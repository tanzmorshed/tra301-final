"ivo-cobra8","10","109","124","30 October 2015"," The best vampire slaying movie ever my number one favorite Blade film
","Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made! <br/><br/> It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade: Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. The best dang vampire slaying movie ever (say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome! <br/><br/>So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god ""La Magra"", And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.<br/><br/>This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome!<br/><br/>So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade: Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords. <br/><br/>What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10/10"
"customX13","9","104","121","20 April 2003"," The way a comic book flick should be made
","I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the ""Batman"" series, ""Spawn,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, ""why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?"" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time."
"MinorityReporter","7","43","52","15 October 2005"," Very stylish and entertaining!
","It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.<br/><br/>David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.<br/><br/>The story is good and, I feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire ""dustings"" to be a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.<br/><br/>As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.<br/><br/>7/10"
"mjw2305","8","39","47","24 December 2006"," Great Vampire Flick
","Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.<br/><br/>This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish. Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely delivers.<br/><br/>8/10"
"supertom-3","10","16","19","21 September 2001"," Style, Class and gallons of blood!!
","This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace."
"bob the moo","Null","33","44","20 January 2004"," Enjoyably stylish flick that gets the dark tone almost right
","Blade was only a foetus when his mother was attacked by vampires and left for dead.  When he is born he is born a half-breed.  As an adult he has been joined by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter, to fight the secret war against the vampire culture.  He hunts the impure-blood vampire Deacon Frost who plans to summon La Magra - the Blood God.<br/><br/>Now approaching it's second sequel, this film was a dark surprise to me as I didn't expect too much from it.  The plot sees Blade hunting a dangerous vampire seeing to unleash the power of La Magra and take vampires from their shadows into the real world; we also get a bit of back story as well. This plot gives all the best lines to the vampires and not enough good scenes with Blade himself.  I like Blade for the same reason as I like Batman - they are both messed up superheroes of a sort.  The film tells us how Blade was created but it doesn't delve deep enough for my tastes - only once or twice did I really get a feel for his cruel, darker nature (`Please, I only work for them').  I suppose this was to be expected and it certainly manages the darker tone much better than the Batman films did (in the long run).<br/><br/>The action is good although it never really gets to the peak of the opening nightclub scene but is good nonetheless.  Some of the effects in the final fight are a bit lacking and they make the usual horror movie mistake of showing too much and having it be less effective than the build up and suggestion of the monster was.<br/><br/>Snipes doesn't exactly display a great emotional range here but he is good in the title role nonetheless.  He is a commanding presence and physically good at the action stuff.  Dorff is pretty good as the main vampire - he is slick and plays it well to be a good representation of the `new breed' as the script requires.  Kristofferson is cool and Wright is sexy while still being a good actress!  The support cast contains no real standouts; Lathan is no more than a cameo and isn't really good while people like Lords only stick in the memory due to their name and not their performance.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyably slick vampire/action movie.  The end product may be more style than substance but the character of Blade is darkly interesting, even if neither Snipes nor the film really give too much away in terms of his inner workings.  I have yet to see the sequel but I would hope that it keeps the same dark tone that makes this film stand out."
"BradleyUK","8","46","64","19 June 2003"," Dark, Dangerous & Pure Fun
","If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP. If the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. Great Action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop, kick & punch thrown. Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. Its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10"
"dennizman","9","65","99","2 December 1999"," Exhilarating and Exciting Action/Thriller Masterpiece!
","Blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.<br/><br/>This film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.<br/><br/>Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic.<br/><br/>This film is in my opinion a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year.<br/><br/>My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10"
"RowanMcBrowan","9","7","8","21 June 2016"," Brilliant vampire action thriller from the better half of the 90s
","Fantastically shot, well paced.. arguably Snipes' most impressive performance to date and lots of fun martial arts fight sequences involving swords and guns - not to mention the unique and timeless soundtrack. Blade is one of my favourite action movies of all time, up there with Die Hard and Predator.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Norrington is what Chris Cunningham (Aphex Twin videos) would have been if he dropped the weirdness and went into more conventional movies.. or if David Fincher stopped with the thrillers and did straight action. It is a massive shame we couldn't see more from Stephen, but at least we have Blade.<br/><br/>Certain special effects haven't aged well (and are in desperate need of a remaster!) but aside from that, this movie is great visually. Norrington's choice of shots, the way scenes are lit is masterful.<br/><br/>The performances he gets out of his actors are great too. It's not surprising Snipes loved the Blade character so much as to later method act and speak to cast/crew in character.. not surprising at all when the first movie of the trilogy this strong (though I pretend Blade 2 and 3 never happened) Watch this movie if you haven't already, especially if you love the 90s aesthetic or if you enjoy vampire-related movies/TV shows. The Blade character is iconic and Snipes was born to play him, and this movie is a 2 hour proof-of-concept for Norrington being the greatest director nobody ever talks about."
"MR_Heraclius","8","41","63","22 February 2020"," Blade
","Awesome action packed superhero movie starring Wesley snipes. When I found out that this movie is a superhero marvel movie, I was shocked because the dark tone, yes that's how marvel movies were back in the 90s early 2000s but the character of blade is not a superhero, he's more like a vigilante but they're the same thing but still, I was shocked when I found out. I really enjoyed and love this movie. Marvel movies back then weren't that good, they were really really bad. I loved the action, the connection between blade and the old man. The girl at the beginning that got bit, I wasn't a huge fan and she wss only there because every stereotypical Hollywood movie or I should say every movie needs to have a woman in the movie in a supporting role or leading role. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel and third movie in this good franchise."
"MaximumMadness","8","11","14","17 February 2012"," ""Blade"" is a strong, mature comic-book film, with outstanding performances and a unique visual style...
","Stephen Norrington's 1998 release ""Blade"" (based on the Marvel comic character) is the film that arguably lead to the recent trend of comic-book movies. It's success (along with that of ""X-Men"") caused people to do something they always should have- take comics seriously as an art form and a medium for storytelling. The film is an incredible, Gothic ride with great performances and unique visuals, and should be seen by any fan of action, horror or film in general.<br/><br/>Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire. His mother was bitten while pregnant, and his blood was infected by the vampire virus, granting him some vampire-like powers (such as inhuman strength), although he also suffers from ""The Thirst""- the vampire's natural need to feast on human blood, which he combats using treatments and serums, almost like a drug addict. Blade and his mentor Whistler (Krist Kristopherson) spend their nights hunting and killing vampires who feed on the humans.<br/><br/>At the same time, a vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) is plotting to overthrow the noble heads of the various vampire clans, and using them as sacrifices to bring about ""La Magra"" a vampyric blood-god, to destroy humanity and grant himself untold power. Blade and Whistler (along with help from a pathologist played by N'Bushe Wright) must figure out a way to stop Frost's deadly plans before he wipes out all of humanity.<br/><br/>The film is truly dark and Gothic. Norrington's direction sets an ominous and deadly mood, and the visuals are all well-crafted. The score by Mark Isham is tragic and melancholy, with some nice techno-y action music thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Acting is generally good (though Dorf does get a little hammy at times) and everything meshes quite well. The action is nice, though it feels a little staged and over-choreographed, and the visual effects, for the time, were outstanding. I should also mention that this is a violent, violent film. It is the bloodiest of the three movies, and has a lot of gore, which actually almost took me ""out"" of the movie a few times- some scenes felt campy with the sheer amount of carnage and goo being flung at the screen.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a couple of scenes and jokes that stick out like a sore thumb, and the tone is a bit too oppressive, making this a hard movie to sit through if you are not in the right mood.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a good 8 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to fans of action and horror. It is a strong vampire film. (Also, a cool note, this movie is one of the several pre-""Matrix"" films to utilize ""bullet-time"", that cool trick where action slows down dramatically to the point where you can see individual bullets whooshing through the air. Just a fun little piece of trivia- ""The Matrix"" did not invent this trick.)"
"shovon-1","8","4","4","30 July 2019"," Has it''s Flaws but a Neat Stylish movie
","I saw it when it got released back in 1998.
I saw it again today July-2019, that's a 20 year aprrox. evolution on my overall psyche ...and I found it stylishly made even today, too. Judging with todays standards where we are bombarded with cgi in plethora ..name it.. avengers, spiderman, aquaman...etc etc. These are graphics made from software that was available in 1998, so they are not groundbreaking , but it passed off even today to label it ''stylishly made then''.
Wesley looks good, at times very good, Leather jacket and all and cool crew cut.
Bad Guy portrayed comes off with flying colours as the 'bad guy' .....chuckle.
where I recently gave Jhon wick-3 a 5 , I give this one a 8 ....in my eyes more stylish and carries more sensibility than Wick 3 -parabellum."

","I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale, but this one is a real winner. Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was  loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. A good one for all us vampire lovers."
"1001","6","58","97","17 January 1999"," A palatable offering of Snipes and dice
","Blade is everything Spawn wanted to be and wasn't. While Spawn was a loud, obnoxious, incoherent mess that should have stayed in Hell with its erstwhile hero, Blade is a relatively subdued (it's nice to actually hear the soundtrack), stylish, well-directed movie that actually tries to build empathy and pathos into the characters. While both are adaptations from comic-books, only one is a page-turner.<br/><br/>Blade, or Eric as his mom calls him, but which superhero would command respect with the name Eric, is half-man, half-vampire, made so by his mother, who survived a vampire attack long enough to give birth to him. This gives Blade a certain edge in his understandable grudge against vampires, ""all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses"" as his main vampire nemesis attests. The aforementioned nemesis is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who wants to unleash a vampire apocalypse on the world, decrying the Mafia-type approach that has served vampires so well up to this point - ""humans are our food, not our allies,"" he explains. Blade is aided by his mentor/weapons specialist Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and a female hematologist he rescued, Karen. Her expertise lends her to both create anti-vampire blood, and a possible cure for Blade that would make him fully human again. Although one gets the sense that Blade's fate isn't entirely tragic. He relishes kicking vampire butt.<br/><br/>The movie Blade succeeds for two reasons. It's technically polished, with good acting, excellent directing and production design, and awesome special effects - the way the vampires turn to skeletons and blow away like dried parchment when they die is way cool. There are three accomplished action sequences, the opening party scene which Blade inconveniently crashes, a brush with death on a subway, and the final conflict, with some special effects I can say, as a movie seasoned veteran, I've never seen before. The second reason is that Blade understands the inherent pull of the vampire myth. Vampirism represents a life given to sin, essentially. They are sensual creatures, dependent on flesh and blood for survival, shirking the light, and yet eternal, like evil fleshly lusts the Bible warns about. Vampires are not tragic, like Interview with a Vampire would have you believe, but fun, cool, and sexy. That's their power. Is not sin sexy? why would it be tempting otherwise? Vampires are cool because they live in sin without paying its consequences - death. But for that reason, they are the enemy and must die. For sin is, in the final analysis, bad. This essential good/evil conflict must be there for this type of story to work. Spawn had neither this nor the technical excellence Blade has, which is why it sucks so bad. Blade reminded me of another good vampire movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula, by Francis Ford Coppola. They would make good companion pieces on video."
"dee.reid","10","6","7","10 October 2000"," Fantastic thanks to Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff
","Blade is a great adaptation of the famous comic book series of the same name.  I'm actually surprised Entertainment Weekly gave it a D+.  Wesley Snipes is one of my favorite actors and is perfect for the role of the tortured half man, half vampire Blade.  Stephen Dorff is totally cool as Blade's young and psychotic arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost.  Blade's tight looking weapons too.  They range from a double-bladed boomerang to little capsules loaded with stuff that will blow up vampires.  Blade is a great film with two great stars, perfectly executed fight scenes, and lots of cool shots of vampires heads exploding. 10/10"

","Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! <br/><br/>Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.<br/><br/>OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o)"
"Aaron1375","10","9","12","19 September 2001"," A very stylish movie.
","This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever.  I liked this one even more than X-men.  In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either.  Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade.  He is just not an emotionless super hero.  Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating.  Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic.  This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't.  A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight."
"Peach-2","10","42","73","29 December 1998"," Awesome!!!!
","Blade is a great movie. This film has so much energy that even I'm ready to go hunting vampires. For a film geek like myself, this film has it all. Wesley Snipes can finally have an action franchise and Stephen Norrington will be working in Hollywood for awhile. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is great, and the editing is awesome. The special effects are in a world of their own. This is one of th most thought out comic book based films you will ever see and it has a great cast. It's good to see Kris Kristofferson and Udo Kier. The only weak point in the whole film is the performance of Stephen Dorff. Dorff's character, Deacon Frost, seems rather weak for Blade. Can't wait for a sequel!!!!"
"friendkj","7","3","3","7 January 2020"," A fun vampire flick
","Vampire movies are usually considered to be low quality. For the most part, that is the case these days. I mean look at the Twilight series! But every now and then a good vampire movie comes up and in the 90's there were 3 vampire films that are considered to be the best. Bram Stoker's Dracula, From Dusk Till Dawn, and lastly Blade. The movie Blade was based off of the comic book series starring the character Blade. The late 90's were the start of the comic book movie era where the comic book movie was becoming more and more popular. Of course, there have been movies based off of comics before hand but they were of lesser quality. Blade is a fun action packed film. While overall bad comic book movies were so bad that they were entertaining, Blade is entertaining because the action is good. There are some typcial action cliches but nothing too annoying for the viewer. The overall story is thin but again, nothing too bad. The acting is pretty decent and that is saying something considering with the next 2 Blade films, the acting does get worse. Throw in some gore and you have an overall fun film. If you are trying to find a fun vampire flick, Blade is certainly the film for you."
"RatedVforVinny","8","3","3","6 December 2019"," A true blood, Vampire classic.
","A superior vampire action movie, featuring a very impressive Wesley Snipes. The martial arts (stunts) are amazing and so are the groundbreaking visual effects. The musical score is magnificent and really drives the whole experience through a roller-coaster ride, of over-the-top blood-letting. Excellent supporting performance from Kris Kristofferson, in the part of his side-kick whistler. 'Blade' is not just blade movie that is made and then goes away and the look and feel of this picture, has been highly influential in the Horror/Sci-fi genre."

","This movie was very entertaining. In my opinion probably one of the better Marvel flicks. The movie was fun and was action packed. The only thing the movie was lacking a bit we're the graphics. The blood graphics were not very good, but the worst graphics I saw in the movies was when Blade kidnapped the doctor and then threw her to the other building. It looked so bad, and you could tell they used a dummy. Overall the movie is a fun, action packed, and entertaining movie."
"DesertDogMedia","8","6","8","2 July 2014"," Blade
","Title: Blade<br/><br/>Directed by: Stephen Norrington <br/><br/>Storyline: We start off in a hospital with a pregnant woman being rushed in while covered in blood. She goes into labour while the doctors and nurses are trying to treat her, they perform a C section to take the child out. We are then introduced to a CONI (Character of no importance) as him and a vampire are driving through the city to get to a vampire nightclub/rave. But just as Blade shows up the music and sprinklers stop as everyone realizes that Blade has crashed their party, one guy tries to take him on but is shot with a silver spike before making it past the crowd. Blade opens fire on the ravers and starts killing them all one by one, until he runs out of ammo. This is where the other toys come into play. We see Quinn get set on fire regardless. He is then taken to the morgue where his kills another CONI and injures a main character, who Blade then saves. In the next scene we are introduced to what looks like the hierarchy of vampires along with the movies antagonist, Deacon Frost. We also get to hear Blades backstory as told by Whistler when Karen finds out that he is a hybrid. The next scene shows us Frost and his men taking out the head vampire by binding his limbs together and leaving him to be killed by the sun rise while they stay protected by their motorcycling suits and helmets. Frost than finds Blade's base and beats down and bites Whistler while kidnapping Karen, Blade then comes back to this and Whistler begs him to kill him, but Blade cannot do it, so he hands Whistler the gun to do it himself. Blade is then captured after being beaten down, so him and Karen are then taken to ritual site where the vampire hierarchy are place in their positions and Blade's blood is drawn for the ritual and it begins as Karen is able to escape. This comes to the fight scene that really shows off Blade's fighting skill, along with the fact that all of these moves were performed by Wesley Snipes without the use of doubles or anything as he is training in various forms of marshal arts. Blade kills Frost in the final show down fight and this ends the movie, but in these scenes you can tell that it is a stunt double, especially in the slow motion scenes. <br/><br/>Acting: Wesley Snipes was perfect as Blade because he was able to pull off the stern, distant and emotionless expressions when he needed to, but was also able to give the character emotion when he needed to. His knowledge of marshal art also helped him out in this sense. Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, he played the suave calculating vampire role to a T, not much else that can be said. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: The fight scenes for the rave scene are well choreographed and do not contain any BS shaky cam, so you can actually see what is happening and what moves are being used. A good example of camera work is one of the shots where Blade kills one guy and spins around to punch another straight in the face, but all we see is him punching the camera at first, but the next shot shows that we were looking for the POV of a vampire, or a vampire henchmen to be exact as he doesn't turn to ash straight away and has his head kicked into the lights and then turns to ash. We also get a good 360 shot when he uses his silver boomerang blade which the camera follows all the way around. We are given another camera punch shot in the hospital scene when Blade comes back to finish Quinn off. The movie does like its establishing shots of buildings, and it is able to pull them off with style in a way so they do not feel over used. The driving scenes are also very fond of using vignette tracking shots for when they're inside the industrial area and voyeuristic shots for when Karen is sneaking around Blade's base. But in the end fight scene with Frost that is made up to use by them giving us a wide range of shots we haven't seen used in the fighting context such as shot reverse shot, birds eye shots, perfectly executed 180º panning shots and worms eye shots. <br/><br/>Costume: In Blade's first appearance in the movie we are treated to a tilting shot of his costume going from his boots, past his chest plate and to his neck. The all black leather works quite well in contrast to the silver buckles on his chest plate, his whole theme revolves around black and silver. Overall Feel: The move is a 2 hour epic, there may be slower scenes in the movie, but they do not feel like slower scenes, they do not break the pacing in the movie. Blade is a movie which you wouldn't expect to be a superhero movie, but it is. Because Blade is owned by Marvel, but feels nothing like a superhero movie. This movie was Marvel's foothold in the cinematic universe as all other popular superhero movies were primarily DC, and the two movies that contained Marvel character didn't have movie releases and were just so the relevant studios could keep the rights to them in one case. This movie perfectly blended action with a good narrative and it was made even better thanks to the cinematographer and stunt organizer who made fight scenes visually stunning to the Nth degree. Like any good movie, it has its problems like some vampires turning to ash when they were killed without silver and such, but apart from that the movie is a great movie to watch and has great re-watch value added to it."

","First released in 1998, Blade brought commercial success back to Super Hero films, after the woeful distribution of films like Batman & Robin and Steel stopped the genre in its tracks.<br/><br/>Starring Wesley Snipes as the eponymous Half-Vampire/Half-Human hybrid come Super Hero/Vampire Hunter, Blade works with Dr. Karen Jensen and Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in order to defeat vampires Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and Quinn (Donal Logue) and their host of undead soldiers before they can kill Gitano Dragonetti (Udo Kier) and the other vampire Elders in a ritual that will transform Deacon Frost into La Magra, the vampire Blood God.<br/><br/>With me so far? No? That figures. The script's interesting, but it's not terribly sense-making. What I mean to say, is, the script's rubbish, but the *story* is great. The whole film is really rather story and effects driven, but the characters are pretty lacking. Quinn is sort of fun, and Deacon's... well... he's attractive, but not a lot else. Still, there's more to him than most of the characters, including the titular Blade.<br/><br/>Straight up, just putting out there, I think goth-culture is attractive, so, my aesthetics may go quite a way to influencing my decision in the final score, if you disagree with me, you might want to keep that in mind, seeing as most vampires have at least a little bit of that going on. All that aside though, the opening of Blade is one of the strongest ways a film can start off that I've ever seen. It has basically everything you could want for a modern vampire tale. Including the Blood Rave song, Confusion (Pump Panel Remix) by New Order.<br/><br/>The cinematography was another cool point, lots of ins and outs in a non-nauseating way. Although the fight choreography suffered from a serious case of ""Only-One-Guy-Attacks-At- A-Time"" Syndrome. Come on guys, this ain't Tekken. When there's an army to fight, fight an army. Maybe not all at once, I know that could get a tad pointless, but it really didn't transfer well in this film.<br/><br/>To end with, there's one plot-hole I'd like to bring up, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything too badly, but if you want to go in completely fresh, stop reading. There's one point when Frost says he needs to kill the 12 Elder vamps in a big underground ritual in order to complete his ascendancy into the Blood God (Khorne?), but he kills the leader earlier, on a beach. Okay, so maybe he wasn't counted, and he was actually number 13. But, Frost's lady-friend Mercury kills another with Blade's sword, before the ritual gets started, and nobody seems to care... I am dubious- faced.<br/><br/>After all that though, Blade is a vampire film that's not slow like Nosferatu, and not indescribably awful like Twilight, so for people with tastes like mine, it's certainly worth a geez.<br/><br/>66%<br/><br/>-Gimly"

"Taran-5","10","3","4","9 August 1999"," Excellent vampire action
","I gave this movie a ""10"" and I feel it is my duty to explain why. It is important first of all to realize what this movie is and what is not. It is an action movie, it is not a masterful exploration of the human condition. ""Blade"" is right up there as my favorite action movie of all time, with the possible exceptions of ""The Rock"" and ""The Matrix"". It does everything an action movie needs to do and then some: it has a fast-moving plot, engaging characters who drive the plot rather than bog it down, it creates a desire in the viewer for the good guy to win, and this last it does better than in any other movie I've ever seen, it creates a pulse-pounding visual experience. Another way in which ""Blade"" goes above and beyond is in its having a ""gimmick"", if you will. Just as ""The Rock"" had that awful poison gas and Alcatraz, and ""The Matrix"" had . . . well, go see it for yourself, Blade has this whole vampire culture it depicts, and a conflict of identity for the title character that comes into play at several points in the movie and does nothing but enhance the experience. Snipes is incredible. Every single gesture, change in posture, and facial expression is just wonderfully intense and perfectly befitting a vampire hunter. The camerawork includes several shots using a fascinating pseudo time-lapse technique which make you nervous even when the characters are just driving. The fight scenes are unparalleled, and as the official site said, there are weapons and techniques rarely seen in American action movies, you really have to see the way these guys move to believe it. What really sets this movie apart is that every scene is intense, there is not a boring scene in the whole movie. The presence of the vampires is constantly felt after the opening scene, and the pressure never lets up. Even the character development scenes make you nervous, because there is almost always some helpless human that you are afraid a vampire is going to chomp into any second, despite the fact that the threat is taking a backseat to the dialogue for a moment. Also, even when nothing tangibly exciting is happening, there is this kind of weird lighting that sort of puts you on edge and makes you enter Blade's world, making you feel what it's like to be a vampire. I saw this movie with a bunch of guys, and when Blade started up his motorcycle, all of us yelled ""yeah!"", it's just that good. If there is any criticism for this film, it could only be for its plot, but I found there were enough twists and turns to keep it from becoming predictable, and besides, you honestly won't have time to be thinking about the plot. This was a movie that had my friends and I pumped the whole way home from the theater. My comments may be a little biased because I like movies and TV shows with vampires, and am a regular viewer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but even if Blade was fighting nuns this movie would be awesome."
"Angelus2","10","6","11","22 February 2008"," A perfect adaption

Blade is a half vampire half human who devotes his life into killing the demons of the night; hoping to find the monster that killed his mother.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes plays Blade with a menacing tone and it seems like he enjoys it.

"Maesterolorin","5","9","20","27 March 2006"," OK, But could have been better
","Blade is supposed to be a Dhampyr (child of a male vampire and living woman). This is a well established legend and the story of the comics. Why on earth they go about changing the 'bible on vampires' making it some fluke of a 'biting gone bad.' Whistler was well done, and Blade was done true enough to the original character. As an action film it is more than satisfactory.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand that they were working a 'cure.' As if anything that could make the blood suckers would or even could be based in science. Heck, the vampires weren't even half the beast they should be. I am not a purest to fantasy, Vampire can but don't have to be weak to crosses, rose wood, or garlic, but either make something new or don't; don't butcher an ancient and complex mythos like the Vampyr or Lycanthorp. In ""From Dusk til Dawn"" they establish that these creatures are vampire like and may have established the legend, but that they can't know. In ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" and it's sequel they establish they are creating a mythos, but it is still mythic. Blade makes the same same mistake we would see in Underworld, but at least they were not adapting something else and changing it to the nth degree. In fact you could almost say they did try to make a new story, but the comic book for Blade was well established before they ever tried to make a movie as a fantasy based vampire story (except for that one guy who dated black cat but that was really complicated).<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment was the ""Blood God"" who went down faster than sororal cheerleader after 5 pint in a chug-fest."

It's fast-paced, stylishly directed, and edited for maximum intensity.  It's also the movie's only watchable scene.  The rest of the film devolves into a silly tale about reviving blood gods and whatnot, most of it incomprehensible junk that serves as filler in-between the action, which quickly grows redundant.<br/><br/>The movie is packed to the brim with stunts and fight scenes, but most of them lack the precious sense of fun that makes the best of action movies exhilarating (the recent Equilibrium wildly succeeds with its action in comparison to where Blade resoundingly fails).  Director Stephen Norrington has an eye for stylish visuals, but fails to bring invigorating energy to the proceedings. As the lead, Wesley Snipes is brooding and bland, a complete failure from a dramatic standpoint.  His impending crisis is neither engrossing nor particularly interesting, just another bland subplot in this soulless action thriller."

The screen play and the plot is stereotypical and mediocre, the ending is predictable, the CGI is very cheesy and laughable even with the late 90s standards and the directing...well, it tries to knit all of this together into something watchable and he achieves that!<br/><br/>If this movie was meant to scare, then I'll say it achieved 50% of its goal. Blade is more of an action, comedy with a slight touch of horror."
"pyrocitor","7","3","5","15 September 2016"," True to form, Blade doesn't suck
","He kicks enough slow-mo ass in a long black coat to make Neo go ""Whoa."" He rocks a vampire franchise slick and edgy enough to make RPatz whimper. And he brings enough spurting blood to the superhero blockbuster to make Kevin Feige faint. He's Blade - breakout star of the era when the term 'superhero film' was largely tantamount to 'campy garbage'. And he's a welcome shot of adrenaline to the current day multiplexes bursting at the seams with his more bloodless (ha) brethren. Respect.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Norrington knows exactly how to stay on the fun side of campy, and goes right for the jugular in doing so, offering a slick, taut, and hugely entertaining bloodbath. Eschewing both a redundant origin story and some of the decade's more frantic action editing, Blade is marvellously paced, ticking along, shark-like, from exposition to action interlude and back with the hypnotic steadiness of blood pulsing through veins. It's hardly an ambitious plot (stop the pending vampocalypse, natch), but lent welcome life from Norrington and writer David S. Goyer's more inventively gruesome touches. Check out the sprinklers at the underground vampire nightclub dousing the raving crowd in blood in a gleefully macabre Carrie homage, amidst the film's inspired opening sequence, and it's impossible to deny you're in for a garishly amusing treat. <br/><br/>Granted, some of the film's stylistic choices (Mark Isham's industrial-influenced soundtrack) age better than others (DP Theo van de Sande shooting the film like a streaky, jump-cutting '90s hip hop video is fairly jarring). But Norrington's flair for the grotesque helps punch up the monster horror fun. His prosthetic deformities and bubbling corpses playfully pilfer the best of Total Recall and Raiders of the Lost Ark, just as the classist in-fighting in the vampire ranks (born vampires sneering condescension at 'turned' bloodsuckers) lends odd nuance to the villainous MacGuffin, while a sterling climactic setpiece amidst a (practical set!) marble vampire temple is as sleekly Gothic as you could ask for. Blade may not reinvent the action wheel, but it certainly gives it a good, vigorous spin in the right direction. <br/><br/>As the titular vampire hunter (no, not Abraham Lincoln), Wesley Snipes firmly establishes himself as one of the more reliable '90s badasses. His icy charisma is easily enough to carry the film, even if his attempts at infusing Blade's monolithic masculinity with humour through bursts of twitchy sassiness may take some adjusting to. Still, anyone who can sell a punchline as corny as ""Some motherf*ckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill"" with dignity intact is worth of accolades in my books. Supporting Snipes, N'Bushe Wright astutely refuses any damsel in distress clichés with a welcome, hardened charisma, at the cost of occasionally neglected to react appropriately to some of the film's more fearsome scenarios. Similarly, as the film's central antagonist, Stephen Dorff is perfectly oily, but his refusal to chew scenery in favour of a more subtle creepiness backfires somewhat, making him a suitable, but fairly forgettable foe. Finally, Kris Kristofferson lends his 'gruff mentor' archetype an appealingly indignant crustiness, bagging many of the film's better lines in the process. <br/><br/>As the bodies hit the floor amidst the flurries of impressively executed, cathartically bloody action choreography, a realization sinks in: Blade, for all its leather-clad macho posturing, is a remarkably unpretentious film. It's fun, no- nonsense, and down and dirty, in the ways that only a moderately-budgeted franchise film with low expectations but high potential can be. You can practically see the seeds for 2016's Deadpool's rampant success being lain, albeit with only the tiniest winks of its fourth-wall-toppling zaniness. Still, nearly 20 years on, Blade remains an adeptly unapologetic slice of entertainment. If you're thinking of giving it a pass, as Blade himself succinctly says, ""Motherf*cker, are you out of your damn mind?!""<br/><br/>-7.5/10"

Blade is not your typical superhero and this isn't your typical superhero movie. He's half human and half vampire and he spends his time ridding the world of the undead. And he does this in more of a brutal way that your average superhero.<br/><br/>Since Blade, Marvel seemed to realise how to make a superhero movie and since then, it's overtaken the DC universe. Maybe it's because Blade is such a broad movie - it's action, horror and superhero movie all rolled into one. Of course it's definitely not a comedy. There are few moments of light relief as it's pretty serious through and through.<br/><br/>If you like 'classic vampire movies' (i.e. before Twilight) then you should give this a try. It's quite an epic from start to finish. It spawned two sequels, the first of which was actually almost as good as the first (some say better), whereas the second one left audiences split.<br/><br/>However, the original is definitely a stand out movie.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","3","5","13 June 2013"," The first successful Marvel adaptation
","Before this film, it was clear that any Marvel comic adaptation to the big screen was not favored by many. Howard the Duck (1986) impressed very few and The Punisher (1989) did not even get a chance to be released in U.S. theaters. It was difficult to say how Marvel would perform after such mishaps. Thankfully, they came back with one heck of an action-horror film starring one of the most popular actors at the time - Wesley Snipes. And was it a great casting choice; thank you David S. Goyer.<br/><br/>To be brief because it was already explained, Wesley Snipes plays a half human, half vampire named Blade who takes it upon himself to slay every vampire that he comes into contact with. Just because, he doesn't like being part vampire himself. Accompanying Blade is his weapons maker called the ""Whistler"" played by Kris Kristofferson. Both Snipes and Kristofferson show great chemistry on screen will give a real sense that these two guys have been at it for years. Snipes plays his role with a controlled anger and moves with style, while Kristofferson lightens up the air with lines that any old man would say.<br/><br/>Witnessing these two handle their work is a medical examiner Karen (N'Bushe Wright) who also shows off some feminine power when she's given the chance. But just like any other female character in an antihero movie like this, Wright's character will not be a love interest and I am totally fine with that. Same goes for what should be for Marvel's The Punisher, Daredevil and Ghost Rider. Playing the villain, Deacon Frost is Stephen Dorff and he too gives the cold shoulder (pun intended) to many of his enemies, including his own. He doesn't even seem to really care about his partner Quinn (Donal Logue), a fellow vampire. That's selfish man.<br/><br/>Along with a set of great characters, comes some fierce stylized action, cool special effects and dark music. The writing is where it gets a little cliché. Because Wesley Snipes holds several degrees in martial arts, it should be no surprise that the action will be stylized to a level that will entertain and not be over top. And because this movie is rated R and is about vampires, there will be blood. In fact, I think it's appropriate to say that this movie was under the ""Marvel Knights"" logo before it was even introduced with Punisher: War Zone (2008) and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012). The atmosphere is dark and gritty. Which is exactly what fans enjoy and want with comic book characters. Also, the special effects were evenly distributed as well, nothing seemed fake.<br/><br/>As for the music composed by Mark Isham, I found it to be effective because it contained a lot of downbeat tones that helped emulate how dark this movie was. But I also found it lacking because there was no reoccurring theme for the main character and it also wasn't present as often as it should have been. Again, when it was present though, it was effective. As for the writing, what didn't work for me was the whole prophecy concept. That and the ""chosen one"" line. Even if that phrase were left out, it would not have sounded so cliché. But overall, this is one early Marvel film, no one should miss.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes does a great job portraying Marvel's first antihero. The action is tight and the score is dark and brooding. The writing even allows for good dialog but its back-story is too cliché."

Wesley Snipes pulls off the role as if his life depended on playing the part. Stephen Dorff isn't exactly the ""old man"" Deacon Frost but to call his performance crap either way is harsh. The other performers do a good job with the other standout being Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler.<br/><br/>In terms of action this is probably one of the bloodiest films I've ever seen with the bloodiest being Punisher War Zone. The gore spills out realistically and the burns also look realistic, Udo Kier combusting in sunlight is an image that sticks with you.<br/><br/>In terms of overall plot this is relatively simple - Blade tries to take down Deacon Frost, the vampire that killed his mother.<br/><br/>The execution is purely for those who like action-oriented vampire films such as Underworld or people who know the comics and want to see their favourite vampire-hunting comic book hero to be brought to life.<br/><br/>Overall if you are into these types of films, this is a must see.

The range of characters is suitably colourful and impressive, with a great turn from a gruff and scruffy Kris Kristofferson, as The Whistler (who's a vampire hunter) and sexy, sultry black girl Dr Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright).<br/><br/>However, it's Wesley Snipes, always looking lean, mean and imposing and great in his black leathers that transports the film from a hum-drum half-hearted affair to knock-out action movie. He's mean with his fists, shoots 'em up like a mean mother and snarls impressively quite a lot. Stephen Dorff, as the evil rival who's intent on entrapping clubbers at his nightspot and using them for him and his pals to feast on.<br/><br/>As a vampire story, it's an interesting and entertaining twist on the familiar theme. Yes, the film does rely a huge amount on CGI, but for once the SFX add to rather than swamp and they still look really good.<br/><br/>Above all, Blade is brisk, smart, flashy and violent but with enough of the other bits to stick it all together, really rather nicely.

","Blade (1998) is an entertaining action film that looks and sounds good - or should I say ”cool” because that surely has been the aim with all the sunglasses, swords, camera-run gimmicks and whatnots. Wesley Snipes plays (and growls his way through) the lead – a vampire hunter called Blade – and does it rather well. A lot of action set to the heavily tecno/hiphop -based soundtrack is what the film is all about, with some humour and drama thrown in time to time. Kris Kristofferson (Whistler), N'Bushe Wright (Karen) and Stephen Dorff (Deacon Frost) support in the cast. The film's opening scene is a great one and it's rather sad that the rest of the movie doesn't quite manage to stay on the same level – we've seen the best the film has to offer after the first ten minutes or so.<br/><br/>Blade is kinda cheesy fun, a guilty pleasure of some sort. It's over the top in in a lot of ways (starting from Wesley's growling, continuing with the often ridiculous use of music and ending with the endless sunglass-related jokes) and does it shamelessly too.

A vampire, Blade, who has enhanced ""powers"" is a vigilante... out to stop the underworld of the vampires.<br/><br/>Blade is an interesting twist on the tired old story of vampires - with visually impressive (for the most part) action, special effects and design. The basic premise is pretty good although the story doesn't really last for the long running time of almost two hours. Quite possibly - this movie would have been a hell of a lot sharper if the editor cut half an hour out of the movie.<br/><br/>Also - the film goes out on a whimper... If there was a better ending - it would have been a more satisfying ending.<br/><br/>The movie seems to pay homage to both Hong Kong action films and newer stuff like ""Mortal Kombat"" (eg: lots of martial arts set to a thumping techno soundtrack) - although I wish there was a bit less orchestral music and more techno!<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is impressive in the action sequences but his character is a little bit shallow (makes Batman look deep!).<br/><br/>OK - but could have been much sharper and better!"
"patriciogl10","8","1","1","21 November 2019"," You actually could make decent comic book movies back in the 90s.
","Blade is probably the only interesting production adapted from a comic book of the 90s. It's faithful to its original source material, it's not overdone, nor it tries to overcompensate with awful CGI, the acting is great, the fighting sequences are well done, it's an intriguing story, Deacon Frost may not be the greatest villain, but he is acceptable, Stephen Dorff managed to inject a determined and menacing personality that brought life to the character.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, well, it certainly feels that way, because he does such a terrific job that you cannot imagine someone else in the role. Sometimes he acts apathetically but he has so much passion for those he protects and you can see that through his actions, not his words. A great vampire film, an even greater comic book adaptation, lots of action, blood, fighting. The film is highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Watch and you'll see."

"Anya-2","Null","1","1","28 September 1998"," Review of ""Blade"" That I whipped up for my school newspaper
","This is more or less professional.....It's a bit lengthy, but bear with me.<br/><br/>Hollywood, which over the decades has brought countless vampire horror/action movies to the silver screen, now spawns yet another series of blood-guts-and-gore filled thrillers-from this summer's ""Scream 2"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" to the more recent Wesley Snipes film, ""Blade.""<br/><br/>The latter movie leaves an incredibly mixed impression, so much so that I am still not entirely certain whether I enjoyed it or not. It is a peculiar mix of fast-paced, ""edge-of-your-seat"" action and a plethora of gruesome scenes, all shown in pitiless up-close detail.<br/><br/>Blade, portrayed by Wesley Snipes (""US Marshals,"" Money Train"") is a half-human half-vampire whose mission it is to find and destroy the vampire who killed Blade's mother and turned him into the ""freak"" that he is.<br/><br/>Blade saves and teams up with Karen, played by N'Bushe Wright (""His and Hers,"" ""Dead Presidents""), a doctor who in a matter of days invented the cure for anemia-a form of which supposedly makes vampires what they are-that real-life doctors took decades to discover.<br/><br/>Together, the two hunt out vampires, led by the charismatic renegade Deacon Frost, played by Stephen Dorff (""City of Industry,"" ""Blood and Wine""), who takes over the grand council by neatly disposing of the former leader and cowing the rest of the hardcore vampires into submission with the help of a host of fellow humans-turned-vampires.<br/><br/>All of this transpires among chaos wrought by the incompetent handling of scene changes by director Stephen Norrington (""Death Machine,"" 1994). Someone ought to let the man know that although there are indeed 24 scenes per second in modern movies, it is absolutely unnecessary to make each one of those scenes show a scene from a different camera. The movie would be a lot more coherent if it were not for the psychedelic shifting of camera angles during all of the intense scenes.<br/><br/>In addition to having to make sense of the essentially senseless change of viewpoints, any viewer who is also an avid vampire fan is forced to adjust him or herself to the idea that crosses and several other sure-fire vampire remedies do not, indeed, work against vampires.<br/><br/>To be sure, garlic and silver bullets-in this case the size of a grown man's forearm-do indeed work, but only if driven through the heart or head. Even burning does not finish off these vampires, as Blade finds out within the first 15 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Still, one must give the movie credit where credit is due. The special effects, jumbled as they are, are nevertheless impressive, from the majestic, if somewhat Spartan and computer animation-reeking, grandeur of the temple of the Blood-God to the sped-up passing of the of the days and nights in the city.<br/><br/>However, the most redeeming features of the movie are the martial arts scenes that rival Jackie Chan in his new movie ""Rush Hour,"" and sword fights that make the ""Highlander"" series' Adrian Paul look like a rank amateur.<br/><br/>The realistic, fast-paced action scenes almost make up for the numerous incongruities of the movie-Blade looks surprisingly like Batman with added bulk, the moon above the city is always full, despite the fact that the movie itself takes place over a span of several days, and the police attempt to shoot Blade down despite him having an innocent civilian with him. The obvious fakeness of the bodies flying through the air is not even worth commenting on, being a usual and expected sight in all action films. Apparently no one has as of yet devised a way to avoid flying bodies looking like carelessly tossed rag dolls.<br/><br/>And of course, all of this is sprinkled-literally, in one of the opening scenes- with prodigious amount of stage-blood which, to give the movie more credit still, actually looks like blood rather than grape jelly.<br/><br/>My advice to the unsuspecting victims of this vampire film is this-leave anyone over the age of 30 or so at home, unless they are the bloodthirsty type. In that case ""Saving Private Ryan"" will provide them with nearly all the blood, severed limbs and weak plot, and none of the profanity of ""Blade.""<br/><br/>And forget about the concession stand's existence altogether-the movie is not for the easily disgusted, and those Twizzlers and Skittles will be sorely regretted within the first half-hour, iron stomach or not. The exploding heads never fail to do the trick."

"MartinHafer","7","4","9","5 March 2011"," 100% insane....and that's not necessarily a bad thing!
","Up front I must admit that this is not the sort of film I usually watch. No, I usually am very content to watch foreign films, classic Hollywood or silent movies. So me watching an action film like ""Blade"" is highly unusual--and I am obviously not in the target demographic audience. Yet, despite this, I still enjoyed this movie because although I usually don't like films like this, sometimes you just have to turn off your brain and enjoy an insane action pic.<br/><br/>""Blade"" originally was a comic book and although he's not one of the biggies at Marvel (like Spiderman or Captain America), he has gained a lot of popularity due to the Blade films. That's because at least the first one (I've not see the others) was exciting and had non-stop insane action. And, unlike the Twilight series, the changes in the vampire canon are exciting and make for an excellent and non-whiny film! No, these vampires do NOT brood about their lot in life--they totally enjoy the killing and revel in it! Apparently the only thing that might stop them is Blade (Wesley Snipes) and people like his assistant (Kris Kristofferson). However, how they stop them is new--using a kitana, bombs, fire and guns that shoot silver bullets to dispatch vampires even faster than you see folks die in a samurai film! As a result, the film is INTENSELY violent and bloody---INTENSELY. So, this is definitely not a film for kids or for those put off by gallons and gallons and gallons of blood and entrails. For example, in the first scene (at a vampire rave), you must see at least 200-300 hundred gallons of blood--and it's very realistic looking! And, when it comes to the language, it's equally explicit.<br/><br/>So, despite being much of the sort of thing I usually hate, I really liked ""Blade"". Call it a guilty pleasure...it was one intensely wild ride. The only problem is that after a while there are SO many deaths and so much fighting that the plot really loses momentum. Still, it is extremely well done for what it is."

This movie was digital, in every aspect. Digital ""blood"", digital death fx, but so amateur-like i thought i sat in a b-movie.

"poem","2","4","9","1 February 1999"," Good effects and much fighting, but no horror
","When I saw the first announcement for this film, I thought it must be great (I'm a big Wesley Snipes fan). Seeing the preview lowered my expectations, and the movie itself was a disappointment.<br/><br/>It is most of the time nothing but an average action movie, and even if the effects and fighting scenes are good to excellent, the story itself was quite flat and boring, and there was nothing about horror. The vampires were just evil humans with some special abilities, not a symbol of forces or fears in our subconciousness, our animal inside, or of natural forces (such as the pest), or such. The start of the film is the best part of the whole picture; Traci Lords plays Racquel (even if nobody ever calls her with a name in the movie), a vampire woman, which takes a human victim (a man which believes she loves/likes him) to a vampire disco. That whole scene culminates more and more and really makes you shiver - it was a very good start --- until Blade appears and starts the first of the well known boring good hero fights: the good hero kills everybody (i.e. every vampire) and is soooo cool and soooo invinceable and sooooo boring... one of the vampires he kills is Racquel, and later I thought that this was quite symbolical, for she has been the one which had ruled the only really good scene of the movie. The later film never comes back to the level of the start. There are some nice jokes in it (exploding vampire blood etc), and many effects are excellent (but not that strange scene where the blood god is created. that looks just absurd), but the fighting is nothing but the well-known typical unrealistic stuff. In all his films, Wesley Snipes is a natural cool one; but here he _tries_ to be cool all the time, and becomes, of course, very uncool this way.<br/><br/>This film has been compared to Spawn, but Spawn is a totally different kind of film; a good family movie where good fights against evil, and good wins. At least that movie was not promising what it cannot keep. Of course, the film about Spawn was very different than the comic; while Blade was really close. But I expect more of a vampire movie, especially if they have such excellent actors, than only an action movie with expensive effects."
"Mojnmand","6","3","6","13 May 2007"," Well.........
",".........I don't really know what to make of this. I usually like vampire movies, and I wouldn't say ""Blade"" is a complete waste of time. It just isn't great. It lacks the eerie feeling you get from watching Coppola's Dracula, and it lacks the charm of for example ""The Lost Boys"". That aside, ""Blade"" is mildly entertaining, but there are some major flaws - at least in my eyes. First of all, I have a major problem with the whole ""pure blood vs. unpure blood- thing"". Vampires are not born. They are transformed. They are damned creatures. Just like in ""Dracula"". Period. End of discussion! Second: Why is Blade able to walk around in the streets without anybody giving him a second glance? A big black guy with sunglasses, a very visible sword strapped to his back and an outfit that would make Batman jealous.... and nobody seems to notice that the same Blade beats up a police officer in the street in the middle of the day! People don't react until Blade has a gigantic gun in his hands! Come on.... And what about Frost throwing that little girl across the street and through some sort of glass object? She doesn't have a scratch afterwards?!?! That's nothing but a miracle! And Blade just tells her to go home - alone! She has just been at the mercy of a vampire, she looked very scared, she was thrown across the street, and the hero just tells her to go home. What a hero! And the final scene in which Blade defeats the blood god a ka Frost... that's just too easy! I mean it's a god he is battling here! A he defeats it with garlic essence! In conclusion: Mildly entertaining, but too many flaws to be a great vampire flick."

","What a stupid movie Blade is. It's a perfect blend of most of the things that were wrong with the 90s. Style over substance, violent anti-heroes, extreme blood and gore, bad music, bad CGI, unnecessary use of sunglasses and fat, flatulent people...the only reason people rate this disgusting movie higher than ""Spawn"" is because of the gore. <br/><br/>It's a very strange movie. The movie tries very hard to make us think Blade is a tough guy, but it's so forced and unnatural. The tacky opening, where blade shows up at a rave party and kills a bunch of vampires is embarrassing to watch, especially when he does that weird ""ooooh yeeeaaah"" gesture with his arm. <br/><br/>There's a disturbing Oedipal theme in this movie too. It's so blatant that I even noticed it as a kid. The absurd quote about ""motherlovers"" suddenly makes more sense now. Maybe there's a deleted scene of Blade trying to ice skate uphill on YouTube?<br/><br/>If that's not bad enough, wait till you see the flatulent, naked, Jabba the Huttish vampire who sounds like a smurf. And people took this movie seriously in 1998? They probably wanted a piece of The Nutty Professor's success. Fortunately, Blade and his mothe...I mean, girlfriend tortures the vampire to death with UV light because he's fat and ugly. <br/><br/>The movie isn't really about ""good vs evil"" either, since according to this movie, the Crucifix is powerless against vampires (they took away the most interesting thing about vampire movies). Still, there are supernatural elements in the movie. The vampires worship a pagan deity called ""the blood god"", and we are shown pages from a ""vampire bible"". <br/><br/>Overanalyzation time!<br/><br/>Does this mean that the blood god created the universe? If so, why does Blade rebel against his creator? And why does he hunt down and kill vampires, they're just a poor minority trying to worship their god. The vampire religion is shown to be the true one, right? So in a sick and twisted way (this is a sick and twisted movie, after all), Blade is Lucifer. <br/><br/>Now, I highly doubt that is what the filmmakers were trying to say, but when you remove the Catholic element from vampire movies, they become meaningless. I bet the filmmakers like all decent Hollywood types didn't want to offend anyone by including Christianity in a wholesome movie about mindless violence, incest and half-naked women. But what are vampires anyway? If they're just freaks of nature, why all the supernatural stuff? <br/><br/>Skip this garbage and watch a good vampire movie instead. Like Terrence Fisher's Dracula movies or the excellent BBC version from the 70s. Or better yet, read the original novel by Bram Stoker."

I can accept that sunblock protected Frost's skin from the sun, but what about his eyes? And when did he suddenly gain the ability to dodge bullets? Although Blade is heavily outnumbered by vampires every time he fights them, he's never attacked by more than one vampire at a time while others patiently wait their turn. It's an old cliche, but it's so obvious here it ain't even funny. Maybe I missed something but weren't the council members an essential element in the process of raising the Blood God? Yet even though one of them was killed by Frost's girlfriend the ritual goes through without any problems.

"tedg","Null","4","11","9 June 2001"," Vampire Sex
","Spoilers herein. Cat's eye comments follow.<br/><br/>Vampirism has always been about sexual domination. This is the story of Norma Louise Kuzma, an illiterate Ohio jewess. Molested at ten, raped by her father, pregnant in junior high, she ran away at fifteen. In the big city, she became a disciple of a sex cult, then a minor leader in the cult.<br/><br/>Her lord, Frost, was one of an organized group of men who consumed and enslaved women (and weak men, enlisted to do the dirty work of the enterprise). We enter the story with two events underway:<br/><br/>--Frost decides to exploit a force from ancient wisdom to further his power: this force is the deep subconscious power of vampire icons to harness more powerful images of sex. He intends to subsume and leverage the power of his peers (pornographers and pimps) for a new medium: the vampire movie. He expects to affect countless millions and become immensely rich.<br/><br/>--Coincidentally at the same time, a TeeVee preacher named Blade decides to fight sex generically. He does so not because of the destructive effects of sex slavery, but because he is reviled by sex in general. He himself is a sexual being -- he hates himself and strikes out at every instance of sex he finds, and incidentally finds himself confronted by Frost.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Norma, here using the name Racquel, and her betrayal. She fights the fundamentalist because he is so destructive -- in fact Blade's actions drive her and her comrades closer to Frost. Frost offers family, protection, bliss, while Blade offers only death. To a large extent, Frost's power comes from the people like Blade who drive confused souls in his direction. (Most cops -- and politicians -- are also driven to Frost and his peers because of the outrageous inability of Blade to compromise, to see their humanity.)<br/><br/>But the tragedy is that Frost lies to Racquel. He is using her for pleasure and for her abilities as a lieutenant in the liberal Army. He promises a future of new levels of honor, perhaps even some notion of self and control over her own life. But he has another queen in mind. <br/><br/>The story is presented very cleverly with a lot of stupid, blunt, battles between Frost and Blade. The point is to show how superficial are their own ideas of self, how pointless the carnage and how meaningless the battle. Norma is only seen on the edge, which is apt. She expects to have her role as porn star be elevated to that of real artistry in playing a vampire goddess. The tragedy is both in her failure and in how she fails; she is abandoned by Frost, then stabbed in the eye (no foolin) by Blade. She literally explodes because of a sexually transmitted disease of the blood -- cooked up in a scientific lab for other (useful) reasons but enlisted here in the battle between `good' and `bad.'"

","I don't care whether this is a ""comic book movie"" or not; it's far too violent. At one point, the villain actually throws a little girl across the street into a kiosk. She goes through it and lands on the street in front of a bus, glass flying everywhere (and gets nary a scratch, of course, in true ""comic book"" style.)<br/><br/>Perhaps the filmmakers thought this was acceptable because the ""bad guy"" did it and Wesley Snipes saves the girl, but I was horrified. I actually cried out in shock and anger in the theater. I'm surprised Stephen Dorff agreed to do it; he should be ashamed of himself.<br/><br/>Of all the money obviously spent on effects, could they not spare a few more dimes for the script? I'm sick of hearing that I ""want too much"" from action movies, that I should just sit back and enjoy the ride. No, thanks very much, I want a decent story. I want some character development (a 10-year-old could come up with better than what ""Blade"" provided). Most of all, I want some decent dialogue (""A cold heart is a dead heart""?

","Blade has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. (Side Note: L.L. Cool J. was approached for the role of Blade....eww} Blade came along at a time when I was discovering Wesley Snipes as a martial artists. Demolition Man, another all time favorite was the first time I saw Snipes display his martial arts skill & from then I was hooked on Snipes as a martial artists & not so much as an actor. There are actors that embody certain characters. To me Michael Keaton will always be Batman on screen but Kevin Conroy will always be his voice. Snipes & Blade are one in the same to me. However, I'm not against a reboot. If Snipes reprises the role that would be great but if they refresh the franchise I already have a nomination for the role of Blade. Martial artists & actor Marrese Crump (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2800599/?ref_=nv_sr_1) The first time I saw him in action I felt the same way I felt when I discovered Snipes for the first time.

","Blade is an overall bad movie but it's saved by it's great fight scenes. So don't expect anything special from this movie just turn your mind off and enjoy it. But sadly this is a review so I need to look at the negatives. <br/><br/>The biggest flaw this movie has is the story. I'll give you a short summary: there's this the vampire council and everyone in it is a full-blood vampire except for one guy (who is part of the council for no reason) and he is bullied because he isn't full-blood. So to take revenge on the them he needs a following so he decides to give some parties (the council wants him to stop, he refuses but gets to stay on the council) and it works! He kills the council leader without any problems and the other members don't do a thing. But he wanted more so he finds a way he can be a super-vampire. So he becomes a super-vampire and Blade of course kills him after a few minutes, oh and he is also the guy who bit his mother? What a coincidence. The end.<br/><br/>So that's the biggest flaw this movie had, but there were several other things that really bugged me. To name a few: a cure to being a vampire is found in only a few days, sunblock protects vampires from the sun, the police officers shoot at Blade while he is holding Karen, no one cares about the kid almost getting hit by a truck or Blade bashing a police officers head against the trunk of a car, none of the vampires care about their bible being burned and the whole ceremony at the end is comic-book bullshit.<br/><br/>With most of the bad things out of the way let's talk about some of the good things. I already said it but the action was great, Blade was just an awesome character whom you just can't love to see kick some vampire butt. I also really liked Whistler he was a real bad-ass and it sucked to see him die (probably the best scene besides the action scenes).<br/><br/>So overall a bad but enjoyable movie, it's probably one of the lesser marvel movies but it's fun to see one of the movies that started the superhero hype. I'm gonna give this movie a 6.3 but I think it's still a must see movie for marvel or vampire lovers."

","This is a Marvel comics inspirited film from before the Marvel Universe films got big like they are today, it follows Blade, the ""day walker"". Played by Wesley Snipes, Blade, was born a half breed human-vampire cross, all the strengths of a vampire and none of their weaknesses. Before entering the world his pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire and as she's dyeing in hospital from the Vampire bit Blade is born, this origin is explained right at the start of the film so that the audience is in no doubt how he came to be. Now an adult Blade is fighting Vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who saved Blade from himself and from becoming a Vampire himself when he was a child living on the streets. Together they fight the cause with Blade doing the dirty work and Whistler providing the tech and back up. Blade's only weakness is 'the hunger', the vampiric need to consume blood which he keeps under control by periodically injecting himself with a serum. The film follows Blade dealing with a rebellious uprising within the Vampire community. After saving Dr Karen Jensen (N'Bushe Wright) from a Vampire attack Blade becomes aware that a plan is unfolding in the Vampire community who up until then have generally remained quiet and discreet as a community who lives side by side with humans without them knowing. Deacon Frost (played by Stephen Dorff) is trying to become all powerful despite the Vampire orders express wishes. He is part of a new order, not born a Vampire but turned into one, keeping his human characteristics which include greed and the need to be all powerful. He has stumbled onto some old literature which talks about the Blood God/Demon. Believing he can invoke the demon Frost sets his plans in motion but he is one ingredients short of success, the day-walkers (Blade's) blood.<br/><br/>This is a thoroughly enjoyable film and in my opinion is probably the best I have seen Snipes on screen, I even like Dorff, thinking about it I can't recall many other stand out films that Dorff has done before or after this. The plot and script are straight out of the comic world and such are punchy, dramatic and humorous at times. The effects in this film are great, from the way the fight scenes unfold to the way that the vampires meet their demise. The film is dark more often than not but that's because of the nature of the subject and vampires not particularly liking daylight - this is one of Blade's strengths so there are daytime shots too, don't worry. The soundtrack to the film is fantastic, a lot of thought went into making both the film and the musical score fast paced and exciting and it really worked. Other actors in the film hold their roles well from Kristofferson playing grumpy Whistler, to others like ex-porn star turned actress Traci Lords and Donal Logue as the cock-sure vampire Quinn. If you haven't seen the film and you like action, adventure, a bit of horror, comics, heroes, or vampires then you should enjoy the movie.

","Blade (Wesley Snipes) is born to a mother who was bit by a vampire. This gave him superpowers which he uses to battle evil vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). The robotic acting from Wesley Snipes and the constant cool pose fighting are what makes this a fun watch.<br/><br/>The story seems like just filler for the next action scene. Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier make for good creepy villains. The dialog is fairly lackluster. The production value is good for this B-movie. It does have a dull look to it all, and needs more flash.

"russellt-766-50076","6","2","4","7 July 2010"," Provides exciting action,but little else
","Blade is a decently entertaining action flick thanks to its stylish film making and cinematography . It has some pretty cool thrills and good action scenes. Sadly that is the films strongest point. Most of the main characters a thinly developed and are only a bit interesting. Blade himself is cool and tough and has a interesting back story but really isn't that compelling. Karen,a girl he saves who then becomes a main character is as dull as dishwater and her acting isn't very good. To be quite honest Wesley Snipes doesn't turn in a great performance either. His blade is very one note,cool tough guy. This is sometimes very entertaining but other times it doesn't serve the movie very well. Whistler however is a different story. Whistler is Blades mentor and serves as a father figure for him. He is very well played by Kris Kristofferson and injects some much needed humanity in this film. The other great characters in this movie are the villains Deacon Frost(Stephen Dorf) and his right hand man Quinn(Donald Logue) they add some menace and humor to the film. My only other complaint about this movie is the CGI. CGI was very hit or miss in the 90s and this film is no exception. What I hated the most about it was that whenever somebody was killed by silver they would dissolve into dust. I have two problems with this.ONE: I like seeing lots of bodies after a huge action scene,its just really cool.TWO: the CGI looks especially cheep during these shots and it is very distracting. But despite it's many flaws Blade is a very entertaining film thanks to its style,energy and great action scenes. And Kris Kristofferson is really cool in this movie,always a plus"
"tburke85","6","2","4","15 June 2009"," Blade A Decent Vampire Movie
","Balde is a decent vampire movie from director Stephen Norrington who does a good job in making this but the lack of suspense, the dialogue at times, and a rushed finale are what weigh it down. The film does however offer just enough cool mart arts action, impressive special effects, and solid performances by the cast. Wesley Snipes is admirable in the title role of Blade a half-human half-vampire who becomes humanity's protector from the sinister forces that threaten their world. Snipes is believable in the role especially in the action/fight sequences. Stephen Dorff is effective as the villain Deacon Frost but he isn't given much to except for a few action sequences and his showdown with Blade at the end is sort of a let down. Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Udo Kier and Traci Lords show up for brief appearances but neither of them ever get the chance to leave an impression. The action/fight sequences are well executed featuring fierce bone crushing moves but the final fight between Blade and Frost was a bit disappointing compared to the ones that came before it. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and the lack of suspense weighed down a bit but everything else made up for it's flaws. Despite it's problems Blade is a decent adaption of a comic book with enough impressive martial arts action, cool special effects, and solid performances by most of the cast who make it worth watching if only the film had been a little better I would've enjoyed it more than I did."
"CrassActionHero","7","2","4","16 December 2006"," The Sharpest Blade
","Blade (1998) Review: Blade gives a rather new twist to vampires. With Wesley Snipes as Blade, expect some action. I looked forward to this. Here we go.<br/><br/>Our hero Blade stalks the night. He hunts vampires. Unlike Vampire Hunter D, he's not a bounty hunter, he has an agenda. The villain is Deacon Frost done well by Stephen Dorff. His agenda, to rule the world.<br/><br/>The action is tight and quick. Blade seems rather unstoppable. His sleek and destructive way of dispatching the vampires is damn cool to watch. Wesley Snipes is pretty good as Blade. his performance is quite good and gritty. Good choice as Blade.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is perfect. In the dark and decadent city, vampires lurk for prey, so does Blade. The scenery is very stylish, dark and corrupting. Another plus is Blade is not just another faceless hero, we get character development. Blade is not in the mood to talk about his past. You will find out why.<br/><br/>Blade also has a decent plot. The villain here has a rather sinister plan at hand. Blade is also not a goody two shoes. He pretty much lets his actions speak louder than his words and is brutally honest. I like the gritty hero, not the milk drinking, say your prayers, and eat your vitamins hero. Blade is the better anti-hero. Blade does have a few drawbacks, the bad vampire henchmen are not that menacing. Most are just a group of faceless mobs that are dispatched with ease. The only henchmen worth looking out for is Quinn played well by Donal Logue.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Blade delivers. I enjoyed this one the most. This is a stylish take on vampires. One more thing, Blade is violent, so sent the kids to bed and enjoy."
"se7endaze","5","2","4","19 June 2005"," 'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun...
","Wesley Snipes stars as Blade, an immortal 'day-walker' who considers it his mission to hunt vampires. Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during her pregnancy, which passed a variety of powers on to her son. Blade benefited from the best attributes of both vampires and humans, and grew up to be a vampire hunter in order to avenge the death of his mother, and to find the means of becoming ""human"" once more. Snipes does his best ""Terminator"" impression by hiding almost all of Blade's emotions beneath a macho facade. This approach works on a certain level  it makes Blade a more dangerous and ambiguous figure, but it also prevents the audience from connecting with him. But, before he can dream of becoming completely human, he must deal with the new leader of the vampire nation, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), whose stated goal is nothing less than the complete domination of the world. Despite being over-the-top, Stephen Dorff fails to imbue Frost with the ferocity necessary to make him a memorable villain. Blade is aided by Adam Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who provides him with a range of high-tech solutions. The grizzled sidekick lays down a nice character role performance for the future installments.<br/><br/>N'bushe Wright is simply boring. The supporting cast includes the internationally known Udo Kier as the vampire whose position Frost inherits, and ex-porn star Traci Lords as Frost's long-toothed mistress.<br/><br/>A fine combination of action, science fiction and horror, 'Blade' is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. The performances in Blade are serviceable. While hardly deep or cerebral, they manage to capture much of the spirit of the original comic book and succeed in not turning it into a children's cartoon. The film provides plenty of action and effects, fights and blood. The violence is successfully broken up with a variety of one-liners and humor.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is so well-developed that it's easy to forget how derivative and monotonous the plot is, and to get lost in the darkness of Blade's paranoid, vampire-filled world. Blade is fueled by a kinetic energy, and there are scenes, such as the opening dance club sequence, the ""Blood Bath"", that functions as exotic, erotic assaults on the senses. Ultimately, that all turns out to be a rich icing on a half-baked cake. Blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied. Stylish and entertaining, 'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun."
"Kurt-15","10","2","4","23 March 2002"," BAM! Nonstop energy, impressive photography, brilliant film!
","To be fair, I am posting this review AFTER my review of the sequel.  Why? The sequel sucks for very specific reasons, plot elements and devices present in this film are sorely missed in the sequel.<br/><br/>This film exists solidly on the ""serious"" side of vampire flicks - ""Dracula"", ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and ""Interview with a Vampire"" - not the campy cheesy schlock of ""John Carpenter's Vampires"".  Why?  It makes vampires seem very real, as opposed to the pure shlock of evil undead coming ""to get you"" - ala ""Evil Dead 2"" (without the satire).<br/><br/>
The film starts with a dramatic introduction to the world of the vampires, from a very personal angle.  The energy is built in the intro, and carried to the hilt by superb physical acting by Snipes, with outstanding action sequences that are unequalled in Western cinema.  The main characters are very strong, very distinct, and very realistic.  Even though all of them could of been torn from a comic book, this film's photography and sound editing put you right there in the middle of it all.  Unique set design and shooting locations also give this film an eerie ""every city"" feel - beating ""The Matrix"" to the punch by as much as a year.<br/><br/>Stephen Dorff shines as a villian, and is so good at being bad you'd think he was the protaganist (there are many other reasons to see that as well). While some critics can't get past the gratitious violence and well, gallons of blood, open minded viewers may see the bigger message in this film. Tucked neatly into the subplots are a good protrayal of a gen-x class struggle, led by Dorff's character.<br/><br/>This film's greatest strength is the plot.  Make no mistake: this is not average 80 IQ plot here.  This is pure neoclassicalism.  If you don't see it, you're missing the point of this film.  The sequel has no plot - the lead character is just moving through a series of action sequences to get ""the bad guy"".  In this film, Blade struggles with personal identity, family, love and love lost - and a plot development that is a real double whammy.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough good things about this film.  The costumes and set design set the scene; the indulgences of wealth and power. The photography immerses the viewer combined with a perfect soundtrack and choreography. Fantastic casting and unbelievable direction make this film a winner.<br/><br/>If you like pure slasher fare, this film will entertain - but if you want some serious backstory, plot & character development added to your violence (like ""The Matrix"") look no further - and skip the pedestrian sequel."
"Bob_647","8","0","0","31 May 2020"," Dark & edgy serial comic book propaganda; & it is cooked off its edge!
","Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the day walker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans, as food, and he plans to waken the Blood God and take control of the world<br/><br/>David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. Stephen Dorff provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains. While overall bad comic book movies were so bad that they were entertaining, Blade is entertaining because the action is good. There are some typical action cliches but nothing too annoying for the viewer. The overall story is thin but again, nothing too bad.<br/><br/>The story is good and renews the vampire genre by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. The vampire ""dustings"" are a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously combust which looks great. Vampire movies are usually considered to be low quality. For the most part, that is the case these days. But every now and then a good vampire movie comes up and in the 90's there were 3 vampire films that are considered to be the best.<br/><br/>The film maintains it's dark edge with retrospective Gothic production, snappy one liners, & sudden violence. This may sound like cliches, but Stephen Norrington is able to direct the film through a Gothic style of its own. The screening time of 2 hours is not cumbersome. There are fresh surprises in every scene. The production design is tremendously visual & candy, with an intuitive & simplistic comic aspect to the production layering & screening.<br/><br/>This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, & the good against evil. Yes sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet."

","Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a thing, director Stephen Norrington gave us Blade. Based on Marvel's comic-book series about a vampire hunter who is part bloodsucker himself, the film starred Wesley Snipes in the title role, with Stephen Dorff as his nemesis, nasty vampire Deacon Frost, who is attempting to take over the world by resurrecting an ancient 'blood god'.<br/><br/>Norrington does a great job in translating the comic to screen, delivering wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, plenty of stylish visuals, a smattering of gore, and a pounding techno soundtrack, with only a smidge of unconvincing CGI to occasionally ruin the effect. Snipes, a solid actor and skilled martial artist, fits the character to a 'T'; able support comes from Kris Kristofferson as Blade's mentor Whistler and N'Bushe Wright as helpful hematologist Karen, who is unwittingly caught up in the battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Also joining in for the fun are cult favourite Udo Kier as 'pure-blood' vampire Dragonetti (who has the best death scene of the film), Donal Logue as Frost's rowdy right hand man Quinn, and Traci Lords as sexy vamp Racquel (whose screen-time is all too brief, her character destroyed in the film's blood-soaked opening nightclub scene).<br/><br/>8/10. Still holds up as a very worthy Marvel movie."

","Blade is a dark action packed flick, that really brings out the best in vampires, and doesn't make them laughing stock. The soundtrack is energetic, the action is non stop, yet there is plenty of time for the story to be pushed forward in a satisfying way. It really strays from the usual vampire formula, and it really mixes up things, making Blade a truly unique movie, which still holds up even to this day, and is still above all other vampire movies.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is the perfect choice for Blade. He is charismatic, fits perfectly in the shoes of the Daywalker, while his co-star Kris Kristofferson is born to play Whistler. He is a badass SOB, and he is always there to even the odds, which are almost always against his half-vampire friend. They both compliment each other very well, and are really fun to watch.<br/><br/>Overall you can't go wrong with Blade. It forever changed ""superhero"" movies, and it just gets better from here."

This is a cult film that I would love to see it again on the bigscreen, or 4k for a secondary choice. Both Blade I and II are impressive visually and allow the series to shine, where others have failed. Vampire films tend to be very generic and seeing a stylish comic book film adapted this way was impressive. Supporting cast only add to the style of the film.

","Blade has one of the most cool openings of any super hero movies. It is with pain that I watched the rest of the movie, seeing how all of that could be so much better than it is. My biggest issue with this movie actually has nothing to do with story or acting. No... It's about blood. When Blade enters that club at the beginning of the movie, you expect to see a monstrous bloodshed. I mean, it's not like it's problem to show blood, they already drenched the whole club in blood. But no, when Blade kills vampires, they just disintegrate. Why?! It feels so out of place and wrong, it literally pains me to see action scene potential not being used to it's fullest. So, what you have left is vampire killing machine who kills vampires, but that killing doesn't look as nearly as spectacular and fun as it could look. And when you add to it the odd pacing of the movie and the way characters are developed, it doesn't really make us care all that much and in the end, you are left with really mediocre movie that could have been so much better if it's makers knew what they wanted to do. 6/10, try to watch it for fun..."

Im glad its rated r because sometimes movies, especially vampire movies or if its from marvel is not so im glad. The cinematics are really cool and different and altogether its very impressive for before the 2000's. The CGI was horrendous and thats obvious but sometimes its barely visible plus it also looks kinda cool and to be honest i dont really care about that i mean this is from the late 90's and its the first movie in the trilogy so they probably didn't have enough money until the other ones to make the effects better.

","Lots of new vampire lore for followers to consider - vampires brand their half human surrogates with a tattoo on the back of the neck called a glyph, the scientific name for a vampire is 'hominus nocturna', and the Book of Erebus is the Vampire Bible. I didn't know any of these things going in, and it's the kind of stuff I look for whenever I take in another vampire flick. This one's two decades old now as I write this, so I'm a little late to the party, but I like to take in a vampire flick every now and then, as this one also checks off a box on a list of comic book inspired movie characters. This one's quite a bit on the gory side, probably more so than most, and it gets off to a bloody start with a vampire disco rave in which the fire sprinklers shower blood on the dance crowd in a maze of brilliant red. If this is what gets your juices flowing, the picture is probably made for you. The story itself features Wesley Snipes as a 'turned' vampire, i.e., not a pure blood, on a mission to rid the world of vampire evil. Aided and abetted by grizzled blood chemist Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade (Snipes) is accompanied by once bitten, twice shy Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) in a quest to put a fellow turned vampire Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) out of the world domination business. It pretty much boils down to blood-soaked spectacle cloaked in martial arts mayhem on Blade's part, with a curious cameo by a Jabba the Hutt inspired sack of flesh called Pearl (Eric Edwards). Definitely not for the faint hearted."

In order to satisfy his thirst for blood he takes a plasma serum that his mentor and fellow vampire hunter Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) developed, but its effectiveness is waning. Also along for the ride is a doctor (N'Bushe Wright) who was unlucky enough to also get bitten by a vampire but who is conveniently a hematologist who just might be able to develop a cure for our heroes problem. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is our hero's nemesis, a leader among the vampires who were infected as opposed to the more reserved purebred vampires, and just to make things a little more interesting Frost has a sinister plot in motion that must be stopped.<br/><br/>Snipes is well cast in a role he could sink his teeth into (sorry), it may not be the role of a lifetime but was certainly an improvement over some of the parts he had inexplicably taken. In the character of Blade we get an intriguing tortured hero, and while this isn't a character piece its still interesting to watch. As for the rest of the cast, Kristofferson is fine in a fairly stock role, but both Dorff and Wright are fairly forgettable.<br/><br/>A movie with lots of noise, lots of gore and lots of visual effects, it's certainly enjoyable on a live action comic book level.

While Blade is great to see on screen being portrayed by Wesley Snipes all the other characters along with the main villain do nothing for this story to make it interesting. <br/><br/>N' Brush Wright's character could have been really something interesting, but she is not and instead feels very pale compared to Wesley and she and Blade have no chemistry together on screen. <br/><br/>Stephen Dorff is a character that could have been great but is instead merely just a sideline Marvel villain before there was a MCU. Which is quite sad to say cause I saw some potential at the beginning of the fill for this character, but sadly he is nothing of notable interest. <br/><br/>Overall Blade does have good fight scenes and is defiantly different from most vampire films. It has great action and great cinematography, but it fails in characters and story that are interesting enough to make the action understandable."
"dimakorou","6","0","0","28 July 2013"," With its undisputed elements and a superb antagonist, ""Blade"" almost makes it enjoyable...
","------------- MY RATING: 55/100 -------------<br/><br/>*CONTAINS SPOILERS!*<br/><br/>The concept is very good but it is being delivered heavy damage by unrealistic plot shifts. For example, the young hematologist girl (Karen) brought big and heavy med equipment from her hospital without being caught. Then, she noticed that a chemical liquid is disintegrating vampire cells and then she created a cure (!!!) for those who are turned vampire by being bitten and all that in a few days! Creating a cure for such a condition should take decades, not a few days and I am sure someone else in the vampire world should have already tried to find a cure to use as a weapon for the non-pure-bloods. Another example is that the antagonist (Frost) was able to capture the Vampire Authority members pretty easily, like capturing humans in an alley. And yet another example is that the protagonist (Blade) burnt Quinn and then left him to be delivered to the hospital where he created such a mess. Why not end him with his blade at the beginning of the movie?<br/><br/>Great acting skills can be noticed on the antagonist (Frost) and maybe Whistler and Quinn but I can not say the same for the protagonist (Blade) and Karen. Especially the scene where Blade is feeding on Karen is so corny.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is pretty dark and blood and gore is everywhere to be seen. The plot is delivering rapid accelerations and decelerations to itself which makes the journey for the viewer unpredictable but also frustrating.<br/><br/>Great and disputing additions are the Vampire Bible which actually is the vampire history and the vampire god which I bet is the incarnation of the original vampire that empowers Frost's body after the ritual.<br/><br/>To sum up, the dark and bloody atmosphere with an insane and superb antagonist are the pros for this movie and those pros outweigh the cons as described above, delivering us a watchable (but not a masterpiece of the genre) vampire movie."

Given that there are two sequels, you can guess for yourself what happens. The showdown with the lackeys, just before the Final Battle, is suddenly all mêlée, though minutes before there were a dozen henchmen armed with all matter of shotguns and automatic weapons. But of course, once Blade arrives, no guns at all, and everyone lines up (single file!) to be haplessly pummeled. And of course, during the showdown itself, the villain, having Blade on the ropes, takes time to gloat instead of going for the throat as you would expect at least a freaking VAMPIRE to do. Again, two sequels and counting, so you can imagine how lethal Blade finds gloating.<br/><br/>BTW: Not by any means anti-Snipes, like him in other things, just not this.

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>One of the best comic to film conversions, dark, funny, gory and action packed. We are introduced to Blade, a half man, half vampire with a tragic past who has made it his lonely quest to kill all vampires. His advantage over them is that he has their strength, speed and heightened senses, and can expose himself to sunlight without fear of burning up. His disadvantage is his need to feed-blood is necessary for him, but is not in ready supply as he will not drink from a human. The film deals with Blade noticing that vampire activity has increased, that gangs are coming together under lead vampire Frost who plans to become all-powerful. It is only a matter of time before this happens, and the human race, oblivious, is doomed.<br/><br/>The action in Blade is superb, with Snipes showing off his martial arts skills, and managing to look kick ass cool as he does it, and the effects are brilliantly bloody. The opening scene in the vampire club is one to be remembered for the ages, and many of the fight scenes are equal to the best Hong kong has ever produced. Kristofferson is good as Blade's only friend, Wright is OK as the woman half way to vampirism, and Dorff is excellent as Frost. The film scores points for being down beat, not striving to be like anything that has come before, or trying to fit conventions, and by doing this it raises itself above the majority of modern horror, action, and comic movies. 9 out of 10."

In small terms, this movie rocks.  It's got some kick-ass action sequences. Wesley Snipes shows the peak of his Martial Arts abilities and swordsmanship.  The movie has equal parts of action, horror, comedy and mystery.  <br/><br/>Fans of the comic may arque that Snipes doesn't look too much like Blade, but he delivers the goods.

"FilmFlaneur","Null","0","0","24 October 2000"," Brain on hold for this modern take on vampire hunting
","Like a Terminator crossed with Peter Cushing's Van Helsing, Snipes' vampire hunter dominates this film with all the subtlety of a stake in the heart. This is not a film for thinking about too much, or too hard (although some of the high-tech changes to the elements of traditional cinematic vampire hunting are imaginative). This is a gory action event, that drags the viewer by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go. Personally I found the action scenes generally exciting, although sometimes Snipes' casual body count has as much impact and significance as the shadowy victims slaughtered off hand in a flashy computer game.<br/><br/>Norrington's direction is flashy and occasionally impressive. He has successfully exchanged the traditional gothic, stately panorama of Dracula for a more hi-tech, fast moving vision of disease, subculture and degeneration. Ultimately, though, it is the figure of Blade, the cool dude crucified on the cross of his repressed vampirism, that remains with the viewer, and one hopes that in the sequel his character is expanded and deepened."

","Is there anything more ridiculous yet still fascinating than vampire movies? I cannot explain their almost 100 year old appeal but Blade is another in a long list which I enjoyed and here is why.<br/><br/>First there is a style twist in Blade combining 40's film noir with vampire conventions. (In a much stranger way Dark City also tries for this kind of look.) Second, our vampire is the opposite of the usual sophisticated blood sucking aristocrat. Blade's central character is a Schwazenegger Terminator macho antihero except that Wesley Snipes can act. <br/><br/>Add some martial arts, lots of shooting, vampire mumbo jumbo, gross zombies and you have an above average action film. There is a Ghostbusters apocalyptic subplot that I was able to ignore almost through the entire movie until it overwhelms the story. But soon that was finished and Snipes went on with being cool. <br/><br/>Speaking of Snipes, he just oozes a menacing intensity. Coupled with Kris Kristofferson as the grizzled side kick and N'Bushe Wright as the damsel in distress and you have the foundation for Snipes to be his big, bad self.<br/><br/>
Blade is basically an action film that has the right mix of movie styles to make it worth watching."

"rparham","7","2","5","27 March 2006"," An entertaining Blade
","In the mid-1990s, Marvel Comics film adaptations where in the midst of some serious doldrums. The previous released Marvel adaptation had been a film version of Captain America that was produced for a extremely low budget and ended up going straight to video, which was appropriate considering how terrible it was. There had also been an abortive attempt to produce a Fantastic Four film, but after the completion of the film, it was shelved when producer Bern Eichenger made a deal with director/producer Chris Columbus to produce a big-budget version (which would take more than a decade to actually make it to screen). It was into this environment of calamity that emerged a film centered around a little-known Marvel character named Blade. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire who has devoted his life to destroying other vampires, didn't seem like a likely choice to bring some light to the Marvel universe, but it did and managed, in many ways to breathe life back into Marvel film adaptations.<br/><br/>Written by comics aficionado David Goyer (whose personal collection of comics reportedly stretched into the thousands), Blade was a vehicle for Wesley Snipes, directed by a former make-up effects artist turned director named Stephen Norrington. The results, while not perfect, are rather entertaining for a action-driven comic adaptation. Blade starts off with guns blazing, featuring a high-energy action sequence in an impromptu vampire nightclub where vampires gather to feast on unlucky victims. The sequence is full of energy, some rather tense suspense at the appropriate moments and well-staged fight sequences.<br/><br/>It is from here that the film's plot begins to unfold: the world is secretly ruled by an ancient race of vampires who control much of the financial empire throughout the globe, manipulating humans and using some as their pawns. Blade, assisted by his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a man whose family was killed by a vampire, hunts down vampires from city to city, desperately attempting to rid the world of this scourge. It is after a vampire bites a doctor involved in blood research, Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), whom Blade attempts to save from becoming a vampire, that he finds himself drawn closer to his arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), who is attempting to translate ancient vampire text to discover the secrets of a all-powerful deity who will transform the world into vampires.<br/><br/>Blade is not high-art, that is for sure. The film is not designed to change your life or make you think deeply about important issues. It is, however, designed to provide some entertainment for it's running time, and pulls it off fairly well. As with other films of it's type, when a complicated culture has to be introduced to the audience, an outsider is the perfect opportunity, and Karen Jenson provides that entrance into the world of the vampires, allowing for exposition that is not unrealistically placed. We learn a fair amount about the film's vampire world, and it proves interesting at times. However, this is first and foremost an action film, and Blade services that aspect well. Beyond the opening scene, there are several major fight sequences in Blade, all well choreographed and destined to get the adrenaline pumping. Director Norrington uses some stylization during the course of the film, including time-lapse photography, but doesn't overdo it like other films heavy on action in recent years.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is strong in the role of Blade, making an indelible impression, even with limited dialogue. He looks the part of hardened vampire killer and wears the role well. Kris Kristofferson is good as his mentor Whistler, providing some necessary levity at moments and giving us a more human hero to latch onto when Blade proves a bit less than talkative. N'Bushe Wright is serviceable in her role, but proves to be a somewhat bland companion for Blade. Stephen Dorff gives a good performance as the villain, without going over the top.<br/><br/>Blade is not quite as good as other Marvel adaptations that followed it in short order, such as X-Men and Spider-Man, but it is a decent piece of action film-making that does it's job well."

I never had those moments where I suspended my disbelief and worried about what was going to happen to Wesley Snipes as ""Blade"".  Everything reeked ""FRANCHISE"" and ""SEQUEL"".

The acting talents could really have been pushed, especially on part of Snipes, whose 'I-have-feelings-very-deep-down' attitude was undesirable at times.

","Extremely violent, fun nonsense stars Wesley Snipes as Blade a half vampire / half human whose life mission is to kill all vampires and keep man kind safe. Evil vamp Stephen Dorff seeks to destroy Blade. Snipes makes a perfect pick for the role of Blade. Dorff turns in a stylish wickedly funny turn. The film has plenty of style to spare. The opening sequence is excellent. The film is always coming up with some new kind of surprise to keep the auidence entertained. The direction and sets are just about as good as one could expect. However, just don't expect much in the form of substance though.<br/><br/>Rated R; Extreme Violence and Profanity."

","The movie opens up in a night club, where music is playing, there's all sorts of dancing. Then the sprinklers go off, and instead of it shooting out water, its shooting out blood. Already, I got a sickening feeling that this was NOT going to be what I was expecting. Already, right off the bat, were introduced to Blade, slaying vampires left and right in brutal and grotesque ways. Necks are bitten, impalement galore. Looks like I found my favorite Snipes movie! AND THIS ISN'T IT! And no, I didn't read the comics , so don't ask. Altogether, people really seem to dig this movie to this day. I wasn't impressed. I thought it was over the top gory, and didn't focus in enough on the story, which is already confusing. Walked away with more questions then answers. which should never be the case...PERIOD...when watching any vampire movie. It's slick, I'll give it that. Good? I wouldn't go that far. I was hoping on a little more information on Blade himself, but instead, we go the bloodbath route, just killing left and right to the point where everything seems to be going so fast, I couldn't tell what was going on. if you love vampire movies, you'll probably dig Blade. If your a Snipes fan like me, you may dig it. If your a Snipes fan like me, but don't really dig overly violent vampire movies, you will probably be disappointed like I was. I'm giving Blade 5 and half stars. I'm in a good mood. We can round it off to 6. And no, I'm never going to watch Blade II."

"dworldeater","7","1","2","17 March 2019"," Good 90's action
","The 1st Blade film is the best in the series and a box office hit that would set things in motion for more comic book adaptations to come on the big screen. What we have here is an avalanche of action with a 90's techno soundtrack. The action is quite stylized, with a whole lot of it, borrowing a lot from Hong Kong action movies mainly with some early CGI f/x. The tone of this film is very dark and is grounded by an excellent performance by Wesley Snipes as the title character. He does not need to say much to convey the hatred and coldness of his character and as such is singularly focused at taking out the vampire populace for the pain and struggles he had in his life as a vampire/human hybrid. Kris Kristofferson is great as Whisler, a Van Helsing type and father figure for Blade. Steven Dorff is lousy as a villain opposite Blade, it seems he tried too hard to play a cool villain, but comes off as a annoying dufus. The support cast is pretty strong with Udo Keir(who would have been a better choice as the title villain), Donal Logue and N'Bushe Wright who appears as Blade's love interest, sort of, is really good as well as gorgeous. There is no shortage of hot chicks either,early in the film we have a cameo from Traci Lords. It has been a while since I have watched Blade and comes across a little dated, but is still a good action movie that would be influential to movies like Underworld."
"a_chinn","7","1","2","4 June 2018"," Before the hard-R superhero movie ""Deadpool"" there was ""Blade""
","At this point, I'm painfully bored with superhero films (I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan and I can't even bring myself to watch his Avengers films), but if more film adaptations took a tone like ""Blade"" I'd probably start showing interest and showing up to the theater again. Almost 20 years before audiences flipped out over the hard-R superhero movie ""Deadpool,"" the lesser Marvel Universe superhero Blade smashed onto the scene with with this ultra bloody tale of modern day vampire hunting. Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half human/half vampire who can walk in sunlight and uses that to his advantage as he hunts his vampire quarry. In this vampire universe, vampires have an underground secret society, who use their wealth and power to hide their existence and keep themselves well fed. That is until upstart vampire Stephen Dorff decides vampires should come out from the shadows and should claim their rightful place at the top of the food chain. It's a cool story set up, but what makes this film great is Snipes as Blade, the ultra slick direction by Stephen Norrington, and the unapologetic gore that made this movie standout at the time (though it still manages to stand out to this day among superhero films). Sure, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kick-Ass"" were super violent, but they were done with a a fair amount of humor. ""Blade"" is a humorless and completely serious of film, mixing action and horror. In many ways, it's more of a hybrid of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Hunger"" and is less similar to any other superhero film of the past 20 years. ""The Crow"" is probably is probably the most similar of comic book movie to this one, although I don't know if I'd really consider ""The Crow"" a superhero movie either. Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" may be the only other superhero movie since Blade to take what I'd consider a serious tone that wasn't afraid to embrace downbeat themes and not worry about being a wide audience crowdpleaser. I think Ang Lee intended his film to be a crowdpleaser, but it ended up not, although I think ""Hulk"" is highly underrated and I would argue is the best of the recent big budget Marvel films (even if they rebooted the series and do not consider Lee's film part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe). But back to this film in particular, Wesley Snipes commands the screen as Blade, in what' is likely his most memorable onscreen role. His stoic low-voiced man-of-few-words demeanor does border on parody and will admittedly come off as silly if you're not into the spirit of the film, but it worked for me. Also, Snipes, a trained martial artist, has some of the best fight sequences of his career. In terms of story, writer David S. Goyer took the unique approach of not making the movie about Blade's origin story and instead the audience finds themselves thrust into the middle of a long simmering war waged by Blade agains the hidden vampire world. The audience's is introduced to Blade and his secret war by way of N'Bushe Wright, an innocent human who finds herself suddenly caught up in fight when she's attacked by a vampire. Director Norrington, as well as director of photography Theo Van De Sande, get a lot of credit for the film's slick look, with tightly edited action sequences and a cold austere vampire world bathed in cool blues and blacks (until it explodes in blood red). The film also greatly benefits from its' supporting cast, which includes not just Dorff, but also Kris Kristofferson as Blade's human helper, making all his weapons and gear, Donal Logue as Dorff's primary henchmen, Udo Kier as an establishment vampire opposed to Dorff, and even Traci Lords shows up as a vamp. There's also a fine atmospheric score by the always great Mark Isham. Also worth noting are some excellent practical special effects, particularly a memorable sequence with a Jabba the Hutt-like vampire is tortured by Blade's ultraviolet flashlight. However, there are some significant downsides to this film. The main one is that the film's best scene, the vampire rave blood bath, is the first scene of the movie and nothing that follows lives up to it. It really is a dynamite scene, with New Order music blasting, sexy vampires cavorting, and blood spraying down from the ceiling where the vamps have rigged blood to rain down from the ceiling fire sprinklers. That is until Blade shows up and mows them down in his trench coat with guns, stakes, high kicks, and samurai sword. Also to the film's detriment are that the characters are all rather underdeveloped. Sure they all have a backstories, but they are more archetypes than relatable or empathetic characters. The story also meanders a bit and loses momentum at times. There's also a rather lackluster and disappointing climax that didn't seem consistent with the rest of the film's slick modern setting. Writer Goyer has a pretty hit or miss track record and his best films included either co-writing credits by others or were made by strong directors like Christopher Nolan, Alex Proyas, or Guillermo del Toro, the director of the far superior Blade sequel. Left to his own devices, I'm not sure Goyer is that good of a write outside of developing solid story set-ups. Another complaint is that while the films did feature some excellent practical special effects, the CGI is consistently awful throughout the film. The CGI blood looks like Magic Marker, the vampire disintegrations from stakings and whatnot look like a bad TV show superimposed images, and when the vampires swell and explode the CGI just looks completely off. The CGI was distracting and takes you out of the film. Still, despite these fairly major deficits, ""Blade"" manages to be a memorable horror/action film hybrid that is well worth watching flaws in all, although Guillermo del Toro's terrific sequel should have been the first film to launch this franchise and is the high point of the series."

","In itself a super cool movie<br/><br/>Blade is definitely super cool money for the movie as well as for the main character. However, the film has little '90s troops that are quite outdated and take something out of the sails of the wind, the same goes for the' 90s CGI effects, but instead kicked 3 annoying action movie cliches as it should be.<br/><br/>I love to watch movies that stand out from the others. I love it when I do not know who in that time a surprisingly big part and I love R rated comic book adaptations (Blabe came first).<br/><br/>But there are many things about this movie that bother me, such as the constant shaky cam, is a tripod really that expensive? The back and forth intersect between the normal dialogues, not everything has to be presented excitingly high 10, because that makes the really exciting something bland. The main villain is just as old as muscular and looks as cool as the hero, so it would be better if he stings out more, especially as he is in a wheel full of old men who look like they are having children's souls to fight to the top as he represents the new kind and the new danger. Then do it too dangerously enough: if your rogue is not cool, then make him ... huge and scary, scary, super strong, diabolical, or at least entertaining enough that it does not interest you like boring.<br/><br/>Seriously Deacon Frost just does not say it out and behaved like that until the climax, I wonder why we and the ever wasting our time with him, at least if he was super pretty and always well-dressed, you could at least to conclude that he served only as their figurehead and that would explain his motivation but unfortunately no! Nothing like that!<br/><br/>Or we just change a few character traits and attributes in this movie because Frost's right hand, his asshole, was so nasty and so annoying that she always wanted to clap her hands when Blade missed one, her jokes were damned funny and his whole character so exhausting that you're just waiting to satisfy the feeling of salvation when he finally dies. (Unfortunately, a fight as well as his death like sex with a tuna can is painful, disappointing and totally anti-climactic.<br/><br/>But those are the mistakes in the script that was probably stretched to double length (with over 10 minutes of filler), an amateur music video editing and post credit scene which for some reason was inserted after a blackout but before the credits, there are only a few plot Holes in the bad plan but otherwise there is not much to find worthy in this movie.<br/><br/>The fights are exciting, so the characters are super interesting the whole movie has a cool look, only half of the movie is night city and even the scenes that take place at night are neatly photographed and lit up so you can see enough and that Film has enough stuntwork for about 50 trailers."
"Tweekums","8","1","2","27 January 2017"," Wesley Snipes the Vampire Slayer
","Vampires are living amongst us with the collaboration of those in power; they manage to keep a low profile though that is until upstart vampire, Deacon Frost, decides that the old order needs to be overthrown. Standing against the vampires is Blade, the 'Day Walker', a half vampire who has none of the usual vampire weaknesses and, with the help of a serum, can control his lust for blood. Other senior vampires look down on Frost because he was turned rather than born a vampire but unlike them he is interested in the past and has deciphered ancient text with tell how to summon the Blood God to do it he will require Blade's blood.<br/><br/>Early on Blade rescues a doctor. Karen, who has been bitten and takes her back to his base where, with the help of his friend Whistler, they attempt to cure her. Once treated she tries to help him find a cure as well as working to make more effective weapons to battle the vampires. After many fights with Frost's underlings the final confrontation and the ceremony take place inevitably it will be fairly bloody.<br/><br/>I haven't read any of the comics that inspired the film so can't say how close this is I can however say that this is an exciting take on vampire films. Gone are the usual crosses and holy water; instead we get swords and silver stakes and bullets. While there are plenty of horror elements it is effectively an action film with lots of shooting and martial arts action. Wesley Snipes is great in the title role as he makes the action look real rather than excessively choreographed. Stephen Dorff is menacing enough as bad guy Frost; it helps that the character is an intelligent villain rather than an obviously matched evil version of Blade. N'Bushe Wright is likable as Karen, Kris Kristofferson is solid enough as Whistler and Donal Logue provides some needed levity as a vampire who keeps getting an arm hacked off. The action scenes are pretty intense and at times quite bloody. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Snipes, vampire films or exciting action."

","1990's Wesley Snipes was the Action star with movies like Passenger 57, Demolition man and Murder at 1600. So When Blade was announced and Wesley Snipe was the main lead, a lot of people were excited. Wesley has a black belt and is a known martial artist too, so with pressure on making a successful comic book movie in a dark tone following after the failure of the Batman franchise, one of the biggest comic book franchises of all time, The film had a lot to prove...<br/><br/>And did it, boy! Blade was Amazing, it had great scenes awesome Soundtrack! pretty bad ass fight scenes and a cool villain played by Stephen Dorff. The Origin story of Blade was quick and useful with exposition, which meant that there was more time to actually focus on the story. <br/><br/>Wesley Snipes performances, is arguably one of the best comic to live action movie adaptations. Forget Bale, Downey Jr or Keaton as your number one comic to movie faces. Snipes was Blade! His acting was great, his presence was felt. Dorff did an amazing job at being the self centered leader, who wants his people to rise.<br/><br/>There isn't much negative to say about the film, one could point out the blood effects, but when you watch in the cinema it looked real as hell. <br/><br/>Another thing should be said about the film, was it was actually first who used the whole slow motion footage, and not the matrix which came out 6 month later."
"hepodcast","9","1","2","19 November 2015"," Not Subtle, Just Fun
","Blade is not a subtle movie. It practically runs on the rule of cool. Everyone is in black leather, swords are the best way to kill, and immortal beings somehow still act like twenty-something douche- bags.<br/><br/>There's a lightness in the plot that's hard to overlook. Vampires apparently just become evil when they turn, making it easier to cope with the efficiency that Blade kills them with. As a character, Blade himself doesn't have much depth, although Wesley Snipes brings a certain gravitas to the role that makes this easy to overlook. Less easy to overlook is the pretty-boy villain, who might as well be the trope-maker for the Marvel Villain Who Could Have Been Really Cool, But Fell Short of His Potential.<br/><br/>But as easy as it is to pick holes in the logic of what's happening on screen, in retrospect, Blade was arguably one of the most influential movies of its day. It came out the year after Batman and Robin had bombed its way onto the screen. Batman and Robin represented the worst way Hollywood could look at comic book movies. It was silly, childish, without weight or import. ""See how silly this Batman fellow is!"" it said to the viewing public. ""That's because comic books are really for kids, not for serious grownups like us!""<br/><br/>And with that movie fresh in people's minds, Blade stormed into theaters and set the whole thing on fire.<br/><br/>In some senses Blade shares a bit of its basic DNA with Batman and Robin. The story is relatively simple, the lines between good and evil are starkly drawn, there is very little nuance to any of the characters. This is still ""comic book"" story telling.<br/><br/>But on the other hand it broke ground for what a comic book movie could be. For one thing it definitely isn't for kids. The hard R, ultra-violent action is clearly aimed at a more mature audience, and it soared at the box office despite ignoring the younger demographic. the same audience that would flock back to the theaters in the next year to see more heroes in black leather fighting the forces of evil in The Matrix. This wasn't a comic book movie; this was an action movie.<br/><br/>And maybe more significant is the presence of predominantly black protagonists. This isn't a ""thing"" in Blade. They don't have some point to make about racism. And the fact that it's so casual about it, makes the lack of black-led superhero movies even today, seem even more glaring by comparison.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning that despite coming on the heels of a comic book movie that nearly everyone hated, and despite being an R- rated superhero movie, Blade did crazy business at the box office, topping 70 million dollars domestically and 130 million worldwide proving there was still life in the genre.<br/><br/>And so, despite not being a great movie on its own merits, when placed in the history of comic book films Blade is a Colossus, standing astride two eras of film-making. It has one foot planted in the silliness of the past, and another planted in another era, an era we arguably still haven't reached even today, an era where the whitewashed and watered down superhero movie is a thing of the past, an era in which comic books are most decidedly not for kids.<br/><br/>Blade is an echo from the past, an influence on the present, and a vision of the future.<br/><br/>(Editor's note: I love this freaking movie with zero guilt and no regard for what it did for comic book moviesWesley Snipes killing vampires with a samurai sword is awesome)<br/><br/>To hear more of our thoughts on Blade check out Episode 165 of the Human Echoes Podcast. www.humanechoes.com"
"Irishchatter","8","1","2","17 November 2015"," Loved the action but it had a cliffhanger.....
","Honestly Wesley Snipes was absolutely amazing and awesome as Blade. He definitely reminds me of legends such as Duke Nukem and Buffy The Vampire Slayer who make sure that everybody around the world is safe from the bad guys and other evil acquaintances. The storyline was very good, I liked how it showed us how and when he was born, I forgotten the date but whatever date it was, it should be an official Blade Day in my opinion! I have to admit I didn't like the blood and gore but I loved the action involved in it. It was really enjoyable!<br/><br/>However, I didn't like in the ending where he was about to kill a Vampire, I would actually would love to have seen him kill the vampire! I think it would be better if they made that happen because I would certainly avoid the sequels, they aren't good as this! <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, go watch it, just don't watch the sequels!"
"skybrick736","8","1","2","26 July 2015"," Blade
","The film Blade, is one of the very first all-out action vampire movies that are often seen today in modern horror films. What's great about Blade is the likability of the two main heroes, performed by Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson. Stephen Dorff also was tremendous as the ruthless Deacon Frost, that was the leader of a group of young club-going vampires. The filmmakers didn't shy away from their use of gore and take advantage of the R rating being an extremely violent movie. The gore could have even been better though, if the filmmakers didn't use the cheap trick of dissipating vampire ash when struck with silver. <br/><br/>There are many horror films out there that are pretty brainless, but Blade is brainless in its own way by having top-notch fighting sequences and a story that's fun and easy to follow. It's slightly outdated, but nostalgic in the fact it's one of the very first, fast-paced superhero movies, which are all too common place nowadays."
"bh_tafe3","8","1","2","30 November 2014"," Well made 90s actioner
","Wesley Snipes has been in his share of instantly forgettable garbage in his career, but in the 90s he was a formidable talent in the action genre. And Blade is one of his signature roles.<br/><br/>This sleek, glossy entry into the action genre is credited by some as leading to the reigniting of comic book properties as workable franchises, but to be honest, I was not aware of the Blade comic series going in, and I'm not too sure how many other people were in 1998.<br/><br/>In the film's opening scenes, we start in a normal looking nightclub, that turns out to be a vampire rave joint where they have blood in the emergency water sprinklers and feast on humans. In comes our hero of few words, identified by some frightened and overawed vampires as Blade, and he wipes out pretty much every creature in the club with a funky looking sword and some cool martial arts move while muttering tough guy one liners. It's a nice, bloody, clichéd opening to the film, and gives you a real pointer to whether you are going to enjoy the next two hours or not.<br/><br/>Blade is the story of a half vampire (Snipes), retaining his humanity through blood transfusions administered by his grizzly mentor Whistler, (Kris Kristofferson in an excellent career reinvigorating performance) who is able to walk around in the day and kick some serious vampire ass. He becomes something of a legendary adversary in vampire circles, and the nutty vampire antagonist Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a rare worthwhile role) decides to invoke an ancient ritual to give him super evil powers to rid the world of the day walker. This is a potentially ludicrous plot that is played straight by Dorff's enjoyably malevolent villain, who is a hard enough man to be a genuine threat without coming across as unstoppable. This is where Blade succeeds where a a lot of films get it wrong. When the villain is too unstoppable, the writers can't work out a way to actually defeat the villain in a satisfactory way and we end up with either a nonsensical rushed resolution or a deus ex machine solution. Not here though. The final showdown is suitably over the top and dramatic, and as an audience we can buy into it.<br/><br/>Coming on the back of The Vampire Chronicles and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade was more than a simple cash in. It was an entertaining, lustily violent, well made action film in its own right. This is a high point for Snipes and Dorff, a new type of comic book movie and one of the better actioners of the late 90s."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","1","2","3 October 2014"," Blade was a game changer
","Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' (2000) is often credited with closing the door on the campy comic book movie era epitomized by Joel Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin' (1997), but it was really Stephen Norrington's 'Blade' that set the tone for the more serious approach that was to come. It also helped to introduce the kind of stylized action that would almost become cliché after the release of 'The Matrix' a few years later.<br/><br/>Though there is a decidedly 90s zeitgeist to it all, 'Blade' is a stylish, well-made take on the whole vampire mythos that holds up surprisingly well sixteen years later."
"alindsay-al","8","1","2","29 April 2014"," A Great dark comic book film
","Blade is really a different comic book film to every other comic book film there has been and that I believe is why Blade is such a good film. The film stars Blade a half Human Half Vampire as he tries to control his thirst for blood and also attempts to stop the end of the world. Wesley Snipes is Blade and was the perfect person to play Blade and will always be Blade. Add to that good side characters and a good villain which does help make this film seem more then just an average film. There is a lot of stylised violence in this film some good and some bad for this film but another big positive is the action, this action is some of the best filmed action out there and it truly sells just how cool a character Blade really is. A few slow parts aside this film is fun, sometimes cheesy and action heavy which I thoroughly enjoyed."
"sb_92","7","1","2","1 March 2013"," Brilliant!
","I watched this film a couple of nights ago forgetting how awesome it really is. I remember when I was younger I never really understood what I was watching and honestly? this was probably like the 5th time watching it since those days. Firstly this film sticks to good and simple Vampire lore, not giving the vampires too many advantages over the humans and not giving them so many weaknesses that they become laughable. The Character Blade is a total Badass! he honestly could not have been portrayed by anyone else than Wesley Snipes! this guy is an awesome Blade the best adaptation I have seen to this date, werther it's from the comics, the old Spiderman cartoons whatever Id probably say this is Wesley Snipes best role since Demolition Man, I find the narrative to go in a steady but creative pace, The character of Whistler is really awesome, he's that old kind of been through it all here and back again knows his sh*t sort of old dude who you just shouldn't f*ck with, I couldn't have asked for a better supportive actor than Kris Kristofferson.The main protagonist couldn't have been anymore evil than he was, Deacan Frost! like wow! I wish this guy had more screen time, he was so bad! his own kind didn't even like him (Stephen Dorff's best role I have ever seen!)this film has good sometimes witty dialogue with that slight subtle humor to it, great martial arts action scenes throughout leaving you wanting more, definitely a very simple but effective Vampire film! and I would recommend this to anyone who likes good action and Vampire films."
"girlinspottedpajamas","7","1","2","17 September 2011"," Realistic
","This was and still is one of the best vampire films I have seen. It changed how most of us look at vampires; of course it still consists of vampires only coming out at night which should stay that way. The wooden stake method is definitely over used but vampires do need a weakness besides sunlight because, come on who's going to be able to make the sun appear in the middle of the night or always be carrying a UV flashlight continuously? So silver is the only alternative and we all know that only werewolves are allergic to silver but it needed a change of direction as well. The idea of blade being more than just a mere human and not a total ""suckhead"" either but both species rolled into one was a pretty interesting factor. Now of course other movies decided to steal that idea and make it their own but most of us know where that idea originated from; at least I like to think so. <br/><br/>The graphics of this film were amazing to say the least. They were of course not over used like most (movies) tend to do and I loved the blood. This was, in my opinion used only when needed and not a complete gore - a - thon. <br/><br/>Language - okay let's face it; not everyone really comments on the bad language in films or otherwise is so used to it ( I will admit I am very used to it) and doesn't pay attention to it. This film tends to only use it to emphasize what their trying to say as important or to reveal their emotions. In most movies, just about every sentence or after every couple words there is a swear word in it. Kind of overused and annoying and not forget to mention that some people are really bad at it (not like we're practicing).<br/><br/>Hmm...what else am I forgetting? Oh yeah, the bad - So the part we have been waiting for the entire stinking time after all the goodie goodie nonsense. I do not like the fact that all the toughies are practically wearing the same outfit material. Leather, precisely black. Frost, Blade, some of the other random vampires and not forget to mention innocent little Karen, how sweet. Blade I can understand and maybe frost but Karen? I don't think so. A sweet doctor who's used to wearing sophisticated clothing just doesn't decide to wear the look alike outfit with a guy like blade ( Trust me, those who wear leather the first time feel a little uncomfortable for a while. I know I was for awhile) Some how I doubt a doctor like her will all of a sudden change their style in a single day, unless of course you're named karen and your in your 20's, 30's. How very strange."
"ARTaylor","8","1","2","23 May 2011"," The First in the Superhero Renaissance
","Blade was the first of the modern wave of truly serious superhero movies, and it establishes much of what would follow. Gone are the outrageous vehicles, overly silly enemies, and alternate universe where time seems stuck in one decade. This movie was one of the very first to show what it would be like for an extraordinary person to appear in an ordinary, modern day world.<br/><br/>For a character so obscure, Blade is handled very well in the film. Let's face it, before the movie he was more known for being a recurring character on the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. But afterward he skyrocketed almost to the top. Not quite X-Men or Captain America popular, but he became recognizable to non-comic book geeks.<br/><br/>The story is good, it isn't just another standard superhero origin movie. It's handled like Tim Burton's Batman, he's already out there and fighting. The origin is just a brief explanation for the newcomer. I really would like more superhero movies to follow that model since it does work and gets the hero into the action sooner. There's the right blend of action, horror, suspense, and humor to keep audiences entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes does a terrific job. He seems to fit the role perfectly. Snipes handles both the fights and exposition well. He also has that Arnold Schwarzenegger/Harrison Ford style ""serious comedy"" delivery where he says funny lines but doesn't come off as a comedian. Now I find myself reading Blade and only thinking of his voice.<br/><br/>Stephen Dorff is also amazing as Deacon Frost. He's the only one able to move the spotlight away from Snipes. His delivery makes for one terrific villain, though his character doesn't have the pathos many other villains have. I remember him more for his sadistic acts, but not particularly as to why. Still, sometimes a villain without a specific reason is more frightening.<br/><br/>The other actors are also good, though most are overshadowed by Snipes and Dorff. Kristofferson's Whistler has a great relationship with Blade. Their final scene is really great, though makes me wish the series had a stronger sense of continuity with Whistler. N'Bushe Wright is good, though not particularly memorable. Donal Logue is great as the comic foil and I wish he would do more than just be the comedic relief in the occasional superhero movie.<br/><br/>The action is the real stand-out. No stuntman in the Batsuit fighting in the shadows ten feet away. Snipes is in there doing the work. It moves fast but is never confusing. There's a real sense that they are going somewhere with it, not just trying to show random cool scenes. <br/><br/>The only real problem with the movie is the ending. It's still exciting like the rest of the movie, but a little sloppy. That's because the producers made one ending that no one liked. So they quickly made another using many of the same ideas. The one they have works fine. But if they had known from the beginning, it would have flowed together better.<br/><br/>The CGI is also noticeably dated and takes you out of the movie. Luckily they don't use much of it and rely more on superior practical effects.<br/><br/>The best part is that the movie revitalized the superhero genre. Before this, there was Superman and Batman. Superman hadn't seen the screen in ten years (longer if you look at an actually good movie) and Batman & Robin had nearly killed the genre off just the year before. But notice how afterwards there has been at least one superhero a year, and now several a year. Marvel used their minor character to open the floodgates for everyone. Sure, subsequent movies have had their ups and downs. But generally speaking the quality of superhero movies has been quit good. No more nipple suits or Richard Pryor built computers.<br/><br/>The movie's exciting action sequences and exploration of vampire lore keep this an entertaining flick. Though Blade still may not be the comic book character to read, the movie is still entertaining enough on its own merits to keep it around. And at the very least it will stand as a marker for the following renaissance of comic book movies."

","Blade (1998)<br/><br/>5 word summary <br/><br/>Half Vampire battles evil vampires<br/><br/>10 years before the vampire craze took over teens and young adults across the country Vampire films were actually cool. <br/><br/>Blade is packed full of action. It has some of the coolest fight scenes and is one of the coolest vampire films made. It's not full of drawn out dialog or lame love stories like most vampire films. It does have a bit of a love story in it but it's barely noticeable. <br/><br/>As I said the fight scenes are great. The sword fights are well choreographed and when you add in disintegrating vampires with every sword swing and every silver bullet shot it looks even cooler. The effects are usually really good. When the vampires disintegrate and things like that look good but toward the end when a hand is formed from blood and some one explodes it looks terrible, which is a shame. As for the acting Wesley Snipes did great and Stephen Dorff did even better. The supporting cast did fairly well too. <br/><br/>Blade does have some problems, besides the occasional bade graphic. Some really cheesy dialog and painful attempts at catch phrases, but it worked out decent in the long run so I guess that's really what matters.<br/><br/>I don't think the plot is the most original vampire story, but it is a pretty original way of telling it. Anyone looking for a good action film should check this one out. Anyone who doesn't like the 2008 style of vampire films might also enjoy it just to see some vampires get killed. Overall a very cool film that I think most will like and many will love. <br/><br/>8/10"
"no-skyline","7","1","2","27 January 2006"," Great Character - Patchy Movie
","Blade is a quality comic book adaptation with some real visceral action and possibly the best opening sequence to any movie of this kind. I wont spoil it to much for those who haven't seen it but Blade wiping out vampires in the opening club scene is absolutely awesome. Even with the 100's of millions of dollars thrown at the likes of Spiderman, X-Men etc the effects in Blade for the most part still hold up today.<br/><br/>Of course the problem with a great opening sequence is can you build on that and top it come the end of the movie and unfortunately this is what holds Blade back from being a great movie. Wesley Snipes was made for the part of Blade both physically with his fight stunt work and in his brooding performance and thats what makes this film. Anyone else in the role is unthinkable. The problem comes when Blade isn't kicking a** the movie really slows down, also none of the action sequences really match that first adrenaline rush. The plot is mostly irrelevant there's something going on about a blood god but really who cares it's all about Blade looking cool and kicking vampire a**.<br/><br/>A quality movie for action and comic book fans that just falls short of being great 7/10"
"ajmoten","8","1","2","4 June 2005"," Blade is the man!
","Blade is a great film without the always common Gothic look. Wesley Snipes (Blade) gives a great performance. Stephen Dorff also gives a memorable performance. The beginning of the movie was very provocative whereas it started off in the real world, and after the night club scene it went into a cartoon world. The only thing that bothered me was that Blade didn't use the traditional weapons of holy water and the crucifixion. I believe that Dorff will be remembered forever as Deacon Frost, because the character was and will be more flamboyant than any other character he has or will play to date. The supporting cast was also excellent. Without a doubt Blade will always be remembered over the other two sequels (Blade II & III). Not going Gothic made this film the best anti-vampire movie in history."
"senor_goodspeed","9","1","2","20 May 2004"," One of the best action movies in recent years.
","Having just read some of the other user comments in IMDb I felt as though I had to respond with my own opinion on 'Blade'. Some comments referred to it as 'average', or 'just another vampire movie'. I totally disagree.<br/><br/>I think this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest vampire movie and one of the best action movies in the last 10 years. This is high praise indeed, but permit me to explain why...<br/><br/>It opens with one of the most original beginnings with the bloodbath club scene. This is fantastic. The use of red against the dark, eerie backdrop of the club is excellent, as is the pumping crescendo of the soundtrack. Then in steps Wesley. This is the part he was born to play. The arrogant smirk, the tough exterior, the 'do not mess with me approach', allows him to relax and enjoy playing this comic book hero to the max.<br/><br/>Stephen Dorff as Frost is also excellent. He steals the show in many of his scenes. He is cold, calculated, arrogant and evil. He is also very stylish and wears a cool shirt for most of the movie. Which brings me along to the costumes. Blade's long black leather coat, in fact all of his leather gear, along with the guns and weaponry, is original and cool. In fact, does 'The Matrix' not copy and borrow heavily from 'Blade' - which came out a year before the much acclaimed 'Matrix'? I know this is very controversial, but I really do think that 'The Matrix' owes a great deal to 'Blade'. From the costumes, to the use of wires in the fight scenes, the fighting choreography in general and a lot of the cinematography are all original in Blade, but then copied, and admittedly expanded, in the 'Matrix'. Any responses to that? Because I know that there are many die hard 'Matrix' fans out there who will be p*ssed at that, but before you lambaste me, check out both films again and then respond.<br/><br/>Oh and Blades tattoo is the coolest on film (along with George Clooney in 'From Dusk Till Dawn').<br/><br/>OK, weaknesses, there are a couple. Firstly that annoying N'Bushe Wright, with her bad acting and her annoying glances and frowns, and secondly some of the red blobby explosive globules are not brilliantly well done, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise superb film.<br/><br/>And to finish the film, the final action set piece does not disappoint. Again, Snipes is masterful as the arrogant (and a very adept martial artist) and confident Blade, as he strides around the temple kicking the crap out of everything that gets in his path. Once more, this scene is accompanied with a great tune, adding to the brilliant soundtrack.<br/><br/>This truly is a cult classic film, and one that everyone should watch."

","Dumb movies with bad dialog and writing are sometimes kinda enjoyable, but there's no sense of humor or subtle irony anywhere to be found here.

Or, if you're extremely forgiving and can ignore the terrible writing and messy shooting/editing, have at it."
"DeadpoolX","4","1","2","13 July 2003"," Lifeless
","The problem with Blade is that its star and director take the film far too seriously for its own good.  What should have been a fun action movie ends up unpleasant, meanspirited, humorless and unexciting.  Norrington's most recent effort, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, suffers the same lack of spirit.  Blade II is a better film from a better director (the talented Guillermo del Toro, who knows when to play a movie straight and when to make it simply a fun ride).<br/><br/>4/10"

","Clad in black leather body armour and armed with a variety of high tech and low tech weapons, Blade (a human-vampire hybrid with tattoos, sunglasses and an attitude) spends his nights hunting 'suck-heads' with the help of Whistler, his sidekick and armourer. His exploits are set against the background of the complex political intrigues of the vampire nation, a well organized and intricate society.<br/><br/>This movie isn't one to try to be something it's not. I'm not going to say that it doesn't have a plot (it does, and an entirely suitable one at that), but if you want high-brow drama, you're looking on the wrong shelf in the video store, amigo. Its action, gore and big-bangs right from the word go, while not stooping to the knuckle-dragging level.<br/><br/>The story in interesting enough, the SFX are seamless and impressive, and the acting doesn't seem to have any great weak points.

I hope there is a sequel."
"Tunica","Null","1","2","30 December 1998"," Total Trash
","Blade is total trash. High concept, expense trash. The script is the written version of Swiss cheese. How many plot holes does a movie need before the people pumping tens of millions of dollars into it decide it's time to rethink some thing. Wesley Snipes, usually a good actor, was dreadful as Blade. Acting like you are on a combination of Prozac and Valium does not come off like the character has a wounded soul. Blade acts like a really dull, unimaginative guy who can do only one thing well, and that is to kick ass. The Techno-Industrial music was great in the unoriginal Discos of Death scenes, but it was an awful choice in the fighting scenes. I wanted to leave the movie and go out dancing."
"Rhythm-2","10","1","2","3 December 1998"," Action and then some...

I am also an AVID vampire fan.  I would have liked the vampires to be a little more nasty but all in all, they represented well. The special effects were great and the storyline was solid.  Blade and Spawn should team up for an action movie.  The almost undead and the dead.  I'll go see that!  This movie is a great rental."
"VampMan","10","1","2","22 November 1998"," A film that rocks from start to finish and leave you pumping
","One of the greatest vampire movies, along with Interview with the Vampire. This sees 20th Century vampires not dressed as goths, and with the sound track gives a very modern feel. I have not had the pleasure of reading any of the comics, but I believe that Wesley Snipes plays an excellent Blade, it is hard sometimes to believe it's him. The whole film has the feel of the Masquerade without actually being the Masquerade and with hopes of a sequel this is by far the best film on 98. To all new viewers 'Blood bath' a happening scene and extremely explosive in speed and visuals."

My record is held by JP for 16 viewings at a cinema.  I plan to see Blade at least 20 times.<br/><br/>The sound track is awesome, combining gangsta rap, contemporary club music and rousing themes for action scenes.  The martial arts choreography was exceptional and Wesley Snipes does credit to this role as the part man, part vampire.  The array of weapons, gadgets and other useful bits of kit was stunning and a lot are used.

","I cry each night when I realize I spent 7.50 on this garbage.  And garbage it was, it was putrid, horrible, poor, enough to bring a man to tears.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes stars as ""Blade,"" a hardcore bad-boy ray-ban sunglass wearing vampire-sniper.  The first 30 minutes you are thrilled to a treat of blood lust by vampires and Blade killing them all.  When he finally speaks you are stupified by the simplicity in the mind of this vampire-hunter, all of Wesley Snipes lines are as follows.<br/><br/>""You know those vampires got one thing coming."" ""What"" a timid female voice asks. ""Me."" Blade then jumps through the glass and kills everyone, fantastic!<br/><br/>Then came his sidekick, a victim of a vampire bite that he rescued because she looked like his mother (brings tears to your eyes...).  First she's a timid scared nurse and would not hurt a small rodent.  Then after 20 minutes of being around Blades she becomes a hard-core female dog killer, and seems to be even darker than Blade by the end of the movie.  Amazing turn around for shaky nurse in a hospital.<br/><br/>Then comes Blades's hideout which is a warehouse wide open.  They might as well tacked a sign on the front door.  And when the ""evil"" Stephen Dorf finds Blade, of course the first question asked by the protaganist is, ""How did you find me!?""<br/><br/>I was utterly shocked.  Combined with lousy acting (exception on Stephen Dorf) and people blowing up like large pimples when being injected by a ""serum,""  it was horrid.  I implore you, my fellow readers of the Internet Movie Database, to turn your heads.  You won't like what you want to see.<br/><br/>In conclusion I ended up spending 7.50.  Seven dollars and fifty cents I could have donated to causes such as the Cure for AIDS, Cancer, Gingivitis, but no, I spent it on Blade.  How do I live with myself?  I shall never know."

Hello?!  La Magra is/was a *god* and Blade is just a half-breed ""daywalker.""  Shouldn't La Magra have just wiped the floor with this guy?  Even for a movie based on a comic book, that's a bit much.<br/><br/>I gave this a 5 out of 10.  Pretty average fare, and plenty of gore.

In brief, upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by Blade, half-human, half-vampire, all annoying. It all climaxes with Blade being put in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968.<br/><br/>Blade has to be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation, perhaps there is a trend here?). Surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the 'hero'? And whilst a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not true of Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys.<br/><br/>I assume that Wesley Snipes has an 'acting' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably. As he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave. <br/><br/>As a piece of narcissism, Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever. Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff *CAN* act, but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes' tedious performance.<br/><br/>Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair.<br/><br/>
Why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again.<br/><br/>To finish, there *IS* a Grace Jones vampire movie, it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this."

This is old news for people who are familiar with action flicks from Hong Kong.  The highlight of this movie is its action scenes. However, a good martial arts choreographer does not make the movie.  How about the rest?  I personally think Blade is a stinker. The storyline is bad, but the editing is the worst.

The movie _is_ gross, but if you're up for blood and gore you'll like this film. This movie dispels the romanticism of other vampire films, and has some very original ideas. There are some unanswered questions by the end of the movie, but it's great that this isn't a movie where every single shot and scene has to do with the plot. I only wish there was a different ending. Fight scenes are good, especially the last one. 10/10"
"pendrell-2","3","1","2","25 December 1999"," A bad case of glorifying Genocide
","Here is a film called BLADE. The story follows as such. A woman is bitten by a vampire and is pregnant. She is rushed to hospital where her son is saved and grows up to be Blade. He is a half vampire who goes around killing all sorts of vampires and vampires lackeys, meanwhile trying to find a better serum to contain his vampiric tendencies. He has a older mentor (played by Kris Kristofferson) who makes all his weapons for him, a female sidekick who he rescued and is now confronted by an evil vampire called played by stephen dorff. Who wishes to bring about the end of the world and *spoiler* needs Blades blood to do it. I was given this film for Christmas and was willing to give it a go, as I love movies of all types and have always loved the driven hero action films. When the film opens up with a techno dance scene involving sprinklers with blood I thought I would be in for a treat. I was wrong after this scene which kicks things off really well, everyone shows their true natures. Kristofferson has forgotten how to act, and it feels like you have seen a better version of him in many other movies. Wesley Snipes doesnt get past his costume or his first scene. A one note performance all throughout the film. He isnt even cool as an action hero (Batman, Bruce Lee) and doesnt have that driven desire for revenge (Conan, Robocop, Crow) to make you want him to attack the baddies and watching the movie it is obvious that if he didnt have vampires to kill he wouldnt have anything else to do. Thats all there is to his Character. The vampires are not evil and nasty or even very stylish. They are just the chosen form for the hero to go up against. Dont get me wrong I love action movies and mindless films. But this was missing all that makes action films great. The details that good movies always know about and have. That is a driving motivation for the lead character, a reason to relate to them and root for them as they kill the enemy. It also needs an understanding of action movies. The metaphor (not a deep one) for action films is that good will triumph over evil. This film doesnt have it.<br/><br/>This film is just a showcase for violence. Why do you go for Blade??? Because he is seeking revenge for a tortured past??? NO Because he is driven by a moral obligation to make the world better??? No. Its because he has a cool jacket and sunglasses, and knows martial arts. The violence in this film is not intense or graphic. Or even disturbing/unsettling in the least. What it is, is frequent and empty. To boil it all down the plot is. One man attempting to kill a whole race because he knows they are evil and should be killed. Not being subtle but I think Hitler thought the same way. Without any motivation for the violence it just becomes a way for the filmakers to entertain you. While the editing in this film is great, and the cinematography is being inventive, in the end it is just a director who does not understand the genre he is doing and isnt good enough to break out a new one. The script is predictable and doesnt even get ""The Heroes Journey"" right. The dialogue is aweful and stilted and wiith all this considered the only way left for the main characters to express what they are like is through their acts of violence!!! Blade is a cool good guy because he has a cool sword and does flashy martial arts. Robocop was also violent but the main character had a personality and you know he wouldnt want to kill anyone if the bad guys hadnt killed him and werent trying to destroy the city. Blase likes killing vampires, he likes killing people who align themselves with vampires. He trains so he can beat up vampire servants real good. The main point of this film is to show Violence (and possibly genocide) in a cool and fashionable way without any motivation behind it. Senseless violence for a pointless movie. What I am trying to say is that violence in films can be justified (and good) but this is just a showcase for violence as entertainment, Dont watch Blade. Its bad. Even the special effects are about as unimpressive as you could get!!!"

","Well I think that Blade rocks! I'm a fan of ""splattermovies"" and this one is not bad in that prospect. It's full of cool scenes and the soundtrack is.. fantastic. I just love the discoscene in the beginning..  in fact.. I bought the movie mostly because of it. =) It's one of the best scenes ever made and the music does a lot. (New Order - Confusion .Pump Panel Reconstruction.) I'll say that Blade is a must see!"
"action-6","10","1","2","17 December 1999"," A superb movie!!
","Blade is one of the best action-films ever made.  Wesley Snipes plays Blade, who is 1/2 human, 1/2 vampire.  Blade is able to walk outside at daytime(he is therefore called ""Daywalker), and garlic & silver has no effect on him. He has got the strenght of a vampire, but he has also got the thirst for blood from the vampires.  To supress his thirst for blood, Blade uses a special serum. The first thing you`ll see in this movie is a woman, who is giving birth to a boy.  The woman has been bitten by a vampire, she dies, but the doctors are able to save her baby, Blade. Soon there is a party in a vampire-nightclub, Blade enters it and begins killing the vampires.  The action- and fight-scenes in this movie are incredibly well directed and cool to watch, the soundtrack is very suitable for this movie, and Wesley Snipes is perfect in the role as Blade.  Blade is a modern adventure, and takes place in an urban environment, instead of the rural environment that most vampire-movies takes place in. Don`t let the vampire-theme put you off this movie, because Blade is first of all an action-film. This is the best movie-based-on-comic film ever!!! 10/10"
"WilsonLau","10","1","2","30 October 1999"," Good give
","This movie was excellent and shows that Wesley Snipes is amongst the best actors of this decade. The film is non stop action, very detailed. The only beefs I had with it was that the vampires disintegrated after Blade killed them and that the martial arts scenes were hard to see. I would much rather see the corpses of the vampires, its more realistic. This guy is none stop action! I'd like to see him in a movie with another action king, Dolph Lundgren. These two guys would make the perfect duo in a martial arts movie!!"

"GT77","10","1","2","7 September 1999"," Excellent!
","I think Blade is the best vampire movie I have ever seen because it is not just one guy with a stake in his hands and killing one vampire.  This is what makes it different from other stereotype vampire movies.  I was reading some other comments, people were saying Blade is a killing machine etc., well, there is more than one vampire to kill, so if every vampire fights like Bruce Lee and uses sword like a samurai, then the movie just might take a long time to finish.. Personally, I enjoyed it very much and I can't wait to see Blade 2, which is suppose to come out in August 2000."
"Cross18","10","1","2","6 September 1999"," Fast paced and one helluva good time
","THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!  Wesley Snipes is sensational as Blade, a half human-half vampire hero who's quest it is to rid the world of the blood sucking demons. Stephen Dorff is equally compelling as Deacon Frost, Blade's arch Nemesis. The action sequences are electrifying, and the soundtrack is awesome.  In my humble opinion, this is the best film ever created."

","We all must admit that 'Blade' is not a good film, but at least is funny to see. It has a very good soundtrack, and the start of the film, in the disco with the vampires, the song 'New order' playing as loud as possible, blood everywhere and Wesley jumping and using his katana is really cool, but the rest of the film gets boring and boring. Just see the first ten minutes, and you'll know what is excitement!!"
"Jc-101","10","1","2","10 August 1999"," Very well done
","I was SO skeptical about seeing this movie, I expected it to be a lame action flick. Instead it turned out to have an ACTUAL plot! It reminded me in certain ways of the Crow. Very unique in it's cinematography as well as the action scenes. Once again I must say ""It's nice to see a film with violence in which the violence is truly justified"" similar to what Brandon Lee said about the Crow :) I really hope Blade 2 won't turn out to be a COA aka Crow2 type of thing. BTW I believe Blade 2 will also bring the character Morbeus into the film. It says he will be teaming up with another vampire so don't be surprised if it's Morbeus."
"Primtime","5","1","2","11 August 1999"," The usual action film
","Blade introduces few new ideas as far as an action film goes. This film produces a lot of blood and violence, the usual predictable ending and a very thin plot. Some have compared this film to Spawn which is much worse and could even make this film look good.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes plays this role with little emotion, a cold killer with the advantages of being half-vampire, half-human and none of the disadvantages that go with either. I never really cared for Blade or his mentour and couldn't really get behind any of the vampires either. Without anyone to endorse, this film is nothing more than a 120 minute special-effects-filled trailer.<br/><br/>I must note that a sequel is being made to tie up the loose ends left by this film. However, after watching this film, I can't see why anyone would even care about a sequal. Even fans of the comic book must be disappointed by this effort.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film as a rental for an evening when there is really nothing to do. Don't make a point of renting this film if you are looking for a story, because there simply isn't one here.<br/><br/>5/10 stars."

When I saw it, it instantly became my favorite movie, now, it's a tie with Matrix (the best movie of '99 yet, and probably to come).  Snipes is great in this movie. The story is also well done - if you can,  see it on DVD and check out all the extras, 2hrs + of additional information.  Very cool.  If you love action, lycanthropes, & martial arts, you should love this movie."
"Meredith-7","5","1","2","23 July 1999"," Far too graphic, but it has a nice look
","I dont think much of Blade as a film, it was not particularly entertaining, and it certainly did not add anything new to the cinema world, or the tale of vampires for that matter.  It has a very modern, cool look to it.  Blade has a nice costume and some extra special weapons which he puts to good use. But some of the violence was a bit too graphic, and unnecessary.  The story itself is quite stupid and Dorff is really annoying as the evil vampire, although not quite as annoying as his bimbo blonde side kick who really should take some acting lessons.  I was just really bored by the whole experience.  A total waste of money and time, but it could have been so much better."

","I came to ""Blade"" hoping for a super gory, scary, action packed escapist action/horror film. It tried so hard to be that but it failed on all counts. The gore was severely lacking, reviews have said it has EXTREME gore but there wasnt anything for than cheesy, fake computer animated gore. It wasnt gross even, it was boring. The action scenes were pretty exciting (especially the first one at rave) but they were all very similar and the stupid vampires disintegrated into ash avoiding any kind of body piling. The vampires weren't scary, they were just kind of crude. The plot was obviously lacking, I won't give anything I away but there is one MAJOR hole involving what the vampires will eat. Anyways, it's worth seeing if you REALLY like the comic book or these kind of films, but if you are just in the mood to see an action/horror film, avoid it, rent Starship Troopers or something."

The thing blade has is style, bags of it. The director combines great cinematography sound effects and music to give an excellent sense of atmosphere. For once someone has used fast cutting to good effect and not made scenes confusing a la Michael Bay. Of the few flaws is the short fight with frost which has an excellent build up but should have lasted 5 minutes more and should have given frost a more imposing form, after all he supposed to be a god!

The later action scenes are too chaotic and poorly edited... can't they leave the camera in one place for more than a millisecond? The CG effects looked like just that... CG effects.

If you like action and getting a rush now and then, then you must see this movie.

This film takes a cult comic and provides a movie which does not stray from the origin's plot too much and has a very credible script for an action movie. Wesley Snipes is excellent as Blade and conveys the sense of torment that would be felt by such a character without overdoing it, I must admit that I didn't expect Stephen Dorff to make such a convincing nemesis but was pleasantly surprised by the way he adapted to the part. I would recommend this as a 'must see' film, and I am greatly looking forward to a sequel."

"Uriah43","5","2","8","9 October 2012"," An Average Movie
","Originally, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The plot was too predictable, the script was elementary and the special effects were downright laughable. But that was the only thing ""laughable"" as there was absolutely no humor in this film either. Likewise, the acting was slightly below average as well. Wesley Snipes (playing the vampire hunter ""Blade"") appeared to be ""overacting"" while the rest of the cast's performance seemed routine and colorless. So, basically what I saw was a film consisting primarily of gunfire, action and martial arts. Nothing more than that really. Obviously, some people really like an action movie that has these elements. In this case, quite a few people must have liked it because it won the ASCAP Award for ""Top Box Office Film"" in 1999. But that doesn't necessarily ""prove"" it was a ""great"" movie. All that really means is that a lot of people went to see it. And that's fine. Similarly, Wesley Snipes won the 1999 Blockbuster Entertainment Award for ""Best Actor--Horror"" for this film as well. In all honesty though, I didn't see much ""horror"" in this vampire picture to really get excited about. Again, just gunfire, action and martial arts. To be fair though, there is a growing number of vampire movies made these days that place a greater emphasis on action instead of horror. But, the difference between a ""great"" movie and one that is just ""average"" in this regard is the quality of the acting. And like I said previously, the acting wasn't that good. Now, that is not to say that this was a ""bad"" film by any means. People who like action movies will probably love this one. However, if you're looking for a good horror movie then it might be best to look elsewhere. In short, this was an average movie all the way. Nothing more and nothing less."

It would have been nice if Blade himself would have had more of a character. He literally is just a ""Tough Guy"" who broods all the time. I do enjoy the action in the movie and the different views of how a vampire can be hurt or their abilities they wield. Since every show has a different opinion on the vampire, it's always entertaining to see the differences."

Its nineties stylings only occasionally come close to cheesy and its relatively generic plot isn't quite so much 'seen it before' as 'I can tell where it's going to go', but the hyper-energetic action set-pieces and confidently laid-back spirit are infectious in a surprising way. 7/10"

","Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire who makes it his personal mission to rid society of vampires (who live in the underworld, but move freely with 'human society'). Blade is assisted in his mission by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who has raised Blade since he was a teenager and Karen (N'Bushe Wright) whom Blade rescued shortly after she has been attacked by a vampire. Blade learns that the vampires are plotting something that could prove catastrophic to the human race and with the help of his small team he sets about trying to stop the vampires.<br/><br/>Blade is just one of those films that is just pure fun from start to finish; it's chocked full of impressively choreographed fight sequences, incredible special effects, quick editing (which admittedly looks a bit choppy at times). Whilst it is a fun film, the plot and tone mostly remain dark (meaning that it's a film that's fun, but in a way where it can still be taken seriously rather than being fun in a dumb way). The special effects are impressive and whilst, arguably, they may still be the star of the show director Stephen Norrington does still allow room for the story to breathe - the character of Blade is given some depth and never remains one dimensional. The story is a little bit silly and many of the antagonists are more cartoon-like than menacing but in a film that's this much fun it never really matters and the film still remains enjoyable (as long as you know what to expect from it).<br/><br/>As well as the Matrix-style fight choreography and impressive special effects the film also benefits from a good performance from Snipes; here he's able to effortlessly switch between delivering dialogue in bad-ass serious fashion to kicking a load of ass and delivering one liners in a typical 'tongue-in-cheek' manner. The supporting cast are all fairly good, but it's only really Stephen Dorff & Kris Kristofferson who are any sort of match for Snipes.<br/><br/>I can't deny that Blade is not likely to appeal to all audiences - it is pretty violent and gory and the Matrix-style fight sequences and OTT special effects won't meet with approval from everyone. However, I happen to like these things and coupling these things with a reasonable story (it isn't a brilliant one however) and a rather 'knowing' performance from Snipes it all equates to 2 hours of unpretentious fun."
"PredragReviews","7","1","3","12 May 2016"," Half-Human, Half-Vampire, All Hunter...
","""Blade"" could have been yet another overblown blockbuster, but it differs in that its relentless nature builds excitement rather than smacking of desperate CGI-laced attempts to keep the audience interested. Wesley Snipes plays the ultra cool hero and you definitely root for him. Although it seems that sometimes he tries too hard at being a hero but most of the time he succeeds. What makes Stephen Dorff's character scary is his intelligence, which is expressed beautifully in the actor's eyes. He is probably one of the most convincing comic villains since Jack Nicholson in Batman. The acting is pretty run of the mill for the most part, with the standout acting being done by Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, spoiled brat and complete maniac (and vampire of course) and Udo Kier (even though he isn't in the movie for more than 5 minutes total) as Dragonetti, the head of the pure blood vampires. While Frost isn't your typical buff, brawny villain, he makes up for his conscipicous scrawniness with his intelligence and ruthlesness As I first saw it, the images blew me away. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and shot and there's a really stylish atmosphere to it. The industrial soundtrack adds to the rhythmic editing and accelerates the fights. The special effects are somewhat weak, but this is a glossy B-Movie and that is part of the fun it provides. As I saw the brilliant ""Matrix"" one year later I realized that some shots seemed very familiar to Blade. The sardonic nature of the movie is further enhanced by the ability of the characters to poke fun at the ludicrous nature of the hyper-intense fights that propel Blade in his quest to rid the world of vampires. It's a journey that's enjoyably involving, despite the frenetic pace, and that's a rarity with any action blockbuster.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7 out of 10."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","3","24 November 2015"," Full-blooded vampire action
","One of those films which is best to see at the cinema, due to the visual impact of the film in the many special effects and choreographed fight scenes within it. Forget watching LITTLE VOICE or some other film like that at the cinema, you don't lose anything when you see it on TV. When watching these kind of special effect epics, you simply have to be at the cinema. And I was. Myself and a friend had a choice between this, the PSYCHO remake, LITTLE VOICE or MEET JOE BLACK. And I'm glad we picked this one, as none of the others are as entertaining as this one was.<br/><br/>For a start it's an adult tale, so expect gritty realism (bones breaking, frequent swearing, etc.) and Snipes gave us some actual insight into his role as the vampire hunter, instead of being another po-faced action hero. Here he is, torn between his human and vampire instincts. So I was impressed with his skills here. The other nod goes to Kris Kristofferson (FIRE DOWN BELOW), who plays an old, limping mercenary with great skill. Aside from a Udo Kier cameo, the rest of the cast is full of fresh, unfamiliar but unblemished faces we are used to seeing in DAWSON'S CREEK and the rest of those boring American TV shows. Stephen Dorff is Frost, the big baddie vampire of them all. He's not much of an actor, but he remains suitably evil.<br/><br/>The film has many artistic scenes of blood dripping, guns dropping, all in slow motion as if they mean something. It certainly looks impressive, even if deep down it all means nothing apart from holding the audience's interest. Indeed this film is shallow, but it's so enjoyable that doesn't matter. The special effects are, predictably, the main star of the show, and they're in abundance. My record for ""most deaths in a film seen in the cinema"" was previously STARSHIP TROOPERS but this one overtakes it by miles. We've got impalings, decapitations, shootings, cuttings, burnings, meltings and even explodings (probably the most disgusting effect here). The audience was wincing and going ""oh my God"" at some of these effects so they obviously did work. Some of the effects look a bit computerised for my liking (especially the gargoyle-skeleton things which look like they were a cheap effect from an episode of XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS). As the film is an action-horror flick, there are also a lot of fight scenes, and these are handled with such ferocity, skill and speed that they cannot fail to impress. Blade fights loads of vampires off at a time, getting punched and beaten but always fighting back.<br/><br/>The film also has a lot of interesting ideas about vampirism, and we learn about their society. Along with that is scientific analysis of the vampire virus, familiars who are the vampire's slaves and many other concepts. When the long-awaited SFX climax arrives it is slightly disappointing, but entertaining nonetheless. Blood literally burst on to our screens. There were a lot of references to other films (RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula to name but two) and a lot of the film was clichéd, but it was fun cliché. However the violence is numbing and excessive so it's not for the weak of heart. If you're an action fan, then it's probably worth your seeing."

","As a property, Blade easily lends itself to the big screen. He's got the vigilantism of Batman, Punisher's hatred and brutality, killer fighting moves, and the best parts of vampires without their weaknesses. He's just such a great character. And Wesley Snipes owns this rile, bringing distinct badass cachet to the party. He makes a vicious beatdown so bloody fun.<br/><br/>It seems like this is where Marvel got its shít together after a string of misfires (""Captain America"", ""The Punisher"", Corman's ""Fantastic Four""). Finally, a movie that takes its source material seriously with a capable action director and an effects budget (for '98). The vampires are refreshingly non-emo and they even throw in some realism without going overboard (vampirism as a blood disorder was novel). To top that off, there's a literal bloodbath. It's very '90s, but still leaves its mark. The pieces just come together here so well.<br/><br/>7/10"
"iconic-sr","7","1","3","19 September 2014"," Blade: A True Vampire Slayer
","Brief Overview: The movie I am reviewing is Blade which was released in 1998 and is really the first major Marvel film to hit the big screen. Blade is a human/vampire hybrid who takes it upon himself to eliminate the vampire ""species."" For the time this movie was made I believe it is a really good film, and still is a must watch for comic book fans.<br/><br/>The Positives: The first thing I really liked about the film is the actor who plays Blade. Wesley Snipes is perfect for this role; he goes through the film showing almost no emotion which perfectly portrays the vibe given off by the character in the comic books. The rapid fire, intense action sequences is the real pinnacle for the film. It's really fun watching Blade take on 20 vampires at a time in a highly complex style of fighting. This flick will definitely keep the attention of the general audience.<br/><br/>The Negatives: I had several issues with the 1998 Blade, but none were so severe that I would not recommend this movie. At times, the acting was a little overdone and the CGI was cheesy, but you must keep in mind when this film came out. Also, there was way too many needles in this movie; at times I was wondering, ""Is this a super-hero movie or a film about some advances in virus vaccinations?"" (No, in all seriousness, it really isn't an issue, unless you have a phobia of needles. If so, proceed with caution!) And the last problem I had is the story line. It wasn't really that bad per se, but it just wasn't a very intriguing angle.<br/><br/>The Conclusion: If you like vampires (or hate vampires), enjoy high intensity action sequences, sword fighting, blood and gore or just a comic book movie fan, this is a must-watch movie. I highly recommend this movie."
"Dastari-1","9","1","3","25 October 2008"," ""The world you live in is a sugar-coated topping. There is another world - beneath it...""
","Up until 1998 comic book movies were a joke. Sometimes they had some campy charm and were marginal successes but aside from the Michael Keaton Batman film in 1989 none of them had been all of that good and even its sequels were very poor. Marvel had a particularly hard time releasing its products to film and its two successes up to 1998, The Punisher and Captain America, were so bad that even fans of the characters felt the need to apologize for them.<br/><br/>Into this mix came Blade, a much lesser known character than previous Marvel and DC attempts to make movies about their characters but in a way that helped. Writer David Goyer and Director Stephen Norrington were able to tell the story that they wanted to tell without having to pay homage to 25 years of comic book history. In fact the movie deviates greatly from the Marvel version of Blade's origin and his powers.<br/><br/>This movie was a success for several reasons. First, it took the story seriously. Blade wasn't a campy super-hero who had hilarious misadventures. The movie is serious from the opening moments when a man who thought that he was being picked up by a hot woman and taken to a party finds out that he's really the appetizer at a vampire rave. While certain elements like the character of Quinn lighten specific moments the characters always act as if the danger and the situations are real.<br/><br/>Second, the movie is an action movie rather than a horror movie. Vampires have almost always been placed in the horror mold. The genius of Blade is to depict vampires more as members of a kind of mafia rather than as the creatures that live in solitary mansions and prey on hapless virgins. The horror and fear are there. Norrington does a tremendous job in presenting a world to us in which creatures skulk around in the dark and the script describes a world that most of us are unaware of but influences our lives on a daily basis. However, even with these elements we are in full action mode as Blade takes on this mafia with all of the weapons at his disposal and his knowledge of martial arts. The fighting is done so well that you even let our cheers as Blade dispatches his foes in spectacular style. Many of the things that the Matrix would take credit for, such as bullet time and the idea that the world that we live in is an illusion (although this is a little more literal in Matrix), were developed in Blade first and usually with far more skill and style.<br/><br/>Third, there is an emphasis on character here that shouldn't be taken for granted. Most superhero movies are obsessed with action to the point that characters simply don't have time to grow. That isn't so here. The tragedy of Blade's life is presented to us and then further developed as we see how Blade being a man that fits into neither world can't live with vampires and that the relationships that he establishes with humans can never last. Deacon Frost is also developed well as his relationships with Quinn, Karen, and Dragonetti develop him to show that he is the complete antithesis of Blade: A hedonist that cares only about fomenting chaos and gratifying his own desires.<br/><br/>Finally, there's a wonderful synergy from all involved. The actors give great performances. Wesley Snipes is the gruff hero with just enough sass to deliver some witty lines to break the tension in some dramatic scenes. Kris Kristofferson plays the father figure and elder hero who has to die to give way to the younger generation. His obvious love for Blade comes through the subtleties of the performance rather than any overt dialog. Stephen Dorff is fantastic as Deacon Frost who wants nothing more than to gratify his own desires and to be restrained by no one. His casual disdain of everyone around him except when he wants something shows the kind of character that he is. Then we have some great direction from Norrington who has the world move around us with time lapse photography when we aren't looking and gives the impression of things hidden all around. Turning up the brightness during the daylight helps to showcase how foreign that world is once you've been steeped in Blade's nighttime world. The script is a top-notch Goyer contribution. As usual with Goyer everything that is introduced has a purpose and all of the elements join together by the end of the movie so that everything from Blade's mom to comments about whether or not Karen will turn, to the biting of Dr Webb all come back when they will have maximum story impact.<br/><br/>If the story has any flaws it is that Deacon's idea to turn everyone into vampires makes no sense unless you assume that he is so interested in fomenting chaos that he would like to see a world full of vampires who feed on each other but this is never stated on screen and it would have been nice if there was some dialog for it. The other problem is that La Magra is a bit of a disappointment once it appears. After building up to this since the midway point of the movie you expect something more than what you see but this is one of those things that you don't really think about until after your first viewing when you're thinking back on the movie.<br/><br/>Many movies like the Matrix, Daredevil, and the X-Men trilogy probably would have never been made or would have been radically different if it wasn't for the cult success of Blade and the techniques that it pioneered. Give it a try as a must-see movie experience if you are either a fan of comics or any of the aforementioned movies."
"g-is-for-gluggermuffin","8","1","3","24 October 2008"," An awesome movie about vampires with lots of violence and action. What more could you want?
","Although my sister refuses to watch this movie because Blade is a 'wussy' vampire because he refuses to feed off humans, I absolutely love it and kind of find it a shame that there are only three of them. I love vampires, and as a result, i love this movie, however even if i hated vampires with all my guts i'm sure i would still enjoy this movie. In all likeliness i probably would, considering it is about killing vampires. Blade is a great movie because it never makes you bored; not for a second. You're always watching enthusiastically, wishing it will never end, enthralled by the epic dialogue and storyline. And violence. And if you think the faint-hearted would hate this movie because it has violence and heads flying in every direction, think again, for when people die in this movie they turn into ash, not blood. Besides, old people might find this movie gets them excited and in the mood for action. Unlikely, but possible."

","Where have you gone Stephen Norrington? This film oozes with talent. LXG despite it's flaws and studio interferences shows his talent as well. The jumping scene from the hospital window to the roof and bullet time were both done here before the matrix in 1999. I hate it when film makers like Norrington and James Cameron go years and years with out making films. Life is short and should be lived but in between make some darn films. They're great action directors and we need more films from you two. Through Domenic Sena into that category as a director who showed promise and then disappeared. I know the studios system must be a nightmare and Sean Connery dissed you but get over it and make movies. Show the studios and Connery how great a director you are. Blade has a good story and great action scenes. It's by far and away the best action film Snipes ever made. The sequels including Del Toro's Blade 2 pale in comparison. The vampires are sexy, regenerate, kick ass and disintergrate when blade wipes them out. An action film with a touch of horror thrown in and a true classic. Blade also was the restart of the comic book stampede that we see today in films. Blade showed that lesser known comics could appeal to the masses and that well known comics could be action oriented with out camp. Blade led us from Batman and Robin to Batman Dark Knight which was co-written by Blade writer David Goyer who also directed and wrote Blade trinity which is no Blade but still entertaining and also wrote Del Toro's Blade 2.<br/><br/>Whether it's on DVD or cable don't miss the chance to catch Blade or see it again. An action/vampire fighting classic!"

Wesley Snipes (perfect piece of casting) is Blade, a much troubled superhero (aren't they all?), he has to take a formula suppressant to keep away his inner vampire cravings. Aided by trusty pal, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), they wage war against all blood suckers and here they must stop the sinister Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) from executing his monstrous plan.<br/><br/>There are no cranial pondering's here in this piece, this is a joyously high velocity action horror movie, containing great choreography and retaining its comic book heart. Blade is pure popcorn fodder for the MTV generation, in fact director Stephen Norrington utilises his music video background to great effect as the combat scenes are scored with delightful sledgehammer precision. Blood brains and gore flow freely as the film hurtles towards the head splitting conclusion, loud, dark and tinged with brooding menace, Blade is hugely recommended for a ripper of a night in. 7.5/10"
"marksnakehandler","10","1","3","6 July 2008"," """"BLADE"" is still the finest vampire film I have ever seen.."" - Tom Millan ""Kindred Gem Films 1998""
","Now I have viewed many styles of vampire films. Some of them leaned more towards the horror side, while others leaned towards action and others towards drama. Before ""Blade"" premiered on August 21st of 1998, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was the ultimate revolutionary vampire movie of the 1990's. It made ""Interview With The Vampire"" look like a ""church choir sit in""/ ""vampire chick flick""- which, by the way, was a drag to watch. Once I saw ""Blade"", I knew fully well that this film, never mind the sequels, had a strong and solid place on my top ten list of ""Best Movies Of All Time"". <br/><br/>Director Stephen Norrington does a stupendous and extra ordinary job of weaving and orchestrating the choreography within this vampire action horror. All of the acting by Snipes, Kristofferson, Dorff and countless others was well done. Wesley Snipes plays a half man/ half vampire who is known as a ""Day Walker"" because he can function not only nocturnally, but during daylight hours unlike the any other vampire. He became this due to the fact that his pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire before giving birth. She died of course but the infant was already infected. Blade was then born into this world and later trained by a cancer ridden smoker Abraham Whistler, played by Kris Kristofferson. Whistler, apparently had battled vampires long before his encounter with Blade. Therefore when he discovers Blade's unique and extra ordinary abilities he mentors him and trains him in martial arts and a vast array of weaponry to create the ultimate vampire slaying machine.<br/><br/>Stephen Dorff plays Deacon Frost, a young and over zealous vampire with a huge chip on his shoulder. He is in disarray with an occult society of vampires who exist underground as a board of directors to somehow integrate with human society- as a tolerant perspective. Of course Frost creates a rebellion to overthrow this ""tolerant"" vampire government of dullards in suits. Frost believes that a prophecy of a vampire god will come as expected and cause havoc everywhere thus violently pulverizing whatever he can to make the prophecy. Frost wishes to become this blood god. <br/><br/>The original score and music in this feature all fit into the right spot. From beginning to end this film is packed with fancy camera shots and excellent editing. The action is ""in your face"" and ""straight to the point"". It's quick, fast and visceral in some sections. I still maintain that ""Blade"" is the finest and most revolutionary vampire film ever made. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" would be my second choice. Never mind the sequels to ""Blade"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Even though I gave ""Blade"" a top rating and ""Blade II"" a 9 out of 10 (4 1/2 stars of 5) the third ""Blade"" was a 0 (no stars). Don't even get me started on ""Blade III"" or ""Blade Trinity"". All I'll say is that it should have been called ""Blade Zero"".<br/><br/>""Blade"" gets 5 stars of 5."
"zardoz-13","9","1","3","26 June 2008"," The Best Thing to Happen to Vampire Movies Since ""Dracula""
","Actor & producer Wesley Snipes may have finally found himself an action movie franchise that he can sink his teeth into with British director Stephen Norrington's ""Blade,"" a well-made, imaginative, adrenaline-laced vampire chiller based on the Marvel Comics' super hero. Snipes heads a first-rate cast that includes Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Dorff, N' Bushe Wright, Udo Kier, and Traci Lords. ""Blade"" synthesizes the exotic swordplay of the ""Highlander"" epics, the double-digit body count of a John Woo thriller, and the martial arts pandemonium of a Jackie Chan opus to spawn a horror movie several cuts above your ordinary vampire fare. If the sight of blood, especially torrents of bogus blood, turns your stomach, avoid ""Blade."" ""Blade"" takes its cues from renegade vampire sags like Robert Rodriguez's ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) and Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"" (1987) rather than those venerable classics such as either Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" (1931) with Bela Lugosi or Neil Jordan's ""Interview with a Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" with Tom Cruise (1994). The Snipes hero must have chose the same guy who tailored ""Mad Max"" and ""The Terminator"" in what essentially constitutes an apocalyptic version of Fran Rubel Kuzui's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1992). ""Blade"" qualifies as a tour-de-fang chiller with darker humor than ""Buffy,"" top drawer special effects, and an infectious techno-pop soundtrack. Lowbrow escapism that it ranks as, ""Blade"" benefits chiefly from scenarist David S. Goyer's solid, seasoned writing skills and atmospheric, innovative helming by sophomore director Stephen Norrington.<br/><br/>Scenarist David S. Goyer provides an invigorating screenplay. ""Blade"" bristles not only with lively action and adventure, but also an intelligible plot that the characters go to extreme lengths of describe and discuss. When you consider that Goyer has penned scripts for ""Dark City,"" ""The Crow 2: City of Angels,"" ""Robert Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,"" ""Demonic Toys,"" and ""Kickboxer 2,"" then you know he qualified as the ideal choice to pen the script. Goyer's revenge fantasy script never leaves you in the dark about a bloody new world where its embattled but immortal hero Blade wages a perennial war against vampires. Goyer shows impressive flexibility in co-opting vampire mythology. At one point, a half-blooded vampire smears on sun screen lotion to shield himself from the sun. Jealous vampires put one of their vampire enemies to death by gradually exposing him to sunlight at dawn. Meanwhile, our hero uses an ultra-violet light to singe unruly fangsters. About the only vampire trait neglected by Goyer is the ability to shape-shift into a bat.<br/><br/>A vampire infected our protagonist's pregnant mom, Vanessa Brooke (Sanaa Lathan of ""Love & Basketball"") with its venomous blood while she was carrying Blade in her womb. Delivered by Caesarean section from his dying mother, Blade emerges as neither totally human nor truly vampire. He can walk in sunlight without risk, and neither silver nor garlic can faze him. One villainous vampire admires Blade when he observes that Blade has ""all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses."" The filmmakers milk dramatic tension from Blade's growing tolerance to Whistler's (Kris Kristofferson of ""Convoy"") anti-venom serum. The chance that Blade may not revert to his vampire origins not only lurks in the background but also enhances the suspense. This element of uncertainty generates anxiety and endows the protagonist with an Achilles' heel that makes him seem more believable and charismatic. Blade cruises around in a black 1968 Dodge Charger.<br/><br/>Legendary vampire hunter Abraham Whistler found Blade as a juvenile roaming the streets and living off the blood of derelicts. Transforming Blade into a super hero with injections of a blood substitute, he serves as Blade's stepfather and ordnance maker. Surprisingly, Whistler lasts longer than most sacrificial characters. Loosely modeled on the Roman god Vulcan who forged weapons for the deities, Whistler trains Blade to slay vampires with extreme prejudice. Blade approaches his crusade with the enthusiasm that Charles Bronson mustered for killing muggers in the quintet of ""Death Wish"" movies. Not surprisingly, more than enough vampires survive from other parts of the world for Blade to combat in the sequels. Wow, does ""Blade"" ever leave itself wide open in its wrap-up in Russia for a sequel! Anyhow, the vampires in ""Blade"" are not tooth fairies. Organized into a powerful, global underground syndicate, Dragonetti (Udo Kier) presides over them as a Corleonesque godfather. The scene in the shadowy conference room with vampires dressed in suits is effectively creepy. Kier's Dragonetti is a pure-blooded fangster in a world of full and half-blooded vampires. <br/><br/>In ""Blade,"" the cities of the world have been practically undermined by vampires. Vampires have gained leverage in the business and politician arenas. These vampires own the police so they control the law. As the snotty, upstart Deacon Frost, actor Stephen Dorff plays the half-breed vampire who Dragonetti turned. Frost harbors greater ambitions than Dragonetti. The elder vampire prefers to co-exist with mortals and abide by their treaties. Frost demands that the vampires dominate humanity. Secretly, Frost has been translating the ancient vampire text, The Book of Erebus, which will enable him to resurrect vampire blood god La Magra. Frost wants to revive this demon, but he needs the missing link: Blade's blood. Frost calls Blade ""day-walker,"" because the vampire bible has prophesied Blade's unique genetic make-up. If he can revive this blood god, Frost can control the House of Erebus that rules the undead, and vampires can emerge as the dominant force in the world. The splashy finale in a phantasmagoric vampire temple with skeletons bursting out of the mouths of vampires in a storm of jagged lightning bolts owes a little to ""The Fifth Element"" as well as ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" (1958), but this scene is fully and logically integrated in Goyer's script.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Blade"" amounts to nothing more than bloody pulp fiction. Nevertheless, Goyer and Norrington have reinvented vampire thrillers. ""Blade"" is entertaining, somewhat cheesy, but technically proficient hokum done with considerable technical prowess. Congratulations Stan Lee!"

Too much gore tends to desensitize you after a bit and the shock value tends to be lost. And thank God someone finally killed off the Traci Lords character, a major irritation from the beginning. Other than that, I thought the production was well done, and Wesley Snipes was at his very best. Kris Kristofferson also performed well, as did Steven Dorff. I would like to have seen more film time time for Udo Keir, who is a true horror icon. The concept of branded human ""cattle"" as familiars was also an interesting twist. <br/><br/>One mistake that I noticed. In the scene where the twelve are gathered in the temple Raquel destroys one of the twelve with a sword. But when the ceremony begins to change Deacon Frost into La Magra there are still twelve vampire clan leaders. Where did the extra leader come from?

","Awesome. Awesome. AWESOME. This film should make Marvel proud that people still want to turn their comic books into movies. It's dark, atmospheric, fast-paced, well scripted and visually brilliant. <br/><br/>Blade is based on and adapted from the popular comic books by Marvel. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid spends his nights hunting down and killing off vampires. Using an array of big guns, big swords and sometimes just plain cool martial arts moves, he dispatches said creatures of the night in huge style, creating CGI orgies of vampire-death-by-disintegration and beating senseless anyone else that gets in his way (look out for Officer Krieger). Helped along by Whistler, his faithful yet badass human partner, Blade's quest is to rid the world of these pesky bloodsuckers altogether. However, a certain power-hungry vampire has other ideas, and he sets about clawing his way to the top of the food chain<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies that are actually better than their accompanying trailer. Rare, I know, but it's true. Everything about this film is astounding. The casting for one, is fantastic. Wesley Snipes was director Stephen Norrington's first and only choice for Blade, and he does a fantastic job. Really the only film I truly like him in. Seeing him as any other character, he just looks strange without his black leather coat, sword, impossibly cool shades and tribal tattoos. This role was made for him. Stephen Dorff is brilliant as Deacon Frost, the maniacal and murderous un-pureblood vampire who wants to take over the world. (Ah, the old take-over-the-world ploy. Never fails.) He even manages to scare Udo Kier's master vampire Dragonetti into submission. Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is great  a decrepit and world-weary creature, almost like a father figure who keeps Blade in good supply of guns, swords and easily wieldable Ultra-Violet light sources. As Blade details their relationship quite astutely ""he makes the weapons. I use them."" Just happens to help that Whistler wants to wipe out the vampires as much as Blade does. N'Bushe Wright is fantastic as Blade's hematologist sidekick, Karen Jensen. She's attacked by Frost's second-in-command, Quinn, (brilliantly played by Donal Logue) and subsequently rescued by Blade. Most female action sidekicks tend to grate on the nerves after about five minutes of screen time, but Wright has a good mixture of sass, brains and she looks good carrying a shotgun. I don't understand why she didn't pop up in the sequels though. Traci Lords is aptly sexy and sinister as Frost's vampire minion Mercury (because of course, you have to have at least one slinky female vampire).<br/><br/>The look of this movie is amazing too  everything is dark, moody and ominous. Even the few daytime scenes are overcast and gloomy. The dialogue, cinematography and acting are all first-rate, but the action scenes are probably why this movie is so popular. They're brilliantly choreographed, snappy and just brutal enough to make you giggle. Thankfully, they're also filmed in such a way that allows you to actually see what's going on. Most fight scenes these days are filmed way too close to the actors, and everything just becomes a blurry mess. I want to see that fist connect with that guy's chin, damn it. The soundtrack to this film is outstanding too - a hardcore techno slice of musical menace that fits the film brilliantly. Listening to the soundtrack is almost as good as watching the film. But nothing beats the club scene at the beginning with blood spraying from a demonic version of a sprinkler system, and New Order's 'Confusion' thumping away at your eardrums. Sensory assault.<br/><br/>Even though this film is nearly ten years old, it hasn't dated. The dialogue is still wry as hell, ""-There are worse things out tonight than vampires -Like what? -Like Me"" the gore is still gory and the characters are still impossibly cool. This is another movie that'll age well, along with other films like The Lost Boys and Near Dark. And I still feel compelled to watch this quite frequently. Usually late at night when blood and guts and darkness show up so well in a room with no lights on"
"james_norman1981","8","1","3","13 February 2006"," A fast paced, kinetic romp through modern vampire mythology...
","Now the summary above might seem a bit highbrow for a film like Blade and, to be honest, it is. However, that doesn't detract from a movie which, although it doesn't do anything new with the traditional vampire story, does offer a fast and furious couple of hours of well choreographed action.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half breed human/vampire mix and the only one of his kind. Taken from his mother by Cesearean section, after she was bitten by a vampire, Blade has all the strengths of a vampire with almost none of their weaknesses... garlic, silver, sunlight... all are nothing to the Daywalker. Unfortunately, he still ages like a human and he still has the vampiric thirst for blood.<br/><br/>Discovered as a child by vampire hunter Abraham Whistler (a wonderfully gnarly Kris Kristofferson) Blade is subsequently trained into a highly skilled martial artist and fighter who hunts vampires across the US. Naturally the vampires take a dim view of this but are consistently unable to take down their nemesis due to his regenerative abilities and impressive skills, particularly with the sword. Using this and other weapons, created by the partially incapacitated Whistler, Blade is a powerful enemy, albeit one fighting against a seemingly insurmountable adversary which has its claws, figuratively and literally, in much of the modern world.<br/><br/>However, all is not well in the vampire society. A schism has developed between true, pure blooded vampires and those who were merely bitten to develop into vampires. As the 'turned' (bitten) individuals grow in power behind their leader Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a selection of very cool shirts), they begin to examine ancient vampire relics which suggest that there may be a way of bringing a vampire god, La Magra, to Earth where he will initiate a vampire apocalypse. Blade must stop them.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is well paced and interesting, although sometimes has to stretch a bit too far for comfort's sake. Still, despite the occasional lapse or ridiculous moment, sun block protects turned vampires from sunlight apparently, the tension is built up fairly continuously and the various fights and climaxes work effectively.<br/><br/>Unlike the CGI heavy sequel and truly diabolical third film with its horrendous products placement (could you really fight someone if you were listening to an iPod!?!), the original Blade comes with few strings attached and no obvious debts to be paid (although devotees of Hong Kong cinema might take umbrage at that). Using wire work before the Matrix made it the done thing, Snipes and, perhaps more importantly, Norrington give us a genuinely super hero whose gravity defying moves seldom appear too excessive. A general (if not total) lack of slow motion and characters who are prepared to be fairly unambiguous means little distracts us from the standard good versus evil fights throughout, while N'Bushe Wright is scorching but useful (not your average screaming damsel in distress) as the doctor caught up in the middle of Blades' fight with Frost and the vampires (and who creates a recombinant viral gene therapy in about five minutes!).<br/><br/>Gerenally Blade works very well, the reveals are unexpected and the acting fairly downplayed. However, the secondary bad guys and the Big Bad Fight at the end are less effective, the latter of which seems particularly lame. A look at the DVD deleted scenes suggests that an alternative, perhaps more apt finish was unworkable within the limited budget available. Instead the film leaves a slightly sour taste in the mouth due to its unpalatable finish but that shouldn't take away from the overall achievement of making an excellent, fun if overly serious movie that goes down well after a few jars in the pub.<br/><br/>Comparisons with the sequels are, in my opinion, favourable. The less said about Blade Trinity the better but there is a definite suggestion that the second movie was superior. I don't agree with this, thanks mainly to the ham fisted attempts to arouse emotion, the rather ridiculous plot, too much CGI and too much gore for gore's sake. It also gains a character and loses one with almost no explanation as to the how's or why's and has the most unrealistic bunch of kick asses ever committed to film (the blood pack really should've seen an image and accent consultant before filming and what is the point in having Donnie Yen in a martial arts film if he doesn't even get to fight anyone!?!).<br/><br/>So stick with the original and best: Wesley Snipe's Blade slicing and dicing the evil vampires with some hardcore moves, kick ass tools and a thumping soundtrack."
"Bogmeister","7","1","3","4 February 2006"," Fighting Modern Vampires in the Big City
","It's a glimpse into how Hollywood works and thinks that, with all the primo Marvel super-heroes to choose from, even including 2nd-tier heroes like Luke Cage & the Panther, the first successful big budget Marvel film is based on an obscure supporting character from the little-known 'Tomb of Dracula' comic book. The key to the success was upgrading the Blade (Snipes) character to be a cool bad-ass in the big city, with neat weapons and wardrobe, not to mention super powers lacking in the original comic book version. On initial glance, the movie could be a standard action thriller from the nineties, but director Norrington imbued this with enough style and mythology to make this a cut above most of those. Rather than an old Gothic atmosphere, everything points towards the modern, the sleek. The actual 'Dracula' character isn't present; instead there's an entire secret cabal of vampires, ruling in secret - for one reason or another it seems all of the police force is employed by them. There are different 'grades' of vampire in this story - those born as vamps and those turned. The so-called pure bloods form a ruling council. They exist in an unspecified truce with human bigwigs i.e. politicians - which comes as no surprise, I suppose - all bloodsuckers would support one another, right? <br/><br/>Also borrowed from the comic books is the villain vampire Frost (Dorff), portrayed as an elder man in the books, but here a turned arrogant punk aiming to change the status quo. The more interesting aspects of the story have to do with the internal conflict among the new age and the older generation of vampires, not the usual battles between humans and vampire monsters. Blade himself in not really human, being a kind of hybrid, having the strengths of a typical vampire and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, garlic). His fights are martial arts-influenced, with the added FX shots of his opponents disintegrating as a fatal blow is struck. Some dark amusement is provided by Donal Logue as Frost's no.2 vamp, never quite getting that killing blow from Blade, just losing a limb every other scene. Logue and Dorff, tho, never seem quite in sync in their scenes together, with Logue stressing the humor and Dorff playing it very straight. But they manage, in conjunction, to provide the necessary menace for Blade and his allies to stand against.<br/><br/>The film veers a bit into inane territory for the climax, when Frost is planning to unleash something called 'La Magra' on the world, which I believe was meant to turn everyone into vampires. Instead of the planned 'blood god' FX, we get a souped-up version of vampirism in Frost and some extra martial arts effort from Blade to wrap things up. Snipes is stolid as the hero, letting loose a grin every now and then when the prospect of graphic violence rises up. He and fellow vampire-killer Whistler (Kristofferson) are supposedly close friends but you get the impression they're together only because they both hate vampires. It's a rather somber unemotional world they both exist in, with nothing more than resolute soldiering a guiding force. Blade would continue to soldier on in two sequels."
"jellyneckr","Null","1","3","18 July 2005"," Good vampire movie
","From the previews, BLADE seems like just another violent gore fest, but it is actually more than that. It is an extremely entertaining action/horror movie that is full of jaw-dropping special effects, good performances, great directing, (due to the fabulous Stephen Norrington), and a fascinating plot. It isn't your average vampire movie. It's a comic book movie geared more toward adults than kids and it's a very bloody one too. The blood didn't bother me, but the two hour running time and the terrible acting by N'Bushe Wright did. Highlights include the opening scene, the final fight scene, and any scene with Donal Logue. 7/10"

"bannonanthony","8","1","3","22 June 2005"," A brilliant start to a brilliant trilogy.
","I have now seen all three BLADE movies so I thought I'd review them all now. This, the first film of the series, did not disappoint me when I saw it for the first time. My parents had seen it ages before I did and gave me their opinion. I agree with them on some things and disagree on some others. For instance, they complained that Stephen Dorff was pretty unconvincing as head vamp Deacon Frost. I personally thought that Dorff was very good in the role and could be very menacing at times. But this is Wesley Snipes' show and he is excellent as our hero, the half human-half vampire Blade. Known as the Daywalker, he is the bane of the existence of the vampires who have their fingers in many pies of human society. Adding excellent support is Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler, Blade's mentor and weapons creator.<br/><br/>The cast overall is very good and the action scenes, such as a battle in a vamp nightclub at the start and Blade's final assault on Frost's stronghold are staged brilliantly. Stephen Norrington is, in my opinion, an excellent director and he delivers the goods with this movie. As a fan of muscle cars, I'm also glad that Blade has some cool wheels here (a black Dodge Charger). My only gripes would be that Frost's minions, with the exception of the luckless Quinn, can be pretty faceless at times and that I think Frost should have turned into a giant monster for the final fight as was originally planned. That aside, this film kicks off the BLADE trilogy excellently and I'm glad that David S. Goyer was the writer for each one as the world he creates is truly stunning."

","Half man, half vampire Blade (aka Wesley Snipes) is out to kill off vampires in general, and Stephen Dorff's brat-pack-vampire bad guy in particular. The latter having a nasty scheme where he's intends to take over the world (or something).<br/><br/>The film starts off, and continues, in quite a violent fashion. It's definitely not PG-13 stuff either, but surprisingly hardcore action. In a sense, it's more gory and violent than the more ""unreal"" (but in my opinion, better) sequel Blade 2. For the first half or so, things happen at a steady pace with both nice action scenes and cool characters - but then things start to fall apart.<br/><br/>Gradually, the plot gets increasingly stupid, and the proceedings come to a screeching halt. Not that there has to be constant fighting and blood flying around, but the way too long and talky conclusion of the film was pretty uninteresting. I just couldn't give a damn about what happened anymore. The bleak gritty look that worked so well in the first half suddenly just feels gray and boring.<br/><br/>Some editing to tighten the film and keep up the pace from the opening would have made it so much better. As would a decision to forget about dodgy CG-characters for the end battle in favour of some man to man (or as the case may be - vampire to vampire) battle that doesn't leave one character fighting a blue screen.

"area01","Null","1","3","11 January 2005"," Bladexploitation?
","Anyone notice this fine Vampire Action Flick has a heavy slice of Blaxploitation mixed into it? This could be due to the adaptation of a Marvel Comic Character from the 70's, when Afros, Leather, Bell Bottoms and Bad Muthers were everywhere.<br/><br/>Of course, in today's PC climate, I am sure the film makers wanted to be true to Bade's roots (no pun intended) or had a dose of Post-Modern irony in the production of the movie. I am talking more about the clothing, cars and attitude than the fine performances from the two lead actors Wesley Snipes and N'Bushe Wright.<br/><br/>Blaxploitation films really took black culture and sold (exploited) it to a mainstream audience, but Blade works as a great horror action flick in it's own right, rather than needing to exploit any particular culture. However.. I think it still owes a debt, in tone, to the likes of Shaft, Action Jackson, Coffy, etc. Bad-Ass dude in leather clothing with bitchin' weapons and cool one-liners - all that was missing was the Isaak Hayes Soundtrack (""ain't talking about Blade.."") and a Pimp in Flares that could double as Bay Window Curtains.<br/><br/>Anyway. Blaxploitation Cinema has influenced a ton of movies over the years - directly with the likes of Jackie Brown, spoofed by Goldmember and Uncover Brother. It is also recognised as an influential period of film making, now given a higher cultural status than it's low budget grass-roots origins. So, nothing wrong with Blade laying down a slice of this in it's production."

","Based on the Marvel comic book, Blade is a solid action movie. It has great fight scenes, awesome special effects, and a kick butt action hero that the crowd can cheer for. In the movie, it seems that there are constant threats toward humanity from vampires. Blade(Snipes), or the daywalker, is the only one that protects us. A renegade vampire named Deacon Frost(Dorff) is trying to resurrect the blood god, which will destroy the world of course. Leave it to Blade to try to stop him. This is a non-stop action roller-coaster from start to finish. Wesley Snipes is especially good as the human/vampire hero. When he's on the screen, you just know he's going do bust some heads in, you can just feel his presence. Co-star Kris Kristofferson is also good as Blade's close friend and father figure.This movie is not for the squeamish, but if you don't mind that, this is the perfect movie to enjoy with your friends on a Friday night."

An excellent performance is given by Stephen Dorff as the evil Deacon Frost the arch enemy who strives for the upmost prize, to live and feed in daylight.

Maybe it was the need for more humor (or better humor) and definitely the need for better exposition scenes, a better plot and better villains and worldbuilding. Well, actually all of those things forced me into a low rating, even if I did enjoy the movie alot, right until the last third.

His mother was bit by a vampire while pregnant so he was born with their abilities yet human understanding. He saves a doctor and spirits her off to his lab where Kris Kristofferson provides him with weapons. We are left with blood, guts and ridiculous storytelling. Production values are excellent and director Stephen Norrington does a stylish job but Snipes appears out of nowhere and kicks the crap out of dozens of vampires while going through poorly written dialogue. Stephen Dorff plays the villain as usual, and Snipes will obviously have the most difficulty kicking his ass. Kristofferson is laughable providing Blade with a super size of everything from weapons, antidotes, cable television, a dental plan, life insurance, and a vibrator. N'Bushe Wright plays the rescue victim because these films seem to require a female in pearl and she is due up. Udo Kier plays the head of the vampires who should voice a complaint that head of the vampires is in a low rent film such as this.

Consequently, we couldn't care less who lives, who dies, or how. The acting is sub-par in my opinion, but this may also be due to the non- existent screenplay.

There was plenty of action but the film doesn't end at all leaving room for Blade 2 to formulate and the special effects were weak. Pearl was also a character that didn't need to be in the movie. I never felt anything for any character as no one was fleshed out at all...not even Blade. However I did like the first hour and Blades character was alright. The car he drives in the movie is cool though. All in all don't expect too much when viewing this one....save it for a rainy day or a time when you have a couple of hours to kill."

","SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Blade is bar none the best vampire movie ever. now usually you just got some human fighting, or running, from the vampires. but blade was different Blade is a vampire BUT he's a Hbrid He Has all the strengths of vampires but none of there weaknesses Except the thirst. he can regenerate and even be out in the day. he is one hard core guy whose out to protect a race that he so desperately wants to join but can't until his mission is doe. Now there's frost, Bitten and desperate to be pure and not to mention king of all vampires. Blade hates him enough without finding out Frost is the one that bit blades mom and made blade what he is. now I was not old enough to see it in theaters but i saw 2,3. And I need to get something out. Blade was made in 1998 1 year before the matrix. and if anyone ever noticed in the scene in the park just before frost throws the girl into the street he dodges Blades bullets and they use BULLET TIME! so the matrix was not first and I'm tired of people saying matrix did bullet time first. But besides that blade is one hell of an action movie it deserves no less than a 10 in fact it deserves more If you haven't seen it your missing out."
"gigan-92","8","2","13","18 July 2009"," A Decent Hero/ Vampire Flick
","Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably preferred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith. His acting here doesn't need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but I'm glad he decides to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. <br/><br/>I have to pick apart a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beating the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. Moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely. Luckily stunning sequel, ""Blade 2"" improves itself."

","A half human half vampire being named Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a special hunter in the world who hunts down vicious vampires with the help of his mentor Whistler (Kris Kistopherson) as they help a young woman (N'Bushe Wright) to defeat a vampire kingpin named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff)who's hellbent on destroying humankind.<br/><br/>This is the movie that started the modern Marvel movie Renaissance as we know on the big screen! The character Blade was an obscure Marvel character who was finally brought justice on the big screen. The film is praised for being a different kind of vampire movie that combines with the action genre, Snipes was meant to play the title hero. There's good acting, terrific action sequences, gore galore, good special effects and nonstop special effects.<br/><br/>I love how this rebooted the comic book genre when folks thought it died with ""Batman and Robin"" but this movie proved them wrong. This created a new beginning for Marvel to become motion pictures with successes like ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"", ""Ghost Rider"", ""Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man"" and more thanks to this movie."
"metalrage666","5","1","5","20 September 2016"," Repeated views certainly make for average appeal.
","Unfortunately the years have not been kind to Blade, and for me at least, the less said about the sequels, the better. When this first hit the screens I loved it simply due to the constant action, however watching this now just leaves me with a very real feeling of ""meh"".<br/><br/>To be fair, as a comic book adaptation, Blade works a real treat. I was never a fan of the comics, but from what little I do know, this stays faithful to the comic legend, his origins, his skills and abilities, but leaving the comic book lore behind for a moment, as a movie and in retrospect, it just no longer works for me for a number of reasons. The action in of itself is relentless and bloody. There's enough gore to suit most horror fans and enough action to satiate most needs on first viewing, and that can often be enough to initially love this for what it is. The fighting is choreographed as well as any ballet but it's when you delve a little deeper into what's really going on that the love eventually fades.<br/><br/>I can accept that as a person who was endowed with vampire strength, giving him heightened senses and coupled with his skills with swords, knives and all manner of weapons would make him a formidable opponent, but to be completely unbeatable is little far fetched and honestly, quite boring. What's the point of watching a hero go about his business if there's no Achilles heel for his enemies to exploit? Watching Wesley Snipes effortlessly smack people and vampires around like they were rag dolls, reminds me of any Jet Li or Steven Seagal movie where no matter the odds, they win every fight, they never get a scratch or even manage to break into a sweat. It becomes a little monotonous to watch after a while to see that the only time Blade takes a hit is when his hands are tied, and with his regenerative ability, merely getting punched in the face a few times is the same as ripping off a band-aid; it might sting for a second but who cares? <br/><br/>All the vampires know about Blade and refer to him as the ""Daywalker"", so they know what he's capable of yet they all insist in taking him on one at a time. The opening sequence in the abattoir/underground night club has the whole crowd all pent up with blood lust yet Blade dispatches many with ease like it's a day at the beach while the others all run screaming for the exits. I could never get why these blood-thirsty vampires never attacked him en masse. Persistently going one on one seems redundant and suicidal. I also take issue with every group of vampires acting like bumbling fools when confronting Blade. None of them seem to be able to shoot straight and even when there's ten or more with machine guns, no one manages to get a shot off before Blade shoots them all. Whether they're vampires or human familiars, watching them stumble around trying to kill or capture one man gets frustrating. I'm not watching a comedy so why the Keystone Cops routine? <br/><br/>Vampires are supposed to have super speed and reflexes, something that's witnessed in one scene where Deacon Frost dodges bullets, yet everyone else manages to get shot, stabbed, punched and kicked with minimal effort. We are also told that while crosses don't actually work, sunlight does, however that's rendered moot by some good ol' fashioned sunblock. So apparently vampires can be Daywalkers too if they wear an SPF 50+. Although the jury is still out on whether you need to wear a motorcycle helmet with the visor down, or just the sun-block and no sunglasses. It's the same sun, but do you need to protect your eyes or not? Make up your minds.<br/><br/>I felt that Kris Kristofferson was totally miscast in this as the shuffling perpetual angry and irritated senior citizen and partner to Blade. Despite his tech prowess, Whistler is completely useless in this, even more so in the sequel and seems to only serve as some kind of joke to old age.<br/><br/>I was going to give this only 4 stars but had to increase it by one simply due to N'Bushe Wright. She's so hot in this and whenever this is on late night TV, she at least makes this watchable. Sanaa Lathan is also not too bad to look at as Blades' mother, (despite her being 10 years younger than Snipes), so having them both in a film that's getting worse with age is at least one redeeming factor. My growing distaste for Blade may be in part due to the excessive and saturated feel that vampire movies have had on audiences. Along with the Underworld movies, the Twilight Saga and various other random vampire flicks that have done the rounds in the last 10-15 years, overload and boredom was inevitable. Blade isn't a bad movie by any means, and is worth a look if you catch it on TV when there's nothing else on."
"kluseba","4","1","5","27 May 2010"," Ordinary action blockbuster instead of a horror movie
","I really have a lot of difficulties to appreciate modern movies about vampires as the ""Underworld"" saga, the ""Nochnoy dozor: Night watch"" and its sequels or the Blade saga. I'm a fan of old and sometimes even modern horror movies (""30 days of night"" is a nice modern film about vampires for example) and I leak to read horror literature too, but this movie is not convincing me at all.<br/><br/>Wesley Sinpes plays a cool and tough guy and is doing a quite well job even though he is maybe a little bit too ""gangsta"" for such a movie, there are also some nice fighting and gore scenes, but this film has an important lack of horror elements, of an interesting and suspenseful story and a horrifying atmosphere.<br/><br/>The movie is much more an action movie with some surprising lengths in the middle of the movie (while movies as ""Dead snow"" or parts of the ""Underworld"" saga still have much more adrenaline) rather than a horror movie. I would compare this movie to the first ""Matrix"" movie, this one being also a wanna-be cool action movie with a pseudo science-fiction background instead of a horror background like in this one.<br/><br/>I give the four points for the acceptable first thirty minutes, the action effects, the style of the actors and the special acting of Wesley Snipes. I haven't seen the sequels but this one didn't give me the state of euphoria to head for the other ones at all."
"darth_sidious","Null","1","5","19 August 2000"," Below average comic book flick
","The best comic book film is? Superman The Movie. The worst? Not sure, but this one fits near the bottom of the scale.<br/><br/>The dark comic book character trend continues in this rather lacklustre adventure. Blade is cool, but nothing else. Blade kills vampires, yippie! Do we know anything about the character, his past as a boy? NO. Do we care? NO.<br/><br/>Character development is thrown out of the window along with dialogue and interesting characters. There seems little motivation in the screenplay, it's all a bit boring.

"Rammstein-2","4","1","5","24 January 2000"," The very definition of bad adaptations
","I have always found movies that are made from graphic novels interesting. Some of them are very successful in the attempt to copy the stylized world of comics. The very best example yet is Matrix - I've never seen anything like that film.<br/><br/>But Blade is much like the Batman movies: nice tries that won't work. Both Batman and Blade are quiet, angry people who never smile (except for Clooney, who seems unable to wipe that stupid grin of his face). They walk around, do their thing dressed in the most indiscreet clothes you can possibly wear and then get out again.<br/><br/>Yeah, Batman is just kind of a parody - but Blade tries to be more serious. Which doesn't work, or course. It's about as serious and profound as a puddle of water on the street. The action is nice, yes, but it is obvious that the budget for Blade wasn't half as big as for Matrix, because it is too rapid and shaky. Some gestures, such as the REALLY corny Maculay Culkin ""yes-I-just-nailed-the-bad-guy""-gesture in the vampire disco or the completely unnecessary pauses he makes with his sword, are probably a token of the original comics.<br/><br/>As for the acting qualities of Snipes, well... I'd like to see him in a normal movie, one where he doesn't act like someone completely improbable. Like Howard's End or The Bridges of Madison County. Or then again...maybe not."
"mohamedahmzak","6","1","6","16 October 2019"," Meh
","Sounded similar to the thousands of films I ve watched about the subject"
"Anonymous_Maxine","3","2","19","15 October 2000"," Wesley Snipes returns to let the world know that Demolition Man was not the last ridiculously awful movie that he planned to make in his career, which seems to be headed precipitously downhill.
","There's nothing worse that a well-known film actor or actress can do than star in a film where they deliberately and obviously alter their voice. Wesley Snipes not only does this (terribly) in Blade, but he also wears false teeth and BROWN colored contact lenses. Are his eyes just not the right shade of brown? They had to be changed? And what was the deal with the teeth? There was never a single shot in the film in which he had fangs. Besides that, listening to Wesley Snipes talk like he's trying to scare a six-year-old kid gets real old real fast, and some of his lines were so pseudo-tough guy that they ruined the movie nearly single-handed, for the same reason that the idiotic Pitch Black was ruined (`There are worse things out tonight than vampires.' `Like what?' `Like me.'). Way to go, Wesley. That was so impressive that for a second I was almost fully awake. The kind of awful acting that this movie is full of belongs in cheesy action B-movies. <br/><br/>I have barely even begun, and it's bad enough with just what I have mentioned so far, without having to watch the laughable efforts of Blade and his goofy female sidekick to periodically pop each other's shoulders back into their sockets (`It's dislocated!' POP!!! `Ahh, better.' Are you kidding me?). I won't mention the fact that when Blade popped hers back into her socket after having casually tossed her from rooftop to rooftop, he actually YANKED on her arm. Excuse me, Dr. Blade, but don't you think you ought to apply pressure in the other direction? This may seem trivial, and I'll admit that it is, but keep in mind that it is a pure example of sheer stupidity, and I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity in movies. These kinds of things about Blade make it clear that it is pulled along entirely by the special effects and the star power of Wesley Snipes as an action film hero. Besides, he looked cool, didn't he? I sure as hell wouldn't mess with a man that big dressed like that, but don't you think that if a huge, tattooed black man wearing a trenchcoat, a bullet-proof vest and carrying a sword were to smack a police officer's head against the trunk of his own car on a crowded street in broad daylight, at least one or two passers-by would notice? That would qualify as suspicious behavior, in my opinion.<br/><br/>
There were so many things thrown into this movie for no apparent reason other than to hold the audience's attention that it really took away from the movie as a whole. For example, what was this globular, vampire version of Jabba the Hutt? Where did he come from? How did he get like that? All other vampires were in human form, and this guy hardly even resembled a human at all. Was there some reason that he was so tremendously fat? It's amazing he was alive at all. Granted, I don't expect his life story. Frankly, I'd rather not hear it. But there was obviously no other reason for him to be in the movie other than to stimulate the gag response from unsuspecting audiences. But that's not all, remember what Blade said to Karen (his goofy female sidekick) as he went to check the nearby vault door? He said, referring to the use of the UV ray gun with which she had been roasting his vampire skin, `If he moves, fry him.' Where the hell is he going to go, Blade?! He can hardly move!! What's he gonna do, run away? If he stood up he'd probably crush himself with his own weight.<br/><br/>
Am I being too hard on this movie? Good, because this is what it deserves. I'll admit that it had a few redeeming qualities (by `a few,' by the way, I mean more than one but less than four). For example, it was cool how Blade exploded the two martial artists by the elevators by the hallway, and the BLOODBATH sign at the rave in the beginning was also pretty good. Aside from these minute moments of forced entertainment, everything about the film was terrible. The `climactic' fight scene between Blade and Frost was like watching a little white kid in a fight against a huge black bodybuilder, resulting in the utter absence of any excitement whatsoever. How about that Blood God? Was he to convert the whole planet into vampires (`Anyone caught in his path will be instantly turned')? You'd think that if this vampire community had thought ahead at least a little bit, they'd realize that maybe it would be better if they tried to MINIMIZE the number of humans turned into vampires, because the more vampires, the less humans. And the less humans, the less FOOD. Thus, in taking over the world, they would inadvertently and idiotically bring about their own starvation and extinction. That's just another example of the stupidity with which Blade is filled.<br/><br/>And of course, they couldn't have left out Blade in some other country (the bitter cold of Russia) speaking in Russian to a vampire in Moscow. How nice. What a tough guy. He killed all the vampires in the U.S. so now he's going global. What a piece of garbage this movie was. Granted, you probably won't be extremely bored throughout the entire movie (even though I was), but keep in mind that this is the type of film that you really have to try hard to enjoy, particularly if you are no longer in junior high school. This is a brainless, pointless movie, with little to no forethought put into it, and the end result is pathetic."

"thesar-2","7","1","18","2 November 2009"," Slice Blade
","'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI – even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or ""day-walker"" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la ""Batman and Alfred"") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 ""suntan lotion""? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride."

It all starts of very well with the scene in the discotheque but afterwards it becomes very clear that this is a comic remake. The story is very well but the effects makes it laughable. When the mastervampires have a ritual at the end, won't tell it all, they change into flying skeletons...looks stupid, looks like Disney is horror. The only effects that are nice are the bites and the ending of Udo Kier, that's really nicely done, sometimes the flying skeletons made me remember of the disappointment of Evil Dead 3.

"The-Sarkologist","3","1","22","23 December 2011"," Playing Call of Duty is probably a much better use of one's time than watching this film
","I saw this film quite a while ago and hated it and wondered whether it was because I had been bitten by the bug that creates such a high expectation in a movie that when I see it I am bitterly disappointed because it did not meet my expectations. So, I decided to give it another shot, and once again was bitterly disappointed. No, it was not that I had high expectations, but rather it was because this film was actually rubbish.<br/><br/>Blade is based on the marvel comic book of the same name as is about a 'daywalker' a half-vampire that has all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses, with the exception of their thirst for blood. Blade (Wesley Snipes) was born after his mother had been bitten by a vampire but before she had turned, so she was still, partly at least, human. It is unclear what had happened to him between his birth and when he was found by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) at the age of 13 and together they became a team of vampire hunters. The movie begins when a young man is being lured into a vampire nest to feed, and the man is rescued by Blade in his hunt for a renegade named Frost.<br/><br/>Now, in this universe, the vampires are divided between the pure-bloods (those born vampires) and the turned (those who become vampires after they are bitten), and the hierarchy is set in that order. Then there are the familiars, those who sell themselves to the vampires in a hope that one day they will become vampires. As Blade explains to Karen, a haematologist that he rescues after she is attacked by the vampires that he is tracking, that they are a race that live apart from humanity and have a treaty with humans not to abuse their powers.<br/><br/>However, there are those within the vampire ranks who desire to rule over the humans, Deacon Frost being one of them, and he is researching the ancient texts so that he might become the Blood God and thus turn the tide of the war between the humans and the vampires. However as it turns out the vampires are actually manipulating humanity from behind the scenes and ruling them from the shadows. As Blade explains, they control the police, but move from city to city keeping in the shadows.<br/><br/>Now the question is why I did not like this film. Personally, it was really clichéd. Now, unfortunately, vampires in and of themselves are clichéd, and have been this way ever since Bram Stoker first wrote his story about vampires (Dracula). Now, don't get me wrong, Dracula is actually quite a good book, but in a sense it has been quite overdone, from the old silent classic Nosferatu, to the many copies that have appeared on the cinema screens ever since. However, Vampires are still quite popular (as can be seen with the Twilight novels and films which, to me, are rubbish). The problem is that once one sees something a vampire story that is really good, it sets a benchmark which makes it very difficult to exceed, and to me that turned out to be the role-playing game Vampire (of which I will not go into details here).<br/><br/>Obviously in a film one does have a very limited space to be able to set the scene, but still, I feel that this film does fail on in a lot of areas, and if I were to label one scene, and that is where Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) appears in daylight and survives, namely because he is wearing sunblock. Seriously, that, to me, is rubbish. He simply should have burnt up like all of the other vampires that are exposed to sunlight.<br/><br/>As this film came to the end it reminded me of a video game, namely it was a series of fight scenes interspersed by some cut scenes that help move the story along, and then, at the end, the hero fights the big bad guy, and wins. Video games have changed a lot since the days of space invaders, and are multi-million dollar productions in and of themselves. It seems that a lot of the action films follow the format of your average video games these days, though games tend to be a lot longer than your average movies, though I also know (and I have done it myself) that people will sit and watch others play these games. As for me, I tend to like a bit more depth and less cliché in my films."

"twbond-00867","7","0","1","18 October 2018"," A stylish, entertaining movie.
","Blade (1998) is a fun, enjoyable movie that explores the Marvel Universe's vampire hunter starring Wesley Snipes (Demolition Man). Snipes does a perfect job as the vampire hunter, and the story gives a very interesting take on the half-human, half-vampire vigilante. Stephen Dorff portrays the villain, Deacon Frost very well, and portrays an antagonist that haunts the audience with excitement, and mesmerising chills and thrills.<br/><br/>The opening takes a fantastic direction on the birth of Marvel's nightmarish vigilante-to then ultimately introducing himself as the Vampire hunter we all know today.<br/><br/>Blade still captures some enjoyable moments, giving one of the ""coolest and visceral"" Marvel opening scenes still worth a watch. It certainly brings the Marvel Halloween-themed vigilante to the big screen a fantastic show of a ""superhero"" that is a little bit ""scarier"" than any other Marvel heroes out in other universe/s.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is not the ""best"" Marvel movie, but it's still enjoyable in other areas. The movie could take more ""jaw-dropping"" moments if we explored his origin more, how about some backstory in his youth-to who he becomes? Who knows, maybe we'll see that soon. I HOPE! An MCU introduction would be spectacular.<br/><br/>I love the Marvel character, Blade. This movie explains why, because it's a fun movie to see. If you love Marvel, check this movie out! It's not the best, but it's still enjoyable.<br/><br/>7/10. Enjoyable, and fun!"

","Other than Batman Returns and The Crow, comic book films in 90's was playing either dumb or lazy or sometimes both, but Blade was one of those comic book films that showed not only can comic book movies can be cool, but it can also be an interesting way entertain the audience, rather than being a kids film. While the did succeed at being both awesome and help getting the popularity comic book films again, it still has the 90's tropes. But aside from the writing not being perfect, there still a style and creativity that makes the film enjoyable, the characters are entertaining, the visuals are good and the action sequences is impressive."
"DJ_Shilo","8","0","1","21 September 2018"," Hunting Season Begins
","It's not often we get a great origin story to a well-written and severely determined vampire hunter with a deadly purpose. ""Blade"" is a gory and violent, non-stop action picture that jumps from the DC comic books and shines brightly. Wesley Snipes may have found his best role and the best performance of his career.<br/><br/>
It's about a vampire hunter named, Blade (Wesley Snipes), whose mother was bitten by a vampire while she was pregnant with him. As a result, she dies, and he lives only to inherit some differences like being able to walk in the sunlight. While living on the streets, Blade is taken in and adopted by his mentor and weaponsmith, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) where he sharpens his lethal skills under Whistler's tutelage. After destroying a vampire nightclub, Blade rescues a hematologist, Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) after she is bitten, in an attempt to save her. Meanwhile, a young vampire, Decon Forst (Stephen Dorff) has declared war on the human race when he tries to awaken a blood god - La Magra, that puts Blade at the top of the hunting game. The only problem is, Decon needs Blade's blood, the blood of the daywalker.<br/><br/>Blade's origin story is well written and fascinating that I must give it up to David S. Goyer for writing the movie and doing a good job. After seeing the character in action, it makes you wonder who Blade is and what his real purpose is. Is he looking for his mother's killer or is he merely attempting to kill all the vampires, the thing he hates most? We learn a little from the opening of the picture and Whistler fills in the blanks later on as to who he is and how he came to be. Blade is a composite of a characters study because there are so much detail and background for him that the movie is not long enough to tell it all but Wesley Snipes takes the role and dives head first into the character.<br/><br/>Mostly this is an action movie with some brilliant special effects. The source material comes from a comic book with a superhero feel, but since Wesley is an accomplished martial artist, it looks even better. He punches, kicks and slices threw vampires, and it's quite entertaining to see. There are several fight scenes in the film, but one fight scene is virtually a bloodbath as body parts burn while others are shot off, come undone and ripped apart. The opening sequence in the vampire nightclub is not only a bloody battleground, but it's got an old-school Hong Kong action style feel to it. One Vampire has his head kicked into a wall light while another is shoved into the ceiling by his chin with Blade's stakes.<br/><br/>Throughout the picture, we don't know what's Blade's real intentions are. Something inside him is eating away, and it seems like he is searching for his mother's killer, but we don't know, but we feel there is something more. He is left mysterious. Deacon Frost is the nasty vampire pest that thinks he is above everyone and proceeds to awaken the blood god to become invincible. Deacon looks to be eternal not just the whole ""walk in the sunlight"" routine.<br/><br/>Snipes hit an emotional range with the character. He is a commanding presence and makes those afraid of him go running into the night, well most of them. You can believe that Wesley is physically good at the action. The Climax sets Blade inside a temple where the monsters all gather together to figure out his weakness and trap him in a casket-like machine to acquire his blood. This action does not go according to plan and Blade takes the final stage with Deacon. Before we see the outcome, we see a character who is vulnerable as well. We know Blade is not the superhero he is supposed to be but a man dying to escape from what he is and possibly become human."
"vucicevicf","8","0","1","10 August 2018"," A movie that is better than the comic
","1.) I feel Wesley Snipes was born to be Blade. In the movie he looks and acts so natural like the role was made for him. He might be the best action hero ever, reminds me a little of Batman because of his tragedy. This makes him more human and his quest becomes very personal and emotional. 
2.) Story of the movie is catchy from the start, as a viewer you instantly relate to 
that newborn child. As the story develops you get pulled into the dark world of modern vampires. The rest of the story is O.K. and keeps you interested.
3.) The movie gives an interesting idea that vampires could be among us in their own secret world and society.The disco scene is shocking and coupled whit perfect soundtrack. For me this is the best scene of the entire movie.
4) Action scenes are very intense and you must love the way Blade destroys his enemies. Almost showing off. The scenes are vary well shot, from interesting angles and CGI elements are used to enhance the intensity in a good way. 
5) Stephen Dorff played a bad gay to truly hate, an upcoming vampire with the ambition to take over the vampire kingdom by all means. Perfect!
A very entertaining 2h, do not miss!!!"
"Spike-Washington","8","0","1","12 July 2018"," One of the better and darker Marvel superhero flicks
","I rented this movie at one point and was intrigued from start to finish. Lots of action, if excessively gory, and vampire slaying. Kind of like a certain she-slayer from the mind of Joss Whedon. But this is something like Batman meets Zorro with a nocturnal protagonist who also wields a sword and various other sharp implements. I hadn't seen this much blood since Duke Nukem 3D. The villain is really good too and we get to see Donal Logue from the TV sitcom Grounded For Life as a voracious minion of the vampire Deacon Frost. Is the world doomed to the mercy of the bloodsuckers? Is the darkest truly before the dawn? You'll see!"

","""Blade"" set a new standard as being, in my opinion, the first good Marvel movie. Twenty years and more than twenty newer Marvel films later, it still holds up brilliantly. It's become dated in many regards, but managed to have smarmy one-liners, over-the-top choreography and late '90's aesthetics blend so seamlessly in tone with the antiquated effects that it in no way effects the score. 
Rather, it has simply shifted genre from hardcore martial arts feature to a grindhouse/exploitation style action extravaganza that never fails to put a smile on your face.
Spot-on casting, gory fight-scenes and a fearless originality leave ""Blade"" near the top of my Superhero list for the past two decades and likely many years to come. <br/><br/>

"generationofswine","7","0","2","25 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","Is this the movie that started it all? I'll go in and say ""no, not Blade,"" though it does certainly need it's share of credit.<br/><br/>For starters, it was rated R, and even though it was rater R back in 1998 where R was far from the kiss of death and Hollywood could feel free to make movies that weren't kid friendly and expect a solid return, it was still rated R. R is harder to turn into a franchise.<br/><br/>And then there is the character himself, Blade. For those of us that wandered the comic book racks, Blade was awesome...but awesome in the way that us Catholics and probably most Jews view Angels...as in you love and respect them, but never want to meet them in person.<br/><br/>You see an angel you know there is about to be blood, a lot of blood, you probably won't live through it sort of blood and the same goes with Blade.<br/><br/>And mind, that applies across the board, Tomb of Dracula, The Nightstalkers, and the insanely short lived solo series.<br/><br/>So of course the movie is rated R. I mean, the opening with the with the blood sprinkelers told us two things straight up, the first was that the movie was going to be way too much fun. And the second was that it would be far from kid friendly.<br/><br/>Seriously though, what a way to open a film. Gets you hooked from the start. In fact, it was so good that we even overlooked the fact that vampires were dusted ala Buffy.<br/><br/>Buffy/Blade show down, you'd pay to watch that wouldn't you? I know I would.<br/><br/>So, yeah, this does not at all start the Comic Franchise movie trend, but it was important. It really proved that there could be a movie based on a comic that didn't involve Superman or Batman and still be a success, still be good.<br/><br/>Sure, The Punisher 1990 proved that, at least in the B-Movie world, but Blade was summer blockbuster sort of good.<br/><br/>Sure we wanted to see Frank Drake and Hannibal King, Rachel Harker and Doctor Strange, but for the first installment, Blade was enough...even if Deacon Frost was too young it was still miles and miles of awesome.<br/><br/>And now that Snipe is out of jail, Strange is out in theaters, and the MCU has Marvel Edge...we can only hope to see another."
"AlienatorX","5","0","1","4 April 2016"," Let's have a talk...
","I know this movie is considered a great superhero movie, a great vampire movie, a great action movie, a great Wesley Snipes movie and a great R-rated movie butI think it needs to be re-examined. On the one hand Wesley Snipes embodies the character of Blade, the action is great, the acting is great, and the film has numerous twists and turns, the thing that real hurts the films is the Vampire angle. For some reason we as a culture are obsessed with Vampires, they were beginning to wear thin when Twilight came out, and that with that mystifying international sensation and the supernova of Vampire fiction that came in its wake I can safely say I am sick to death of Vampires, no pun intended. Again and again and again and again, it's gotten to the point where they're not even intimidating any more, just boring. And here is no exception, if a vampire movie wants to survive it needs to be able to put it's head above the proverbial water and stand out but Blade just doesn't, no surprises, nothing new, nothing interesting, just generic Vampire stuff that manages to kill an otherwise great movie. I know a lot of people like this film a lot but I cannot see why, give it a watch but I am not a fan."

","31 Days Of Horror: Day 24<br/><br/>Lean, mean and full of attitude just like it's main character, Stephen Norrington's Blade is one of the liveliest, most enjoyable flicks of the 90's, and injected energetic vitality into the vampire genre, which can get stuck in moody doldrums sometimes. Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a cranky half human, half vampire hybrid with all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. He spends his time brooding through decaying nocturnal hell pits looking for vampires to slaughter. He's joined by even crankier Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) a human companion and Q to Blade's Bond. When a rogue faction of the slick vampire nation rebels with a nasty plan to resurrect a 'blood god', Blade races against time to find their leader, a hotheaded punk named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a career highlight). Frost is a nasty genocidal fiend and makes quite the adversary for Blade, setting up one hell of a final smackdown in the third act. Donal Logue plays scruffy first lieutenant to Frost, N'Bushe Wright is a female scientist on Blade's side, and Udo Kier slink nicely through his scenes as vamp overlord Dragonetti. The action scenes have a throat ripping viciousness, the vamps are uniquely grungy and sleazeball, and it all coagulates into a nice piece of pure 90's comic book escapism. The night club opener is one of the best scenes in the horror genre, and is now iconic."

","Blade. Saw this gem of a movie at the theatre and will never forget how it worked on me. Almost everything was done right with this comic adaptation.<br/><br/>The movie generates a sense of reality the whole way, and this is one of the best things a superhero movie can deliver in my honest opinion. Sure, some elements here and there like vampires going to ashes remind you that this is a fantasy, but the story itself remains real most of the time except at the climax which evolves into surreal. Filming was also very well done, avoiding flashy colours, accentuating the feeling of seriousness and reality throughout the city scenes.<br/><br/>Fight choreographies were perfect, delivered fantastically by Snipes. Speed was fast enough to show that unnatural characters are at work here, but still slow and natural enough for our human eye to know what's going on. Wesley Snipes also did not just get fighting right, he also got acting right, delivering a nicely balanced performance. Managed to show that Blade is a tormented guy without going overboard and keeping the movie's focus elsewhere, where we want it to be. And Stephen Dorff did even better with a timeless performance in the role of Deacon Frost­. His character instills fear and doubt in every scene where he shows up despite his smaller stature and business clothing. It all fit together perfectly. Finally, one also needs to mention the successfully designed settings in many scenes, from the Temple of Eternal Light to the skyscraper rooftops to the vampire archives, it's all eye-popping and does not get old even today.<br/><br/>Now, to what was not done right. First, some special effects. The blood ones, especially by the end where Blade explodes a few vampires with blood boiling, look absolutely horrible. The ashes from vampire dying by silver didn't work with me either, although they were not as bad as the blood effects. I also thought N'Bushe Wright wasn't a great cast for Karen, although maybe the role itself wasn't the best part of the movie. All in all, very minor sins compared to the whole achievement.<br/><br/>Before closing, let it be said that Blade showcases some unrestrained violence but where there is no violence or danger, superheroes aren't needed much. This movie understood that most hero stories must be set against a credible evil in order to work, and Blade was a movie made for a mature audience rather than for kids."

","First of this review is going to be fairly biased as Blade is my favorite vampire film and superhero film. So don't criticise me for not pointing out all the negatives.<br/><br/>Blade is a 1998 horror, thriller directed by Stephen Norrington. The director has also made another brilliant film Death Machine which is definitely worth a watch. Blade is completely different however. Blade is a extremely violent and disturbing horror film with some of the best vampire kills ever. My personal favorite being the sunlight execution. This film does have some quite scary moments, quite noticeably the first 5 minutes. What starts of as a rave scene soon turns into a literal bloodbath with a nasty outcome. So if you put this on for someone who didn't know what it was, it would definitely scare them. Well at the least surprise them. Definitely a fun movie with a great storyline and well throughout characters. Not for people afraid of gore or violence as it contains some extremely graphic scenes."

A few days ago, I finally watched the first movie of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Blade is a Marvel character, half human, half vampire; all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. The films aren't very accurate; one of the main characters in the films (Whistler) originated in the 90's Spider-Man series and not the comics. There were three major films, and also a TV series.<br/><br/>Anyways, this film is good, but not stunning. The action sequences are great. Especially when Blade's kicking some vampire butt, slashing them as they turn to dust. Wesley Snipes does a great job as Blade. He definitely acts like the badass Blade is. The story is okay. Nothing special.<br/><br/>Special effects actually aren't that bad for the most part. They don't seem dated or anything. The musical score is good but the soundtrack isn't. The costumes are all well done.<br/><br/>Acting is okay besides Wesley. There's some star power in the cast. The dialogue is well written. The tone is dark but it avoids the kinky vampire blood stuff of say, Vampire Diaries, for the most part. It does only as much world building as it needs to, and nothing extra. You could argue that the later installments into the franchise do it better, but I disagree.<br/><br/>Blade is a great film but not as good as Blade 2, which is just an improved version of this one.

No? That figures. The script's interesting, but it's not terribly sense-making. What I mean to say, is, the script's rubbish, but the *story* is great. The whole film is really rather story and effects driven, but the characters are pretty lacking. Quinn is sort of fun, and Deacon's well he's attractive, but not a lot else. Still, there's more to him than most of the characters, including the titular Blade.<br/><br/>Straight up, just putting out there, I think goth-culture is attractive, so, my aesthetics may go quite a way to influencing my decision in the final score, if you disagree with me, you might want to keep that in mind, seeing as most vampires have at least a little bit of that going on. All that aside though, the opening of Blade is one of the strongest ways a film can start off that I've ever seen. It has basically everything you could want for a modern vampire tale. Including the Blood Rave song, Confusion (Pump Panel Remix) by New Order.<br/><br/>The cinematography was another cool point, lots of ins and outs in a non-nauseating way. Although the fight choreography suffered from a serious case of ""Only-One-Guy-Attacks-At- A-Time"" Syndrome. Come on guys, this ain't Tekken. When there's an army to fight, fight an army. Maybe not all at once, I know that could get a tad pointless, but it really didn't transfer well in this film.<br/><br/>To end with, there's on plot-hole I'd like to bring up, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything too badly, but if you want to go in completely fresh, stop reading. There's one point when Frost says he needs to kill the 12 Elder vamps in a big underground ritual in order to complete his ascendancy into the Blood God (Khorne?), but he kills the leader earlier, on a beach. Okay, so maybe he wasn't counted, and he was actually number 13. But, Frost's lady-friend Mercury kills another with Blade's sword, before the ritual gets started, and nobody seems to care... I am dubious- faced.<br/><br/>After all that though, Blade's a vampire film that's not slow like Nosferatu, and not indescribably awful like Twilight, so for people with tastes like mine, it's certainly worth a geez.<br/><br/>66%<br/><br/>-Gimly"

I don't hear about too much worthy praise for Blade but in time Blade will surely be remembered and appreciated for the generally awesome movie that it is.<br/><br/>Played bestially by Wesley Snipes, Blade is a legendary vampire hunter who is a half-breed, half-man half-vampire, only one of his kind, making him The Daywalker, giving him all the strengths of the vampire but with none of their weaknesses. In his fight against evil, Blade's equipped with an extensive arsenal of blades and guns and special gadgets to stay alive with, and he's a master of the martial arts with superhuman strength and capabilities. Blade's one man army weapon specialist, Whistler, makes all kinds of useful toys for Blade. Deacon Frost is the street smart, book smart, driven bloodthirsty lead villain vampire obsessed with unleashing the Blood God, La Magra. Blade ends up taking a liking to a human who is about to turn, Karen, unless they can find a cure. N'Bushe Wright appears in one of her best roles. She's incredible as Karen. N'Bushe Wright is physically impressive alongside Wesley Snipes. Kris Kristofferson is really awesome in Blade. Kristofferson gives a really moving performance. It's one of his better roles. Stephen Dorff can be found in one of his top roles. Dorff is believable as Deacon Frost and very good.<br/><br/>Blade's razor-sharp from end to end, nicely pieced together with spectacular fight scenes, bass-pounding techno, excellent storyboard, intense action and star-powered acting from Wesley Snipes, Wright, Kristofferson, and Dorff. If you're a fan of this type of a movie and you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT, and HURRY! Blades's a really cool flick!"

","I now own all four of the Blade movies. The three with Snipes are extremely entertaining. He seems to actually know some katana moves (his sword type from the samurai of Japan) or at least someone in the movie did. The leather clothes and the cape are a little over the top but what the heck. Of course the bad guys are really bad and the good guys are almost as bad but only to the those that deserve it, the vampires and the familiars. Kris Kristopherson is great as Whistler. Daniel Logue is way to nuts to be taken seriously which is a shame because I like him. IMDb requires way too many lines as far as I am concerned.

","While engaged in a destructive battle with vampires, half-human/half-vampire Blade teams up with a doctor to stop a renegade from unleashing a powerful creature from vampire lore.<br/><br/>This one could quite possibly be one of the better additions to the vampire saga to come around in a long time, and definitely has a lot going for it due to that. Much of the positives here is on the continuing focus on action gives this one a rather fun feel with a lot of great confrontations, starting out with the spectacular assault on the nightclub as he wipes out dozens of vampires by gunshot, slashing and other weaponry as it starts the film off with such a bang that the mixture of action into the proceedings makes for some entertaining moments right off the bat. As this leads into the shoot-outs in the hospital attempting to take out the charred vampire left in that initial attack, the pace is set-up here for some really thrilling moments here from the shoot-out in their book-room following his capture and eventual escape into the train-station which has some brutal action with his dealings with them, as well as their hideout in the garage which gets some fine brutality mixed amongst the action. Still, the best parts here is the lead-up to the final showcase battle at the ceremonial chamber, from the collection of the council and their set-up along the statues and undertaking his draining for the start of the actual ceremony where the appearance of demon skeletons from their mouths is where this really picks up considerably. Even the action is fun here with fine brawls amongst the guards and the kung-fu battle in the pit before getting to a stylish sword-fight that finishes with a great final death for the group, all of which means this one has a ton of great action scenes that make for a really fun time. What grants this one so much action-packed fun is the main story here, which is a rather novel idea and is carried across wonderfully here, from the concept of the vampires as a society, complete with a hierarchy, rules and guidelines for living undetected. This makes for a stellar universe here as it gives it a big sense of history that's richly deserved here, while other little things that come up here, like the relationship of their helpers or the underground feeding nightclub, one of the film's action highlights, has a novel ring that provides for a clever way to continue on with their heritage but mixed up with a contemporary feel that is frighteningly sensible as well as logical. These here are the film's most enjoyable aspects, though it does have one main problem. The film's only real misstep is tied to the explanation of how he survived the initial attack and how he's the way he is, handled in a very back-handed way that's just thrown into the proceedings without any real attempt or effort, making his back-story all the more confusing and off-putting. Though some of the kills here end up providing a lot of rather fake-looking CGI gore in the process, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise entertaining effort.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a mild sexual act and drug use"

","Before Bryan Singer came along and blew our minds with X-MEN or Sam Raimi wow'd us with SPIDER-MAN, director Stephen Norrington created one of the first good Marvel comic adaptations with BLADE. The series follows the half-human/half-vampire Blade in his on-going battle against the undead with the aid of his mentor Whistler. In the film, Blade confronts Deacon Frost, a vampire who's become fed up with his people's desire to remain in the shadows of humanity. He plans to summon the vampire blood god La Magra and allow vampires to rise to their rightful place over the humans. BLADE is Norrington's first major directing gig and he brings us a killer action/horror film to debut one of Marvel's coolest characters.<br/><br/>With few exceptions, the casting in this film was terrific. Wesley Snipes truly is Blade; I can't think of any other actor that would've personified the character anywhere as well as Snipes did. He's got the cool demeanor, hint of humor, and wicked martial arts skills to bring to the role. Kris Kristofferson's gruff attitude was an inspired choice for Whistler and Stephen Dorff was fun as Frost. The character of Frost reminded me a lot of Kiefer Sutherland in 1987's THE LOST BOYS which probably made me a bit biased because of how fun a movie it was. Dorff was equal parts crazy, arrogant, and evil: all the best qualities in a comic villain (especially a vampire comic villain).<br/><br/>The action in this movie is awesome, with plenty of martial arts (all vampires know martial arts?) and slicing/dicing. Blade's got a nifty arsenal of toys at his disposal, including his glaive, his sword, and a compound called EDTA that had been cooked up by his hematologist associate Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). The EDTA makes for some gory endings for a couple of vampires that cross Blade's warpath. The film's weakness comes in the form of the CG, which has not aged well. Nearly all the CG in the film stands out and pulls you right out of the movie, especially the wraiths in the La Magra summoning scene. I don't know if it was a lack of funds or time but the visual effects still needed a great deal of work."

","If any writer or director wants to make a film about a lesser known comic book hero, then they really need to see Blade and Blade II to see how it should be done. After the disaster that was Batman and Robin, this shows comic books films could be done seriously and was a surprise hit of 1998.<br/><br/>Blade is a half-human, half-vampire. His mother was bitten by a vampire whilst pregnant and he ends up infected. He has all the strengths of a vampire, but he has a sense of humanity and is able to walk in the day (he is nick named 'The Daywalker'). But he has to fight his internal thirst for blood and make sure he is more human then vampire. He works with his mentor and tech guy Whisper (Kris Kristofferson) who hunt vampires. Blade is the muscle, he is a skilled fight and uses weapons like a silver sword to kill vampires. They are also investigating the activities of Declan Frost (Stephen Dorff), a vampire who was turned and wants to bring about a prophecy involving the re-birth of the blood god. A sub-plot also involves Blade saving Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), a hematologist i.e. a blood specialist. She had been bitten by a vampire and on the edge of turning. She offers to find a cure for vampirism, and help creates a new scrum for Blade.<br/><br/>This is a film that proved that David S. Goyer is a talented writer, and that Stephen Norrington have ability as a direct. They made a dark, serious, very violence film with a few little jokes to lighten things up. Stephen Norrington gave the film a dark, yet cool tone, showing a good eye for the setting and there are brilliant action sequences. He has a cool effect for when vampires are killed. The material arts are well done; maybe a little too much MTV style editing, but still very good. Some of the CGI was a little ropy, but the film was made in 1998, and it's budget wasn't as big as other major films of the time; but still pretty fun. Goyer adds a political and social dimension to Blade, involving vampire politics and racism (between true blood vampires and turned vampires). They are themes of corruption, but the biggest theme is Blade fighting his urge. The best vampire stories often have some sort of theme in them. Wesley Snipes is utter cool in this film, showing his fighting skill and delivers good one-liners. He is Blade. He has the look, the skill and the ability to play the role. Blade and Blade II are the best films he has done.<br/><br/>There is also good dance music by Mark Isham. I am personally not a fan of dance music (except for Paul Oakenfold), but in the context of this film, it works really effectively.<br/><br/>A fine action movie."

","I have not had very much experience with the comics, so I cannot make many comparisons to them. When you unleash Snipes, it's pretty hard to mess it up. This manages to lift it beyond that, and while the action(which is never excessive, and always forwards the plot), cool and well-done shoot-outs and awesome, well-choreographed martial arts alike, is all intense, fun and exciting, it does marvelous on almost everything else, as well. From my understanding of the title character, this really nails it(and the gallery, including and beyond that, is magnificent, very colorful and imaginative). The psychology is accurate, and it's also communicated nicely to the audience, not talking down to us and not being too obvious. Design is excellent, the utilitarian approach to the weapons is spot-on. The casting is great, Dorff, Lords and Jover make such good vampires. So does Udo Kier, but A, this isn't the first time he portrays one, and B, everybody who's seen the man in anything could have told you that. For such a subject, this is somewhat different than the traditional movie about the creatures. It is rather bloody, violent and gory, and not everyone will have the stomach for it. The tone is brutal and gritty. There is convincing atmosphere and suspense in this. The acting is a tad mixed, though there are no downright poor performances. CGI isn't bad, it was done on not that huge of a budget considering the amount, and it certainly works. The music is kick-ass. This is nicely stylized, and it doesn't go overboard. The humor is genuinely funny, very natural, and doesn't try too hard. Script is well-written, dialog and story alike. This is paced well, very fast and smooth. The cinematography and editing are flawless and just a little bit creative, without this becoming an experimental film. There is plenty of strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informative commentary track of several people(cutting back and forth between them), two featurettes I will review on their respective entries here on the site, half a dozen minutes or so of random behind-the-scenes footage, and a few short, and spoiler-free, interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who made it, and anyone who enjoys Wesley fighting on-screen. 8/10"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","2","10 January 2009"," The all inclusive vampire-action-sci-fi package
","Vampires have been hands down the most popular subject of ""monster"" related films and books for centuries, their popularity going as far back as the early 1700s though their origin much, much earlier. ""Blade"" is what happens when classic vampire lore meets 90s action movies, a fusion of stylized action and vampire myths. Yes, Blade--the vampire hunter-- carries a shotgun that fires off silver stakes. While stylized action and certainly vampires are nothing new, together they pack an highly entertaining punch.<br/><br/>The Blade universe is a modern one where vampires live among men, turning them to vampires only at a rate that is enough to ensure their survival. But one of these turned vampires, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), wants more for the vampire race and studying an ancient vampire bible, learns of a way he can awaken a blood god that would turn the world population into vampires. Standing in his way is Blade, (Wesley Snipes) a vampire-hunter who is born a sort of half-vampire (his mother was bitten during pregnancy) and possesses all their skills with none of their weaknesses. Hating the creature buried inside him, Blade is motivated to kill them, straight up.<br/><br/>Blade is one of those mysterious, dark, cold and emotionless protagonists. That makes Wesley Snipes perfect for the role. It helps to have not so good actors in these stoic roles because they play them better than anyone else (take Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" for example). While Blade of course is forced to get in touch with his emotions in the film, this of course is not of our concern. What is of our concern is that Snipes kick a lot of ass and look cool doing it, which he certainly does. Sometimes quite humorously, which is always a plus of stylized action. The only other performance worthy of mention is Kris Kristofferson who is typecast as the grumpy old human vampire hunter who makes all the gadgets and would rather shoot himself than become a vampire.<br/><br/>Stephen Norrington (whose biggest credits include creature effects work for James Cameron's ""Alien"") brings Blade's world to life. Norrington brings you everything you could want in a vampire action movie, even if you don't know what that is yet. It's sleek, cool, very bloody and moves at a strong pace. For one thing, ""Blade"" doesn't get dull. David S. Goyer, who wrote the script based on the relatively unknown Marvel Comics character, gives you exactly what you expect from an action script without going overboard on the one-liners. The intrigue of the vampire lore he's created is enough to help you get by the few annoying parts that come up in addition to the unnecessary swearing that was likely included solely because the action would guarantee an R rating anyway.<br/><br/>""Blade"" is not a consummate action hero movie, certainly not by 21st century standards the way the market for these films has exploded and produced some incredible films, but it's fast-paced, entertaining and full of goodies for people who like action and vampire mythology. The special effects are strong for 1998 capabilities too, which doesn't hurt. Basically, it's enough to emerge a winner despite some bad acting and its predictable action hero plot and script. Not even just a winner, but some of that predictability still scores big points even if it's familiar because the movie is very cool."

","i hate protagonists and villains that do flips and kung fu while wearing shiny black leather. i also almost always hate vampires, they're usually pretentious and smarmy. incidentally, this movie doesn't have any moments that are overtly offensive or stupid. so, if you're in the mood for a pointless entertaining action picture, blade can deliver without turning you off too much. <br/><br/>it has better character development than the other three blade flicks. take quinn, for example, the most annoying character in the whole world. he's loud, hip, ugly, and full of lame lines. it's gratifying to see him get profusely abused by blade. quinn gets knocked around left and right, set on fire, both arms cut off, and his face shoved against the side of a speeding train just to name a few. <br/><br/>anyway, there are a couple flukes in the story that i can't get over. for example, at the beginning, blade stops in a shop, talks to some guy about how his serum isn't working. the guy in the shop says ""yeah i had a feeling that would happen."" they do some brotherly fist pound and say their goodbyes. you never see this guy from the shop ever again, even in the sequels. in fact, in blade 3, whistler (blade's father figure) mentions that when he dies, blade will be all alone in a world full of enemies. <br/><br/>also, i don't get why blade has to take serum for his blood lust. why doesn't he just rob a blood bank or maybe even whistler could donate a small amount of blood every now and then. does he have some principal against drinking any kind of blood? or maybe drinking blood would turn him evil... i dunno, maybe the comic explains it. also another thing that bothers me about every vampire movie, is they always say ""this part of the myth isn't true but this part is."" blade says ""crosses and holy water don't do dick"" but garlic and stakes through the heart work. also silver. most movies ignore the garlic myth, though, so it's neat to see a serious vampire movie where garlic blows them up."

","Eric Brooks (Wesley Snipes), better known as Blade, is a half-human, half-vampire ""daywalker"" with all the advantages of being a vampire without most of the side effects (though he still craves blood). As such, he has made it his mission to stop the evil vampires (led by Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier) with the help of his sidekick, Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). As an age-old prophecy comes to fruition, time is of the essence to stop the vampires now... Traci Lords also appears.<br/><br/>This film works, and I'll tell you why it works... because it is a vampire-inspired retelling of the Patrick Swayze classic ""Road House"". Both films feature tough but sensitive leading men who travel from city to city to bust up groups of hooligans intent to make life miserable for those around them. Both has sidekicks who looks like urban cowboys. Both of them have that sidekick killed by the hooligans, leading to greater revenge. Both have the romantic interest be a doctor, specializing in a field that helps the hero (surgery for Swayze, blood for Blade). There are some obvious differences, but the general theme is more or less the same... this is Swayze's Dalton character if he were a vampire hunter.<br/><br/>And that's really the selling point of this film. Sure, the vampires are cool and the story is cool. And Stephen Dorff is incredibly cool. But if you don't look at this film through the lens of ""Road House"" you'll be forced to look at through the lens of ""The Matrix"" with all the stunt fighting and bullet-dodging, not to mention the ubiquitous late 1990s techno music which seems like it was stolen directly from ""The Matrix""'s soundtrack. And any film that falls into this trap has no chance to survive in the long term.<br/><br/>Did I like this film? Heck yeah, I really enjoyed it. Vampires, Udo Kier, Stephen Dorff and Wesley Snipes' best role since ""Demolition Man"" (though still not quite as good). Traci Lords was here (but unfortunately over eighteen). If you like vampires and you like action films, this is probably the best you're going to get... I can't really think of another film. And as far as comic adaptations go, this was one of the better ones, opening the gateway for the hugely successful Spider-Man and X-Men franchises."

","To put it bluntly, Blade is a very entertaining movie, that never goes down in gear. It feels like a 90 minute roller coaster ride, and there's plenty of loops, believe me. The movie takes a lot of otherwise unrelated elements, such as Vampirism, Martial Arts, Techno, and mixes it perfectly. The opening scene is a great example of this blend, and is something that you've probably not seen anywhere before! The combat scenes are wonderfully choreographed, and the Techno beats suits the style perfectly, making it a very heart-pounding experience.<br/><br/>The acting is also surprisingly good, especially Wesley Snipes as Blade. He doesn't overdo his character, and he doesn't need to, because just his pure physical presence suits his character perfectly. He doesn't have to many lines to juggle with either, but he manages to pull his few quotes off quite admirably. The saying that looks can explain more than words especially works in Snipes favor this time, and he does a great job of keeping his character believable. Stephen Dorff also does a good job of playing a down-and-dirty villain, and his tone is just perfect for Deacon Frost. He's a stereo-typical madman, who's attitude almost is a complete opposite of Blade's silent nature. Even Kris Kristofferson manages to pull it of quite nicely, and (unless you're heart is made of stone), you can't help but feel a little sad about his condition after Frost's visit. It's been a while since i've seen him act great, so it was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>The only thing that fails in Blade is the story. It has some really good potential, but ultimately throws it all away in the ending, which is one the most cheesy and uninspired endings of all time. The pacing in the ending just seems a little too bumpy to make the final clash between Blade and Frost feel climactic, and although there is a little twist in the ending, it's nothing that will leave you in awe, and (in my opinion) doesn't contribute a hole lot to the story's unfolding.<br/><br/>All in all a very entertaining movie, with a lot of cool and memorable scenes, some nice fights, and even some good acting. Unfortunately the story doesn't quite compare to the rest of the film, which is sad, because it had so much potential to be better. But hey, let's face it! The story isn't the most important piece in a horror/action movie, so it's gonna be a 8/10 this time."

","Blade is the first in the Blade trilogy(Blade,Blade2, Blade:Trinity)It stars Wesley Snipes in the title role as a human vampire hybrid,who has (almost)none of the vampires' weaknesses and all their strengths.Blade has made it his mission to hunt down and destroy the evil vampires.His one weakness is his thirst for human blood.Blade is aided in his quest by Abraham Whistler,Played by Kris Kristofferson,who has developed a serum to curb Blade's blood lust and to keep his vampire side in check.Stephen Dorrf,plays Deacon Frost,the main baddie and Blade's adversary.Snipes is very convincing as an action hero,he is athletic,charismatic,and the camera loves him.Kristofferson is cast well in the supporting role of Whistler.Dorrf is also very convincing as the villain.he too,is very charismatic.Stephen Norrington directed the film.his previous directing experience was 1995's ""Death Machine"".he also directed""The League of Extrordinary Gentleman""(2003).his other credit include special effects work on films such as ""Hardware,Aliens, and the Exorcist:the Beginning,as well as makeup effects for ""Hellraiser:Bloodline"".David S Goyer wrote the script for ""Blade"".he previously wrote the script for The crow:City of angels,as well ""Blade 2"" and ""Blade:Trinity""He also wrote the screenplay and story for Batman Begins,as well as the story for its sequel,2008's Dark Knight"".anyway,back to ""Blade"".the film moves along at a brisk pace,is well directed and well written,with good dialogue.the film is also well photographed,is visually very appealing.the tone of the film is dark,without being oppressive and the music is appropriate.there is a lot of graphic vampire violence(the film is quite blood soaked at times)and some language.and obviously there are many action sequences,sometimes over the top,but this is no criticism.it works well with this movie.finally, the special effects are plentiful and generally well done.overall,a very well execute movie in the vampire genre. a strong 8/10"

","When i first decided to watch BLADE, i was expecting the same old cheap thrills that you get from almost any other vampire film. The truth about this film is that it is not just the tired old vampire story that so many movies seem to be following these days. BLADE not only goes where no other vampire movie has before but does it with style. This film even dares to change the background of vampires in some ways, making it more believable and gripping.<br/><br/>In this film you may expect some guy hunting vampires in ancient tombs or supernatural worlds. Personally, I think that the best thing about this film is that it brings the story closer to home. The story includes night clubs, even outdoor parks and places we visit sometimes regularly. That is probably the best thing that the creators could have done to the story, again, making it more believable. <br/><br/>The action in this film also is not anything like what most people would expect. The fight scenes are extremely well done and planned out perfectly while keeping it so that it doesn't go too far.<br/><br/>When watching this movie, I can't stress enough watching it with an open mind. While it is a vampire story, it doesn't follow the guidelines of one. So if you are going to watch it and compare it to every other vampire movie that you may like, you won't enjoy it as much.<br/><br/>But all in all, its brilliant."

John Carpenter.<br/><br/>Blade is a refreshing entry into the vampire genre, using a mixture of pseudo-science and urban myth to establish vampirism in a stylish, modern context. It's also a good superhero movie, a sort of gory, garish Batman.<br/><br/>Snipes is note perfect, all snarling anger wound up tight inside painful self-control.

","Half human and half vampire, Blade is an unstoppable force. He hunts down vampires to save humanity. Since most are familiar with the background and story of Blade, I will tell you about the film. Wesley Snipes as Blade is perfect for the film. I can't even picture anyone else playing him. Kris Kristofferson plays an awesome ass kickin' old man in the movie as well. Frost, played by Stephen Dorff is the main villain in the film who at first appears to be a weak adversary but actually is quite good as far as acting goes. There is plenty of action and killing in the movie. Never is there a dull moment. It isn't so much scary as it is action packed. You'll get your guns your knives, your hand to hand combat, and a nice body count to end the movie. A decent amount of gore as well, so if that is what you are looking for then you won't be let down. The performances are good, the action is great, and the story is great, which leads to a pretty good movie. If you end up liking this one, see the second one as it is ten times better."

","This has to be one of the Wesley Snipe's best performances ever. The action and fight choreography is surprisingly excellent. Snipes does execute them with great grace in order to make it fairly convincing for viewers and exhibits mastery over the sword and other weaponary. The special effects are above average and mostly good. This movie is very very dark, perhaps one of the darkest I've ever seen. The biggest weakness is the main villain who is some sort of punk and doesn't come across as scary nor can he fight convincingly. The storyline isn't anything great and is somewhat weird but passable. Despite several weaknesses, Blade does come across as a good entertainer with fairly high production values."
"carlmorgan40","10","0","2","9 July 2006"," top action film
","In my opinion blade is the best vampire action film ever to enter the market. It changed the view on vampires from being thought of as old white faced cloak wearing individuals and now they are thought of as a criminal underworld with ranks and levels and their own dark world which in my opinion add so many different textures to the bad guys instead of being the one dimensional characters they were in all other previous films.<br/><br/>The choreography of the fight scenes is quite amazing and even though they are unrealistic they were done with a bit of humour which added to the all around enjoyment of the film. Wesley Snipes best film to date and i would say a must see film for anyone to watch who wants to enjoy themselves and who doesn't take films too seriously. If you enjoy this film you would also enjoy the rest of the trilogy and i would also recommend van helsing or any of the underworld films."

","Blade stands as not just one of my favourite films, but also my fav vampire movie. It's gritty, grimy, dark and gives you a very original concept of a world overrun by neck suckers. His character is a no quibbles Hunter Killer. He's cold and un feeling when it comes to vampires and thats the way he should be. He got more cute and cuddly as the other movies were made, i bet he was totally against the direction his character was heading. Blade was an 18. Blade 2 was a 15. Gay-ed TRINITY a God damn 12. - Hollywood AT IT'S WORST. Not your average action flick by any means, it paints a grim picture of blades world and you get the picture Blade is in over his head and that the fight (his fight) will never be over. I would have been quite content with this being a one off - as exited by prospect of sequels as i was - they didn't need to happen, and even though they did they take nothing away from the triumph of this first movie."
"north-julie","9","0","2","27 April 2006"," Stunning effects and action. Blade is perfect popcorn pleasure
","When a young man is taken by his mysterious girlfriend to an underground rave, little does he know that she is secretly a vampire and that all of the other 'ravers' are blood sucking beasts. But don't worry- there's Blade to save the day.<br/><br/>And spectacularly so.<br/><br/>Blade. armed with a sword, shotgun, handgun and shuriken type weapon, rips through half of the occupants, taking them out in a flash of brilliant effects and expertly staged hand to hand combat. The vampires disintegrate into dust and Blade moves on.<br/><br/>This opening action scene is one of the best ever, and sets a dark but constantly entertaining tone for the rest of the movie. Directed by Stepthen Norrington, who went onto make Sean Connery flop LXG, Blade came out before The Matrix and in terms of coolness, beats Keanu's film hands down.<br/><br/>When vampire Deacon Frost (Stepthen Dorff) plans to resurrect a long dead vampire god, Blade and his mentor/sidekick Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) use their heavy arsenal to stop him. With doctor Karen Jenson onboard (N Bushe Wright) Blade also searches a cure for his thirst. No, not that kind of thirst...<br/><br/>Blade, played to understated perfection by Wesley Snipes, is a half blood, or 'daywalker'. His pregnant mother was bitten before giving birth to him (it turns out later it was Frost who bit her) and he has been given all of the strength of a vampire, and none of their weaknesses (daylight, garlic, silver). Unfortunately he also has their thirst, and he uses a garlic compound to quell his thirst. Snipes is physically able to perform in the film, and with Blade a man of few words he has no problem conveying the human emotions.<br/><br/>Kristofferson is effective as Whistler, and his death scene late in the movie is accompanied by superb melancholic music. Dorff, while not the beefiest of bad guys, is able to give Frost a youthful exuberance and cocky persona that sits as a perfect opposite to Snipes and his brooding.<br/><br/>Wright is decent support as the token female, working away on a cure while also letting Blade bite her when he can't find any serum. Donal Logue is annoying as Frosts sidekick, but thats the point. However, when he finally gets his comeuppance its a great comedic moment as he charges at Blade and gets decapitated by an acid edged piece of rope.<br/><br/>The fights and effects are superbly staged, with the nightclub massacre one of the highlights of action film history. The gleaming white tiles end up blood splattered as Blade takes no prisoners. Later Blade jumps off as building, grabs onto a speeding train and gets put in some kind of ancient tomb style device. The action never lets up, and Norrington delivers well with his limited budget.<br/><br/>Blade, unlike some other action heroes, decides to take a life when he could easily spare it. When launching his one man assault on Frosts headquarters, he annihilates the human bodyguards of Frost and discovers one on the floor lying injured. Blade points his shotgun in the guards face, and the guard shouts 'no! i just work for them!' before Blade blasts his head off. Its an incredibly powerful moment, coming after Whistlers death and filling Blade with anger and a lust for revenge. He is a great hero, but not infallible.<br/><br/>This is a great action movie, and there is no chance of someone watching it and being left bored. Its perfect Friday night entertainment, and deserves to be loved.<br/><br/>A splendid action epic."
"m0rg16","8","0","2","22 April 2006"," Norrington is a genius
","You'll not find a better pop corn flick, no matter how hard you try. Blade is an excellent film from the Kung Fu inspired fight scenes to the acting of Wesley Snipes.<br/><br/>Blade is a Daywalker, a human with some vampire powers. He has their strength and their regeneration power, but also their thirst. He hunts vampires for a living and that's pretty much the plot. In this film, he goes up against the villainous Deacon Frost who wants to put an end to mankind once and for all and rule over them. Even though Stephen Dorff won't strike you as the coolest villain ever, he is still way more memorable than anything the other Blade films will offer.<br/><br/>Kris Kristofferson plays Blade's mentor Whistler who is an aging vampire hunter himself. Even though Kristofferson is just an old country singer, he's definitely ideal for his role. Some of his lines are just golden.<br/><br/>Stephen Norrington definitely cooked together one of the best action films I've ever seen. Now it's not something that will etch itself onto your mind and stay there forever but as far as dumb action films go this is great. The action scenes are obviously inspired by kung fu films where western slug fights are matched with eastern camera controls. Not an abuse of quick cuts that Hollywood films usually prefer and instead we get a full view of the fight which is very effective.<br/><br/>Other than that, Blade is in this film much different than in the lackluster sequels. Here he is an animal, his hatred for vampires is obvious and he'll do anything and kick anyones ass to get them. Again, this was not present in the sequels where Blade is instead a show off. He spins his sword in nine different cool ways before finally cutting and nobody knows why. That's why you should see this film, and avoid the sequels at all costs. Norrington is one of the best action directors out there, and it's to bad he hasn't done more films.<br/><br/>Rent or buy this film. But at least see it. It's an excellent pop corn action flick. As good as you'll find, actually.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Blade, Wesley Snipes' better hero performance, continues the story of Dracula in a twisted but cool, ass-kicking way. This is not your father's typical vampyre film. ""Blade"" is the newer & fresher version with vampires living in luxury, blending into every facet of society without much notice. Wall Street, off-shore accounts, condos, fancy cars, & club-hopping is the flavor that is favored in this film, neighbor. There has never been a vampire hunter more skilled, more prepared, and more ruthless than Blade. Blade has a score to settle with the Vampyre Clan, and that is the bloodsucker who killed his mother & made him who he became. <br/><br/>In ""Blade"", Blade is the tortured soul, half-human & half vampire hunter from the comics who takes on a renegade vampire Deacon Frost & his posse of blood sucking idiots bent on human & the vampire kingdom domination. The Vampyre leader, Dragonetti, thinks that Frost is a major risk to his plans & orders him to take care in his behaviors. Blade has trained most of his life to effectively destroy any & all vampires in his path. He has become the one man all bloodsuckers fear, and with good reason. The heavily tattoed Blade hates a part of himself & is on a mission for a cure to end his thirst. Along with fellow hunter & father figure Abraham Whistler, Blade goes out on nightly suck-head fests kicking all the vampire ass he can to a sweet soundtrack & fabulous martial arts choreography, not to mention using the most technological weaponry. Blade, taking rare pity, saves the life of newly bitten hematologist Karen Jensen & takes her back to his hideout. Karen proves her worth by creating a vampire blood weapon which explodes them once injected. Blade & Karen find out that Frost is making big plans for the Vampyre underworld from Frost's wannabe & the archives beneath the city. Frost captures Dragonetti, takes him to the beach, & watches him burst into flames during a morning sunrise. Now that Dragonetti is dethroned, Frost takes over the vampire hierarchy & captures Blade and Karen, he beckons to use Blade's blood to release La Magra, the Vampyre God & envelope his power. Frost also assembles the entire Vampyre Council to use in summoning the Vampyre God. Blade, severely drained of blood, meets his birth mother, who was turned by Frost when she was pregnant. Blade releases his mother from her curse & gets a blood power-up from Karen. Once his strength is regained, Blade takes on vampire soldiers & finally meets Deacon Frost, freshly upgraded to Vampyre God (incredible fight choreography). After a spectacular final battle, Blade destroys his nemesis Deacon Frost & saves the world.<br/><br/>Blade will not disappoint the hard-core vamp fans & does his karate best to impress. Good ensemble cast with Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, Stephen Dorff, & Traci Lords. Great costume design, ultra-cool tattoos, & kick-ass weapons (beautiful sword) designed for Snipes, who plays his role with a superb tough-guy flair & quiet inner storm.

","I've never seen Mr Snipes in acting, but I will say it first: His performance in Blade was fantastic. This movie has you on your toes from the opening credits, and you'll probably have a fear of the dark after watching.<br/><br/>So, the story. Keep in mind I've only seen it twice, hence my copy of the story may be off: Vampires. A night-going, light and garlic hating and very powerful, yet brutal breed of blood-suckers. Scary enough? Imagine the gore with the aid of special effects! Anyway, the vampires are rising up, what with the aid of the non-pure (meaning, wasn't born a vampire) Frost, a cunning and cruel man with intentions of bringing the Blood Lord back to dominate the earth.<br/><br/>So who be Blade, you ask? Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire whilst pregnant, she gave birth before dieing. Blade swore revenge, yadda yadda yadda. But he's one kick butt character. I mean, you combine Aragorn from lord of the rings, Neo from the matrix, and Jackie Chan, and you described blade.<br/><br/>But his role is critical to the vampire's domination. Blade is a ""day-walker"", meaning he can walk without burning up from the light (like vampires). If his blood is spilt and falls to the hidden altar, the blood lord will arise.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. There's so much fighting, you'll want to grab a stick and join in on the carnage with your friends. With a lot of violence, blood, bullet, and wicked sword and knife skills, our hero will blow off heads, slash hearts, and ward off the vampires with his evil garlic, for justice! The performance by Wesley Snipes really fits the character. A big beefy man that shows little remorse for other people, but underneath the bitterness has a heart of gold and a sense of humor."

There is a great emotional scene in the finale between Snipes and Kristofferson, and if you don't like blood and gore stay away from this film!, plus Snipes was the perfect choice to play Blade in my opinion!. This is unquestionably one of Snipe's best films in my opinion and one of the best vampire films out there, with an amazing performance from Wesley Snipes and i say it's a must see! for everyone.<br/><br/>The Direction is great!. Stephen Norrington does a great job here, with awesome stylish camera work, fantastic angles, great use of colors, great zoom in's and zoom outs, awesome slow mo shots, and lots of other great shots as well!, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace!.<br/><br/>This is a gore fest!. We get hundreds and hundreds of decomposing vamps (CGI but still cool!),tons of extremely gory vampire bites, harsh bloody beatings,gory birth,nasty fat bubbly creatures,tons of bloody stabbings, tons of impaling's, blood showers,tons of slicing and dicing,tons of cut off limbs,extremely bloody gory wounds,ripped out teeth, someone is drained of there blood,tons of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,extremely gory wounds,knife in the eye, knife in the head,bloody slit wrists, decapitation, body is cut in half only to reattach it'self seconds later!,throat slashing,2 incredibly gory face explosions,nasty burnt corpse, blood everywhere, and more it never stops!.<br/><br/>The Acting is wonderful!. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is perfectly suited to the role, is extremely likable, kicked that ass, is fantastic in the acting department, had great chemistry with both Kris Kristofferson and N'Bushe Wright, had a great emotional scene with Kristofferson in the finale, and just did an amazing job overall, no one else could have played this role but Snipes! (Snipes Rules!!!!). Stephen Dorff is awesome as the main villain, like Snipes had some cool one liners, was totally OTT, is very menacing, looked very cool, and really surprised me by giving an awesome performance!. Kris Kristofferson is excellent as Whistler, he had great chemistry with Snipes, and had a very cool character i loved him!. N'Bushe Wright is very pretty, and did very well with what she had to do, and also had great chemistry with Snipes i liked her lots. Donal Logue was annoying and hammed it up big time i hated him. Udo Kier added class and as usual was extremely creepy!, i just wished he had more to do (Kier rules). Traci Lords(Racquel),Kevin Patrick Walls(Officer Krieger),Sanaa Lathan(Blade's mother), all do fine with what they had to do. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5"

","Being a fan of both snipes and the comic i was very excited about blade hitting the cinema screens. one thing that particularly encouraged me to watch the film was the eighteen certificate, this meant that the action, violence and general content would not be watered down to fit a pre pubescent audience, unlike spiderman or x men etc. and what a joy it was!! from the opening massacre to the final fight blade is not just an action movie but a film that deals with one man coming too terms with what he is. the action and special effects in the film are eye popping with snipes pulling off some genuine slick and fluid moves. the focal point of this movie is snipes and his skill with the sword, the man is a joy too behold while he decapitates vampires. the style of the film is good, moves at a lightening pace and also quality is bought to the cast by kristofferson, snipes and frost. a must for fans of comics that like something darker and a lot more violent."

","This is one of those rare comic-book movies that really works. In many, the fairly one dimensional characters just seem poorly written, but in Blade, with the heavy duty action and thumping techno soundtrack, it just seems to work.<br/><br/>Blade is one of the great underrated characters in Marvel comics, and Wesley Snipes brings him to life and plays the role with such gusto that he really makes the part his own, to the extent that I really cannot imagine anybody else in that role. Blade is one of those great anti-heroes that makes you feel that maybe you shouldn't be rooting for him, but you cannot help doing so anyway. Without giving anything away, I think that the opening scene is one of the greatest character introductions ever.<br/><br/>Unusually for a comic-book movie, the characters and plot manage to hold together until the end and I for one, after seeing it for the first time on TV, immediately bought the DVD.<br/><br/>Blade is a fast action thriller that never lets up. I loved this movie and I would argue that it's better than either of its sequels."

","Blade is the movie that made me start collecting movies. I had seen a little bit of it when I was 12 and it gave me nightmares. But four years later, I rediscovered it when I bought the DVD and it quickly became one of my favorite films. What I saw blew my mind: This movie was absolutely awesome! It had everything a kick-ass action movie should have and then some! Blade is a dark, bloody, testosterone-filled action film from start to finish with a character that epitomizes badass.<br/><br/>The opening scene in the nightclub sets the tone for not only this film, but for the entire Blade series. The action and fight scenes in this movie are intense, kinetic and well-executed with crazy stunts, impressive martial arts, and blood and ash flying everywhere. Blade has a wild arsenal with some truly amazing weapons, particularly the stake launching shotgun and the glaive (S-shaped boomerang thing) that he uses to their full potential. Blade moves so fast that sometimes it seems like a blur of leather and silver. Throughout the entire film Blade stylishly deals out insane amounts of punishment and death in some very inventive ways, especially with the E.D.T.A., a chemical that causes vampires to explode (use your imagination). You'll be cheering for Blade as he destroys any and all vampires that get in his way.<br/><br/>This movie is very bloody. Vampires nastily disintegrate into ash after being blown away or impaled. Limbs are chopped of many times. Vampires literally rip out your throat when the feed on you. And did I mention that vampires explode into chunky heaps of blood and guts? If you like blood and gore, this movie will satisfy any gore-hound.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes IS Blade. No other actor could be Blade. He has the look, the voice, the demeanor, and the badass personality to make Blade entirely believable and extremely cool. When he puts on the leather trench coat and the sunglasses, he becomes Blade. In this movie, Snipes evolves the character of Blade and shows some of his human side, but not before killing as many 'suck heads' as possible. Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost does a great job, even though he doesn't pose too much of a threat to Blade because he is so small and pale. Dorff has the menacing and brutal Deacon Frost down perfectly. N'Bushe Wright does a good job as Karen, as does Donal Logue, who provides plenty of comic relief after his repeated run-ins with Blade. Kris Kristofferson is excellent as Blade's hardened mentor Abraham Whistler. The guy is at least 70 years old, but he could definitely beat the crap out of someone half his age.<br/><br/>Stephen Norrington shot the movie very stylishly. Everything has a blue-gray industrial feel to it, which suits the dark, tortured character of Blade perfectly. We only see daytime once or twice the entire film, which I thought was great, since it's how Blade and the vampires live. Norrington also stages some truly spectacular scenes, like in the subway and in the temple of La Magra. I really enjoyed his use of fast forward shots that show the city turning from day to night. Very nice, Mr. Norrington.<br/><br/>Followed by two sequels: Blade II in 2002, which is just as awesome and also extremely stylish, and Blade: Trinity in 2004, which is also pretty good.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: <br/><br/>Blade is an outstanding action movie, with kinetic action, great special effects, a top-notch performance by Wesley Snipes, and a dark and gritty visual style. One of my top ten movies."

","Blade is exactly what any action fan should be looking for. Stephen Norrington is a underrated director who has a eye for quick and effective action. For this movie, he also has a great cast backing him up. Wesley Snipes played the tortured anti-hero to the hilt, showing that he can act and do much of his own action as well. Kris Kristofferson plays his mentor and father figure, Whistler, very well too, adding background to the story. In the way of villains, Stephen Dorff plays Frost, the vampire with a plan for destruction. Not Academy worthy, but adds depth, being the yin to Snipes' yang. With everything from costumes to stunts backing the movie up as well as expected, this is one for any action fan, from junkies to anyone looking for some one night thrills."

","I like horror films, and this is pretty much Dracula meets Kill Bill. Wesley Snipes plays Eric Brooks, also known as Blade, he is a defender of the human race who kills vampires with his huge blade and excellent martial arts skills. The only twist is that he used to be a vampire himself before Abraham Whistler (Kris Sristofferson) transformed him to the good side. Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) was the victim of a vampire, her mother was even bitten by one, this explains her birth mark. Blade looks after her as she hides from other vampires. Meanwhile, villain leader of the vampire gang Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), plans to suck the blood out of all humans with his huge army of blood suckers. The violence is really good, the digital effects are intriguing, the martial arts are cool, and Wesley Snipes is the perfect actor for the role. Wesley Snipes was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!"

","""Blade"" is the best of the series and loaded with action and martial arts. Blade (Wesley Snipes)came from an unusual birth: his mother was attacked by a vampire and dies giving birth to him, resulting in Blade being half vampire/half human. With his mentor/weapons master Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade is on a mission to hunt and destroy vampires that run the city. Seems that these are not your typical vampires: They're like the Mafia. Lead by the Elder vampire Dragonetti (Udo Kier, who seems to make a career out of playing bloodsuckers), the vampire organization has their fangs into many different pies, and also own the cops. Of course, Dragonetti's pain in the neck is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff, playing it cool), who believes that humans are their meal ticket and shouldn't be coddled. Frost is also digging into the legend of La Magra, the blood god that will pretty much wipe out humanity, and Blade's blood is the trigger to releasing La Magra. Blade, with the help of Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a scientist that helps Blade by creating a neat weapon to fight the bloodsuckers off, goes into battle, but not before he discovers a secret connection between him and Frost.<br/><br/>Action packed and loaded, and interesting twists to vampire mythology (When disposing a vampire to the sun, Frost and Co. watch by wearing heavy sunblock and motorcycle outfits.

","Blade is one mean brother who is half human, half vampire. He has all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. During the night he kicks vampire ass all over the city. Lucky he's on our side!! The first and easily the best in the trilogy, BLADE is wall to wall action from the opening scene (at a vampire dance party) to the closing credits. Blade must find and destroy Deacon Frost before he becomes a vampire god! Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, and is backed up by solid performances by Kris Kristofferson as his mentor Whistler. Stephen Dorff tries his best but in my opinion is miscast as Deacon Frost. He looks like a stiff breeze could blow him over and is in no way threatening. Aside from this BLADE is a very slick, highly enjoyable horror / action flick!"
"blonde_ambition","7","0","1","9 May 2005"," One of the better modern-day vampire movies
","We've kind of been overdosed on vampire movies in recent years, most of which being total The Lost Boys rip offs, but Blade is probably the best of the new spate of vampire films. It's about a man named Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is a vampire slayer. Ironically, Blade's mother was attacked by a vampire while pregnant with him. Seeing as he was not directly attacked, he is now a half vampire; basically he is a vampire but has blood substitute to eat, and is referred to by vampires as ""the daywalker."" On the baddie side is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who isn't happy with all the pure-blood vampires (lead by Udo Kier)ruling the vampire kind, so takes over with his own little gang and tries to resurrect something evil known as La Magra.<br/><br/>Fast paced and intense, it's clear to see why it has become so popular and Wesley Snipes is fantastic in the lead, plus the leather-clad look suits him. And Dorff, as his nemeses, surprised me. Despite playing a baddie that seems like yet another David-from-The-Lost-Boys rip off, he is very good at portraying that somewhat evil yet not pantomime-esquire baddie. And he clearly loves playing the role. Of the supporting cast, Udo Kier and Donal Logue are the most entertaining; Kier (once again playing a vampire) delivering the sort of subtle evil performance he has been famed for and, in some lights, does look incredibly creepy, even though he's not really portrayed as a baddie at all, and Logue is wonderfully upbeat and frantic as one of Frost's little cronies.<br/><br/>If the movie does have any drawbacks, at two hours, for some people it can get tedious, and the obese vampire is absolutely hideous, but the movie is so fast paced you probably won't have time to get bored, and that hideous vampire is only in it for about two minutes, plus you can't help but sympathise with it when Karen (Blade's love interest, played by N'Bushe Wright) is pretty mean to it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very watchable movie that you will most probably enjoy."

","The action sequences in this movie are some of the best that I have ever seen. Wesley Snipes really put in work to make this a blockbuster film. Even though the vampires are not real vampires, it still appeals to everyone. We all know that vampires do not die from silver and garlic. I do not who came up with that. That is the only bad part. The first sequence set the tone in a way that I have never seen in my entire life. Blade let be known that he is the ""Daywalker"". Stephen Dorff is very good as Lord Deacon Frost. Blade is even more interesting when he loses his blood and then regains it. The sword-fighting scene was kind of wack. That is the only slow part of this film. The guns and martial arts make this a smash hit. Truly, an action classic!!!!!!!!"

","The premise of this movie didn't look very interesting to say the least. So it was only natural that i was skeptical when viewing this for the first time. But i was actually surprised at how entertaining this movie turned out to be! Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half man, half Vampire who hunts evil Vampires and try to protect humans from the bloodthirsty creatures of the night. Now however he has become the hunted one. His special half-breed blood is interesting to the Vampires since they think it can be used to summon the mighty blood-god.<br/><br/>There is mainly one reason why this movie works so well. And that is the action-scenes. There is a frenzied pace here that just keeps going throughout the whole movie. The acting is of course over the top, but still suitable to the movie. Stephen Dorff is entertaining as a Vampire leader, Wesley Snipes is suitably hard and composed as the hard-case Blade. There is some gore in this movie, but i think it's balanced quite nicely. It never becomes excessive.<br/><br/>So watch this movie for the heart-pumping action and high pace. It's not movie of the year, and it's not Oscars material. But entertaining it is. I rate it 7/10."

Wesley snipes plays the role well and looks the part. the story is over the top with a 'hip' bad guy played with relish by Stephan Doriff. the fight at the end is great, and Wesley snipes' attitude adds humour to not only that but the whole film. if this film hadn't tried to be a horror but being an action instead id have given it 8 but the attempts at scary moments makes the film seem worse off. but the blood shedding fight scenes and good acting adds depth and ill give 7/10."

","I have no idea why I had never seen the ""Blade"" films before, especially since it is based on a comic book, (Marvel at that) and a relatively obscure one from the 1970's/80's at that. However, it was decided by my boyfriend and one of his friends that since ""Blade: Trinity"" was coming out this week that it was about time to get up to speed. Generally, it was a pretty good experience.<br/><br/>Directed by Stephen Norrington (""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") and starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff and Kris Kristofferson (did I ever think I would be saying those words?), ""Blade"" involves a vampire hunter (the title character, played by Wesley Snipes) who has a little of the vampire blood running in his own veins. His mother was bitten by a vampire while she was pregnant with Blade, who was subsequently born a ""half-breed""; half vampire  half human. He has the strength and thirst of a vampire, but he is able to walk around in daylight and ages like a human. Together with Abraham Whistler (Kristofferson), a fellow vampire hunter who took Blade in when he was 13 and raised him/trained him, they a pitted against Deacon Frost, (Dorff) a ""young"" vampire who is not only super cool, but super ambitious as well. He needs Blade's blood to summon La Magra, the blood monster, which would enable him to reign over humans, rather than exist among them, as vampires have been doing for centuries.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by how stylish and fun this film was to watch. It was slick and Blade is a cool character. The techno score was very appropriate and added to the great action scenes. I particularly thought the early scene at the rave/bloodbath was great. It really kick-started the fast pace of the film and gave us enough background without spelling everything out for us. The only real criticisms I had were in the CGI area  the whole blood monster/antidote thing was pretty over-the-top and should have either been scaled down a bit to work within the production's ability, or handled in a different way completely, because the result was very cartoonish, but not in a positive way.<br/><br/>See this film if you like action films. I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to horror films (read: wuss) and I wasn't scared or startled once. This is a fun, sleek film that was definitely worthy of a franchise. 7/10 --Shelly"

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","1","29 June 2004"," The first of the decent modern vampire movies
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Looking all the way back to the book ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker, vampires have been this fairy tale monster which humanity has been fascinated by. Skipping forward to 1922 and the Vampire made it's debut on the big screen in ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"". Since this first film, we've had countless different Hammer Horror films, mostly staring Christopher Lee, until in 1998, the way of the Vampire took a new direction. This direction was of the Vampire in the modern world, and that new film was ""Blade"".<br/><br/>In ""Blade"", the world is as it is today. During the day humanity walks around, ""like cattle"", living their lives. At nighttimes however, there is an alternative nightlife. This life, the modern vampire, feeds off humanity, but tends to keep to itself. There is a link however, between the Vampire and Humanity. That link is a human-vampire hybrid called Blade (Wesley Snipes). Blade's mother was bitten during pregnancy and as a result Blade (also known as Eric Brooks or ""The Daywalker"") was given the vampire's strength, it's regenerative powers and it's hunger for blood, whilst simultaneously able to walk in the Sun. One other characteristic Blade has picked up from his freak birth is a hatred for Vampires as a species. With this in mind, our hero travels around the world slaughtering vampires and causing chaos in his wake.<br/><br/>OK, from the offset, ""Blade"" gives the impression that it will be a very cool film. With a nightclub scene and flowing blood, followed by well choreographed violence, this film gets going from the very start. From this point in the film onwards, we are dealt vast quantities of dark, powerful violence which never relents until the very end.<br/><br/>Perhaps inspiring to a small degree the black coats and the style in the following years ""The Matrix"", this film provides a sense of chic for the viewer. Stephen Dorff in particular as the fabulously evil Deacon Frost shows us how cool and how fashionable the vampire world can be. In fact, combining ""Blade"", it's more laidback and funny sequel and 2003's ""Underworld"" into one fashion show would be a great idea, simply since in all three films, I find it hard to think of a young looking vampire who doesn't demonstrate at least some sense of style. By giving this race of creatures an element of the sophisticated, Hollywood has brought them fast and furiously into the twenty-first century.<br/><br/>Finally, if the style of this film is going to be truly praised, as well as the outfits, the breathtaking martial arts choreography has to be mentioned. In the last couple of years, there's no denying that there have been a lot of films with this specialist kind of fighting. Copying primarily from films featuring past masters like the late, great Bruce Lee, this recent idea of films containing complicated, sophisticated fight scenes is truly brilliant. With people like Woo-ping Yuen who choreographed not only ""Wo hu cang long"" (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") but ""The Matrix"" and the ""Kill Bill"" films, cinema has come a long way. Yuen has been involved in film since 1971, but whilst his talents are no doubt legendary in Asia (especially since he was also responsible for ""Jui kuen"" or ""Drunken Master"" from 1978), it must only surely be since his more recent works in America that his talents are recognised the world around. In ""Blade"" amazingly enough, it is not Woo-ping Yuen who does the martial arts choreography, but the man who does just as amazing a job is the star himself, Mr Wesley Snipes. Down as the Martial Arts Choreographer in the credits, Mr Snipes provides a superb job, giving us some beautiful movements in which Blade destroys his opposition with minimal ease.<br/><br/>So to summarise, whilst the notion of the Vampire might not be a new one, it was thanks to films like ""Blade"" that the creature found a new lease of life. Relocated to the modern age and placed in a sharp, stylish outfit, the vampire moved into the twenty-first century with sophistication. Add to this style, the classic martial arts forms and ""Blade"" was always going to be a winner. This film is ultimately, just plain cool."

Snipes is excellent as the stone cold Blade, a half man half vampire with a mission,actually its more of a crusade to rid the world of all blood sucking Vampires. Blade isn't alone, Kris Kristofferson backs him up as whistler his weapon maker and mentor. Based in a world where the underworld is secretly run by vampires Blade uses all his super-human skills and weaponry to fight the war nobody knows about. The war against Vampires. With superb martial arts fight sequences and sword fights Wesley Snipes kicks and slashes his way to a climactic ending. You won't be comparing this one to Buffy."

","Superhero films usually end up a tad disappointing. Lets be completely honest here, the only REALLY good epic superhero film so far is Superman (Chris Reeve). Batman looked great but was dull, Spider-Man (always the coolest superhero) was pretty good, but imagine how good Spider-Man would have been if his film had been directed by David Lynch or David Cronenberg!<br/><br/>Never heard of Blade, apparently a minor character in the Spider-Man comics. Still, this is great fun. Good for Wesley Snipes for making a success of this after playing second fiddle in SO many films.<br/><br/>The opening scene is just great - by the way - for those wondering what that ace techno tune is in the opening rave sequence, it's New Order - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) - ahhh that rave brings back memories... (we didn't have spraying blood though, just sweat!)<br/><br/>The film is completely ridiculous of course - How come Blade's ""blade"" turns all vampires to dust except Quinn? - but it's good fun, probably helped by a fantastic techno soundtrack that just adds to the cool, no wonder Blade wears shades most of the time.<br/><br/>Good stuff, but don't try and analyse it as there are plot holes big enough to fit Titanic's budget in.<br/><br/>The second film was fun too, but that was even sillier... but that's another story...<br/><br/>One of those few films that truly deserves its ""post-pub"" status.

","Wesley Snipes stars as a half human/half vampire in this action film based upon a comic. Snipes is perfectly cast as the morally ambiguous vampire hunter. His nemesis is Stephen Dorff, who is trying to spark a vampire takeover. Dorff is only satisfactory as the lead vampire, is physically unimposing, and doesn't seem to be on screen that much. Kris Kristofferson is interesting as Whistler, Blade's weapons and knowledge expert. N'Bushe Wright is OK as the hematologist, who ends up rescued by Blade and then helps him in his battle against the vampires. Donal Logue from ""Grounded For Life"" seems like he's doing a Sam Kinison impression throughout the movie in his role as one of Dorff's main baddies. The film is just under two hours long, but it moves swiftly enough to make it seem shorter. The action is fast and loose, peppered with computer generated effects, martial arts violence, blood, and gore. Many reviewers commented on comparisons between the effects and violence from Blade and The Matrix, but it should be noted that Blade was released before The Matrix, not after it. From the opening sequence at a vampire rave to the final obligatory face off between Snipes and Dorff, the film consistently provides satisfying action and plot turns, although it's hard to overlook the fact that it's somewhat formulaic in structure. **1/2 of 4 stars."

Wesley Snipes is the perfect choice as Blade; half human and half vampire with none of the weaknesses of a vampire except for the thirst of human blood. Next up is Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost (the bad guy of course.)<br/><br/>This film is nowhere scary but doesn't have to be. But all I think that is important for this film is the action and a good storyline. Both Snipes and Dorff are quite convincing and I can see why this film had spawned a sequel.<br/><br/>

Wesley Snipes is perfect to play Blade since he has the look and physical ability to pull off the roll and since brotha Snipes isn't really given the credit he's due, this is a great vehicle for him.<br/><br/>The fights in Blade are the best things about the movie. Plenty of swordplay balances out the gunbattles so there is something for everybody. The soundtrack fits each scene perfectly and like the sequel's, it's a great techno soundtrack. The tone and look of the movie is dark but that enhances the look and the feel of this kick ass movie. There is not much slow time and the slow time that there is is dedicated to explaining some of Blade's story. The supporting cast also does a fabulous job. Kris Kristoffersen, Donal Logue, and Stephen Dorff fill out their characters completely and all are accomplished actors.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Although bested by Blade 2, this is still a great movie and the DVD is filled with great extras.

If there is something bad to say about this entertaining action/horror movie, it is that it thin on plot. I also didn't like the acting of N'Bush Wright.

"stamper","7","0","1","23 September 2003"," Move over Buffy, here comes Blade!
","Before watching this film, I had relatively little knowledge of the comic book character Blade. I'd only seen him as a special guest' once or twice on the animated series of Spider-Man I was watching when I was in my early teens and the only things I remembered, were that he was a vampire hunter and that he seemed to be a native American. In the film version dedicated to Blade, he still hunts vampires, but instead of being a native American he is black. I, for one, do not care, but if there would be a film with a black Spidey, an Asian Wolverine, a blue Hulk or a black Kingpin in a Spider-Man film, I don't think I could bare it. Now I'm not judgmental or something, so I would not dismiss different colored characters immediately, but I guess for some characters it would be harder for me to stomach, because I like them more than others.<br/><br/>
Getting back to this film, I must say that it starts off great, with an original insight into the lifestyle of modern vampires and some good old action. The film just immediately finds it's pace and luckily it stays on it for the bigger part of the picture. The contributors to the films capability to do that the actors. Wesley Snipes is good as vampire hunting Blade as is Kris Kristofferson as his elderly sidekick Whistler. The best performance though, in my opinion, comes from Stephen Dorff, who not only seems to enjoy playing Deacon Frost but seems to actually become Deacon Frost just for the take of each scene he is in. He doesn't just act Frost, he breathes Frost, he IS Frost!<br/><br/>
The direction of the film, is OK. Nothing great, nothing bad. The choreography of the action sequences is mostly good and there are just some minor things (which are present in almost every film) that could have been improved in those important departments (important for an action film that is!). The things I do not like about this film, I would like to blame on the script. First of all I feel that Blade's personal drama could have gotten a bit more attention, so that he could have more depth as a character and second of all I didn't quite like the ending of the film. Why? Well, first of all, the ending is somewhat predictable. Secondly, I felt that it could have been more original and spectacular. I mean, throughout the film Frost makes such a big fuss about La Morga, that  in the end I couldn't believe what kind of wuss the prophecy foretold. Last and maybe least, the lines in the end aren't too good. Well maybe that is putting it a bit too harsh, but Blade screaming Frost' over and over again seemed a little lame and unoriginal to me.<br/><br/>

The only thing I like about it was Stephen Dorff as Frost, but even he couldn't make the stale lines interesting, but he is gorgeous so that made up for some of it. None of the characters were developed enough and after the first 10 fight scenes Snipes with his sword got pretty monotonous.

","Spoilers, perhaps?  Wesley Snipes stars as Blade, a modern-day vampire hunter pulled from the pages of Marvel Comics' '70s schlock-o-rama title, `Tomb Of Dracula.'  He doesn't have the afro, the goggles or the orange trenchcoat, but nonetheless Snipes' version would kick the s**t out of the Marvel character!  Because Blade is a baaad man - a seemingly immortal killing machine who possesses the superhuman strength and evil cunning of a vampire but none of their weaknesses (daylight, garlic, etc.).  Born a `daywalker,' he relies on his blood-cursed heritage to understand and conquer the undead enemy. From the opening scene, a bloodbath of epic proportions, viewers know this film is the real deal - no pulling punches here.  Built around countless action scenes, it employs amazing effects, plenty of video-game carnage, sensational camera angles, bizarre sets and excellent fight scenes.  But, as usual, it's got a pretty archetypal action/sci-fi storyline: Blade and Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), in the middle of a bloody crusade of vampire-vanquishing, unearth a diabolical plot hatched by their preeminent adversary, the vampire overlord Deacon Frost (an overacting Stephen Dorff). Using the different vampire keys, Frost tries to seize control of the House of Erebus, become Bloodlord and reign over all vampires to suppress humanity in a bloodsucking Armageddon.  And kudos to the final confrontation between Blade and Frost in the illusory vampire mosque - someone actually dies without coming back six or seven times (just like the old kung-fu movie showdowns)! N'Bushe Wright (Dead Presidents) plays Karen, a blood specialist who doesn't really do much in the film but follow Blade around and solicit the plot of the movie, and Traci Lords plays Racquel, a pretty vampire seen only in the opening sequence - two needless characters. With the aforementioned opening scene and characters like Pearl, `Blade' rises above the other sci-fi induced comic-book movies (like `The X-Men' or `Daredevil') as pure fun and eye-popping entertainment.  It's nice to see a company like New Line Cinema; one with the balls to make rough and tumble films like `Last Man Standing,' `Rumble In the Bronx,' `Boogie Nights,' `Dark City' and `Spawn.'"

","It's not the usual Peter the Vampire Hunter seeks the vampire who killed his wife/daughter etc movie.  Yes, that is the basis of the plot.  But the method of execution of that plot is something else!  <br/><br/>Start with Deacon Frost.  This is not your normal egocentric vampire. I've seen Dracula 2000 (not too bad a movie--then again, I give it credit for having a new premise!), and am into White Wolf and the Camarilla so I know the two origins that are presented in each.  I have the feeling that part might answer a few questions that have arose, but the whole feel is right. Frost makes a wonderful Anarch-Brujah kindred.  The council of pure-bloods are like the Old-School Warrior Scholars, the True Brujah who resent this upstart who came in and tried to change their habits and ways.  Do things properly seems to be what they are saying.  Excellent resource for a gamer.<br/><br/>Then you've got Blade.  A day-walker, as he's called in the movie.  Dhamphir is another name I've heard applied in the VtM game to apply to him.  I see not only the strength and stamina of a vampire, but the celerity of one as well.  As for the Matrix-esque moves, you decide.  How close are the two movies to release date, and remember to allow for cgi-production times as the actors are wrapped, but the ""extras"" added in.  I don't think anyone stole anything here!<br/><br/>The good doctor Karen is an interesting twist.  A cure for vampirism.  Now that's something you don't see much of.<br/><br/>All in all, for someone who is not familiar with the comic book, I must say it's a pretty good movie.  I plan to watch the sequel soon here to see if it measures up."

","This is one of those movies that I've watched again, and again. It doesn't fit the traditional Vampire mould, working within the genre it aims to contribute to. For example, you find yourself feeling genuinely sorry for the Blade character who has been damned from birth to fulfill this righteous role, but circumstance has him trapped between humanity he is defending, and the evil nosferatu within.<br/><br/>One of the most horrific scenes is the opening sequence set in a nightclub, where, unbeknown to us the gentle viewer, the place is packed with vampires who get their feed at the appointed time. When this happens, the sprinkler system activates and drenches the lot of them in blood. Very nice. And the carnage at the end of this scene is breathtaking in its ordacity, yet jarring in its originality.<br/><br/>The sequence where Blade takes sympathy on the freshly bitten love interest, and sees his mother's fate so closely matched to hers in well-staged flashbacks, will always bring a lump to the throat. But of course, Mumsie comes back for more...<br/><br/>Other parts of the story are well executed, where Steven Dorf's portrayal of Deacon brings the term 'evil so-and-so' to new, dizzy heights. Where they discover one amongst the aristocracy that isn't of noble, pure blood, so they take him outside by Dawn's early light and give him a sun tan. mmmmm crispy. Watch the film, I don't wanna spoil it. The part where Deacon toys with the policeman, who wants ever so much to turn to the darkside, is also a classic. I watched my cat play with a ball of string, and instantly observed more than a passing similarity between the two!<br/><br/>Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, a more-than-worthy addition to the already swelling Vampire genre, and a much prized member of my DVD collection. And, as usual, it's several million miles better than the inferior sequel, which favours muscle and guns over pure, honest, good old fashioned blood and gore! Buy it NOW"

The make-up and special effects (most of the time is impossible to know what is what) do its role. Snipes was maybe too misterious, the film finishes and we are still curious about who was the protagonist and what are his feelings. But we may consider it part of the original idea of a mixed ""hero-anti-hero"" protagonist. N'Brushe Wright was forgettable as Dr.Karen Jenson. They could have found a better one, as Halle Berry for that.

Blade is kind of the same as Blade 2 in many aspects. I just enjoyed the guys in Blade 2 more...they looked incredibly ferocious.<br/><br/>  This movie is a modern vampire story, with some nice elements but not really captivating action. Blade is the interesting one, as he is half/half. And then you can look at him out of two points of view: by a vampire, he is considered perfect; by his human part, he does not consider himself so.<br/><br/>   The story of the movie is unspectacular, with some nice fight scenes, but that's kind of all. Not really much impresses, beside the good special effects. Not the actors, not the plot, nothing. This movie just doesn't seem fresh.<br/><br/>   The only smarter part is the one about the conflict within the vampires. Pure blood, or not, does it really matter? Same question as in Harry Potter...just had to think of it. Here we see in a brutal way that it does not. But by this we neglect the fact that all pure blood vampires have more experience than the new ones, but still they are too few.<br/><br/>
   This movie showed the vampires in a dark view. The only light is Blade. The vampires are everywhere...I would say that if it really is so, then why doesn't the world know anything about it...the vampires aren't perfect, and some of their victims might have escaped.

Definite kudos to Snipes.  And to match, the lead Villain Deacon Frost (Stephen Doriff) surprisingly come across just as strong in his performance and characterization unlike the second film which had nothing to counterbalance the main character.

So typically the film is fun to watch with most of the cast comfortably in their roles.<br/><br/>Most of the cast.  The two main actresses in the film did not seem to fit so comfortably, as though they were playing the roles for a different film and not this fun comic book ride.  <br/><br/>The plot moves along nicely, never slowing down or getting boring and simultaneously never just filling the screen with action constantly for the sake of throwing action out there.  It never comes across as formula driven like the two Batman films under Schumacker's wing.  It doesn't suffer fromt that same ""episode"" feel that the Schumacker Batmans have.  Blade has its roots in the comics, but it is the live action version in its own world where anything can happen.  <br/><br/>Again, Blade proves one of the better comicbook-to-film translations out there."

Stephen Norrington definitely has a unique visual style.  The film has a certain look to it that is highly original.  He makes good use out of his cast as well.  Besides the obvious (Snipes being a badass), Stephen Dorff is awesome as Deacon Frost.  ""We're the top of the f***ing food chain.""  Kris Kristofferson also surprised the hell out of me in this role.  He's a very good actor, and likeable to boot. Genre legend Udo Kier puts in an appearance as well, albeit a brief one. One of my favorite performances comes from the comic relief of Donal Logue. The man is hilarious.  The climax is equally as cool as the beginning showing the souls escaping the vampire hierarchy.

"Big Movie Fan","Null","0","1","16 June 2002"," Wesley Snipes Kicks Butt In His Best Ever Role
","Let me first say that Wesley Snipes was born to play Blade the Vampire Hunter-nobody else could have done it. Snipes was 100 percent Blade.<br/><br/>Before I watched this movie in 1998 my favourite Wesley Snipes film had been Passenger 57. However, after watching this I came away thinking this was Snipes best role.<br/><br/>I mean, Blade is totally cool having all the strengths of a vampire but none of the weaknesses. And who can forget that sword of his that slices the hands of those who shouldn't be touching it?<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this film were some of the best I have ever seen in a movie and again, it helps that Snipes makes it all so convincing.<br/><br/>A lot of superhero films of the last few years have gotten a lot of good reviews but Blade seems to have been forgotten by most people-he deserves more. Blade is a brilliant action packed film not for the faint hearted. Check it out."
"chrisbrown6453","9","0","1","15 May 2002"," This was a really cool movie.
","Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half mortal, half vampire. His mother was bitten when she was pregnant with him, and when he was born, he inherited all the vampire powers (strength, agility, and regeneration) and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, silver, garlic). But he is human in that his life goes at the same rate as all of us. Vampires tend to live a lot longer. His life is spent killing vampires, and searching for the one that infected his mother. The movie starts with a nasty birth scene, and quickly turns into a bloodbath. Literally. There's a very cool fight scene, and then the rest of the movie is spent following Blade. The major plot (killing vampires) is good, but the inner plot wasn't well developed. Stephen Dorff plays a vampire leader. He isn't a pureblood (meaning he wasn't born a vampire, he became one), and he wants vampires to take over the world. So he translates the ancient vampire Bible, and learns of a way to summon the blood god. Great, but what does that mean? The whole blood god thing isn't explained. Why is that such a good thing? And when the blood god arrives, he isn't all that much better than any other vampire when it comes right down to it. So that was disappointing. Otherwise, I liked the movie. I enjoy these gothic/action-adventure/vampire/thriller type films. They always have an awesome soundtrack, and pretty good fight scenes. And these days, the special effects are a compliment. Blade is no different. Some of the special effects are cool and revolting at the same time. But they get the point across. And Wesley Snipes does a great job playing Blade. <br/><br/>Now I haven't read the comic books the movie is based on, so I don't know how faithful the movie is, but he was very cool, and very menacing. And what I really liked was that he didn't display a lot of emotion. Sometimes in these movies, the bad-ass good guy has a heart that comes out way too often. Here, Blade has a heart, but it comes out very, very rarely, and then only for a few seconds. The rest of the cast was adequate, nothing really special about them. The scenery was good looking, and the direction wasn't bad for someone I've never heard of.  Many quick editing and shaky camera movements, that worked well during the fight scenes. <br/><br/>What I did like about the story, was how they made vampires seem more human than creature. They discussed how to kill vampires in a way that made it seem like you could actually kill them, and not just like they were invincible. And who would have thought that something that became famous during the O.J. trial, would have played such a big part of the climax? (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm talking about, and if you still don't get it, write me and I'll tell you about it.)<br/><br/>
Overall, Blade isn't for everyone. The blood effects can get brutal sometimes, and if you don't like the whole vampire thing, you may not like this. But I enjoyed it, and I think it's worth seeing on a big screen."
"Agent10","7","0","1","14 May 2002"," A bloody good time
","After seeing nothing but movies about Dracula when it comes to vampires, Blade brought a new spin on an old story. This was a great, wild and funny film, thrown together with some genuinely chilling moments and cool special effects. The action industry actually did something right by making a film with some intrigue and intelligence. Wesley Snipes fit the role of Blade perfectly, never indulging us too much with sly dialogue, instead proceeding with the standard butt-whooping. Movies like this are just great to watch, especially the last fight scenes with Blade and Deacon Frost (thank goodness they changed the ending). And the scene in Moscow was priceless!"
"mules82","8","0","1","13 May 2002"," Haim and feldman are wonderful.
","Blade is another vampire movie starring such great American actors as Corey, in both the Haim and Feldman variety, Keefer Sutherland and Alex Winters. Haim plays the brother of this guy who likes to hang out with Keefer Sutherland.  Sutherland is in a gang of outlaws with Lou Diamond Phillips and Christian Slater.  They are also vampires.  Anyway, the brother of Haim never knows what is going on, but Haim does.  Haim teams up with Feldman and Joe Pesci as they try to take down the vampire army led by Sutherland and Stephen Dorff.  There is one great scene where they are all playing volleyball in a pool and Ben Stiller spikes the ball and it hits this girl in the nose and she starts bleeding.  Robert DeNiro gets mad, then he says that he doesn't like ice cream or cookies.  In Blade, Chris Rock, who plays the lead vampire, can go out during the day unlike most vampires who die upon exposure to sunlight.  Rock holds a big umbrella that blocks out the sun, he also wears spf 35 which is a very strong sunblock.  He is also black so he doesn't burn easily.  I really liked this movie.  There is this one scene where Haim's brother thinks he is eating Chinease food, then he looks down and it's worms, but the whole time it's really just lo mein.  Also, there is this scene with Tony Danza and he yells up the stairs for Samantha and jonathan to come down, then he beats up jonathan and vampires come and they eat everyone.  That scene was cool.  <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this movie was a 8/10.  A lot of scenes made no sense at all and seemed like they were just cutups of different movies spliced into one non-sensical one.  But I still liked it a lot."

","Wow, Wesley Snipes can act! and better, he can fight good enough to tame the Steven Seagel hype that somehow still lingers around Hollywood nowadays. The film has some awesome special effects; my favorite is the lighting used in the movie. I would probably recommend this movie to someone simply because of the opening scene--a tour de force in movie-making, at least in this genre. Fighting, shooting, fire--it's all there. Dorff puts in a good performance as the bad guy and Kristofferson ,as Snipe's almost-paternal sidekick, Whistler,does too.<br/><br/>Not bad, for a re-adaption of a comic strip, which, needless to say, there are just too many floating around nowadays.<br/><br/>dan"

","Brilliantly filmed, stylish, and nothing close to Hollywood. Thus making ""Blade"" an excellent film. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore, you got the standard bad guy-hostage-shoot-em-up-revenge with movie stars who can't act, and that's about it. But Blade is totally different. The way it combines a horror movie and a slapdash kung fu movie was totally dope. I can't describe this movie in one word, but it's definitely a film that's complicated to not like.<br/><br/>Finally, Wesley Snipes does not play Wesley Snipes.After the aimless, dumb, morally illicit ""Money Train,""I almost lost all respect for Snipes' acting. I was barely able to tell that this was Wesley Snipes, I didn't know Deacon Frost's Vampiress was played by Traci Lords until the end credits, and Kris Kristoferson was only recognizable through his accent. The only thing I would object to this movie was Dorff's villain, who did not seem villainous nor threatening enough, but just a young,  foul mouthed meglomaniac with an inferiority complex. There were some flaws in the movie, but none that were noticeable or as obvious as the turkey Money Train. Recommended for an audience with a strong stomach, Blade is quite violent, but not gratuitously. It is all stylized, however, and not graphic.<br/><br/>There was one perky scene in the movie, I'm not going to give it away for those who haven't seen it, but it's clearly obvious that ""Java the Hut"" served as an inspiration!"

","WOW, this is it! All the time, you hear someone announcing his movie to be ""stylish"" and ""cool"", meaning ""I've used some camera  filters that made the whole thing look completely weird"" etc. ""Blade"" is the first movie, that really got it right: Although director Norrington uses a style usually used on MTV or in a commercial for cars, it really seems to fit into the neo-vampire world. The hip techno-soundtrack adds to that feeling and Blade himself is, I'm happy to say so, really cool! Okay, okay, he's just another macho-hero of sorts, but one shouldn't care,if he's up to watching this movie! ""Blade"" is a fun-movie: Don't think, enjoy! The story isn't that bad, but certainly the worst flaw of the movie. The martial arts delivered by Snipes (he choreographed it himself) is ranking from ""all right"" up to ""hey, that was really good"", but without ever reaching the quality of the earlier van Damme movies. I keep thinking that Snipes could even do better than that, but wants to stay ""realistic"", something van Damme never even tried. The film is really worth watching, especially for Action and Martial Arts Fans. Only you Horror-Addicts beware: As a horror-movie it really sucks, cause there's not much to be afraid of in it."

","Wesley Snipes stars as the tortured soul, Blade possessing powers greater than any man or creature of the night. Blade sharpens his lethal skills under the guidance of a professional vampire hunter. When the bloodthirsty Immortals' lord, Deacon Frost, declares war on the human race, Blade is humanity's last hope for survival. It´s a comic/action/horror/thriller/sci-fi movie and it´s captivating, furious and fast. Blade is known as The Daywalker because he can walk in the sunlight but is thirst for blood. Wesley Snipes is excellent as blade and Steven Dorff is OK as the evil Frost bud Kris Kristofferson does not fit in as Abraham Whistler. I did not like Stephen Norrington direction and the blood and gore is enough to fill several movies. The film is a lot like Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn so if you liked it you´ll love this one. I thought is was good and it made a great DVD."

Blade was my least favorite character in the film; and he really shouldn't be, right?<br/><br/>The ultra-modern design of the vampires' lair was a nice change from the usual gothic candle-light-and-velvet fare, but that was about all that made this movie a stand-out.

","As a fan of High-Octane, low-intelligence, through-the-roof violence, I will say that this film (starring the charismatic Wesley Snipes) kicks it up a notch...in fact, maybe 2 or 3 notches.  Now, you can't go to see this movie and expect Oscar Caliber performances...you'll be damn lucky to get a believable line at all, but that's not the point.  The point to this movie is Abuse Factor, and, believe me, it delivers.  Wesley plays the cult comic book character Blade, whose mother was raped, and presumably killed by a vampire (in the comic, it's Dracula, in this it's Steve Dorff).  Anyway, to make a long story short, Wes is pretty upset about that, and dedicates his life to, what else, whoopin' Vampire booty.  There is so much booty-whoopin' in this film, I didn't know which way was up!  I think they should have called it ""Vampire Butt Whoopin' with Wes"".  Now as far as the acting goes, Wesley plays Blade almost perfectly from the comic...a big, mean, low dialog, Vampire Killer.  Kristofferson plays Wes' mentor, and is quite convincing as a freaky kind of ""wise master"" himself.  The plot is pretty cut-and-dry, and I'll give 3 guesses to who wins at the end.....Nonetheless, this movie totally ROCKS, and there's LOTS of gore, for all you Horror Buffs...This is a fast paced action/horror extravaganza that'll leave you breathless at the intensity...just be warned, this ain't no ""Dawson's Creek with Fangs""...I mean, um, ""Buffy""..."

Some reviewers  has taken it seriously now that the first example of it arrived here (Vinterberg's ""Festen""). I haven't changed my mind, although seeing Blade made me, at least, understand it.<br/><br/>Here, in Brazil, we didn't see Woody Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry"", Ang Lee's ""Ice Storm"" and some important others yet; mostly because our theatres have been busy during all this year with films like this.

What would it be of great masterpieces like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Star Wars"" if they didn't exist?

Sometimes you start to wonder if you're watching a movie or a cartoon. Do you remember ""Spawn""?<br/><br/>This movie has no characters and, therefore, no performances to be remembered; but I was expecting this. The plot could be resumed to 20 minutes and the action scenes are weak. So you can wait until it's released in video.<br/><br/>Marvel's Blade is not published here, but I really love other comics characters and, still, I have to say that no superhero has conquered a respectful place in movies yet, not even Batman.

Wesley Snipes develops his character well, adding a bit of humor to a seemingly straight-edged hero(of sorts).  Kris Kristofferson also deserves mention for his solid co-star acting.

","Well I liked Blade - it had action; a fast moving plot; talented actors; and not a bad script, but ...<br/><br/>I felt that the ending let it down a little. There was this huge build up (quite predictable, but nicely executed), and then it finished with more of a fizzle than a bang. The action was fast paced and exciting, and yet suddenly it was over, and I have to say I felt a little let down by its conclusion. When I watched the movie the entire audience laughed when the bad-guy/good-guy battle came to its logical conclusion, and I somehow don't think that was quite the reaction the director was looking for.<br/><br/>I'd also liked to have seen a little more input from the peripheral characters. There were times when the female sidekicks on both sides could have been used more, and yet they were just ignored. Especially as the film reached its climax the female characters seemed to be there more to fill holes in the dialogue than actually bring anything to the action.<br/><br/>A couple of glaring plot holes also caught my eye, but with block buster action movies what can you expect :-).<br/><br/>All in all though, despite my reservations it was an exciting film, very much worth seeing. I found myself rooting for the bad guy, but then he did seem to get most of the good lines although Blade did have the coolest wardrobe. I urge anyone who hasn't seen it in the cinema to do so before its run ends. This is a film that requires the big screen to appreciate it in all its glory.

How many conflicted superheroes in comic books are anything but the same?<br/><br/>It's definitely a macho, testosterone-filled ride, but don't think that women won't like this movie! After all, there are plenty of scenes that show off Mr. Snipes' significant bodyshaping work!<br/><br/>Yes, the special effects were corny at times--not cheesy or badly done, just corny. But, my main thing is this: a key element for an action film is comic relief. This seems especially important for a movie with a dark theme.  ""Interview with the Vampire"" had its funny moments.  This movie had virtually no funny lines. They tried, but it simply didn't happen.  The guy who kept losing his hands, and kept giggling all of the time, was supposed to make us laugh. It didn't work.<br/><br/>I thought Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost was a bit corny at times. But, I really enjoyed this movie. It was one of the best ones I've seen this year. The ending was a bit of a let-down, and it wasn't funny but even so it still was a pretty fantastic action flick.  The action sequences alone make up for any lacking in other areas."

The story here is actually remarkably complex, with several inter-twining undertones about race, family, and tradition, and much of the exposition is accomplished via flashes of images and associations. The music and rhythm of the entire film is edited in a very musical way, rising and falling and regulating the viewer's energy levels very carefully. When you really watch closely you see that this film is incredibly well put together.<br/><br/>This movie has some very interesting themes, which it handles in a way that gives a good name to action movies. The first is that of blood and race. You might think this is ""just an action movie with a black hero,"" but I think this movie is VERY much a black film, and should be seen as such. The main theme is Blood as a metaphor for family and race. The villain, Deacon Frost, is outcast among vampires for not being ""Pure Blood""... for not being BORN a vampire. He resists his human side. Blade was born half-vampire and resists his vampire side. Blade's girlfriend, played by N'Bushe Wright, is not the traditional Halle Berry-type black beauty, and her apartment is not the typical Archetectural Digest-type. Why? I think to show that her character has remained true to her African-Americanism, not trying to be yuppie-ish and strive to fit in with whites. In contrast, Blade's mother shows up all made over and sleeping with a white man, and she tells Blade that ""these are my people now."" The message is that she has turned against her blood. Of course themes of blood and purity are uniquely suited to a vampire movie, and this movie takes them up and handles them in an interesting way. Blade is one of the few movies with African-American characters who succeed BECAUSE of their difference, not because of their trying to blend in with whites. Blade is not a sell out.<br/><br/>Another thing this movie evokes very will is the underlying creepiness of city life. Scenes of buildings and alleys as the light shifts and voices whisper, as well as the chase scenes in the subway reflect the strangeness of living in close proximity to so many people, some of whom may be very dark and different. This movie would make a good double-feaure with DARK CITY for this reason.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, the movie is just a blast. Blade, the character, is VERY, VERY cool. The violence is extreme in a jokey, not crass way, and the rhythm and vibe of the movie is dead on (note how many reviews mention the bravaura opening scene). I say it rocks and has a serious side, and I can't wait for a sequel.<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

","Vampire film lovers will probably love Blade, a stylish, gory action vampire flick with plenty of big drinks. Wesley Snipes who also co-produced Blade stars as the Marvel Comics sad hero, and he looks great in the part. He understands the tempo and tradition of Marvel's hero vampire. Snipes is big, he's mean and at the same time vulnerable; an ideal comic book super hero. Blade is in the tradition of Dark City, the Crow and Spawn but for my money is heaps better than any of the others, but aficionados will no doubt have their own favourites. My prejudice will always swing towards the good ol' vampire flick any day, so no doubt I'm no judge, especially regarding the two Crow flicks which I didn't like at all. As for Dark City and Spawn, well they weren't much good by any measure. Blade's mission is to kill off vampires. He's the strange son of a Drac; his mother was bitten while he was in utero. He's half beast, half human and is sustained by a concoction he injects periodically which is prepared by his mentor and protector Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), also half human and half vampire is the head bad guy, and for someone who's not an obvious choice for the height of evil in a flick like this, he's neither big nor ugly, Dorff is very credible as an adversary for Blade. The twists for this vampire flick largely revolve around hi-tech weapons and environments. The vampires gather at a disco where they indulge in their own version of a foam party. Blade mixes modern haematology, biological warfare and garlic mace with old fashioned blades, silver (very large) bullets and shotguns. Crosses aren't in but garlic mace is very handy accessory if you're in questionable company. Blade isn't one of those psychological vampire flicks; the set ups are obviously orientated towards the next mass brawl. The sexual element, a seminal characteristic of the vampire myth isn't emphasised all that much either but there are still copious exchanges of bodily fluids. Vampire films are fairly rare in mainstream cinema, the last one was the surprising From Dusk Till Dawn. Blade is both rare and well done."

"CXC","Null","0","1","24 September 1998"," Blade's a slasher but it ain't too sharp
","Following postmodern traditions of vampirism already set out in movies such as the watershed vampire movie THE LOST BOYS, the vampires of BLADE are portrayed like a heathanistic, orgiastic cult, who hold court in the city's palaces of desolation, the most perverse night clubs, to satiate their unholy desires and prey upon star-struck vampire wannabes as well as unwitting victims.  Since this theme has been amply explored in movies like the aforementioned, BLADE has no way to out-do them or to innovate upon those themes other than by sheer volume of gore and depravity. Unfortunately, this approach does more for sensory overload than it does to impress us anew with the evil of ""modern"" vampires, and BLADE ends up coming across like a desperate stretch to overwhelm us.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Snipes is such a striking physical specimen and able enough as an actor that he pulls off the job of convincing us that he is the reluctant, loner hero; an outcast who is trying to make sense out of his condition and finds somewhere deep in his psyche, beyond the comic-book cinematography's power to probe and to peer, a deep-seated reservoir of resolve to draw upon to do his gruesome duty.  Also alluring, here, is the veteran actor Kristopherson, who keeps us at arm's length throughout the story, always wondering what makes his character tick, and how it could be that he and the half-vampire mutant can maintain their symbiotic communion."

"bluntsbitch","7","0","1","28 April 2002"," Best vampire film of all time
","** CONTAINS SPOILERS **<br/><br/>It is without a doubt that Blade is the best vampire film of all time. Or rather, should I say, of this ""new"" vampiric genre. It's not like the old vampire movies of the past [i.e. Nostrefatu & Interview the the vampire] as it seems to shock, scare and draw in the viewer's attention. As I say, the more gore - the better.<br/><br/>The film has one of the best opening sequences in cinema history. The young and carefree adolescent male is taken to a club where vampires hang out. The blood which fires out from the sprinklers is an amazing scene and from then on relies heavily on special effects.<br/><br/>Enter Blade [played by the sexy Wesley Snipes], as we learn, is a half-human half-vampire with all the weapons and gadgets you could ever dream of, provided to him by his long term friend, Whistler played by Kris Kristopherson. The effects in this one particular scene do not disappoint - the slaying of the vampires is truely magnificent - way better than the semi-impressive effects in TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br/><br/>
The film focuses a lot on Blade's arch-nemessis, vampire Deacon Frost who plans to become the most powerful vampire in history. Blade also must keep his eye on Dr Karen Jensen, whom he saved from an attack by Frost's right-hand man, Quinn. Jensen develops a special cerium to help Blade battle the vampire race.<br/><br/>This is truely Wesley Snipes' finest performance. Recently I saw Blade II and while still impressed, it lacks the originality of the first movie.<br/><br/>A must for all fans of vampires, horror, gore and straight up action.<br/><br/>Overall score - 7 out of 10"

That was a useless character to put in the movie and EXTREMELY out of place.  Why does everyone look human-like except for this disgusting thing?  Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!<br/><br/>I also hated the way the vampires exploded at the end of the film.  The computer animation looked HORRIBLE and like a cartoon!  I don't know why the director insisted on having the vampires blow up like a balloon and then explode all over the place.<br/><br/>One other thing that kind of bothered me, but wasn't anything terribly infuriating was right at the end of the movie when Blade throws the vile in the air and spins around and kicks the vile-dart-thing into Frost.

"exterminator_99","Null","0","1","7 March 2002"," Vengeful Vampire
","From the opening scenes of ""Blade"", we are left under no illusions as to what the film will deliver.  New Line's first attempt at a comic book franchise in the ""Batman"" ilk is a stylish, loud and highly entertaining escapist film, enhanced by superb combat scenes and a drastically macho performance from star Wesley Snipes.  A vampire superhero is an exciting premise for movie and comic book fans alike and fortunately ""Blade"" delivers the necessary punch required in this genre, one that often misses the mark on the big screen.<br/><br/>""Blade"" draws on some famous figures of popular culture, including Batman, The Crow and Dracula.  Vampires have held huge appeal for cinemagoers for decades, so coupling this with a vengeful Batman-style vigilante results in a character who we have empathy for but are also frightened by.  Wesley Snipes' hushed tough guy acting style delivers, despite his one-dimensionality near the film's end.<br/><br/>Blade is introduced in a fighting scene at the start of the film.   This opening scene is effectively shot.  It sets the tone of the film perfectly with its pumping electronic soundtrack, quick cuts and over-stylised mise en scene.  Blade deals to the bad guys with surprisingly fluid and effective martial arts, as well as his arsenal of semi automatic weapons and throwing knives and, of course, stakes.  No gore is spared in this opening scene, in fact the whole film is a gore-fest.  It's the type of film ""Fangora"" fans would drool over.<br/><br/>From here the story reads very much like a comic book.  The vampires are presented as an underground corporation of super-humans who live, for obvious reasons, in the shadows and conduct their business like a multinational.  Blade saves a pathologist named Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) who was unfortunate enough to be bitten by a vampire.  She comes up with a cure to make Blade a human (he currently survives on injections of serum), but just as his cure is around the corner a new vampire leader named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) plans to take over the world in a diabolical scheme to resurrect a Blood God'.  Silly is the right word, but in this genre it works well.<br/><br/>Blade's human sidekick is Whistler, played by Kris Kristofferson. Whistler's got an air of the Old West about him and the duality between his character and the cold and urbane Blade works effectively well.  Of all the other characters apart from Blade, Whistler is the most believeable. Wright's character is drastically underdone.  She pouts from scene to scene and does not offer much in the way of dramatic delivery.  Dorff's Frost is deliciously over the top and while the scrawny thesp holds his own, his physical presence cannot match Snipes for a second.  Udo Kier, who many people will recognise from vampire movies of the 1970s, plays an interesting role as the slightly camp Dragonetti, leader of the pure' vampires.  All characters, including Blade, are given minimal time to develop, but this is an action movie, so we forgive director Stephen Norrington for this failure.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Blade"" are very good as is the art direction, set design and makeup.  The film is tightly edited and shot in a series of blue, yellow and white filters and Norrington often employs a level of colour de-saturation to emphasise the Vampires' pasty complexions.  The soundtrack is effective and is generally thumping deep trance, in keeping with the violence and action the film delivers in large doses.  There is plenty of blood and guts, including some slightly disturbing scenes involving a UV lamp and a rising sun.  <br/><br/>By the conclusion of the film we feel that any more action would deter from the film's effectiveness.  As far as action / comic book movies go ""Blade"" is one step above the norm and is something most film fans can sink their teeth into."

","The first ten minutes of this film are so visually striking that you know the climax won't outdo it so why go on watching?  And thus it proves. A young buck is invited to a rave that uncomfortably borrows from a scene in 'Schindler's List'. Very distasteful, guys.  This is an unusual rave, in any case.  Ravers with a tab stuck in each fang?  Either way, the young buck has a lucky escape as the less than friendly ravers suffer a dehydration problem rarely seen at an all-nighter.<br/><br/>Love the names in this flick. Krieger. Abraham Whistler. Dragonetti. Blade, also known as Eric *giggle*.  Better than Fred, I suppose.  Is this a Phillip Ridley film?  Oh, I nearly forgot Deacon Frost.  Mostly because he's hard to see without cricking your neck.  He should be called Deacon Blue, he's a 'real gone kid'.  In fact, he's positively dead. Deacon Frost, who fancies himself as 'the man', (or 'the vamp', if you want to be pedantic) has trouble stamping authority on the proceedings due to his aforementioned lack of stature and it's the dominating distraction in the film. Christopher Lee used to be lot more imposing playing Dracula due to his height but Dorff reminds me of an anorexic Freddie Starr, although he won't be eating any hamsters.  They're taller than he is.  His dress sense doesn't do him any favours in the world domination stakes either. Natty seventies puce velvet suit and flares invoke pity rather than terror.  Dorff's face betrays the fact that the material is beneath him although it's hard to imagine anything getting beneath this diminutive Nosferatu (I know the lingo!) Truculent and obviously suffering from an inferiority complex, he noticeably stays on his feet around a conference table of distinctly wishy-washy vampire mafiosi who understandably disapprove of his bolshiness.  Unfortunately, when he eventually sits down in a leather chair he practically disappears altogether.  He's way too grumpy and needs to get out more, which being a vampire is hard.  Or is it? in a very funny scene he gets to go out in broad daylight by wearing special make up.  What about his eyes and hair?  Don't their clothes usually set fire anyway? (And Frost's togs definately need to go). Perhaps he greased them up too.  Hey, slimy guy, slimy suit. The reason he needs to go out in the day is to taunt his arch enemy....ERIC! They should have got Buffy the vampire slayer to tackle him, at least they'd be eyeball to eyeball.  With Blade, Deacon Frost is eyeball to.....well, modesty prevents me.  Anyway, the world's too big for both of them. Actually, it isn't, there's plenty of room for Frost. In fact, he's too small even to audition for a remake of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (why can't they make them like that, anymore?) But despite having to stand on an off-camera box the entire picture he aims to get even with Blade and turn into *SUPER VAMP*! Then it won't matter how tall he is, thank you very much.<br/><br/>
Wesley Snipes plays Blade with the usual nonchalance we wearily expect from him.  He is aided by a doctor played by N.Buste Wright in a performance so flat you could fax her to the set. Ms Wright has an archetypal James Bond moment when she is tossed into a cell to face something nasty but is blessed with possibly the biggest air vent in film history to crawl out of.  Kris Kristofferson fairs better as a grizzled old vampire hunter and is rather fun if you're in the right mood, which I'm not.<br/><br/>Since the advent of video games, Hollywood has felt an unnecessary need to compete with the former's kineticism with predictably silly and tedious results and the trend sadly shows little signs of abating. Vampiric."

","The movie itself is almost laughable as cinema--with hilarious camera shots of dramatic stances that would make Stallone blush in ""Cobra"".  But that's kind of the point I think--when making a vampire martial arts live action comic, departure from reality is what it's all about.  The film making is sufficiently stylized, and the first ten minutes or so at a vampire rave is brilliantly accomplished, using a pumped up remix of New Order's Confusion while beautfiul Eurotrash vampires mash and grind. And throwing in ex-porn star Traci Lords is inspired in a cameo.  <br/><br/>There are two major flaws in the flick: It's fine for overgrown adolescents in their college years and beyond (hey, we need entertainment too), but the violence and silly vulgarity (this has gratuitious use of the word f*** instead of gratuitous nudity, personally, I prefer the latter).  The other flaw is that they can't quite bring it all together at the end, it just doesn't work. On the DVD, they added a partially completed alternate ending that they felt also didn't work, but unfortunately the one they came up with was worse."

","i read somewhere that the makers of this flick ran out of money and that's why the ending was as poor as can be seen... they could've saved money by not hiring that n'bushe wright chick, who was absolutely useless and awkward and served only so that through her they managed to make some kind of storyline. the story itself was lame and really gave no chance to kristofferson or snipes to make an impact of anykind. wesley's ju-jitsu was a pleasure to watch though... yet dorff managed to deliver some good lines in a stylishly cheeky manner. THE reason to watch this movie isn't the plot or acting but the style it's done (for most of time). the cameraman is a genius! the props and all that makes the mood are alright, really dark and sort of modern-gothic... and the music is really good. what about that ""confusion"" -hype in the internet, huh? the rave-scene was obviously dug by lots of people, i'd imagine, cuz next months everybody was looking for pump panel's ""confusion"". and a cool scene it is, indeed...<br/><br/>this is the kind of a movie that you'd recommend to somebody with the usual ""...if you got nothing better to do""."

","I own this movie. I'm reviewing it because I've just read some erroneously nasty things about it. Hey! It's a movie, dudes! It's not a documentary on vampire lore or a Discovery Channel exposé. If anybody wants to see a BAD vampire movie, see John Carpenter's. Okay? This one's clever, slick and introduces its own history with a vampire alphabet of sorts in the form of runes, kinda, which are tattoos marking the vampires by their owners. And they also name books in a vampire ""bible"". Wesley Snipes just plain rocks as Blade, a mutant created by the timing of his mother's bite. In a pretty rare ""Hollywood"" role, Stephen Dorff is a demonic, sexy-as-hell Deacon Frost, all ripe to undo the current hierarchy of the vampire scene on the eve of the coming of the Blood God. The director's eye doesn't miss a detail. The color and symbolism are impacting and concise. It's ""stylish"" like early Clive Barker (who has since lost his mind). Good looking sets, clothes, lighting and action. The showdown at the end with the skeleton-people-pteradactyl-things is brilliant. I still wonder and ask you: Does Blade's dead mother, in the guise of her return, look a whole lot like Toni Braxton? Or is that just me? An interesting comparison would be Modern Vampires with Casper Van Dien. I own that one, too.<br/><br/>If you can bend your rules about vampires, just a bit, and except some new twists, this movie is exciting, very well made, action-packed and sexy, like vampires are supposed to be (in my opinion, although the sight of real blood makes me pass out)."

","Finally, a vampire movie for the 21st century! Having never read the comic, I had no expectations on that score. Being an intense vampire buff though, I had many expectations. Blade blew them all away. Many times over the decades the vampire has been depicted onscreen, usually to disastrous results. Not so here. This movie didn't set out to make any grandious statements, just to provide a rocking good time, which it delivered in spades. The delectable Wesley Snipes and equally yummy Stephen Dorff combine explosively to bring the classic vampire/vampire hunter tale to modern times without all the overly-dreary Goth mentality we've been drowning in since the mid-'80's. Fast-paced, furious, and often funny, Blade gives us the classic good/evil take in a new light. Wonderfully gory, great special effects, and a superb supporting cast, particularly the gruff and deliciously understated Kristofferson and newcomer N'Bushe Wright. It has the makings of a cult classic, and while great to see in the theater, I'd reccommend the DVD to anyone, as its special features gives a delightful realism to the concept of La Magra and the evolution of the comic and the movie as well.

","Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel.  And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.<br/><br/>However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class.  Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, ""Blade"" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years.  But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters?

"RueMorgue","8","0","1","9 May 2001"," Hokey, but so what? A pretty entertaining ride nevertheless.
","Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side.  It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard.  I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea.  (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)  So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating?  Because it tries.  It tries very hard.  In my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.<br/><br/>Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever.  Some of those ideas are included here.  The storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way.  Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have slowly but surely moved into the world, and share it with humankind.  For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them.  The vampires have even taken familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being ""turned.""<br/><br/>Now that I think of it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film, They Live.  A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Blade as well.<br/><br/>The acting isn't the best here.  Snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, isn't too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he's to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher).  Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the ""head"" vampire you just love to hate.<br/><br/>I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this film.  From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film, the special effects aren't half bad.  There's certainly enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right?  The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique, and not generally used in contemporary action films.  Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with, say, a machine gun. Plus, there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away.  (Unless, of course, you are Indiana Jones.)<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad, either.  As a bonus, the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool, too. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?!<br/><br/>My Rating:  8/10"

Acting is done great by Kris Kristofferson as Blade's mentor, and newcomer N'Bushe Wright has an appealing prescense in the movie also.  You will enjoy this no matter who you are.

Still, logic doesn't apply to the plot (e.g. if the old, pure vampires like Udo Kier are that powerful, why can Dorff kidnap him this easily?). In fact, the whole mythology behind the film is half-cooked, if that. The showdown is loud, but its solution a bit feeble, providing a one-liner that could compete with the worst: ""Some motherf**k**s always try to ice-skate uphill."" Snipes states. Huh?!?

"Keyser Soze-12","Null","0","1","16 December 2000"," One of the best Vampire Movies, though it has it's problems...
","This has to be one of the best, if not THE best vampire movie I've ever seen.  Don't let that trick you, I hate vampire movies.  Many of them have potential, but never get past the horror movie image.  I'll get straight to the good and the bad. <br/><br/>Happy Premise Number 1: the action.  Wow!  Man, this rivals the Matrix!  The action in this movie is well choreographed, and it, well, is pretty cool.  I think that even middle-aged people can like this movie for the action, because, man, it's good. There is this scene early in the movie where Blade jumps from one building to another, and, while it isn't like the Matrix, it still is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Happy Premise Number 2: the climatic sword fight.  I decided to keep this separate from HP number 1 because this is the best part of the movie. Basically, it's a sword fight between the good guy and the bad guy.  It is so well done.  I loved it.<br/><br/>Happy Premise Number 3: the vampires.  Normally, Vampires are portrayed in movies in two different ways.  One:  They are like Dracula.  They're seductive, sexy, and extremely good looking.  Two: Total monsters. Sometimes they're more like zombies than vampires.  Blade does not portray vampires in any of these ways.  It shows vampires in a more realistic fashion.  They aren't sexy, in fact they are often disgusting.  But, they act very, normal.  They don't act like monsters.  They act, well, the way you would act if you had big teeth and a lust for blood.  Seriously, if vampires actually existed, this is what it would probably be like.<br/><br/>Happy Premise Number 4:  the characters.  The characters of Blade and Deacon Frost are two of my favorite characters, mainly because they are well developed and are interesting.  The other characters are developed well, but Blade and Frost are the best.  I mean everything about these guys is cool. Even their names: Blade... Frost.. It's just cool.<br/><br/>Happy Premise Number 5: Wesley Snipes.  This man rivals Arnold and Stalone in the action hero category.  What makes him better is that he can act! Arnold, while I do like him, can't act like Snipes, nor will he ever be able to.  As for Stalone, he can't act at all, so let's just move on.  <br/><br/>
Happy Premise Number 6: This is reserved for people who have seen the movie. Remember that seen in the park with Blade and Frost?  It has this really cool bullet time thing.  Seeing how this came before the Matrix, I'm rather surprised.  That is a really cool scene.<br/><br/>Time for the bad stuff.<br/><br/>Depressing Premise Number 1: the cg effects.  You would think in today's CG filled world, that this movie could, and should have had decent computer generated effects.  Well it doesn't.  It fact, it's really bad. Depressingly bad, I.E. Depressing Premise Number 1.<br/><br/>Depressing Premise Number 2: EA 1101 or whatever it is called.  It's this drug that, when injected into vampires, reacts with their blood and kills them.   That's a cool idea, except that after the drug is shot in, they explode.  I'm not kidding, they explode from the inside.  If you have a nasty, gruesome picture in your head right about now, it's worse in the movie.  I think that it was unnecessary to have that much blood.  It's pretty sick.  And gore usually doesn't effect me, so if you're sensitive to it, this may not be your movie.<br/><br/>Depressing Premise Number 3: the movie can be rather depressing.  There is basically no uplifting stuff in this movie.  I honestly don't care, but some people do, so I thought I would mention it.<br/><br/>Depressing Premise Number 4: There is this Vampire who is really fat.  I'm talking Jaba the Hut fat... only more disgusting.  I think it's a little too much for the film and should have been cut out.  Does that really need to be in there?  I say: no.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  Blade is just a cool movie.  If you can handle blood, you can handle this movie. There is so much cool stuff in this movie.  The acting is cool, the characters are cool, the action, the premise, the direction, the images, everything, (with the exception of the few things I mentioned above) is cool.  I'm not a horror movie person, but this really isn't a horror movie.  It's not trying to scare you.  It's trying to, well, be cool.  And, in my opinion, it is.

","Blade looked like an intriguing idea from the adverts, so I decided I would follow my instincts and go and see it. Although Blade is not a great film, I certainly enjoyed myself<br/><br/>Meet Blade (Wesley Snipes). From the outset it's clear this is a troubled hero - a pre-credit sequence has him enter the world shortly after his mother's fatal encounter with a pointy-toothed demon of the night. Hardly your model birth. But every superhero has their dark side to wrestle with and being half-vampire just leaves you with an aggravating desire for meat cooked very, very rare. With a nifty serum suppressing such cravings and equipped with weaponry by grizzled armourer Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade launches a one-man crusade to rid the world of vampires, forsaking the classic cross and holy water combo for a more forthright reliance on weighty darts, bullets capped with garlic essence and a sword edged in silver.<br/><br/>With an opening sequence to die for, it is certain Blade is going to be lots of fun. Wesley Snipes is perfect for his role, and Stephen Dorff is a superb villain. Kristofferson is also very watchable. The direction is enthralling, I look forward to see some more good stuff from Stephen Norrington in the future. The script is flawed but enjoyable, and the art direction is fascinating.<br/><br/>Blade is a film you can really get your teeth (or should I say fangs?!) into, I recommend it for action fans who want a scare!<br/><br/>I rate Blade 7 out of 10."

I wasn't expecting Wesley Snipes to go Braveheart with the humans over the terror being brought down by evil vampires. I expected good action, martial arts, and lots of it. Blade delivers as an action flick. Some of the characters maybe like cardboard, particularly Blade himself, but it's not so to hurt the movie. It doesn't become too melodramatic to a degree unlike many action movies try to do with their heroes. What you get from Snipes is a good I-can-own-your-ass-anyday performance. What more do you need? About the only negative side of the movie I can tell you right off would probably have to be its reference to vampire history. ""Pure Bloods""?

As far as the character's personality goes, he wasn't serious enough.  He made fun of the original character's personality, instead of creating a new one or just ""acting"" the part.  Though his performance was less than fair, it did not ruin the film in the least.

","The first, oh, 70 minutes of Blade are what an action movie (and a comic book movie) should be.  The action sequences are well-choreographed, without the now-popular editing that makes it impossible to tell what's going on.  The special effects don't diminish from the fighting.  And little touches like blood raining from a sprinkler system let you know you 're in a very strange world. The last ten minutes of Blade are perhaps the strangest reversal in the history of film.  I don't want to give it away, but the villain goes through what will happen in great detail, and then it happens in a fashion completely different, which is unexplained.  It's like they decided to change the movie without telling us why.  Still, the final scenes do offer the most enervating sword-fight I've ever seen.  All in all, this is a cool movie.

","Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc.), and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,"" Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of ""Passenger 57"") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker. He acknowledges the internal conflict, but doesn't dwell on it more than necessary. He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batman.<br/><br/>I'll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy. On the other hand, you sort of have to have that in a movie like this, so it's easily excusable.<br/><br/>Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, hyped in the previews, makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes' hero. He's got class, presence, and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to tone it down a bit.  Who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this is. And whoa! where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Don't get me wrong, but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since ""Millennium,"" and how many of us watched that just 'cause of the cool video box? Well, here he is, folks, in a very Obi-Wanish turn, as Blade's mentor and father figure. And good job, too.<br/><br/>The quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a pulsing techno beat, the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! It had a script, too! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there.<br/><br/>The two major indications to me that I saw a quality flick were these; I had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in, a la any Schumacher ""Batman,"" ""The Avengers,"" ""MK: Annihilation,"" ""Godzilla,"" or ""Armageddon.""

It's not worth it for a bunch of rap with Blade references thrown in seemingly at random.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. It suffers from some hokey flaws, such as the fact that we're treated to a Dick Tracy-esque smattering of ""explanations"" (ex: ""You're being injected with sodium nitrate.. garlic""). The audience is treated as stupid, with every technical (or semi-technical) term being explained or given another name. While this make sense in some respects as a character is being ""shown the ropes"" it's a bit annoying with repeated viewings. The annoying bits of dialogue aside, the main bad guy has a certain affinity for overuse of the ""F"" word, (much as Kevin Smith's ""Jay"" in ""Dogma""), which really gets old fast.<br/><br/>If you got sick of black leather/trenchcoats and designer sunglasses (no cell phones thankfully) in ""The Matrix"" prepare for more of the same...<br/><br/>Watch for a hilarious ""Japanese Rap"" scene at a nightclub.<br/><br/>There is a lot of gore towards the end, as is expected in modern ""vampire"" movies.<br/><br/>There are some ""sexual"" scenes within the first few minutes of the film, but you don't see any exposed flesh (sex always detracts from these kinds of movies anyway, IMHO).<br/><br/>I'd give it an 8 out of 10.

To be more specific Blade (Wesley Snipes) does the same thing in the beginning that he does in the end, except it's more drawn out. Since the film is an action film we don't concern ourselves with the terrible all around acting, but you need to change things up a bit if you want to prevent a tacky ending to an otherwise mediocre film. All around though it was not too bad and I give it just a little over average for an action film because it has plenty of action.

I admit though that like many people I watched 'Blade' without the faintest idea about the comic book it was based upon and I still don't know anything about it. Like many big screen versions of such comics it fails in that it tries to deliver to both fans and newbies alike. Frankly I got the idea but I got the definite feeling that there was a lot more back story and a whole new universe which wasn't particularly well expressed throughout the film. Also, the similarities to the TV series 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' were quite obvious, though who came up with it first is debatable. Basically I liked it though Snipes brooding, invincible character made the film a little too clearcut. The man seemed to have no weaknesses, either emotional or physical, and so it was clear to me who would 'out'.

But that's not enough to carry a movie, and I think that's what they depended on here.<br/><br/>The motivation given for Blade's desire to find and kill any and all vampires is thin at best.  He is supposedly taking revenge on them for killing his mother and making him what he is.  He is not simply a vampire, but a daywalker -- a vampire that is not confined by rising and setting of the sun.<br/><br/>Stephen Dorff plays Deacon Frost, a rebel among the vampires who not only has Blade as an enemy, but has angered the elders of the vampire council as well.  Frost believes that because vampires regularly 'dine' on humans that they should be ruling instead of cowering during the day and sneaking around at night. So he's not popular on either side.<br/><br/>Frost decides to try and release the Blood God which he believes will make him invincible.  But the problem here is, and this could be a spoiler so take heed, he needs the blood of the daywalker to do it.<br/><br/>That's the setting.  The plot is not that strong and the motivation of the hero is very thin.

","Although Blade was far superior to Vampires, which came out around the same time, it was lacking in some areas. Blade is clearly a comic-book super-hero movie, fixating almost totally on Blade's inner struggle and total supremacy over his enemies. You can only watch so many Faceless Guys in Black Jackets and Knit-Caps get pummeled before it gets tedious. The action is clearly in the ""Boss Man stands on a table and bad guys throw themselves at him to be killed one at a time"" which I've always found inferior to more realistic, down-and-dirty action. I kinda wanted the camera to move over a few feet to reveal the Nameless Baddie Geneterator that spews out the cannon fodder. I would have liked to see the Vampires get a little more personality. Instead we have the Wise-Cracking Vampire, the Sexy Vampire, and a whole bunch of Stoic Vampires.<br/><br/>However, Blade has some pretty good choreography, and Wesley Snipes knows his stuff, though I thought it was more than a little homo-erotic the way the camera focuses so lovingly on his massive pecs. <br/><br/>All in all, Blade does have a generous amount of moments that make you say ""Hey, that's pretty cool,"" so its worth a viewing."

","Certainly one of the better comic adaptations of recent times, Blade was one of the most stylish films I have ever seen. The opening nightclub scene was one of the top action scenes of recent memory, a multitude of weapons and ample blood and guts combined brilliantly. Wesley Snipes was fantastic as the half human half vampire hero, and although the put on guttural voice got a little annoying some times, his performance was flawless. Full marks to Kris Kristofferson for his  great cameo performance as handy man Whistler, and Stephen Dorf was also good as Deacon Frost. The fight choreography was great, very well done, although a slightly longer climax with Frost would have been better. The gore bordered on overly gratuitous for most of the film, but stayed on the good side of gratuitous thankfully.

"Neoromeo","Null","0","1","12 November 1999"," As good as a vampire-hunting film comes
","Recent action directors have carried with them a message about how to make an exciting action film. This is the message: if you're going to make an action scene, make it look really good. ""The Matrix"" directors Andy and Larry Wachowski took with them that message, as did Alex Proyas with ""The Crow"", and so does director Stephen Norrington with the best vampire-hunting film ever made, ""Blade"". Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff star.<br/><br/>
Blade (Snipes) is a part-human, part-immortal vampire hunter who was born just as his mother was giving birth to him. At the time, she had been bitten by a vampire directly before she gave birth to Blade. That was 1967. Jump 32 years into the future, and you will arrive on the present day, where an evil vampire lord named Deacon Frost (Dorff) has begun to act on his plan to overthrow the human race and populate the world with vampires. Blade has become a full-fledged warrior who, with the help of his friend and mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) intends to stop Deacon Frost from doing so.<br/><br/>
Frost, however, has some more plans of his own. He has translated the vampire language (and God knows what it's called) and now has the ability to summon the power of the Blood God, an evil spirit which will make it that much easier to overthrow the human race. The whole vampire population will be given powers allowing them to never be hurt, even by a wooden stake. Blade must stop this from happening as well, before the world is taken over by vampires.<br/><br/>
""Blade"" was a violent, exciting, well-crafted action-horror film, if not having been rather gory for most of its duration. The film is visually arresting, with excellent cinematography and film editing so hypnotic, you'd think the film itself was on speed. There was also a powerhouse techno soundtrack, featuring a fast remix of New World Order's ""Confusion"" which made the action scenes more exciting yet. The special-effects were generally good dazzling, although some were extremely unconvincing. And as for the acting, well, Stephen Dorff was respectably terrifying as the evil Deacon Frost, and Wesley Snipes is all right, although this is not even close to his best performance. But the film is so atmospheric and energetic that you hardly have any time to pay attention to the acting. I give ""Blade"" 3 stars on a five star scale."

","I had mixed feelings about viewing Blade...I desperately didn't want to believe the hype for fear that I may be disappointed.  Thankfully, the hype was on the mark for once.  Blade is probably one of the best action/horror crossovers I've seen to date.  I generally find that when a filmaker tries to combine two different genres they always tend to lean slightly more to one side than the other.  In Blade this is not the case.  A superb blend of both the aforementioned  categories adds up to a rollercoaster movie which picks up momentum and doesn't halt for a moment.  This combined with excellent character development makes what was a good film into something alot more.  The cast are great, Snipes is particularly deadpan as the hero, and its always good to see Kristofferson in a movie.  Dorff is simply terrific as the archvillain and the supporting actors do the movie proud. The production design is lavish with a great dark side to it and the costumes and special effects are just right.  Not too much, not too little.  Couple this with a good script and sub-plots....voila!....instant great Saturday night movie."

The vampires are more interesting characters.  Although I'm still not sure exactly how you are ""born"" a vampire.

","When I first heard that they were making Blade into a movie, I read that L.L. Cool J was interested in playing the character of Blade and was doing his best to get the film made. Naturally, when Wesley Snipes got the film off the ground and into production, the thought of Blade I had was a cheap straight to video title that would fade into obscurity with other comic-book movie adaptations such as the Punisher with Dolph Lundgren and the rare Fantastic Four movie. Little did I expect what I saw. When I first viewed the trailer, I was hooked. I love Hong Kong action films and escapist Sci-Fi cinema such as Blade Runner, and the trailer gave this movie elements of both such genres. To top that off, it did not portray Blade as a comic book character, but as a rather subdued anti-hero. Still, I was in for a shock when I actually saw the film. In my opinion, I must say that the opening fight sequence is the most brutal and violent action sequence I had ever seen in a Western film. It was fast, well-paced, and graphically violent. But therein laid the problem I had with the film. Blade seemed to be an unstoppable killing machine capable of dispatching vampires left and right (which he did in several key action sequences), but the vampires themselves were portrayed as somewhat wimpish, almost begging to be staked. I would have expected that vampires would be a little more difficult to dispatch, given the nature of what they are, but they seemed to go down like grass before a lawn-mower. Maybe I was missing something here, but most of the other movies I have seen with vampires in them (like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Fright Night), vampires didn't always just crumple up and die. They usually put up a good fight. Its like this in Buffy the Vampire Slayer on the WB as well, but they tend to fight back more than in Blade. But as I watched on, this concern seemed to take a back seat to what I was witnessing. Some of the other points about the way vampires lived in society seemed to be taken from the White Wolf game Vampire: the Masquerade, and some of the other factors of vampiric biology seemed a bit of a stretch (like a cure for vampirism), but once again I tended to let this slide as I was watching on. But these problems nagged me, and hampered my overall enjoyment of this film. I doubt many of these issues would be addressed in the sequel, which I hope to see in the summer of 2000, but there is always hope that they will take the time to reason some of these faults out. I personally hope that with the death of the Batman films and with Superman's new movie being placed on the backburner at Warner, Blade will fill the niche left open by a lack of a cool comic book film. However, it will have to be an incredible sequel as it is likely that the X-Men movie will be out the same summer. As long as they stick to the look and feel of the first film, and iron out some of those pesky bugs, they may have a successful franchise on their hands. Here's looking forward to Blade 5, if they can keep the plot going that long!"

","Okay, some of us have never seen the comic book before, get over it. As a movie, this one is a possible classic. The opening scene is EXCELLENT,,, you see some poor fool tricked into attending a vampire party. He's surrounded by blood-suckers and things look extremely grim (this is typical of a vampire movie) but then suddenly there is this black dude in full leather who starts chewing up these anemic low-lives (this is not typical). That was the moment when this show took a turn into a different area and things just got more interesting after that. <br/><br/>Snipes was perfect as this character. He holds the intensity and physical capabilities to truly bring such a character to life. The fighting scenes were excellent. The amount of gore was unexpected but done so well that it fit right into the sequences (I had a problem with silver killing vampires but I got over it). The way that bodies/body parts disintegrated was reminiscent of Lawnmower Man but quicker. <br/><br/>Snipes, like Steven Seagal, hits someone and they stay hit. If I was fighting someone who was trying to kill me and I knew they would keep trying to kill me,,, I would break legs, arms, ribs, or anything else I could get to. These guys do this and it makes their movies so much more realistic than a lot of the karate flicks you see. It's graphic but it's real.<br/><br/>The other thing that stands out about Snipes portrayal of this character is his extreme focus. When he is going from point A to point B he only gives opponents enough attention to remove them from his path, permanently in some cases. With this, the movie flows very well and keeps your interest.<br/><br/>Great original plot, even if it is from a comic book. I wish I'd seen this one on the big screen."

The story line is bog stock and the overall point to this movie is not to actually have one.<br/><br/>Let's visit reality for awhile here. (another place I haven't been lately) For the film makers, active participation in not having a point is accomplished by careful design, because it's the gratuitous action and frequent gore that propels this film along. To have a point would only get in the way of what is really important - like decapitations, disembowelments and wearing really cool sunglasses.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very good while the gore is convincingly off-putting. Even though the fight scenes are brutally violent with no redeeming qualities what-so-ever, they are impressive.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, 'Blade' is very macho with lots of foul language and moronic one-liners. (standard equipment for these types of films) Are you starting to get the picture?<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes (who is in perfect harmony with his inner psychopath), displays an expert hand, and indeed foot, through the habitual bouts of fisty cuffs and ritual impalings. His performance though is frigid and aloof which makes it difficult for a discerning audience to give a damn.

","For those who haven't seen this movie, ""Blade"" is a very good Horror/Action flick...and there is a little bit of comedy as well.  Wesley Snipes played the hero very well.  He has great martial arts skills.  Plus, I love how he used his sword.  :-)  Stephen Dorff was an excellent vampire and villain. I'm so glad that he won ""Best Villain"" in the 1999 Movie Awards.  You know... this is the first movie that I found him so HOT.  :-)  Anyway, I'm glad that they got the opportunity to be part of this film.  Oh yeah, I thought Kris Kristofferson was good in this film.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like action and you love vampire films, check out ""Blade."" The part when the evil vampires were trying to bring back the vampire God at this Temple was (I thought) the best part in the movie.  There is a great fighting scene between Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and Blade (Wesley Snipes) in the film.  It was funny when Blade made that vulgar but silent quote during the fighting scene.

"Anonymoo-2","Null","0","1","24 June 1999"," Probably the best vampire action movie made
","As a veteran of many comic books and their notoriously lame films, I was one of those who expected Blade to fall flat on its face with pitiful acting and little ice skates poppin' outta their boots.  Well, New Line Cinema has most certainly proved me wrong. With an awesome, pumping soundtrack, dramatic, compelling acting, and battles to rival the greatest works of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and John Woo put together, Blade was everything it was made out to be and more.  Of course, you have your mandatory vampire movie elements: a couple innocent bystanders getting bitten, gloomy, dark garb, a (somewhat) tortured hero, and, of course, LOTS and LOTS of gushing blood. We have Wesley Snipes as the half-vampire, half-human hero Blade, packing enough weapons to decimate an army of his monstrous foes and still have enough left to raid the local convenience store.  Stephen Dorff (god, what's up with that name?) is the incredibly slick villain Deacon Frost, who brings a new meaning to the word ""evil.""  Lastly, we spotlight Kris Kristofferson (okay, I complained about ""Dorff,"" but this is ridiculous...), who is Blade's supplier of weaponry and a fellow vampire-hunter. If you're in the mood for a lot of action, a little comedy (that fat guy really looks like my Algebra teacher...), lots of thick red blood (okay, big turnoff... but it's all CGI!), and a lot of surprises, see ""Blade.""  It'll really make a cutting impression in you.  (God almighty, that was a lame finishing line...)"

","If you liked Starship Troopers or other gory films you will love this! This film has it all but not for the faint hearted. This film is jam packed full of action. The opening 5 minutes are outstanding which sets the standard for the fights throughout the rest of the movie. Not Snipes' best role as a half man half vamp but he manages the character well. Snipes' fighting skills, shown in some of his other films but not this extreme, are outstanding. A little stupid in some places but hey the film is about vampires! There is a funny part in the film when Blade cuts some guy in half, only to see the two parts of his body come back together which Snipes follows by miming ""What the f**k?"" Overall a good film if you like that gory stuff."

Although for a change some of the bad guys actually had brains as well.<br/><br/>Plus there weren't lots of ""special super weapons"" which seem to take over in a lot of sci-fi type films these days.

Not a novel, which has to at least pretend to be realistic, not a real-life story which has to strive to be realistic, the movie Blade is based on a comic book. In one of the first scenes there's a shower of blood. Literally, a shower of blood, and then lots of vampires die in real melodramatic fashion. If you couldn't suspend your disbelief right then and there, then I don't know what to tell you."
"Jaime N. Christley","Null","0","1","26 May 1999"," Surprisingly successful comic-book mishmash
","It's sub-par to ""The Crow"" and ""Batman Returns"", which I consider to be the best comic-book filmizations that have become so prevalent in the past few years, but it's also quite skillfully done.  It has bounce and pizzazz, to make up for the damage done by the ludicrous, stilted dialogue.  It seems the only place fictional characters can talk hard-boiled anymore is in the comics or on ""NYPD Blue"", so ""Blade"" is forgiven for that.<br/><br/>It's also got Steven Dorff, who makes a terrific villain--he's jokey and he doesn't always chew on the scenery like you would expect him to.  He also brings in the laughs, which is one of the colateral duties of movie villains these days.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes gets the coolest costume of any recent comic-book movie hero we've seen, and he wears it well.  He is well-suited for the chop-socky fight scenes and, as Blade probably doesn't emote too often, his stoicism gives the film a solid base.<br/><br/>N'Bushe Wright doesn't have much to do, which is a pity.  She has the standard heroine-gets-in-a-nasty-dilemma number near the end, but it's too easy and therefore, isn't any fun.<br/><br/>The special effects will come off better on videotape than it did in the theatre, as will (strangely enough) the photography and the Mountain Dew editing.  Stephen Norrington directs in the style of a Nine Inch Nails song, which gets to be a bit much near the end."
"Rumples","6","0","1","23 May 1999"," One of the better comic adaptations
","Blade is violent, unpleasant, cliched and even a bit corny. But it is still a fairly entertaining movie and a classy action/horror film. Yes the script is flimsy and the storyline a tad unlikely but that doesn't stop this film from being interesting. I felt that it started out quite strongly, not being familiar with the comic I was intrigued at the possibilities, but faded badly at the end. Anyways, don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. But if you're prone to queasiness and don't like the latent sexuality behind all that biting, sucking and blood, give Blade a miss.

"ChoiBaby","Null","0","1","14 May 1999"," A dark, handsome thriller destined to become a cult classic.
","The freedom of mankind is at stake... The vampire infestation is pandemic...no one is safe... Only one warrior can vanquish the traces of evil...ironically he is one of their kin... He has the semblance of a normal human being...and the powers of an immortal... This warrior has started his own prophecy...the one legend known only as Blade!<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes tackles the title role with plenty of qualified skills. He's adept at all forms of martial arts, he has an edgy, wise-guy attitude, and the horrific demons of the night do not scare or intimidate him one bit! Blade's most admirable challenge yet is to destroy the evil Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and cast asunder the armies of malevolence. Blade puts the teeth in fighting as he slices and dices vampire hordes one by one...<br/><br/>Blade's only two allies are a beautiful scientist (N'Bushe Wright) who has already fallen prey to the vampire curse, and an inventor, Whistler (country singer Kris Kristofferson) who supplies Blade with the adequate arms and weapons. Blade also has a cool arsenal of accessories. A shot-gun to kick some vampire rear; body armor; a shining, silver titanium sword, heart piercing knives; a motorcycle; shades; and a really mean attitude all add up to Blade's trademarks. However, with all the firepower Blade has at the palm of his hands, can he defeat the overwhelming odds before they consummate their plan to take over the city...and the world?  No problem, right?  All in a day's work for Blade...<br/><br/>BLADE is just one addition to the latest genre of superhero comic book characters who are adapted onto the big screen.  In all sincerity, this version of the Marvel Comics action hero is given a fairly successful translation as a movie. Expect no mercy thrills with heart pounding tension, fast moving energy, and a very sick array of imaginative (and disgusting) special FX. The vampires in this movie look very, well, bleak and the gore in this film is piled to new extremes.  Bonuses also include Udo Kier and Traci Lords as merciless vampires on the prowl.<br/><br/>BLADE is a pretty cool movie. Brutal action scenes and above average performances from a well reputable cast boost this film above standard fare. Sanguinary is one word that can also describe this movie.  Prepare to close your eyes and scream at the unpredictable atrocities!<br/><br/>Bravura beginning and closing sequences are fantastic and surreal. They serve as the best features of the movie. Windows shatter, and the ""bloodbath dance"" choreography in the epilogue of this movie is strangely provocative yet stomach turning. The futuristic techno-rock and rap are awesome and mind-bending.   The middle though tends to drag occasionally.  Also, a subway chase scene is somewhat dogmatic and the end where the ultimate evil is unveiled will not make a lot of sense...<br/><br/>If you ever need a film to help provide your escape from the real world into an effervescent dimension, BLADE is just right for you. Your pulse will rapidly beat by the minute in this gore galore flick, and although the film ends up with a conventional conclusion, there are enough surprises to jump even the most jaded viewers. BLADE is a handsomely dark, moody vampire picture which offers plenty of wit and horror.<br/><br/>RATING: **1/2 out of ****."

Anyone who goes to MacDonald's expecting gourmet, health food must be stupid.  The ads promised fast adult action, lots-o-FX, MTV visuals, flying vampires in black ensembles, and general super-human, bad-assedness, all based on a juvenile comic book.  And it delivers exactly what it promised!  If you think vampires are real and should be portrayed in a more believable, true-to-life way then you need help.<br/><br/>Next to Superman 1, I can't think of a better adaptation from a popular comic.  For some reason, comic adaptation's are usually doomed to stink. The producers treat the subject as camp (which rarely ever works) and too often water down the violence (Batman...zzzzz).  Blade, thankfully does not pull any PG-13 punches.  Come on, if comic's are generally about anything, it's violent conflict.<br/><br/>It's also the first American action film I've seen that nearly catches up with the amazing, super-kinetic energy that Honk Kong action directors have mastered over the last couple of decades.  For some reason Woo, Chan and Hark have been utterly stifled by the Hollywood way, and unable to duplicate their own, homespun virtuosity.  Unfortunately, Blade never quite returns to the intensity of the opening rave-club, slaughter scene. However, this alone is worth the price and is purely one of the best action scenes I've seen in an American film, in a long time."

","I remember sitting down to Lethal Weapon 4, which by the way is another excellent film, and watching the previews with an impatience beyond comprehension.  Then I saw a preview for Blade.  As a kid, I had been a big Marvel comics fan, and since Blade is neither a popular comic hero like Batman or Spawn, I was wondering how or why anyone would want to make a film about him.  I also admit that the preview was less than convincing.  I convinced myself to see it simply because I am a big Wesley Snipes fan and Blade was a cool character.  Then came August 22. I had just come back from out of town and immediately my friend Mike called me informing me that it was definitely one of the baddest-ass action movies in the history of filmmaking.  So, on August 23, I saw it.  From the previews, one would expect a Seagal-ish cheap-ass action flick with poorly choreographed action sequences, lame as hell moves, and crappy acting on the part of supporting characters.  Of course, one could not hold the plot against the movie.  Why would you go see a movie like Blade, an obvious action extravaganza, for a realistic plot?  The filming style was incredibly unique.  And of course, Wesley Snipes lets himself go, letting loose incredible arrays of fighting sequences involving capoiera, aikido, and several styles of kung fu.  The supporting actors, mainly Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue, also performed to the peak of their abilities.  All-in-all, Blade is an excellent movie for those who prefer violent, go for the throat action movies with an exceptional badass ring to them."

The blood and gore in this film will satisfy action and horror fans, being repulsive and fantastical. Stephen Dorff has a nice, villainous role as well. What I especially like about this flick is that extra information or comic book jargon is not necessary to get the gist of it.

I haven't seen or heard a better film for a home system.  DVD owners everywhere should be supporting New Line's incredible series which includes ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Dark City"" special editions.

","With all respect to Will Smith I regard Snipes as the coolest action actor among the black elite of Hollywood population. Overall the movie is quite decent  and sailing far ahead of such flicks like ""Spawn"", ""Shadow"", ""Phantom"". Good pace, no sub-plots, small volume of those boring what-is-this-all-about details and as a consequence  - a lot of question marks. But on the other hand, I don't think it's fair to ask too mush from the comics. In our age of absolute trust and confidence it's good to have if any kind of suspicion. Do you like garlic ?"

","Whilst visiting Los Angeles for my first holiday in America, I  happened to be staying around the corner from the Mann's Chinese Theatre one night whilst I was going past it I happened to notice that the premiere of BLADE was on. I was quite excited about this as I have always been interested in films and have always wanted to attend a premiere. So there I was watching all the actors and actresses arrive in their limos and go into the theatre. When the premiere was over ,I begged my parents to let me go and see BLADE. they finally gave in . The advert didn't look to violent from what I remember from it,and it didn't say much about Vampires in it. So a few days later we went to see it, it was rated R and my parents weren't sure of what it meant.I finally persuaded them, so we went to see it. In the opening scenes my mother wasn't too happy with me seeing it, she said it was too violent ! My father said nothing so we continued to watch it. Finally it got too much for my mother so she dragged me out, I was quite disappointed at that. She said it was totally unsuitable, my father agreed. He said that it should have been NC-17 as it would and is an 18 in the United Kingdom. I did enjoy the film despite the gore, and I think  Wesley Snipes choegraphed the scenes very well . I think Stephen Dorff and Wesley Snipes acted really well and were chosen well for the parts as enemies. I hope the sequels are going to be just as good. But meanwhile my ambition is too see the end of the film, maybe in a few years !<br/><br/>Catherine Jones"

","This movie was just awesome. It has to be the coolest and awesomest movie I 've ever seen. Wesley Snipes is the special effect in the movie with his martial arts move. The soundtrack is also awesome."

","I just got back from seeing Blade and I thought I'd give it a quick review. This isn't the kind of movie critics usually like, but, as they should be, most reviews so far are pretty good.<br/><br/>Let me start of by saying that I don't usually go for the corny comic book style movie OR the usual shoot-em up action flick. I do however appreciate well-choriographed martial arts action and a good horror flick. Blade manages to combine martial arts action with John Woo-style gunplay, a good horror-vampire plot, funny-but-not-too-funny dark humor, and an ausome techno soundtrack. A little something for everyone. It actually works in every catagory and turns out to be one he** of a fun movie.<br/><br/>The directing has that cool music video feal too it and it works perfectly for this type of movie. Wesley Snipes does a good job as Blade and, although sometimes he seems a little too bland, he generally does an excellent job. The rest of the cast does a pretty descent job too.<br/><br/>The martial arts action scenes are some of the best ever. Wesley Snipes manages to combine great fighting with guns to create some highly entertaining action sequences.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say about this movie. The plot is pretty good, the action scenes are GREAT, there's plenty of humor, the special effects are pretty good too, from the numerous vampire death sequences to some pretty interesting characters that I don't want to give away. This is just a plain FUN movie. One of the best of the genre.<br/><br/>ONE LAST THING-- I thought I'd give the FIRST scene of the movie a quick review too. You see, this scene is by far the BEST scene in the movie (don 't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good- but this scene is one of the greatest of all-time).<br/><br/>This scene is one of my favorate action scenes of ALL-TIME. The credits are still rolling and already you get the feel for the rest of the movie. A rave-type club full of vampires attempt to feast on an innocent human as SHOWERS of blood begin to POUR from the ceiling. It becomes chaotic as everyone is going crazy to the ausome techno soundtrack. Blood is everywhere, vampires are every, the camera is rapidly changing back-and -forth between slow-motion and fast-forward, they're all about to feast on this guy when BLADE bursts out to kill some Vamps. Now you have gallons of blood covering everything and everybody, you have Blade kicking people all over with both cool martial arts action and special anti-vampire guns, and of course the techno music is still playing to give the audiance that extra rush. It just can't be explained. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Jesse (pulpjes@aol.com)"
