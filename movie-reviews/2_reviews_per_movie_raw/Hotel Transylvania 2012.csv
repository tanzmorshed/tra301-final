","Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages: Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for the ride and let yourself enjoy life.<br/><br/>I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation. There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the right thing for their children if given the chance.<br/><br/>While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed.<br/><br/>Well done!"
"nightbiker-1","10","118","170","28 September 2012"," Very enjoyable experience
","I gave this a complete 10 because both the wife and I (as well as the other movie-goers -going by their reactions) thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to the very end.<br/><br/>Was it predictable? Of course. Its an animation geared towards children (what would you expect?) -but like most of the animation movies of today, there were quite a few 'hidden humor' spots as well which would be completely missed by the younger audience (not unexpected since it is the adults, after all, who are forking over the bread and it doesn't hurt to keep THEM entertained as well). The movie is fairly fast-paced and the animation well done. I'm usually a little apprehensive when I've harbored good expectations from a movie based on clips/previews, but in this case I felt it truly delivered. This one will be added to our library when it (eventually) hits the shelves. Too many people look for a great amount of depth and unpredictability in animation movies -but THAT is a bit unrealistic (no pun intended) -think about it: These things USED to be called CARTOON MOVIES for a reason. They weren't intended to fit that kind of expectation. They ARE intended to be fun -and this movie is just that: FUN."
"eshghefilm","9","105","153","29 September 2012"," One of the best (funniest) animations I've seen in years!
","I went to see Hotel Transylvania last night in a small group of adults aged 24-30 and I LMAO as did the others. The theater was packed with little children who mostly laughed at not really funny parts and adults who laughed when the children were quite silent. The story is about Count Dracule trying to raise his only child safe and sound away from terrifying humans and invites all the monsters to his hotel to relax and celebrate his very young daughter's 118th birthday which is accompanied by a surprise visitor! <br/><br/>This is a really funny movie with a simple predictable story line and tons of characters that you will love. My favorites were the zombies who were the hotel staff and it took them forever to finish a task. I recommend this movie to anyone who like monsters ( so afraid of a little boy licking ice-cream)and want to have a good laugh and take a break from Disney."

","..took my family to see this one today, 6 year old son, 3 year old daughter..<br/><br/>Both of them really enjoyed the experience, though to be honest i think my daughter connected with the movie more because of the plight of Dracula's young daughter being the focal point of the story. That really surprised me!<br/><br/>Any horror fan with kids will get a real kick out of this one. And even non-horror fans should find the story cute. Sandler and company really pull it together for this one, after their last couple of films were less then stellar.<br/><br/>Definitely a pleasant surprise, and good fun for the whole family."
"cal-acadia","8","42","61","19 October 2012"," Far exceeded my expectations!
","I went into this movie really with no expectations. I had only seen a few fragments of commercials and got nothing at all interesting from them. So, WOW, was I surprised and impressed when I saw it!! The movie was a creative story, quick moving action, funny, heartwarming, visually interesting and sometimes surprising - this film had a lot of great things going on, and I found myself really engaged and far more interested in the characters than I would have guessed. Sure, there were a few ""as if"" moments, but for the most part I found it to be fun, funny, and a film I heartily recommend! Kudos to the writers, voice actors and animators.... With a youngster in my home, I'm sure we'll be seeing this again soon."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","46","68","27 October 2012"," Count me among those who thought the movie was surprisingly good
","After reading reviews that either disliked or were indifferent to Hotel Transylvania and being dubious because Adam Sandler(who has been in a lot of really bad movies recently) was in the lead role, I was unsure of whether to see the film. But my love for animation and the appetising trailer over-rode my doubts and I saw it anyway. And you know what, while The Pirates and ParaNorman were better animated movies from this year in my opinion I found Hotel Transylvania much better than expected. More could have been done with the relationship between Jonathan and Mavis, it is a romantic angle that has been used many times before and as well as feeling somewhat under-baked very little new was done with it. While a vast majority of the film is fast-paced with no real dull spots, some parts of the film did feel rushed. On the other point of view, the animation is excellent, the backgrounds are both beautiful and Gothic and that is the same with the colours. The characters are well-modelled. The soundtrack is catchy and upbeat, though some of the songs could have been more than just snippets. The writing is zany and often witty with a surprising amount of heart also.<br/><br/>The story is predictable, but not dull. It has a number of great moments, the genre references are not as inspired as they were in ParaNorman but they are fun to spot, and I loved a lot of the slapstick-in-style gags. Especially the zombie Beethoven, the scream cheese Hors-D'Oeuvres, the shrunken heads do not disturb tags and the digs at Twilight(much more fulfilling than any of the movies combined). But it does have a lot of heart. Is the over-protective father idea clich√©d? Of course. But I did find it genuinely touching instead of overly-exaggerated as I have seen described. Dracula's past is also shown in a darkly emotional way. The characters are not the most memorable I have ever seen, but they do have their likability, my favourite here was Dracula. And the voice acting was surprisingly great, to me from a non-fan who has liked him in some movies(Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish and Happy Gilmore) and hated him in others(Jack and Jill, Going Overboard, Zookeeper and Mr Deeds) Adam Sandler gives one of his better performances of late in the role of Dracula, he is actually funny as well as emotive in alternative to irritating. Selena Gomez is endearing as daughter Mavis and Adam Samberg brings some heroism to Jonathan. Kevin James, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher and especially Steve Buscemi give solid support. In conclusion, surprisingly good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","The, I think, is a movie that is fun for the whole family. Youngsters will like the characters, the older children will enjoy the jokes and plot, and the adults will likely enjoy the movie as well, being able to catch on to the more ""adult"" funny references and a story about a father-daughter relationship that can be appreciated. <br/><br/>The movie is fairly fast paced, but most cartoons are, especially ones that are just 91 minutes long. If you're planning to take your 3 year old to appreciate the plot, connect with the characters, and understand the meaning of family and love... that's not happening... it is a children's movie but it's not Sesame Street. <br/><br/>My husband and I took our 2 1/2 year old because it seemed like a cute movie to watch. It was. Our son sat through the entire movie and danced with the music, etc. We enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>Was it EXTRAORDINARY? No. Was it a good, fun family film? Yes. <br/><br/>I would recommend it. If you're unsure about paying for a ticket at the theater, you can always wait for the DVD to come out."
"manualsexdrive","8","23","35","24 September 2012"," Fun movie for kids and adults
","I'm a big Universal Horror and Hammer Horror fan, but my 5 year old son is obviously a bit young to experience Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man and Frankenstein in their true form, so it's great that a lighthearted movie has finally been released that kids can check out. I was a bit worried that my 5 year old would be a bit scared by some of the scenes, but this movie is totally kid safe. The scariest thing that happens is a couple of loud screams and some glowing red eyes. No problem.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler does a great job as the voice of Dracula. Not too over the top and constantly delivering some great lines. Andy Samberg and Selina Gomez (surprisingly) both do a great job as Jonathan (nice touch) and Mavis respectively. I also loved Steve Buscemi as ""Wayne"". Unfortunately Fran Drescher who can usually deliver some sharp witty comedy isn't allowed to shine as her jokes throughout the film have been done to death and didn't bring much to the film at all. <br/><br/>There are some great hidden jokes/sight gags, and some beautiful animation and character designs that will please old school horror fans and adults, but the only part that I found utterly cringe worthy was the end scene with Dracula rapping (even after his joke about Twilight!) Hey, gotta please the kids somehow..."
"billygoat1071","8","32","52","12 October 2012"," Monsters Going Wild
","Hotel Transylvania has a simple concept: classic campy monsters staying in a hotel where humans are not allowed because they think we're evil. It doesn't sound too fresh but it looks fun. Behind this concept is a father-daughter-relationship that seems to follow the footsteps of other great recent animated films. The result is, it's not getting there yet but it's still as delightful as it's suppose to be. It's one of those films that it's so crazy, you'll instantly like it. Most of the gags are clever and ridiculous. Overall, it's an endless fun entertainment.<br/><br/>Though, the film sometimes feels like a mediocre animated kids film. Generic family film elements are there but they are used in a different way. There is often slapstick and toilet humor but the gags are best when it's outrageously absurd. Every set pieces are swift, quirky, and exciting. The voices of the characters sound silly at glance but the actors made them pretty likable.<br/><br/>When the craziness slows down, there's a sweet bit of Dracula's relationship between Mavis and Jonathan, and some brooding. The drama is a little effective. It's not as strong as most recent animated films. It's more focused at being fun and hilarious. It's great when it stays to the roots of a cartoon like showing peculiar looking characters acting like lunatics. The best laughs are when the monsters are expressing their misanthropy in a ludicrously paranoid way, and when they're just making fun of each other. Mainstream pop culture song numbers kind of tone things down, but the song number at the end didn't affect the breathtaking and emotional climax.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is good enough for the whole family even though it's raucous. Fans of the animation genre would enjoy this a lot more. Since it's directed by a cartoon expert, it contains a lot of absurd and exciting scenes that is similar to his shows. Although, some might expect something more since many animated films these days are deeper and powerful, leaving the old habits behind. Hotel Transylvania still has the heart but it's just not as compelling as the others. If you're in for the joys then this will give you a good time. My rating may be too high, but this my thing. I always enjoy this kind of animation."
"joe-is-sexy","7","9","12","3 November 2012"," Some jokes are forced, but an overall enjoyable film!
","Hotel Transylvania stars: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James and David Spade. It goes for approximately 90 minutes. It fails to deliver GREAT 3D moments although some could be classified as 'GOOD'. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is what is called 'Jokes Are Failing' Syndrome. Although they do crack in a couple of good laughs in the first half, majority don't live up to expectations that animations nowadays do. Too many slapstick moments and unnecessary forced jokes... NOTE TO FILM-MAKERS: If jokes are forced... Don't even bother with the joke!<br/><br/>The movie has heart though, which kind of makes for it's first half. The second half however is fun, cool, funny and surprisingly a bit thrilling! It does have it's fun moments... I will admit. Although some of the 3D doesn't work I still found it to be a good animation... Is it the best animation of the year? NO WAY! But is it great as an animation? No, not really it is what I call 'A good animation if you just let your mind do nothing!' A B from me."

","Somewhere within haunted woods lays the secret entrance leading under a foggy graveyard and over a lone stone bridge to Hotel Transylvania, perched on its secluded rocky island in the shadows of central Romania's Carpathian Mountains. Human-free since 1898, Dracula's (voiced by Adam Sandler) castle-like vacation destination offers sanctuary to monsters of all kinds seeking refuge and relaxation from the daily grind of damnation. A tireless staff of zombie redcaps, witchy maids and gargoyle waiters lurch at the ready to serve all guests. The hotel is also home to Dracula's daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez), whose upcoming 118th birthday means finally discovering the unknown world beyond her overprotective father's creature comfort inn - until lost young American backpacker Jonathan (Andy Samberg) wanders into the lobby.<br/><br/>Wow. What an incredibly entertaining animated feature. Heavily softened and loosely modernized, the primary supporting characters Dracula, Frankenstein (Kevin James), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Wayne the Werewolf (Steve Buscemi), and Murray the Mummy (CeeLo Green) are delightfully based on some of the most famous Universal Studios monsters to ever haunt the silver screen. It's great seeing them lovingly depicted here for a younger and young-at-heart crowd of moviegoers. If you're so inclined, doing a quick search through Wikipedia brings up a wealth of history regarding each of these legendary creatures of the night, including which famed films were based on stage plays, literary treasures and ancient lore.<br/><br/>And, before the ghoul patrol purists start foaming at the ears, yes Wayne isn't really a werewolf. We know he's more an anthropomorphised wolf night and day. Yes, Frankenstein has always ever been the name of the doctor not the monster in the true classics. Relax, it's a fun kids movie. Just roll with it, and enjoy the glib aside at the Twilight movies near the end.<br/><br/>Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel's screenplay crackles with boundless energy and clever laughs throughout this 91-minute screening. It's sheer genius that these monsters are actually just as terrified of humans, fearful that we're getting fatter to overpower them and do nasty things such as cut open their heads to fill with candy. Hilarious. The story arc shift from it being about Dracula and his wonderfully motley hotel guest to it being about sheltered Mavis seeing the wider world through Jonathan's gregarious eyes is memorably rich and compelling. Also, keep an eye out for Wayne's daughter Winnie (voiced by Sandler's daughter Sadie), who uproariously steals her one scene opposite the big boys. Top marks also go to Ron Lukas and Noelle Triaureau for their outstanding art direction here. Hotel Transylvania is visually amazing.<br/><br/>Amazing still, the official website is absolutely well worth checking out. Before clicking enter at its splash page, checking out the What guests have to say link takes you to a wonderfully imaginative listing on TripAdvisor. Notable highlights of the site itself are the paper toys of Mavis and Murray and the colouring pages of all the main characters available in the free downloads section.

"mackenziekaylyn","9","27","46","21 October 2012"," I loved this movie!
","Everyone remembers that special movie they saw or that one that was the best for your mind, that one which really stuck. For me that movie was ""Hotel Transylvania"". I think it was one of the best children's movie ever made. It conveys humor, creativity, action and freedom. <br/><br/>Set in Transylvania in modern time, Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's one hundred and eighteenth birthday. But he works overtime to keep Mavis (Selena Gomez) from falling for a human boy named Johnny (Andy Samberg), who miraculously stumbles upon the hotel. All Mavis has ever wanted is to leave home and see the real world and see if humans are as bad as her father says they are. The main characters are Selena Gomez as Mavis, Andy Samberg as Johnny and Adam Sandler as Dracula. It is a brilliant cast for this movie.<br/><br/>Selena Gomez was perfect for the part of Mavis and did a great job while Andy Samberg was good but wasn't perfect for Johnny. I think he could've done a much better job. Adam Sandler was born to play the part of Dracula. He did a magnificent job and was extremely humorous. The other characters were great and they matched their roles perfectly!<br/><br/>I liked that we got to know the characters and what their goal was. For example Mavis wanted freedom and wanted to leave home. What I didn't like is that it was a bit confusing. For example, ""Why was Johnny hiking in Transylvania at night?"" or ""Why didn't Mavis just turn in to a bat and fly away to see the real world?"" These questions make you wonder but I still think it was a wonderful movie even for my age group. <br/><br/>I think the moral of the story was trust your children to make the right decisions no matter what you think about them and from the child point of view the moral was to know your parents are always just trying to protect you. And both are true and if you look at them from both sides you will get the full story. I think that this is a movie for age groups above five and below fifteen. Reason being because Dracula does a fang up where his face goes a bit creepy but other wise I'm sure parents will love it and children between the ages of five and fifteen will love it to."
"Animated_Antic","7","3","3","3 July 2018"," A wild and zany animated movie.
","The name Genndy Tartakovsky is a name that most animation fans will appreciate and even if you haven't heard of him, you probably have heard of the shows he created at Cartoon Network like ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""Samurai Jack"". The name Adam Sandler on the other hand, is not a name most film fans will appreciate. This was the man who did bring us some of the worst comedies ever made like ""Jack and Jill"" as well as create ""Eight Crazy Nights"" which despite it's grand and glorious animation is one of the worst animated movies ever made. Seeing the two team up is a little odd, though that's what they did with the help of Sony Pictures Animation which resulted in the movie ""Hotel Transylvania"", a film that has gotten an interesting reaction from both critics and audiences a like. Where the critics hated this movie, audiences seem to like it. As for me, I think it's decent. Is it a terrible and childish movie? No. So, is it a modern Halloween classic? Also no. I'll get into why in a minute, but first let me sum up the plot. <br/><br/>Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) has built a hotel for all monsters to go to relax and go on vacation away from ""evil humans"" as well as keeping his only daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) safe after his wife Martha was killed by the humans years ago. With her 118th birthday approaching, Mavis is curious about the human world and wants to explore it though her father is still reluctant and wants to keep her safe. However, things go upside down for Dracula when a human tourist named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) accidentally stumbles into the hotel. Wanting to keep the guest from being scared, Dracula disguises Jonathan as a sort of Frankenstein monster and only gets into a bigger sticky situation when Mavis starts to develop romantic feelings for Jonathan. What happens next are lots of crazy shenanigans and fast paced humor that explaining the whole story would be too much so I'll just leave it there and get to my thoughts.<br/><br/>This is certainly a very creative film. The idea of monsters staying at a hotel away from humans is a very clever and unique plot which does lead to some creative jokes and fast paced humor, though the film does have moments to let the audience catch their breath with some pretty effective slower moments. The scene where Dracula tells an emotional backstory in the film was actually surprisingly really well handled which is something I was really impressed with by the film. As for the animation, if you want crazy, zany fast paced animation, here it is. This film really knows how to do fast paced animation well which really reminded me of the old cartoons from 40's and 50's or even that Baby Herman short at the beginning of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" yet it does bring me to a small criticism. Though the film worked well in computer animation, it would have really shined had it been hand drawn. These character designs seemed to be made to be drawn by a pencil and not by pixels and it was even clearly proved during the end credits where we see 2D versions of the characters. It's nothing too major, but I feel that seeing it being done traditionally would have been a major plus for this film. Most of the jokes really work. Even though it is kind of juvenile at times particularly in the opening, this film did have some good laughs including a scene that took a stab at ""Twilight"". Yeah, I have to give credit to this movie. They really made a great anti-Twilight joke. Now how are the characters, particularly Adam Sandler as Count Dracula? Actually, they're mostly fun. I was a little nervous when I first heard the casting of Sandler as Dracula, but he managed to really pull off the character and his voice actually mostly unrecognizable. Even the other monsters in the film work. I think the funniest monster is Eunice who's the Bride of Frankenstein. Having her always push her poor husband around did make me chuckle a lot not to mention having her played by Fran Drescher was also an ideal choice. There are things that I didn't like about the movie, most notably the soundtrack. Man, this is one dated soundtrack. Although Mark Mothersbaugh's score is pretty good, the songs sounded like they came from an eight year old's kid's iPod from 2012. The autotune also really got on my nerves and having to listen to these terrible pop songs just irritated me.<br/><br/>So while I don't think ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a great movie by any means, I certainly don't think it's as bad as what other critics have said. It does have a creative story, the animation is really fast paced and enjoyable (even though it would've been better hand drawn) and the characters did have some funny things to them. In my opinion, this movie seems to be suited as a fun silly movie to throw on during a party and that's it. I think it's good for a one time watch, but really it's not much of a classic."

","I did not know this movie was directed by Tartakovsky, which is probably why I liked it as much as I did. He is one of my favorite animation directors and he does a great job in directing this movie as well. The humor is a bit hit or miss, mostly kid-oriented but there were some creative jokes and I laughed out loud a couple times. The cast does a good job for the most part and the movie has some heart to it. Overall, a pretty pleasant surprise that could have benefited from some better writing."

","Hotel Transylvania was surprising good. Adam Sandler plays Dracula, the over bearing father trying to protect his adventurous world traveler dreamer daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from anything human, while at the same time tries to keep his hotel business running. Adam Sandler's role as the father figure, is a great new look into the actor's skills unchecked since Punch Drunk Love and Click, it's nice to see him playing something else than an annoying stupid voices, immature characters in movies aimed at teens and men who never grew up. I just glad he didn't play the ""nails scraping on a blackboard"" cringe-inducing way man-child. He is put to the test to try to protect his daughter Mavis when an young free-spirit, bag pack hostel, human named Jonathan (Andy Sanberg) walks into the hotel. In fear of losing his hotel business due to the presence of a human being, he has to figure out a way to quickly get him away. Dracula is force to dress up Jonathan as a monster, so he can freely able to get rid of him without his guest knowing. Before Dracula can get rid of him, his daughter and his guests find Jonathan as the life of the party, and very friendly to the point, that Mavis starts to have feelings for him. Jonathan and Mavis sub-plot relationship isn't as remotely as cheesy as Twilight. The movie even has a scene taking a jab at the Twilight movie in it. The movie is a lot of fun. There is a few sprinkling of potty humor, but it's doesn't detracts from an otherwise fun ride. Full of interesting-to-look-at characters and zany, hectic animation, it's a feast for the eyes with enough jokes thrown in for the parents in the audience, especially in Sandberg's character. The guest of the hotel made out of Frankenstein (Kevin James), Wayne the Wolfman (Steve Buscemi), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) and Murray the Mummy (Ceelo Green) are play their roles great and gives something new to each of the old school monsters. The film is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky well known for his work for Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, and Samurai Jack. The computer animation is Pixar level. From all the animation monster-related movies put out in 2012, this one was worth the money paying. So check in to ""Hotel Transylvania"" to find Adam Sandler and his pals playing the greatest monsters in movie history."
"michaelhirakida","4","16","27","18 November 2013"," BLEH BLEH BLEH! Thats what I have to say to this movie.
","Somehow, Hotel Transylvania feels unfinished. This film is suppose to homage the classic Universial Horror Movie Monsters. But ends up being your typical 2000's and 2010's clich√©d kids fest about having fun and stuff.<br/><br/>So, one of Adam Sandler's films foreshadowed him to play Dracula in a movie. Well, here he is playing Dracula who lives in 1895 (Not Bad Impersonator) as he has a daughter who he must protect because of the big bad humans. The monsters build a hotel/resort to protect her and the monsters from the Humans.<br/><br/>About 110 years later, his daughter Mavis (I think thats the wrong name of the daughter of Dracula. I think its suppose to be Mary Or Whatever) played by Selena Gomez always has wanted to go out in the world and explore. She is turning 118 years old (I think 18 years old in Vampire Years I guess) and her farther lets her out for like a few minutes but tricks her into thinking humans are evil by building this town and having zombies play humans. Anyways, this one human named Johnny played by The Lonely Island's Andy Samberg finds a way through and Dracula dresses him up like a monster and pretends he is the party planner.<br/><br/>But uh oh! Johnny and Mavis are getting a close relationship together! Trying to get him out of the place fails obviously and the ""Chaos"" he creates still goes on.<br/><br/>The animation is 50/50 on this picture. For The Positives, each Character has his/her own unique design. Frankenstien's Monster is blue instead of the regular Green and he wears a Hawaiian shirt. For The Negatives... Ill get to that right now.<br/><br/>I feel that there is too much stuff on screen for me to sink in. Yeah it looks good but it doesn't mean that I will care if a room is highly detailed.<br/><br/>The characters are sometimes amusing but not really funny. In one ""Joke"" Frankenstien's Monster's body comes in half and sneaks up behind the Mummy (Ceelo Green) and farts behind him. Oh. Yeah. Very Funny. VERY FUNNY.<br/><br/>Characters I feel don't emote enough. For Example, if there are 6-8 characters on screen and two are talking, and the other 4-6 are just standing there, they will have the same dumb expression on their face for the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>Also, if you are beginning to watch Monster Movies, don't start with this one. Go watch Horror Of Dracula or Bride Of Frankenstien first. Because if you watch this first, you don't know anything about the characters as they don't explain their traits. Why should we care about characters we don't know anything about? The actors (Most of them) are Adam Sandler's friends. David Spade and Kevin James are examples.<br/><br/>There is one plot hole that I must point out. The Invisible Man is well, invisible for most of the movie but he wears glasses so we can see him. In one scene, he wears shorts and then someone pulls them down and he is embarrassed. So was he naked all this time? Does he wear invisible clothes? If so, why is he wearing Visible clothes? Running gags are unfunny as its like Oh Dracula Gets Mad and Oh Johnny is having fun.<br/><br/>The Ending isn't Even an Ending. Its just a stupid music video with lyrics that don't make no sense. Its just ZING ZING ZING and whatever the lyrics are.<br/><br/>I liked it the first time I watched it which was a few months ago, but now I don't like it anymore. The acting is alright, the animation is OK, but the movie fails to do anything neat with these monsters in the situations they get into.<br/><br/>But there is one scene that I liked. Maybe two. The Wolfman (Steve Buscemi) eats a bunch of sheep that is in the road and one scene where There is this Female dressed as a mummy walking by and The Mummy is has the I WANT face.<br/><br/>Thats basically it. I don't want to overwrite to 1,100 words so Ill just leave at this. Hotel Transylvania is a unfinished movie with no ending, plot holes and characters we don't care about.<br/><br/>49/100 C-"
"bazmitch23","2","21","39","22 March 2013"," Good idea, but not executed very well
","My friend and I wanted to go see this for Halloween. We liked the idea of a hotel for monsters. We both hated it. The characters moved in very OTT way and it was distracting. Every shot was a close up on someone's face, I just wanted to push them away from the camera. The jokes weren't funny, it has the typical Adam Sandler toilet jokes that just make me groan. Jonathon was REALLY annoying. He was this films' Jar Jar. But worst of all we have the ""Liar Revealed"" clich√©. Dracula pretends this human is a monster, they keep the lie up, at the end everyone finds out, they banish the human but then they realize they liked human so they want him back before he gets home.<br/><br/>We've seen this MILLIONS OF TIMES!<br/><br/>However, there were a few things I liked about it; the flying tables scene was very creative. It was like a Terry Gilliam scene, Steve Bucemi's wolfman was funny and there were a few good gags. The animation was nice and Mavis was cute in a very goth way.<br/><br/>I hated it, but I'll give it a 4 for at least trying."

Ever since Twilight came out Gothic movies like these have been popping up to appeal to younger audiences (Monster High, Frankenweenie, etc.) and I'm sure I'll get some unhelpful review votes for this, but the fact that people like this movie is the scariest thing about it. The movie itself is pathetic; bad soundtrack, awful voice actors, typical and predictable story, and to make matters worse there'll be a sequel coming out in 2015! I have now lost all hope in humanity.<br/><br/>I was hoping that Hotel Transylvania might be different from the stupid remakes that won't stop coming out, but no, it was just a fast way to make money off child viewers. Movies today are about money, not quality. It's sad, but I doubt things will ever change."
"sashank_kini-1","2","23","46","14 December 2012"," A film that so desperately fills in bucketloads of childish gags in its scenes that neither do the characters move us nor does the film's humor and the music groove us
","Adam Sandler voices an overprotective control-freak Dracula who keeps his precious daughter Mavis (voiced by tween sensation Selena Gomez) within the confines of his behemothic mansion hotel-for-monsters Transylvania. Count Dracula despises human presence for reasons revealed later in the film, and so he cautions his fellow-monsters and daughter Mavis to be wary of their presence. On Mavis' 118th birthday, Count calls everybody to his abode and arranges for a party. Mavis' ultimate desire is to leave the palace and meet humans and she makes this birthday wish to her dad. Even though the wish is granted with conditions, Dracula has a back-up plan to get her back to him and keep her in control. All goes smoothly until an actual human named Jonathan (voiced by SNL regular Andy Samberg) checks in. Predictably, Jonathan and Mavis show fondness towards each other and Dracula now has to drive this human presence away before things get monster-messy. <br/><br/>It is one thing to make a film that appeals to three year olds, but it is completely a different thing to make a film that seems to be written by three year olds; while in Case 1 you may get a charming movie that appeals to a wide audience, especially young children while in Case 2 you get a juvenile attempt unworthy to be shown even to the youngest audiences. Unfortunately, Hotel Transylvania falls under Case B; it is a film that so desperately tries to fill in as many childish gags as possible in its scenes that neither do the characters manage to move us nor does the humor and the music groove us. While almost every Pixar film (even the massively underrated Cars and its sequel) concentrates first on its plot and character development and then the dialogs and gags, Hotel Transylvania seems as if the writers first brainstormed as many kiddy jokes they could come up with and then put in characters to mouth each gag, and finally sketched some story in the background with dull, contrived colors. <br/><br/>Take the first half of the movie: almost half of it is spent on introducing the various monsters and in many many many unfunny jokes. Once Jonathan arrives and explores the hotel along with the Count, we get nothing more than Jonathan trying to show what 'cool' is, hence more more more derivative jokes and situations. Characters keep tumbling in and out and the jokes really do not have anything to do with the main plot. Part two is not much different except for the development of the oversweet romance between Mavis and Jonathan and everything-going-wrong- to-be-set-right-by-the-main character situation. There also is a rap performance by our Count Dracula and vocal presence of singer Will.i.am which is really an emasculation-of-everything-worth-living-for-in-this- world terrible. <br/><br/>Generally, I stay away from Adam Sandler and Eddy Murphy's movies because of their dicey reputation. I liked what I watched of Sandler's 50 first dates and Murphy's Beverley Hill Cop is a classic, but some of the recent outputs have notorious critical ratings and mixed audience opinions. Sandler only puts on a cheap accent and tries sounding as if the dialogs are actually funny, which is a very difficult task. Gomez is what Mavis or any cute-young-female-protagonist would sound like, therefore banal and I think animated film-makers should bring in unique voices for characters (Miley Cyrus' slightly hoarse voice worked in Bolt). Andy Samberg again has a voice suiting his character but what can he do without a good script or a skit? My advice: stick to R-rated D*** in A Box Part 2 with Timberlake and other such skits on SNL and not-to-forget more wicked Lonely Island albums instead of future collaborations with Sandler. <br/><br/>A truly horrible decision (and one that really infuriated me) was putting that auto-tune Will.i.am bummer. While none of the other songs are worth any mention, Will.i.am's recent nasal exploitations stand out the most for all the wrong reasons. B.E.P did a wonderful job on their unfairly underrated incredibly catchy The E.N.D, but they went overboard with their auto-tune on their next album, the unlistenable The Beginning. The group is on a hiatus, and its lead male member Will.i.am is now working on his fourth album and some collaborations that again range from unmemorable (the David Guetta track) to obnoxious (Scream & Shout) to simply painful (This Is Love). His songs may be hits in clubs where there is a medley of crappy songs played at full volume and the only thing teenagers do is trying to outdo each other's dancing, but all the flavor is gone when these tracks are listened to as standalones ‚Äì the heavy auto-tune and electronic beats smelling like burnt CDs. I know my rant above deviates from the movie but Will.i.am needs to stop messing up his music for want of money.<br/><br/>The 3-D in Hotel Transylvania works not to great effect as the colors used in the film are mainly dark in shades like black, brown, grey, and dull white. Once they are screened in 3-D they get duller to a greater extent than colors like sky blue and bright red and yellow. A similar problem happened, but to a greater extent while watching Harry Potter and the Deathly-Hallows 2 where I felt I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more without the blasted 3-D (my city doesn't have a 2-D option for those not wanting 3-D). But the 3-D glasses had one benefit: I could figure out how much the film exasperated me by counting the number of times I took off my glasses and set them aside during the film.<br/><br/>Adults, please take your kids for an upcoming Pixar film which has a higher probability of being good, and kids, please tell any of your parents not to take you for a film like Hotel Transylvania. Spend it on education¬Ö or better films."

Through the whole movie I was just waiting for something to grab my interest, but alas, I waited in vain. Maybe if you assume it will be bad, it will be better than expected, but I thought it would be good and was pretty disappointed with the whole thing. From the jokes to the creativity of the characters and even the voices were just lacking something. The animation was good (what animation isn't good these days?) but unoriginal and boring."
"illbebackreviews","6","6","9","22 February 2013"," A very un-unique animation which is still surprisingly good in its own way
","When 'Hotel Transylvania' first came out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it for two reasons: Adam Sandler and vampires. I thought a comedy about Dracula would be boring. This movie isn't that bad but at the same time isn't that funny In this movie, we have Count Dracula who has organized a building called Hotel Transylvania to keep his fellow monsters safe from the evil humans. Now, doesn't that sound familiar? From a Pixar movie? MONSTERS INC! One day, a human accidentally ventures into the monster world...Hmm...Still familiar and meets Dracula's daughter, Mavis voiced by Selena Gomez and falls in love...Still remind me of the Sully and Boo relationship as well as segments of Twilight.<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying that voice acting is brilliant. Adam Sandler really was great as Count Dracula, Adam Samberg was great as Johnny and Kevin James was a great Frankenstein. Selena Gomez also did a great job. The story however isn't anything special by any means. Too much of the story is from Monsters Inc but there are parts of Twilight in this movie which I love as a lot of it is indirectly mocking that god-awful series. The characters are funny but by no means any memorable. The dialogue is actually the movie's greatest strength. It really is hilarious in so many ways. There are so many one liners and Johnny's line ""Wow man! Your Dracula impression is way over the top!"" is simply hilarious as is the woman with the annoying voice saying to the monster in the kitchen ""Your voice is annoying"" If it weren't for the dialogue, this movie could so easily be horrible. The visual animations in the movie are stunning with each scene being carefully visualised and is truly a treat for the eye.<br/><br/>The film's main problem is its very close resemblance to Monsters Inc which makes the movie nothing unique. However, the mocking of Twilight is handled very well, the animations are superb, the characters and voice acting are done well and is well directed but a bit rushed at certain points during the film. The film could also have been a good ten minutes shorter and we wouldn't have missed anything funny or special. Overall, a good animation movie which isn't unique but funny"

","When monsters want to go on vacation, they turn to Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler) Hotel Transylvania, a luxurious castle resort where they can simply be themselves without the possibility of being bothered by humans. For one special weekend, Dracula invites some of his creature friends: The Invisible Man (David Spade), The Mummy (CeeLo Green) among others to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez). Things do not go according to plan when a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) manages to crash Dracula's party and then begins to fall in love with Mavis.<br/><br/>Since I plan on seeing Hotel Transylvania 2 tomorrow, I thought I would first look at Hotel Transylvania. Adam Sandler has not had too many good movies this millennium. Most of them are just bad, stupid comedies. This one is a little stupid but I wouldn't call it bad. This is an animated kids movie so I wasn't expecting highbow or too deep. I thought it did its job with what it was trying to do. The animation isn't groundbreaking to say the least but I thought it was decent. The monsters all looked the way they were supposed to and their powers and abilities were well done as well. I can't speak too much more about that seeing that the theatrical version was in 3D and had more bells and whistles and I just saw it on Netflix. I also thought that the voice-over work was pretty good all around. Adam Sandler was great as Dracula and had some funny moments and some good one liners while also having great chemistry with the other characters. He was supposed to be Dracula but he was really just another Adam Sandler character but I didn't mind. What was also odd was the french accent Jon Lovitz used as Quasimodo. Being that this is an Adam Sandler film, the other characters are voiced by actors who have previously worked with Sandler in other films. The film did have other funny moments not involving Adam Sandler as most of its comedy comes from its portrayal of all the different monsters and their interactions with Dracula and one another. Most of the jokes were childish but I still found them funny. Underneath all of that is just a story about a father-daughter relationship where the father is just trying to raise his daughter and wanting what is best for her and trying to keep her safe. There's also a good message on stereotypes and prejudice. Sure the story may be a little clich√© but it is just so damn cute.<br/><br/>Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

"brown-faith922","3","6","10","29 July 2013"," Not That Funny...
","This movies is funny, but not that funny. Obviously that is an extremely opinionated assertion, but it's my opinion. There just wasn't enough humor to cover up the obvious annoying clich√©s and the painful lack of likable characters.<br/><br/>This movie does absolutely nothing to draw you in and make you care at all about what happens to these creatures. The premise is great - a hotel where all the terrors of the past and present congregate? How could such an interesting idea be messed up? Like this.<br/><br/>For one thing, there were no surprises. Without giving too much away, I can say that it was obvious from the beginning what was going to happen to each one-dimensional character, and even more irritating was that it all happened using the same formula as every other stupid teen angst movie ever made. None of the characters interested me. None were developed enough.<br/><br/>Were there funny moments? Yes, and of course they managed to fit in the tiny, harmless yet funny reference to the certain famous/infamous series regarding sparkly fanged creatures, and that was all good and satisfying. Still, there were few rib-crackers... nothing that made you fall out of your seat giggling.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm only just getting to my real problem with this film - it's obvious political and social messages. Bottom line, let your kids go, they should be given room to breathe, etc. Whether you agree with that message or not, we see it so sickeningly often in film these days, it's become a kind of disgusting platitude. Originality? Anyone? And also, they do next to nothing to veil the obvious metaphor of monsters living in hiding (literally in closets, for some of them) misunderstood by the rest of the world. I make so social or political statements here when I say that it was way, way too obvious. And it makes the movie, for me, far more dramatic than it needs to be. Obviously, no one is going to take such a silly animated movie seriously, so why try to stuff dramatic messages in there? And why is it that a kid's movie is all of a sudden the place to be stuffing these political messages? In short, there was nothing about this movie that made me think, ""Heh, that's interesting. I like that."" I'd seen it all before. If it had cracked me up, perhaps I could have given it a pass. But it just wasn't that funny."

It has the usual stale kids' movie humor of recent years, complete with de rigeur auto-tuned musical numbers. For this level of spastic comedy, I was hoping for more laughs, and it's a fairly blah selection of voice talent for the cast. Mostly, it's short on laughs and feels long at just 90 minutes. On the bright side, there's an upward-surge when they finally venture outside the hotel walls (finally giving Buscemi some much-needed spotlight).<br/><br/>My kid liked it, so the movie's got that going for it.

","The movie starts out looking like a sweet movie about a vampire father and daughter growing up together. Well, don't let that mislead you.<br/><br/>After the first two minutes of the movie, we go from 1895 to present day. It shows Dracula planning for his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday. He has invited all his monster friends to come stay at the hotel and prepare for Mavis's birthday extravaganza. This scene is utter chaos, and just looked like ""bad animated movie"" to me. I mean, when the movie includes the vocal talents of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Ceelo Green, and Selena Gomez, I didn't have very high expectations. But instead of being a cute animated movie, it turned out to be 90 minutes worth of a random spew of events.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to families with children under the age of seven, who are going to the movies only for the purpose of entertainment.

","It feels pretty good when people take an old story and put a fresh spin on it. ""Transylvania"" is a great new entry in the world of animation movies, a genre that has been thriving for the most part in the last couple of decades. In the new film, Count Dracula and to a certain extent, some of his monster peers discover that family life can a bit stressful. That's in addition to having to deal with centuries of problems with humans.<br/><br/>Things get so bad that Dracula builds a ""resort"" where misunderstood creatures can find peace and protection from the rest of the world. It also helps him deal with his 118 year old daughter. It all appears to be working until one day, an adventurous human soul wanders into the castle, and things become even more complicated for all parties involved.<br/><br/>Soon, we have Dracula trying to contain the damage, keep up appearances, and eventually trying some unorthodox methods to solve his problem. The film, like ""Paranormal"" earlier this year shows plenty of heart, tolerance and has us entertained throughout the movie. In fact, the film remembers to bring in music, comedy, and some sharp and clever dialogue. There is plenty of vocal talent in the film, all contributing a bit to the overall effect.

The characters are also not that deep. Often, this will take away from a film (or completely ruin it, like it did for ""The Good Dinosaur"").

It seems Sandler has more misses than hits these days, but this was clearly a hit. Funny for both adults and children, great use of characters to drive the humor home.

"RageReviewer","7","3","4","21 April 2014"," A monster-sized movie about, what else, MONSTERS!
","Hotel Transylvania is a very zany combination of classic horror-movie monsters, ancient paranoia combined with modern terminology, fast-paced comedy, and even a strange teenage romance between two ""teenagers"" (one is really 118). So where to begin...<br/><br/>The biggest positive is that Adam Sandler finally found a role befitting his voice. He voices Dracula, the iconic vampire of old, who in this movie is a very controlling yet caring father of Mavis (portrayed by Selena Gomez), and is also the creator and manager of Hotel Transylvania, a safe haven for monsters where they can relax and take a vacation. Here we see other iconic monsters such as Frankenstein (and his wife), The Wolfman (with his wife and kids), The Mummy, the Flyman, Quasimodo, and even the Invisible Man. Each of these monsters voices fit so well with their roles, such as Frankenstein played by Kevin James, ""Wayne"" the Wolfman by Steve Buscemi, Ceelo Green as ""Murray"" the Mummy, and even Chris Parnell as the Flyman. Oh, I could go on about the monsters, they're all cleverly portrayed, even if some of them are a bit stereotypical (Fran Drescher as ""Eunice"", or Bride of Frankenstein, while it is hilarious, does get on your nerves the more you hear it...). Even Selena Gomez does a very decent job as being Mavis, this ""teenage"" vampire who (not a big shocker) wants to see the world, yet her father, once again being controlling, scares her to come back to her father's loving arms in the sanctuary of his Hotel. <br/><br/>Then enter Jonathan...<br/><br/>Jonathan, as played by Andy Samberg, seems more like a typical teenage idiot who is too dumb to be afraid until it is too late; in fact, that's how he got to the castle in the first place! He arrives at the castle after a few townspeople tell him not to go, and his reaction is to simply take a picture with his phone? Who reacts like that when someone tells you your life is in danger? To continue, he later realizes that he has to blend in as a fellow monster, claiming to be a relative of Frankenstein, and has to show Mavis, and eventually Dracula, what they have been missing all their lives...a modern twist to their classical hotel. <br/><br/>Jonathan to me seems to be the bigger blemish to an otherwise great film; his character seems to be nothing but the clueless idiot who just stumbles upon the Hotel, yet the other monsters take him seriously enough to consider his opinions? It eventually turns out to be a liar- revealed story where he's revealed NOT TO BE A MONSTER. And so he actually owns up to his lie and decides to head home. Dracula chases after him with his wild band of monsters in tow, and that's when even more humans show up in town at the local festival celebrating these classic monsters. These people seem to fall not too far from the Johnny Tree, as they simply accept them and want to help Dracula reach Jonathan and his plane (which leads to a Twilight Parody that had me laughing out of my seat). Finally, Jonathan and Mavis end up on a beach in Hawaii enjoying a different sort of vacation than Hotel Transylvania.<br/><br/>So where are the positives? Again, the casting. A lot of these roles are very well portrayed, even Jonathan. Along with that the humor is great, there are plenty of things that will make both kids and adults laugh. The character development is sensitive too, if not a bit predictable (again the liar-revealed story, but with a twist where there's TWO liars this time). And finally, I have to say the animation is near flawless. Sony Picture Studios did a fantastic job animating this, especially the monsters, they look great! And of course Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of notable Cartoon Network's Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, and Symbiotic Titan) is just a gigantic asset to the film.<br/><br/>The negatives? It's mostly a fault on the humans, as most if not all of them (especially the ""protagonist"" Jonathan) just don't add much other than to be the thing to hate, directly or indirectly. Thankfully, the only human you see for the majority of the film is just one human in contrast to loads of monsters. Also, the concept of the ""zing"" between Jonathan and Mavis needed a desperate rename (especially since Adam Sandler raps about it, which is something that broke my ears). It's touched on a lot in the film (such as ""You only zing once in your life""), yet couldn't they just call it a connection and get it over with? Do they really have to tone it down for little kids who can't even comprehend past 2 syllables? And finally, it may just be me, but I felt the pacing was very rushed in the whole film, especially when it came to Dracula. I understand that he's a control freak, and that he has to be quick on his feet in case something happens in his hotel, so it almost works for him. But in one scene where he's flying down hallways to catch up to Jonathan (who gets kidnapped for about the 3rd time, big surprise), he nearly runs through her daughter as if he were a train. I could hardly keep up with him! But again, it was something that was bothering me and I felt that it was way too quick.<br/><br/>Altogether, this movie was a smart, well thought-out product that proves that once you know where you're meant to be, flaunt it! I felt this was one of Adam Sandler's better roles, and it just feels that he loved every moment of it. It's worth the watch, especially around Halloween time, pick it up when you get the chance!"

Now I know this is meant to appeal to children (though there are a few scenes, that are borderline to say the least, if shown to the little ones), but that doesn't mean it has to be stupid. Pixar set a high standard of course, but other studios have followed and there have been quite a few entertaining fun animated movies.<br/><br/>While this isn't DOA (or undead to stay with the theme), it clearly lacks heart.

","In order to escape from the constant depredations of hostile villagers (which resulted in the death of his wife), Count Dracula has opened a hotel catering only to assorted supernatural clientele (Frankenstein's monster, werewolves etc.). This is also convenient for protecting his daughter Mavis, despite her wish to explore farther afield now she has come of age (a rather arbitrary 118 - not sure why it should be an extra 100 years for a vampire, but never mind). Into this oasis of calm comes Jonathan, an inadvertent human tourist, and he and Mavis fall for each other.<br/><br/>This is a CGI animated movie with a good voice cast, headed up by Adam Sandler doing a creditable job as Dracula. It is essentially a kids' movie and should be judged as such. By that criterion it is effective: the characters are (mostly) sympathetic, there are some decent gags (though, for me, no belly laughs), constant action (though no great surprises), and the film works OK. For all that, though, it leaves no lasting impression - it is fair to regard it as adequate, it would be overstating the case to make it out to be much more than that.<br/><br/>I wasn't able to see the 3D version, and so cannot comment on the 3D."

So when a human accidentally enters the hotel, Dracula has to do everything he can to prevent the other guests to find out or even suspect anything about the human being a human. But at the same time, his daughter gets involved, and there's this whole comedy-thing with wacky animation and over-the-top characters and all that.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is a movie that I was very unsure if I really liked or just liked. It was kind of in the middle. But after some long thinking, I came to the conclusion that it's a very good movie that I really enjoyed. The main reason this movie is so good is because of the sense of humor. There are references to classic horror movies such as Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and The Fly. There are also just plain LOL-jokes and even a joke that directly criticizes Twilight. I mean, wow! Sony Pictures Animation have always been known for their great sense of humor (most notably in 2009's Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). But I think this one takes the cake.<br/><br/>But the reason I was skeptical whether I really liked it or just liked it was that the story is incredibly uninteresting. Ironically enough, for a movie that has a scene making fun of Twilight, the main plot of the movie is a love story between Dracula's daughter and the human visitor. The love story isn't bad, just clich√© and forgettable. The story also doesn't really have any true twists and turns, besides one that's small and pretty insignificant. It's basically just the ""it's been a misunderstanding, we have to get back the person that misunderstood before it's too late""-type of plot points.<br/><br/>The story also had potential. There is one scene where we learn about Dracula's past, and it's actually pretty dark and emotional. But they blew it by not doing anything with that plot and just kept on going with the romantic comedy story.<br/><br/>With all these gripes aside, I really did enjoy Hotel Transylvania, mainly because it is such a good comedy. And not just for animation, it is right up there with being a great comedy. It's not as funny as The Dictator or Ted, obviously, but it is a very enjoyable movie that's hard not to enjoy."

","Throughout almost all our fairy tales we have always seen big, scary monsters and children hiding under their beds in fear that these monsters would come and eat them up. Ever heard of a story where things happen the other way around? Dracula (Sandler) has built a hotel called Hotel Transylvania where all monsters and beasts can come and feel safe. No scary humans to come and disturb them, only darkness and peace. But when Jonathan (Samberg) a young human bag packer arrives at the castle, Dracula is petrified. Dracula's young daughter Mavis (Gomez) is eager to explore the world outside but her father refuses to let her go into the destructive and dangerous human world. The movie explores a good storyline which is the exact opposite of the stories we usually hear. The movie is light and entertaining but the movie still lacks a lot of humour. Yes it would appeal to a 10-year-old but the movie still needs to give the audience some more reasons to laugh."

","There are very few movies anymore that are truly kid friendly, but i truly enjoyed this one! The best part is it has nice messages for both kids and parents. My boys loved the whole monster theme. I personally would wait till a child is 8 or 9 before letting them see it only in case they may fear goofy monsters and voices. It was nice as an adult to have some unexpected clean laughs. The many generational perspectives, and even in an odd way, cultural perspectives can make this an easy film for a broad range of ages to enjoy, from 8 to 70 years. I also enjoyed hearing good old stars like Kevin James, Adam Sandler, and Fran Dresher as the voices. As an 80's teenager i have a natural respect for these actors, actresses, and ""90's feel"" films. I did not see it in 3D, but based on the animation i just saw, i am sure it would even be better in 3d. So this would be a fabulous film to add to the October/Halloween festivities. It really put us into the spirit of fun and laughs."

","Cee-Lo Green wasn't though. This movie got more and more silly and ridiculous as it went, much like a snowball made of humor. But then it fell and landed on me, which wasn't that fun. All the main casting was excellent, although the shrunken heads weren't Whoopi Goldberg like I thought, but an impostor. Sandler was great, casting Selena Gomez was pretty smart, and Andy Samberg was goofy. This makes the second movie in a row Samberg and Sandler have worked on together, but I like to ignore the first one.<br/><br/>As to why I didn't like this movie... Cee Lo sings with auto-tune, and Sandler raps. Yes, he raps. The two real-world songs they used were by LMFAO, and that's not how I want this generation to be remembered by. But I saw it in a theater filled with kids, and they say more about than I can. It's a good movie, and I'm glad the 3D wasn't too annoying. (There are plenty of good adult jokes too.) You should go see it."

There were some funny parts, but not because they were funny - because they were so ""silly"" you couldn't help but laugh.<br/><br/>I feel like this movie was made especially childish - yes I am aware it's a kid's movie, but do kid's movies really have to be this foolish? When I was a kid I enjoyed movies with interesting and original story lines with limited singing and acts of inanity.<br/><br/>If you're an adult I wouldn't waste time with this movie, that is just my opinion.

"Simon_Says_Movies","5","6","11","29 September 2012"," Unsubstantial Fluff, but Should Please Kids
","In a groundbreaking (and diverse) age of animation where Disney is no longer the sole juggernaut, competing houses Pixar, DreamWorks, Aardman, Laika and Studio Ghibli (and to a lesser extent Fox's Blue Sky Studios) continually offer audiences compelling fare that often break any preconceived notions that this overarching genre is simply for children.<br/><br/>Struggling to find its foothold in the industry as DreamWorks once did is Sony Pictures Animation, purveyor of fare including Open Season and The Smurfs ‚Äì an entity which seems decidedly stuck in the past. Offering up slapstick-laden fluff of the lowest common denominator, the products flowing from this studio (even at their most comforting and brisk) are insubstantial and almost always offer nothing but a fleeting diversion.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is a chief offender when it comes to all the issues plaguing mainstream animation today and in a number of ways seems like a significant step back from the frisky energy boasted from 2009's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. At the very least that well-received film had the audacity to adapt a tricky children's novel, whereas this Adam Sandler-led vehicle seems as archaic as the gloomy manor in which this film is set.<br/><br/>However, not to be a complete ogre (a creature which ironically does not make an appearance amongst the mummies, gremlins and more famous monsters and ghouls), Hotel Transylvania does not even seem to be reaching for anything beyond mediocrity and seems simply intent on pleasing a young audience for 90 minutes ‚Äì a basic merit I cannot entirely dismiss.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is not offensively bland and frankly, the easy-going nature of the production is likely to please its target demographic while keeping accompanying parents rooted in their seats (this is no ""Oogieloves,"" or so I can surmise).<br/><br/>Sidestepping the inconsequential nature of Hotel Transylvania's execution, a significant failing of the film comes via the misleading trailers which essentially play out as a bait and switch. The promotional material promises a comedy of errors whereby a human stumbles upon a retreat for the fantastical. Hilarity would hopefully ensure as Adam Sandler's Dracula tries to hide the true nature of his abode (and its many odd residents).<br/><br/>However, that portion of the film plays out almost immediately and what we're left with is the well-worn overprotective parent story as the hotel's newcomer falls for the famed vamp's daughter, Mavis. Adding a level of creepiness to the whole ordeal (and I don't mean of the horror variety) is that Mavis is 118 years old and is essentially being kept in solitude by her father. Freud, eat your heart out.<br/><br/>That central plot thread of Hotel Transylvania is hopelessly clich√©d and so overdone it adds yet another layer of dust to this proverbial dinosaur of a movie. One could name a few dozen films in a matter of seconds that utilize that trope as its driving comedic force and alas it's not even the first animated flick of the year to do so. Pixar's Brave also employed the overbearing (at points literally ""over-bearing"") parent shtick and unsurprisingly it turned out to be one of the weakest and most insubstantial entries in the studio's canon. Hotel Transylvania with its simplified animation, less successful humor and weaker voice cast is another step down on that disappointment.<br/><br/>With the aforementioned voice cast, an impressive line-up has nevertheless been assembled. Sandler is the classical Transylvanian blood-sucker ‚Äì velcome! ‚Äì Selena Gomez his daughter and the guests attending her birthday include Andy Samberg (as the human presence) Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Rob Riggle, Fran Drescher and Cee lo Green. Samberg is among the funnier of the bunch and nobody does Buscemi quite like Buscemi, but regardless of the talent on hand, there is not a memorable performance between them. Nobody is offensively awful but when the material isn't failing them¬ÖOK the material fails them.<br/><br/>Bah, but enough with the hate as this is not in fact a scathing review and as a whole Hotel Transylvania does not make the damning sin of being boring, it certainly proves Sandler is capable of starring in a movie not of the atrocious variety. There are a number of jokes in David I. Stern's screenplay that hit home (even when you can see them coming) and there is something charming about seeing all these creatures share the screen in a cheery monster mash-up. It's like a more comedic The Expendables done via The Brothers Grimm.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Hotel Transylvania is inoffensive fluff that will be better served in a home video capacity than it ever will on the big screen. There is simply no ""must see"" element to this film. A little too noisy and a lot too bland, Sandler and co. should be able to please nearly every child in the audience but will never have the power to pull the child out of an older crowd.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

","Hotel Transylvania has occasionally cute moments and intermittently interesting art design (otherwise, it's mostly K-Mart Hallowe'en d√©cor), but the story is trite, hackneyed, clich√©, and any other words you can think of that mean: nobody broke a sweat on the script or on the plot. The voices are mostly uninteresting, except for Steve Buscemi, who attracts interest by demonstrating that he was catastrophically miscast as the Werewolf. The film is also aimed at a very, very young age group, something you might not understand from seeing the trailer, which makes the film seem about 10 times more sophisticated than it actually is. If you've got little kids, take 'em. If you don't, you'll fall asleep about halfway through the opening credits. If you do go, DO NOT spring the extra bucks for the 3D version. There's about as much 3D here as there is on your average Etch-A-Sketch."

Drac's an overprotective dad and wants her to stay at home: in a giant mansion he's turned into a plush hotel for all the monsters of the world to relax.

Mavis and Jonathan hit it off but Dracula gets to him first ‚Äì and frantically masquerades the kid into monster form so his daughter won't know the difference.<br/><br/>That about sums up this claustrophobic mess, but with a title like HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA it shouldn't be surprising most of the film takes place there. The only problem is: there's little more than that over-saturated lobby that gets really dull quick.<br/><br/>Sandler, who's needed a hit for years, doesn't suck in doing Drac's voice, but Adam Samberg's Jonathan sounds like a deliberate imitation of an airhead college jerk you wouldn't want to spend a minute with, much less ninety ‚Äì which feels more like an eternity.

","Every father of a daughter has wished at some point in his life to keep his little girl well protected from the world and the wrong guys in a remote castle in the middle of nowhere for 118 years. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is an animated feature about a father, who happens to be Dracula, voiced by Adam Sandler, who does exactly that to his daughter Mavis, voiced by Selena Gomez.<br/><br/>The story begins in the year 1895 where Dracula is unexpectedly forced to be a single father and raise his baby girl Mavis after a tragedy takes his wife's life. He builds a huge castle for Mavis and turns it into a hotel for monsters. His intentions is to make it a refuge for monsters (insects included) where no humans are allowed. Flash forward to the current year, it is the eve of Mavis 118th birthday. It seems to be the equivalent to a human teenager's 18th birthday. Mavis quickly reminds Dracula that his promise to her on her 118th birthday is that she would get to finally explore the world outside of the castle and even travel to a different country.<br/><br/>Not wanting to disappoint his little girl, he allows her to visit a small village just outside of the castle that same night. However, it turns out that the village is not real. It is made of multiple facades with Dracula's zombie workers disguised as humans who scare Mavis away by using fire and threatening to kill her.<br/><br/>Her curiosity of humans is put to rest by the experience. But, when she meets a mystery young male drifter named Jonathan who stumbles into the hotel claiming the identity of a party planner for her birthday who is Frankenstein's cousin ‚Äì John Stein, Mavis feels a certain ""zing"" with him that she just can't shake. At the end, his true identity is revealed in the worst way ‚Äì under the scrutiny of the hotel's monster guests as well as Mavis who is hurt by her Father's betrayal but is fascinated even more by Jonathan. However, upon Dracula's wishes Jonathan exits the hotel to continue his travels. Dracula says, ""I want to kill him.

","The first thing you should ask yourself before seeing the film is, do you want to hear Adam Sandler's Dracula impression for an hour an a half. Second should i trust Adam Sandler to not put any penis jokes in a children's film, oh and you can't. Thirdly, is there another film playing the same time for the same duration you can watch while your kids watch this one. If not than this is just one of many sacrifices of being a parent. <br/><br/>First of all while watching a bad movie you may not be aware of it till about 30 minutes in, exactly the same amount of time your refund expires. So now your here for the long haul, at this point I still have some hope but to pass the time I'll just pick out reasons why this movie sucks.<br/><br/>I noticed most of the movie is just in a few rooms in a hotel, which means most of the money went to the actors or produces or Adam Sandler. You can tell an animated film is cheaply made when a table is cloned 100 times and used in the big action scene. <br/><br/>The plot, well i guess it has one. Dracula doesn't want his daughter to grow so he convinces her the world and humans are terrifying and evil. That's it, no bad guy, no one to root for, everything about it was cheap. To fill in the boringness Adam and his pals make off colour jokes I'm guessing for my benefit. So little creativity was used when making this too, remember how Toy Story cleverly brought toys to like or shrek did with fairy tale characters. You would expect something smart with monsters but there is nothing. <br/><br/>So if your kid tells you he likes it, remember that's not how kids say they like something. It's same way we react to seeing a great movie expect with hopefully no F-bombs."
"dense_electric","5","5","9","14 October 2012"," It had a lot of potential...
","I saw this earlier today, and I was a bit underwhelmed. The film certainly has an interesting premise - it's the relatively unused ""monsters are afraid of humans"" bit we saw in Monsters, Inc., though not handled nearly as well.<br/><br/>The film tries to be a comedy, and fails in that regard. There are one or two memorable jokes, but most of the humor is relegated firmly to the ""fart joke"" territory. There's also the mandatory awful musical number at the end which serves no purpose but to remind you that the creators were aiming this at children and only children (I actually got up and left the theater at this point).<br/><br/>However, my biggest gripe with the film was the total lack of pacing. Not in the story, but in the animation. Visually, everything just moves way too fast on the screen. The animators seem to have absolutely no sense of timing for comic effect - while you're still trying to work out the previous visual gag, the next one has already come and gone. Maybe you'd have to see it to understand my meaning, but the animation just needs to slow the hell down. That alone might have saved this movie.<br/><br/>That said, the film *does* have some redeeming qualities. Most have criticized the story as being too clich√© or predictable, and while it was to an extent, it didn't bother me. I found Mavis's character and her relationship with Dracula to be one of the more compelling aspects of the film, and I can't help but feel like they would have ended up with a better movie if they'd focused on this more and left the fart jokes at the door (though admittedly, not one that would appeal to little kids).<br/><br/>Unless you're really itching for something new to see, I probably wouldn't spend the money, though I suppose it's also not the *worst* vampire movie coming out this year..."

","In the last couple of decades Pixar has raised the bar so high for animated movies, that even if a perfectly fine animated movie comes along, we end up feeling underwhelmed by it. That's precisely the case with Hotel Transylvania.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania tells the story of modern day Dracula, voiced by Adam Sandler, who runs a hotel away from human world meant only for monsters. When the whole monster world ‚Äì including all type of zombies, werewolfs, mummies, and Frankenstein, comes to his hotel to celebrate the birthday of Dracula's daughter's 118th birthday, a human boy discovers the hotel and falls in love with his daughter. <br/><br/>Though it was fun to watch the whole monster world assemble under one room, but soon the proceedings get reduced to silly jokes which would make only 12 year olds laugh. I kept thinking about The Cabin in the Woods throughout the movie, where all different kind of monsters are assembled and thought even if some part of that innovation was applied in this movie, this would have been eminently watchable. <br/><br/>The only person who could make some kind of an impact through his voice was Adam Sandler, who did a nice impersonation of Dracula's voice. But even that was unfunny after some time. But looking at his standards, I guess this was the best movie Adam Sandler would have done after Punch Drunk Love. Andy Samberg as Jonathan, the boy who discovers the hotel, is irritating, and Selena Gomez as Dracula's daughter is nothing to write about. <br/><br/>It's a shame to see that there is already a sequel planned for this lame movie.

It's like all the kids these days have ADD and can't concentrate on a well-told story so the filmmakers feel the need to have almost no pause in the action and just go from scene to scene with no breather, inserting pop-culture references everywhere. Even my eight year old cousin who I took to see this said the movie felt ""like it went faster than other movies."" <br/><br/>The voice cast is excellent, with Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Andy Samberg and Kevin James lending their talents.

Bursts of manic pacing steamroll over most of the wit in the story, and by the end the whole movie is bogged down by parental mush about trusting one's kid to make her own discoveries.

A bunch of characters playing their stereotypes for all they are worth, and nothing more.<br/><br/>Fortunately, things do pick up and there actually is a story. That was a relief for me. The last 2/3 of the film is fairly entertaining. Still obnoxious, and certainly not all that original, but entertaining. There is some emotional heart to it, and uh, yeah. The ending, as the plot is wrapped up and before the credits roll, is just over the top ridiculous, so much so that even the most cynical viewer probably cannot resist a smile. The credits themselves are fun, as well.<br/><br/>Is Hotel Transylvania a ""good"" film? I have a hard time going that far. Did it really need to be made, i.e. does it add anything of particular value to our cultural experience? Resounding ""No"". But is it really all that bad? No; it is fairly harmless, and like similar films, decent viewing for children, with a good message and lots of fun, bright colors. That is about it."

","I grew up on the Classic Universal movie monsters of the 30s and the 40s, so I definitely had to see this movie, and overall, I think it's a pretty strong movie with few weak points. Of its weak points, it has too many non-generic creatures. Dracula creates a hotel for monsters, but in the movie, ""monster"" remains unspecific. The castle is teeming with ghosts, walking dead, cryptids, mutant freaks, outcasts from society and a few mythological beasts. It could have been entirely devoted to ghosts, undead creatures and demons, but instead, it goes a bit too far with a few creatures that defy explanation and identification. The hotel is meant for these outcasts of society to exist alongside each other away from humans (shades of ""Monsters vs. Aliens) ‚Äì somehow forgetting that many of these beings were once human themselves. There is a buried political statement here about how society treats its outcasts, but the point is never addressed. However, this cacophony of contradictions is pushed to the background because the main plot is mostly about Dracula (Adam Sandler) being over protective of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez). Mavis was originally going to be played by Miley Cyrus, but backed out. This works well to the film's benefit because Miley's Tennessee accent would not have worked for the sheltered daughter. Not only that, but Selena does pull off the innocent effervescence required for the character. As Dracula, Sandler's signature voice is practically unrecognizable with the thick Slavic accent and sounds at times almost exactly like Bela Lugosi. It is into this world that a lost hiker voiced by Adam Samberg wanders, and Dracula quickly tries hiding him as a relative of one of the body parts of the Frankenstein Monster, once again using the name of his creator. The movie has a fast and furious roller coaster parade of jokes and scenes; the best material comes from Steve Buscemi as the harried Wolfman as the father of a litter of kids who fail to respect him. At one point, Dracula asks straightly: ""Do you have any kids left who still respect you?"" There are also a few gags from Dracula suffering the indignity of years of bad Dracula impressions and alleged vampire misconceptions. When getting a look at ""Twilight,"" he asks very forlornly, ""Is this what my legacy has come to?"" The movie has a top-notch cast of comedy actors including David Spade, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher, Molly Spade and Cee-Lo Green as the singing voice of a fat mummy. The animation is superb; it may not be as top-notch as ""Brave,"" but then, why are we expected to have these 3-D movies compete with each other in animation? While the movie does tend to drag down on logic at times, it pulls together with the zest and appeal of a carnival fun house, and if the animation over the credits is any indication: I could see the movie siring an animated TV cartoon."

"diac228","8","4","8","7 February 2013"," Light joyful fun, Hotel Transylvania is a shockingly good time for all
","From the outside, Hotel Transylvania may look like a clich√©d and typical aim-at-the-kids-mooch-off-the-adults animated film with pop music, celebrities, cute characters, and plenty of childish humor. It may look like a film that doesn't strive for the heights of Pixar and instead aims for the likes of Dreamworks' lesser efforts. And from a film buff's perspective, it may look like an animated movie with known production hell that was tossed at September to just collect some cash and lessen the losses.<br/><br/>But, Hotel Transylvania actually delivers. Surprisingly, and in many departments. It did not just succeed in pleasing the kids, but it actually entertains the adults with quick zany Tex Avery humor with very minimal downtime. Similar to the original Madagascar flick that remains DreamWorks' most consistently entertaining franchise, this movie rapidly fires jokes high, low, and direct to catch the kids, teenagers, and adults off-guard. They took the classic father/growing daughter concept and gave it a clever monster twist that allows for plenty of creativity.<br/><br/>And if there is a man that can handle potential creativity, it's the incredibly underrated director Genndy Tartakovsky. Tartakovsky was behind such cartoon gems like Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, the original Clone Wars, and of course, Samurai Jack. He knows how to time jokes, how to time emotion, and knows when his product might be overstaying its welcome. This movie clocks in at a mere 91 minutes, so the movie never feels like its dragging. The script went through so many changes, but they hired the right guy to help mold it into a good backdrop to all the visual humor that dominates the source of all the laughter you'll experience.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the overbearing father conflict is supported by an original concept so it never feels like previously charted waters. But let's also hand it to the voice cast for not hamming up the script. Adam Sandler isn't exactly the most prolific actor for doing accents, but with his Sandler touch and knowledge of when to cut back on his material makes for a surprisingly good performance. Partnering up once again is Adam Samberg, and those two work off each other quite well in an Abbot and Costello manner. Rounding out the fun cast is Devid Space, Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Selena Gomez, and the hilarious Luenell in a limited role.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Hotel Transylvania isn't deep and doesn't carry any cinematic weight, but is indeed a very enjoyable film with plenty of surprises, humor, and even a good bit of heart. It's perfect for kids with the fun cast of characters and silly jokes while it's perfect for adults because it is short, clean-cut, and also has some great adult humor to boot. Tartakovsky took a doomed project and injected plenty of life to it with his brand of humor and his ability to pack plenty of rich content into a limited about of time. Don't let the look or reputation of the studio fool you, this movie packs a light delightful punch."
"paul_haakonsen","8","4","8","8 January 2013"," Great animated movie with all the classic movie monsters...
","""Hotel Transylvania"" really surprised me in a good way. I was a little bit concerned about taking all the classic movie monsters and put them together in an animated movie. But this really turned out to be a great experience.<br/><br/>The animation is really great and the characters are so unique and memorable, and they have just the right amount of Tim Burton-touch to them without being too much copies of his usual style of art. There is a lot of great details to the characters and they all really have their own personalities and characteristics. But not only the characters were amazingly detailed, the scenery, settings and surroundings were also nicely fleshed out and brought to life on the screen.<br/><br/>As for the story, well then director Genndy Tartakovsky managed to put a great story together and execute it nicely on the screen. You are instantly sucked in and drawn deep into the storyline and bond with many of the characters.<br/><br/>The story itself is about Count Dracula who is running a hotel in the middle of a dark, scary and haunted forest; a hotel for monsters only. However, a human appears on the threshold of the monster hotel one day. And as if a human visitor wasn't enough for the count to deal with, then his daughter was also coming of age and was showing an alarming interest in the world outside the hotel; the world of the living.<br/><br/>""Hotel Transylvania"" has a pretty impressive list of people on the cast list, and they are doing really good jobs with the voice acting. Personally, I really enjoyed Steve Buscemi (as Wayne), Kevin James (as Frankenstein) and Fran Drescher (as Eunice). But the rest of the cast were also doing great jobs.<br/><br/>""Hotel Transylvania"" is a nice animated movie that is enjoyable for both youngsters and us older people as well. I enjoyed it because it had a funny story, was stuffed with great animation and it had that semi-goth feel to it and dealt with all the movie monsters that I grew up with and loved then and love today as well."

That's that, Mavis is a unlikable character, bold, not feisty but completely disastrous film.<br/><br/>Came out in September 28th, it needs to be thrown away, I can't stand the bad voice acting, uninteresting plot and comedy that doesn't make me laugh at all.<br/><br/>Mark Hotel Transylvania off, and go watch Despicable Me instead, touching, but very funny.<br/><br/>I thought this would be as stupid as Trigun: Badlands Rumble, not similar at all, but Trigun: The Movie wasn't my cup of tea, Hotel Transylvania was really unnecessary to make."
"lagudafuad","4","5","11","12 October 2012"," Yawn!
","I made a lot of attempts to get to see this movie; I was so  disappointed after 30 minutes in.  I like being surprised by the story a movie delivers, so sometimes  instead of reading ahead i just go to the cinema to be surprised. When  I found out what the plot was for this movie I felt like shooting  myself in the foot for not reading ahead.  Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Hotel Transylvania has been in  development since 2006 with Miley Cyrus penned to play the voice of  Mavis (Dracula's daughter), but she later dropped the role and Selena  Gomez was given the role instead.  The movie's idea was to paint a scenario typical to that of  Pixar/Disney's Monsters Inc, where the monsters were afraid of the  humans, although in this twist the humans seems to love the Monsters.  Every movie runs on a typical fuel, Monsters Inc's fuel was they need  of screams for their energy, the fuel in this movie is Mavis (Selena  Gomez) desire to go to the outside world. This kind of driving force  for a movie is too flat based on the fact that the outside world is  just outside your door.  The voice casting/acting in this movie is not half as bad as the plot.  Adam Sandler voiced Dracula and did a fine job at it too. The movie's  plot is about Dracula, who lost his wife to an attack by humans.  Due to that, he built a hotel where the world's monsters can take a  rest from human civilization. In his list of invitees we have 1.  Frankenstein and his bride 2. Werewolf, his bride and their liter (and  may I tell you they have so much) 3. Mummy 4. Skeleton and bride 5.  Invisible man 6. And much more.  The movie does try to be funny, with lines like when Dracula told the  Invisible man, ""Hello! Great to see you""  The movie director Genndy Tartakovsky is behind the some notable  Cartoon Network animated television series, including Dexter's  Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Sym-Bionic Titan.  Genndy will also be directing an animated film based on Popeye.  Hotel Transylvania will have been best as a short movie that was like  30 mins long rather than a full length one that has nothing but wasted  scenes luring you to an expected end.  But putting it all together if you haven't heard of this movie then be  happy, you are not missing a thing."

","What is it with most modern animations, when all the cast have to end the film by embarking on an embarrassing song & dance routine? It was entertaining in Shrek, but more than a decade on the sight of various individuals shaking their stuff and caterwauling into a microphone to 'popular hits' has worn thinner than Kate Moss. Stop it. Now.<br/><br/>Aside from that misstep, this is a fun frolic in a world full of the most harmless monsters you're ever likely to encounter. Sure, they're ugly and have weird habits, but they wouldn't hurt a fly (In fact some of them ARE giant flies) and all they want to do is live their lives in peace. They stay away from humans, who they believe are nasty, vicious uncivilised creatures who'll kill you as soon as look at you (Not entirely inaccurate down my neck of the woods).<br/><br/>An unrecognisable Adam Sandler plays Dracula, whose cute teenage (118 years old) daughter falls in love with a mortal... much to his disapproval. Much of the rest of the film is about him trying to keep the lovebirds apart, and the usual assortment of gross-out gags and freaky goings-on. Of course, he has a change of heart near the end, and all the stuff about feeling a ZING when you meet the one you want to spend eternity with is just cloying nonsense ( Especially when the girl's objet d'affection is a witless red-haired surfer dude)<br/><br/>But there's more than enough fun here for both kids and adults to make it worthwhile, as the writer makes the most out of an inventive premise with more jests about The Invisible Man, Frankenstein, The Mummy etc than you ever though possible. Trust me, this is quite a feat. 6/10"
"TxMike","Null","2","3","2 May 2013"," Very interesting and funny movie, once you get past the first half-hour.
","I know there are many anti-fans of Adam Sandler, but you got to give him credit, he is amazing as a voice actor in animated movies. Here he is Count Dracula, yes the real one. And as he explains over his long lifetime never has said ""blah, blah, blah"" at the end of his phrases.<br/><br/>Dracula and all the other monsters feel threatened by humans who always want to hunt them down and kill them. So many years ago he found a very secluded place in Transylvania and built the large, castle-like Hotel Transylvania, almost impossible to find, as a refuge for his family and all the monsters who want to visit there.<br/><br/>Selena Gomez voices Dracula's daughter, Mavis, who is having her ""big"" birthday, she is turning 118. Her mother had long been departed but had left a gift for Mavis, to be opened on her 118th birthday, it was a reflection on finding your true love.<br/><br/>Dad didn't want his headstrong daughter to actually visit a real human city, as she desired, so he built a fake city not far from the Hotel. She visited it, was disappointed, and returned home. But Dracula's inept monsters playing humans set the fake city on fire, this attracted the American hiker, Andy Samberg voicing Jonathan. Dracula is mortified, much like the Monsters in ""Monsters Inc."" reacted when the little girl found her way back to their habitat.<br/><br/>Anyway perhaps predictably Mavis and Jonathon fall for each other, Dracula wants to keep them apart, and the funniest part of the whole movie, near the end, is when Jonathon is on a jet liner, and Dracula has changed into a bat, and is hanging onto the jet liner window trying to communicate with Jonathon, while starting to smoke from the burning sun. You know, Vampires cannot be in the sun.<br/><br/>Anyway, the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie, used to establish the basis for the story, was somewhat tedious. But the last hour or so is totally entertaining."

","As mentioned, the characters for Hotel Transilvania look (and sound) a lot like the characters of Despicable Me. Unfortunately it is not as great as that movie. The plot takes a long time to take off, and there is not much going on between the characters. It does have all the right ingredients for a fantastic movie (funny characters, nice animation etc.), but somehow it does not quite seem to work. It seems to me that Quasimodo was introduced to spice things up, but he literally falls out of the sky. Nevertheless, it is fun to watch and very enjoyable. Just don't expect any real surprises story-wise. You know how this is going to end when you are 15 minutes into the movie. I think with a little more effort they could have done so much more with this film..."
"italian_guy1","5","2","3","6 April 2013"," role choice, not sure
","the movie was pretty good, but i will say it right off Adam Sandler sucked as Dracula, it was not the right roll, the personality and voice of the Dracula was not believable at all. he would have made a great addition but not the lead. his voice is to common in relation to his other roles. its a kids movie but its still also very cheesy was OK to watch but as a adult with a child it would be been nice to have some more underline jokes. how quickly Mavis fell for Jonathan was a little silly it went from 0-9 in one scene. kinda enjoyed the side story's more then the main one. the animation was really well done a lot of depth and render in the images."
"caspervanheck","5","2","3","20 January 2013"," Sandler-heavy, otherwise fine
","First off, there are quite a few very good things in this movie. The wolf-man having too many kids is awesome, Callaway (Cee Lo) somehow fits perfectly as a mummy, just like Gomez in her role of the teen vampire girl. Other details, like Quasimodo as a chef, and his pet rat, are very well-worked out. Some scenes, like the rooftop sunrise scene and Dracula chasing the plane, work out perfectly. Character interaction is mostly fine, just as some of the gags and references (like Fran as Frankensteins wife). The story is highly predictable, and while the final feel-good scene is ridiculous, it is quite enjoyable overall.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie would get a 7.5 or maybe even an 8 from me, were it not for one small detail; Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>The guy is hilarious, but only under a very specific set of circumstances. Pull him out of his natural habitat, and he's annoying, full of stupid jokes, and way to prominent to let other actors shine. A large number of gags seem directly out of his play-book, and that's not a good thing: it contributes to the idea that he was initially cast for a smaller role, demanded a bigger one, started making changes no-one wanted, and eventually messed up the whole movie in an attempt of self- gratification and ego-massaging.<br/><br/>So, fun movie, too bad about Sandler."

","Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) is the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, a five-star resort where the world's monsters can be safe from human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters like Frankenstein's Monster (Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Bigfoot, The Blob, and other monsters to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez). However, Mavis prefers to explore the outside world with her father's permission, but the village he directs her to is actually an elaborate deception to convince her of the threat of humans enough to coax her back.<br/><br/>However, this charade inadvertently attracts the attention of an ordinary young traveler named Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg) who was exploring the surrounding forest and he follows the staff to the hotel. Once Jonathon enters the hotel, Dracula frantically attempts to hide him from the patrons such as disguising him as a Flesh Golem named Johhny-stein with the later hasty cover story of being a relative of one of Frank's body parts. Eventually, Jonathan is discovered by Mavis and company, forcing Dracula to claim he is going to arrange Mavis' birthday party with a young perspective. In doing so, Jonathan manages to liven up the staid activities at the hotel, charming everyone, especially Mavis. Eventually, even Dracula begins to like the human, taking him into his confidence about his family's traumatic past after the vampire notices the young man knows something about them in a respectful manner.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) realizes Jonathan is human and captures him to cook him, forcing Dracula to directly intervene by magically paralyzing the chef. Eventually, the birthday party happens and it is a raucous success until Dracula overreacts to Mavis and Jonathan's innocent kiss. Things get worse when Chef Quasimodo interrupts the party and reveals Jonathan's true nature. Even as the client√®le are revolted, Dracula, in his ranting, lets it slip that he tricked Mavis at the fake village and Mavis is outraged at being so manipulated by her own father. For his part, Jonathan feels obliged to reject Mavis for her father's sake and leaves the hotel. Afterward, Dracula realizes that in his efforts to protect Mavis, he has broken her heart and now she tearfully wants to stay at the hotel forever.<br/><br/>Wishing to undo his mistake, Dracula persuades his friends to help him find Jonathan and even risks his destruction by venturing out in the daylight to do so. Learning that Jonathan is about to board a flight out of Transylvania Airport shortly, they race on and enter a town en route. At that town, Dracula and company are stunned to see the humans celebrating a monster holiday with many humans costumed as the monsters in tribute. To clear a path, Frankenstein tries to scare them, but finds the humans are cheerfully welcoming them instead and even provide a shaded route through the town for Dracula to proceed at maximum speed.<br/><br/>However, Dracula finds that he is too late with Jonathan's plane taking off. With no alternative, Dracula desperately flies after it in broad daylight without knowing he is being burned. With maximum effort, Dracula manages to reach the plane and resorts to mind-controlling one of the pilots to tell Jonathan that he wants him to return to be with his daughter and manipulates the plane back to the airport.<br/><br/>Later, Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis and gives his blessing to their relationship and the hotel has another party to celebrate his daughter's liberating coming of age before setting off on their travels. This movie was just decent nothing to write home about i do not however like the reviews this movie is getting the ending song was just awkward the techno style they were going with for it just didn't sound right it toke the film a while to really start the twilight bashing part was very much needed! the backstory of monsters seeing humans as the villains was actually really creative there are a few bathroom jokes that you can get past but there's not that much adult jokes all in all the movie was decent it had fun characters,great visuals,brilliant voice actors but it felt to much like a Saturday morning cartoon with its soundtrack and score and visuals but i guess thats what director Genndy Tartovosky is used to having created Dexter's Laboratory and such overall it wasn't what i was expecting but it was a OK movie"

","This film has an interesting twist on the usual monster genre, as it features all the classic movie monsters but colliding with the modern day. The characters were all very imaginative and cute. I like all the references and jokes throughout the film. However, it is somewhat predictable as Mavis is the typical teenage girl character longing for ""a whole new world"" but stuck under an overprotective father, along the lines of earlier animated films like The Little Mermaid (1989) or Aladdin (1992). The other character Johnny was sometimes endearing and sometimes annoying and forced - his character was quite inconsistent.

","The Hotel Transylvania movies are some of the most fun cartoony animated movies. The animation is very reminicent of cartoon shows like Tom & Jerry, or Looney Tunes. Characters are animated in exaggerated ways and makes the movies really entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>I love most Pixar movies, but they never really deal with cartoony action. This movie does it really well and has a pretty weird sense of humor. This sense of humor makes it extremely watchable by adults. It has a few of the ""jokes kids won't get because they're not old enough"", but it doesn't rely on them. It just has really a creative sense of humor that is clever.<br/><br/>Sandler is surprisingly amazing in this as I forget it's him doing Dracula. His usual movie pack also does well and really shows you they do have comedy talent when not stuck in Sandler's awful live action movies.<br/><br/>What really makes this work besides the sense of humor is the story. It has heart and really keeps you invested in the movie. The characters are really well done and the family aspect of Drac and Mavis gives this movie so much depth.<br/><br/>I'm glad there is a creative team making animated movies like this. It's not the same level as Pixar, but it's really funny and creative in it's own way. It's miles above any of the Despicable Me movies and non-Dragon/Panda Dreamworks movies. It's sad that the series plot wise has kind of gone downhill, but it's sense of humor has still stuck strong and make each movie worth a watch just for that and the cartoony animation."

Before the first human shows up we already know the script.<br/><br/>There were a number of fun things about the monsters that kids would enjoy but adults will find tiresome.

At one point the Invisible Man is playing charades, which he admits, ""I'm not very good at.""<br/><br/>At one point Dracula asks if humans would accept them (the monsters) if they ""came out.""

","I'm sure plenty of children and families adore ""Hotel Transylvania,"" but not every animated kiddie movie is without intelligence, so I'm not going to cut it any slack. Another animated monster kids movie, Pixar's ""Monster's, Inc."" (2001), for instance, is kind of clever in its use of doors to multiple universes. And, although not animated, ""The Monster Squad"" (1987) manages to pay homage to classic monster movies and remain charming despite some childish humor. ""Hotel Transylvania"" features many of the same monsters as that film and more, including Dracula and his daughter, Frankenstein and his bride, werewolves, mummies, an invisible man, a gillman and Quasimodo, but they've basically nothing to do with their sources in novels or prior movies. They're more akin to the monster cereals, such as Count Chocula and Frenken Berry--mere caricatures, overly sweet and not very good for you.<br/><br/>In ""Hotel Transylvania,"" Dracula has clipped the wings, so to speak, of his bat daughter, but he must learn to allow her to fly the coop. He also runs a hotel for monsters. The Dracula of ""Nocturna"" (1979) did the same thing, the film also had plenty of music like this one (except it was disco), and Dracula's daughter fell in love with a human. The similarities stop there, though, since ""Nocturna"" also had gratuitous nudity and an old Dracula complaining about how his reproductive organs don't work as well anymore (although, here, the Invisible Man defends the size of his in one pool-side gag). ""Hotel Transylvania,"" on the other hand, has Count-less butt jokes, including a fart that's let on fire. I'm not sure which is worse, but I know fire is bad.<br/><br/>There's a joke at the expense of the ""Twilight"" series, where Dracula sardonically remarks, ""This is how we're represented."" Right back at you, Count Chocula; ""Hotel Transylvania"" isn't fang-tastic, either. Nor had I ever heard Dracula say ""blah blah blah,"" and I've seen well over 50 Dracula movies since reading Bram Stoker's novel. Perhaps, the worst caricature of all, though, is Quasimodo as the hotel chef. Why is he a chef? Because he's French, I guess. That's racist. Anyways, the movie wraps up like a bad rom-com but replaces the father for the girl or boy chasing down the other for a grand romantic gesture. It's kind of like ""The Wedding Singer"" (1998) and with the same actor.<br/><br/>Another quibble I have with this movie is that when they list off Dracula's vulnerabilities--sunlight, garlic, stakes to the heart--they don't mention crosses. I get that they threw out all of the sex and violence from Dracula--even though that was most of Stoker's book--it's a kid's movie, after all. But the religion? I think that was a shrewd commercial move to avoid offending any audience, except for maybe cranky old Dracula buffs like me. But, they've made millions of dollars off this franchise and, as of this writing, about to release the third movie installment, so they know what they're doing. I don't have to like it, though.<br/><br/>(Mirror Note: No mirror shots in this Dracula movie, either.)"

The humour does not really improve as the movie progresses either (fingers stuck up noses), but the main characters become well developed and likable, especially the backpacker - an avid horror fan who enjoys interacting with the monsters with a natural curiosity, sticking his hands into skeletons and so forth. Some of the backdrop gags work well too (the backpacker beaten up by an invisible knight) and there is a great sequence towards the end where the monsters come across a town in which they are celebrated as horror legends rather than feared. The film does, however, also become more sentimental as it progresses, especially as Dracula's daughter predictability falls in love, but the overall product is more enjoyable than one might expect from the barrage of toilet humour and groan-inducing wordplay puns early on."
"redanhemma","5","1","1","12 October 2017"," Decent film, but not hugely impressive
","I had heard a lot about this one being good, so I decided to watch it but was rather underwhelmed. Most of all what kind of bothered me was the constant happy-cheery-jokey kind of stuff going on. I get that the target audience is young children, but I don't think that necessarily means you need to make everything so silly and cheesy. I've seen a lot of really great children's movies that were more serious (though still age-appropriate of course) and only had the occasional funny bit. Especially considering the monster theme, I did not expect this level of silly and cheesy.<br/><br/>And while on the topic of the monster theme, that's another thing that kind of bugged me. Maybe I'm just stuck up, I don't know, but it bothers me when creators take too much of a creative liberty with established classical characters or beings/creatures, or in some cases they just got things wrong (like the oh so typical case of calling the monster Frankenstein when that's in fact the name of the man who made him, that's a massive pet peeve of mine, and just generally making his character entirely wrong). I suppose I just prefer more old- fashioned monsters. And... Why is Quasimodo not human, and more importantly, why is he some sort of crazy fiery chef??? Speaking of which, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is a pretty good example of how a movie for children can still be pretty dark and serious without CONSTANT comic relief.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is not awful or anything, not at all, but much too goofy, over-the-top, predictable to a ridiculous extent, and not very ""authentic"" with its monsters. I'd say it has too much of a modern tone as well, if that makes any sense. This could have been so much better if the creators had the courage to be more unique."
"japamo","10","1","1","14 June 2014"," The ""Groovie Ghoulies"" On Speed ‚Äì You Don't Just Watch ""Hotel Transylvania"", You Ride It!
","In case you weren't a Saturday-morning cartoon show freak during the '70s, the ""Groovie Ghoulies"" was a Hal Sutherland/Filmation animated production featuring nice, family friendly versions of Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, and the Wolfman (Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie respectively) plus a few other legendary monsters. The cartoons spotlighted their wacky, episodic adventures in a castle called Horrible Hall and also in the ""real"" world ‚Äì or at least the world of Archie, Veronica, Betty, Reggie, and Jughead. They also did ""Laugh-In"" jokes and skits.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania"" (hereafter ""H-Trans"") borrows a fair amount of that 60ish, freestyle ""Groovie Ghoulies"" vibe (plus the vibes of movies like ""The Croods"", ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", and even the Harry Potter series, and of course TV series like ""The Addams Family"" and ""The Munsters""). But that's good, because ""H-Trans"" uses its borrowings skillfully to spin out a wildly enjoyable, supersonic story about an extended nuclear monster family.<br/><br/>The main theme revolves around widower Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler ) frantic efforts to safeguard his only child, surprisingly fetching and independent-willed vampire daughter named Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the ignorant terrors of the human world. Having reached the age of monster maturity (118, or 18 in human years), Mavis is eager to explore the mysterious world beyond the creepy, eerie walls of Dracula's castle. However, Dracula goes to extravagant lengths, even fabricating a Balkan village populated by the undead pretending to be hostile humans, to keep Mavis safe at home. Beyond that, Dracula has renovated his castle to be a hotel/retreat/refuge for all sorts of kooky, ""domesticated"" monsters, from good-natured husband Frank (Kevin James) and his nagging wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), to harried wolfman Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and his pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their unruly canine brood, to the narcissistic, bespectacled Invisible Man (David Spade), to obese but hip and swaggering mummy Murray (CeeLo Green), plus practically every other monster in creation.<br/><br/>To keep the meddling humans out, Dracula has converted the hotel/castle into a seemingly impenetrable, booby-trapped fortress. Nevertheless, a back-packing surfer dude type named Jonathan (Andy Samburg) stumbles into the castle and is somewhat terrified by but far more curious about the place and its odd denizens. Aghast, Dracula tries EVERYTHING he can to either hide the human Jonathan from his suspicious guests, especially Mavis, or to disguise him as Frank's ""right-hand"" cousin ""Johnnystein"", who is also a ""party planner"". Of course, this fails and Jonathan and Mavis meet and find a ""zing"" of love and affection exists between them, so much so that in a calm, sweet break from the action, they climb to the hotel roof and Jonathan shows Mavis her first sunrise from beneath the shade of a chimney, since of course vampires and sunlight are not friends.<br/><br/>Eventually even the obstinate Count and his guests realize that Jonathan is a pretty decent, trustworthy fellow, especially for a human, and knows how to liven up a bunch of cool, party-hearty but somewhat out-of-touch, antiquated monsters. Dracula even confesses to Jonathan in an emotional sequence how a bunch of torch-and-pitchfork villagers killed his wife and embittered him against humanity. Jonathan and Mavis get closer and even kiss (which bugs Dracula so much his face turns red and his fangs grow, which always cracked me up) and may even start on a path of wedded independence.<br/><br/>But chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz), instead of his expected gentle personality, reveals a nasty but funny desire to serve Jonathan for dinner. Naturally, this drives Jonathan away from the castle. Formerly biased and cautious Dracula (and company) must now brave the outside human world AND daylight to intercept Jonathan's airplane flight from Transylvania and convince him to return. Can he do it, and reunite him with Mavis? As I said, ""H-Trans"" is a supersonic, roller-coaster delight of a ""monster"" movie that will almost give you a whiplash. Despite the pace, however, the movie is a clever, respectful homage AND parody of famous monsters (even the ""Twilight"" vampires) which also obtains its laughs from common domestic themes such as parent-child interactions, the search for autonomy and freedom, the need to let someone you love go and find his/her destiny, and the unexpected power of forgiveness. ""H-Trans"" also displays its humor through sharp dialogue and one-liners, slapstick pratfalls, and juvenile humor. In other words, just about anyone, from ADD patients to reasonably sophisticated cinema lovers, can find something to like about ""H-Trans"".<br/><br/>These characters, monster and human, lead interesting lives, and deserve a sequel!"

","After the death of his wife, Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) creates a lavish hotel to protect his daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez) and other monsters from the pitchfork wielding humans and their hatred. Fast forward a century to Mavis's 118th birthday, a human by the name of Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg) stumbles upon the hotel. All hell breaks loose in Dracula's head as he tries to protect his hotel's image while being a protective control freak of a father.<br/><br/>With a bucket full of monsters, the writers (Todd Durham, Dan Hageman & Kevin Hageman) could have gone horribly wrong or created a string of brilliance. Instead they wrapped the story around Dracula and his daughter while throwing in a string of clich√© plots and a bit of a love story. The rest of the cast takes a backseat only stepping into the limelight for short funny moments that only peaks in the climax. Also, the whole monster-scared-of-humans concept was reminiscent of Monsters Inc. sans the cute factor.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderfully detailed and well put together for each character. The film lacks sweeping jaw dropping scenic material since most of the film plays out inside the castle; Sony Pictures has clearly taken a huge stride in the right direction with their animation. The action was fast paced and entertaining while emotions never got overwhelming to spoil the fun. Screenplay by Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel didn't exceed expectations but was amusing enough to keep us in our seats. The kids in the theatre, on the other hand, were having a laughter riot. The background score was unremarkable while the songs were well placed apart from the one at the end, which was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler as the voice for Dracula without his usual over the top antics was just right. Selena Gomez as *seen it before* Mavis didn't stand out while Andy Samberg as goofy Jonathan lacked variety but stilled managed to be funny. Kevin James as Frankenstein didn't have much to do and felt wasted. Steve Buscemi as stressed werewolf Wayne was brilliant as you've come to expect from him. David Spade as Invisible Man Griffin, Ceelo Green as mummy Murray, Jon Lovitz as Quasimodo, Luenell as Shrunken Heads and Fran Drescher as Eunice had their moments but they were few, and far between. A lot of talent there but not really utilised properly.<br/><br/>With a house full of monsters, the potential to create magic was there. Unfortunately the director Genndy Tartakovsky decided to play it safe with a humdrum story that we've already seen before (Brave comes to mind). Irrespective of all that, this film targets kids and they were clearly enjoying it. With a long weekend ahead, Hotel Transylvania is the perfect film to satisfy the appetite of the little ones. Meanwhile for the adults, it's a so-so affair that leaves you with a smile but fails to mesmerize you."

","Hotel Transylvania (2012)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Nice animated film about Dracula growing protective of his new daughter so he creates Hotel Transylvania in hopes that she will always stay there and never enter the ""real world"" with humans. This location would also be the perfect getaway for other monsters but on her 118th birthday, the daughter decides she wants to experience a new type of life and she gets her chance when a teenage boy sneaks into the hotel. It seems like most people went into this movie not expecting much but it really turned out to be pretty good and especially if you're a fan of monster movies. I think kids are really going to enjoy everything going on but there's also a lot of stuff for adults including some terrific winks to previous monster movies like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN. What I liked most about this film were all the monsters because there's so much imagination going on inside the hotel. I thought the big guys like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the mummy and the various werewolves were all very fun but even the smaller characters were a blast. Just check out the brain that gets stepped on by the teenager. Another plus is that the vocal work is extremely good with Adam Sandler leading the way as Dracula but we also get nice work from Fran Drescher, Kevin James, Selena Gomex, Andy Samberg, Steve Buscemi and David Spade. The animation is top-notch throughout as the entire look of the sets are very good. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA has a few flaws along the way but for the most part it's entertaining and well worth watching."

","I don't know if Sandler helped sink this by mere association or what. The humor is broad. The message against prejudice is as heavyhanded as in Brave, but simply blurted out to us. The computer animation is typical, nothing to see‚Äîboth horror-themed stop motion films of this year trump it with ease. The horror sketchbook feel is much better captured in Frankenweenie, by a filmmaker who actually loves the stuff. ParaNorman has the fancy characters and dazzle for the kids, but offers us a richer, more visual experience on the same subject.<br/><br/>By contrast to those other films that show creators immersed in at least some aspect of their work, this gives the feel of a mass-marketed product‚Äînever more obvious than in the songs performed, ranging from punk rock to club music. <br/><br/>The logic here is something for everyone."

The storyline is not focus, sometimes really annoying and the plot is flat from start through the end. They tried to make people laugh with it's joke which is not funny at all. Also Jonathan's character is too annoying, they should put him in right role. Overall, 'Hotel Transylvania' is mostly just a joke.

Dracular had a pretty daughter who fell in love with the human Frankenstein. Favourite part: My favourite part was when Dracular saved the person because when the chief feared the person and that is how Dracular saved the person.

"aliceboy","6","3","6","8 March 2013"," A waste of a dynamic, gorgeous animated film
","When I first heard about this project, I was excited. How could I not be? I've been a monster fan since I was able to be a fan of things, and have enjoyed Genndy Tartakovsky since my very first exposure to his vivid, highly-stylised work. Then came the bad news: the voice cast. Upon seeing that not only Adam Sandler, but also David Spade, Kevin James, Fran Drescher and Selena Gomez were attached, my heart sank. What was this? The worst, most pandering cast they could find? So, I decided I could skip this one, Tartakovsky or not. The film showed at our local theatre, and I let the wife and daughter go with friends and without me. They came back pretty pleased, but not excited enough to make me feel like I'd missed anything. So, I waited for it to come out on home video. Having finally gotten to see it, all my expectations have been confirmed: the film was fantastic to look at, with animation more full of animated life (as opposed to 'real' life, a la most computer-animated films) than I've seen in...maybe ever; the voice cast was awful. It's an entertaining premise (though one I feel has been visited before), and one that has the potential to gather together great monsters in a human-free environment to unwind and show us their 'true' personalities. That much was realised, but only as far as the voice talent could take it. Sandler's Dracula was lackluster and as empty as his performances tend to be. Most of the rest of the cast could have been anyone, really. Even their heaviest hitter talent-wise, Steve Buscemi, was so underplayed as to be non-existent. And Samberg's character, the sole human in the story? Oof. Could they have made him sympathetic to anyone but the most obnoxious late-teen douchebags? And I'm not even going to touch the non-Mothersbaugh soundtrack. Though, to paraphrase the young son of an eminent animation man: movies always end with dancing anymore. Okay, I know that cranky geeks in their 40s are not the target audience for this movie. But maybe it should have been. Clearly, they weren't going to get the Twilight crowd, and the movie was a little too light-hearted for the Twilight-lash-back crowd. Outside of that, who was going to see this movie and actually care what was on the screen in front of them? Monster fans and animation freaks! While neither of those are likely to be completely let down by Hotel Transylvania, I doubt this is one of which any audience is going to need repeat viewings. Except, perhaps, with the sound off."

"jpajs14","6","3","6","7 December 2012"," Please give this review a read (I give this movie a 6.75 / 10 rating)
","Hotel Transylvania is a good, entertaining movie for kids and adults alike. The storyline is simple, yet touching: Count Dracula creates a hotel, which is to be a safe haven for the monsters from the human world. Dracula's main goal is to keep his daughter, Mavis, safe from the outside world. However, a human makes his way into the hotel, falls in love with Drac's daughter, and thus spirals out of control from there with chaos and turmoil through-out the movie as the Count tries to keep the human away. The plot is executed very well, touching the hearts of viewers with the relationship between the Count and his daughter. The many powers and speedy movement of the Count is very entertaining to watch, his character is portrayed very well and seems to be one of the most loved characters of the movie. This movie contains a little bit of everything from cute romance, to clever jokes, to out-of-control monster chaos. In the beginning, that's what the movie seems to focus on the most is the chaos. Monsters running around, limbs falling off (zombies), other monsters getting squished by a blob monster, and so on. I think it's merely a showcase for all the monsters featured in the movie as well as entertainment for the younger audience. Even though most of the chaotic, slap-stick comedy throughout the movie is typical, it still appeals to the younger kids. As for the clever jokes and one-liners, I wish there were more of those. There were a couple of small spoofs and references in the movie that had me laughing, although I won't say what for spoiler reasons. The humor is widely ranged in this movie; with a lot of the jokes being repetitive, I think it weighs down the movie a little bit. It still contains plenty of charm that is unique, but it's just not that memorable. The kind of music that is used towards the end of the movie is annoying because it is basically techno/pop music you hear on the mainstream radio stations, and although the younger kids might enjoy it because that is what they are growing up listening to; I think they should have used music that is more classic and appealing to general audiences. In summary, we have a decent animated movie here, but it contains many elements that we have seen more than once before in past, similar movies."

","Hotel Transylvania comes across in the trailer as a monster good time where Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's birthday while he works overtime to keep his daughter from falling for a human, who haphazardly stumbles upon the hotel. The story was interesting in how humans were viewed from the point of view of the monsters, as not just the enemy but as fearsome. I couldn't really figure out why Johnny (Andy Samberg) would be out hiking alone in Transylvania, I couldn't figure out why Mavis (Selena Gomez) wouldn't just bat out and see Haweewee or the world for that matter, and I couldn't figure out why Drac's bat was only slightly sun sensitive. There was some fun to be had watching this film and it was clear how when anyone ages, their idea of fun is totally different from that of young hundred and eighteen year olds. I did notice from the laughter in the theater that children don't really get it with some of the humor it just has to be physical, and I know that the children didn't understand the underlying story of an overprotective father. But, with the very spirited young wolves, the green smoke joke and all the colorful creatures, this was a good film for tweens. There was an interesting moment when Johnny was asked if he believed that humans, all humans were ready to accept monsters, but the reality is even with films like Twilight romanticizing a relationship with a vampire, it doesn't change the fact that if a being came out of the coffin who lives off of human blood, survival instincts on both sides would kick in and someone would have to go! I was fond of Ceelo's mummy and found Steve Buscemi's wolf to be as believable as any father with a massive brood, exhausted! Fran Drescher's Eunice was so Real Housewives of New Jersey and Luenell's Shrunken Head cracked me up. I have to agree with Johnny that Dracula's accent and behavior was over the top. It was kind of creepy when he would fang out, yet this was a charming little story that was entertaining and fun even if Mavis did borrow from Puss in Boots when she wanted her way. It will garner an audience that will appreciate it for what it is, an hour and a half of movie viewing escapism. I give it an amber light."

","With its plot lifted shamelessly from ""Finding Nemo"" and its overly familiar standard Halloween-mask characters, the basics of ""Hotel Transylvania"" pose no threat to the younger set and no challenge for anyone older. Dialog and plot development match the toothless motif with a big, friendly daddy Dracula defends his monsters-only hotel a la John Cleese in the old British ""Fawlty Towers"" television show (or ""programme"") and tries to keep his daughter from coming of age. The main plot follows precisely the sequence you expect from this premise with the characters growing and coming to terms right on cue. The big name voice actors (Sandler, Samberg, Gomez, etc.) appropriately phone it in given a lack of interesting dialog or witty one-liners. The animation style brings us a lot of warm colors but no technical virtuosity. In short, a non-offensive essential neutral time killer for the five to ten year old set."

","Rating-6/10<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is an animated movie that has laughs, a nice style and some good people involved in the voice cast. Now the film is only OK and really isn't good or more nevertheless it is fun and should entertain the majority who view it. There are many good jokes and although a lot are physical jokes, it plays well and some really can get you going with stomach hurting laughter.<br/><br/>I felt it was written well and is the basis of the funny business in all fairness, and although not being the tightest of scripts, still the jokes come across thick and fast. As I said before the film has a lot of laughs but the writing does lack depth and although will please in my opinion, it won't be a totally memorable experience, especially for parents maybe watching with kids.<br/><br/>Another thing that maybe the script does or that the director does it give the film very little heart, maybe even none at all. It isn't sweet and even at times it can try,but it still falls flat on it's face. The problem they have in that area does hinder it quite a bit and also a massive reason this won't be remembered as much as other animated films, and although still OK on my account, no more than that.<br/><br/>The voice cast as I mentioned are good and Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez and others are well cast with humour flowing through there voice pretty well. I have to say after a little while you do start to forget who the cast actually are with people such as Sandler becoming a forgetful after thought which helps in the humour as you actually laugh at him. I also liked the voice of Steve Buscemi who voices Wayne the werewolf and he is very funny and the basis of many funny moments.<br/><br/>The animated style is nice, it isn't quite what I would call the top notch kind of animation but it is still really quite nice. I found the movement is well done and although the movie is very very fast and characters kind of hit the wall, literally, it still looks very nice. I also really loved the sets involved and yet again they look very nicely done, I think with the addition of director Genndy Tartakovsky who himself is also an animator, you get a good team to sort out the way it looks.<br/><br/>I think with this movie anyone can watch it, not only the kids but also the adults and even though I have seen some people say this strictly for kids, I don't believe they are right and it fine enough for anyone. Don't expect it to be unfunny seriously, I went in thinking maybe this will be very poor but in truth as I have said it is OK, so lets move on to my conclusion. <br/><br/>So overall the length of the movie is good at a steady time of 91 minutes, it fits in everything it needs too and doesn't over do it either. I think also overall, as I have mentioned a million times already, it is funny, and funny enough to be OK and well worth a watch from anyone who really wants to see a good animation with a nice style and quite a few good laughs too."

","Though it lacks its subtle (and sometimes subversive) sophistication, 'Hotel Transylvania' is definitely in the spirit of the old Rankin/Bass classic 'Mad Monster Party?'. The Adam Sandler players are all here, and they all appear to be having a good time, which seems to be the movie's sole purpose (as it refreshingly lacks the heavy handed messages so often employed in these kinds of films). It's not really all that funny, but it is high energy fun that never slows down, and a perfect Halloween movie for kids and pre-teens that adults can enjoy (or at least tolerate), too. If you're looking for good clean fun, you can do worse than to check into 'Hotel Transylvania'."
"Ccriggsby","7","2","4","4 September 2013"," An enjoyable movie
","When it comes to animated movies, Sony is normally pretty good. Hotel Transylvania is no exception. However, there are a couple of things I didn't like. Three things actually. First, is the Dracula character. I love Adam Sandler, but when it comes to the character, I can not picture Dracula. I only picture Adam Sandler in the studio trying to act like Dracula. The second thing is that for the first third of the film it seemed a little slow, then the rest of the movie seemed like a blur. Too many things happening to fast. There wasn't enough dialog or actions happening for the characters to change their minds or progress. The third thing is the (SPOILERS) song at the end. Other then that, I really enjoyed the movie. The story is entertaining, the animation is top notch for Sony. Watch it with your kids."
"pjveerman","7","2","4","19 February 2013"," Worth spending the night in
","Every once in a while i'm in the mood for some animated fun. You don't have to expect a lot from most animation movies but a lot of 'em are solid fun. So is Hotel Transylvania. Kids like monsters. Especially overactive ones. That's exactly what this movie is. An overactive stay in a hotel for monsters. No humans allowed! The story is simple and predictable. Also the all-star cast isn't necessary. Mostly because the strength isn't the voice acting. It's the animations, the fun and kinda dumb characters and the tempo which makes the movie fun to watch. You won't get bored nor surprised by this movie. But whether you're 51 or 8, you'll definitely have a good laugh."
"hr-boege-546-170392","7","2","4","8 February 2013"," mostly a child movie
","what can i say about this movie? first of all its made by Sony, not one of the major animation studio, which is interesting. as you could expect from a minor studio, the animations aren't that great compared with other animated movies. but it isn't the animation that makes the movie great, its the story. and the story actually gave me a hard time, to make my opinion about it. there is some humor in it that target both children and adults as well, and also stuff that both can relate to. the whole idea is also great, but did they pull it of in a good way? i would say no. there are simply too many clich√©s and overused plot points. its a typical ""teenage daughter/protecting father"" and ""hidding some thats not supposed to be there"" story. they also use one of my most beloved (ironic meant) clich√©s, the ""guy screws up everybody hates him and mourn"" clich√©. its old and just makes movies look stupid. there is also kind of a running joke about a little old furry thing eating stuff. i really don't get why they included that, it makes no sense. so too conclude i will say that its mostly a movie for children. it appeals to them in a good way, and I'm sure that they will love it. for adults, as mentioned before there is also some stuff, but don't enough to appeal to an adult audience. the adult jokes makes it watchable for parents. so 7/10, because it works as a kids movie, but don't add something new."

"filipemanuelneto","8","0","0","24 June 2020"," A good film that consolidated Sony's place as a great animation studio, but that still has problems to solve.
","This film is one of the best that Sony Pictures Animation has made, finally putting it at the level of Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks. These four giants of animated films have been fighting for a long time. Sony has so far been the most discreet and least successful competitor, however, with this film and the ensuing franchise, the studio has finally managed to show its worth.<br/><br/>The script is simple: after losing his wife in a confrontation with violent humans, the secular Count Dracula hides, with his daughter Mavis, in an isolated castle, protected from the humans eyes. To make it profitable, it turns it into a large hotel specially designed to welcome other monsters and creatures that want distance from people. But, as the centuries go by, Mavis has grown up and wants to finally see the world beyond the immense dark forest that surrounds the castle. And that is what Dracula is most afraid of, as he regards human beings as highly dangerous.<br/><br/>The film was perfectly capable of humanizing and giving a funny touch to the monsters that we get used to seeing in horror films. Dracula, the Mummy, the Werewolf, Quasimodo, the Invisible Man, Frankenstein's monster, Bigfoot... they're all here, and all of them much more human and lovable than they could be in another kind of film. The plot rests on the father-daughter relationship, on the way a father tries to protect his daughter until eventually she feels suffocated and revolts against it. The most comical scenes are reserved for the Count, especially when he plays with Jonathan, the human teenager who, against all odds, finds the castle and decides to explore it. The dialogues are excellent and the humour is everywhere.<br/><br/>The direction is ensured by Genndy Tartakovsky, who previously collaborated with Cartoon Network Chanel, where he was responsible for some of their most iconic animated shows. It is, therefore, an interesting bet that worked very well. The voice actors cast is large and very good, with the veteran Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez at the head. Everyone did their job very well and fit the characters perfectly. I found Sandler's effort to make his voice more Romanian especially interesting, although it might not be necessary.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is based on computer animation and CGI, whose quality seemed somewhat irregular but generally good. Unlike the films from other studios, music and songs are far from being the strong point here... in fact, it was one of the weakest bets in this film, with forgettable songs that seem to be there only because they have to be there, without being able to add quality and joy to the film. The ending, where music plays a predominant role, ends up a little blurred because of that."

"dilipbts","7","0","0","29 April 2020"," Hotel Transylvania
","Hotel Transylvania has a simple concept: classic campy monsters staying in a hotel where humans are not allowed because they think we're evil. It doesn't sound too fresh but it looks fun. Behind this concept is a father-daughter-relationship that seems to follow the footsteps of other great recent animated films. The result is, it's not getting there yet but it's still as delightful as it's suppose to be. It's one of those films that it's so crazy, you'll instantly like it. Most of the gags are clever and ridiculous. Overall, it's an endless fun entertainment.<br/><br/>Though, the film sometimes feels like a mediocre animated kids film. Generic family film elements are there but they are used in a different way. There is often slapstick and toilet humor but the gags are best when it's outrageously absurd. Every set pieces are swift, quirky, and exciting. The voices of the characters sound silly at glance but the actors made them pretty likable.<br/><br/>When the craziness slows down, there's a sweet bit of Dracula's relationship between Mavis and Jonathan, and some brooding. The drama is a little effective. It's not as strong as most recent animated films. It's more focused at being fun and hilarious. It's great when it stays to the roots of a cartoon like showing peculiar looking characters acting like lunatics. The best laughs are when the monsters are expressing their misanthropy in a ludicrously paranoid way, and when they're just making fun of each other. Mainstream pop culture song numbers kind of tone things down, but the song number at the end didn't affect the breathtaking and emotional climax.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is good enough for the whole family even though it's raucous. Fans of the animation genre would enjoy this a lot more. Since it's directed by a cartoon expert, it contains a lot of absurd and exciting scenes that is similar to his shows. Although, some might expect something more since many animated films these days are deeper and powerful, leaving the old habits behind. Hotel Transylvania still has the heart but it's just not as compelling as the others. If you're in for the joys then this will give you a good time. My rating may be too high, but this my thing. I always enjoy this kind of animation."

"snowfre","5","0","0","15 April 2020"," Perhaps entertaining for the younger demographics, but more of a yawn-starter for the rest
","Okey, so Count Dracula has a 5-star hotel that ghosts, ghouls, and monsters pilgrim to, to get some much needed recovery and to not risk meeting any humans at all. The plot itself isn't really unique. We've seen it, ghost hotels, vampire comedies, and the forbidden love element between Dracula's daughter Mavis (Gomez) and Johnny (Samberg) doesn't give ""Hotel Transylvania"" any sort of overarching feel of freshness. The jokes are honestly old and weary, and Adam Sandler starring as the vampire patriarch shows little to no interest in any form of originality in his portrayal of the count. Apart from Frankenstein loosing limbs and other supernatural humor skits that's been around since the inception of Halloween themes comedies, the film should at least have some positive credits for its kid friendly appeal. As obvious from my rating, ""Hotel Transylvania"" isn't the worst film I've ever seen, with the exception of Sandler's farce-like, over the top version of Drac, the eminent voice cast does a good job, from Sandberg and Selena Gomez to Buscemi and James, given the uninteresting story they've been given to work with. In terms of visuals, a thumbs up for the backgrounds and settings that is nicely animated; the characters on the other hand, are as basic as CGI-characters can get. I really believe that ""Hotel Transylvania"" will be a favorite among the children, for the older audience accompanying them, it won't be a memorable experience."

","Drakula, the owner of a hotel only for monsters, organizes his daughter's Mavis, 118 birthday. But Mavis wants to get out and see the world. So Drakula creates a fake village scene to scare Mavis off when she visits it. So Mavis is now afraid of humans and she won't leave the hotel, where she is protected from them. However, a human, Jonathan, finds his way into the hotel and ruins Drakula's peace. And worse, he zings with Mavis. Hotel Transylvania has a nice story, which doesn't escape the clise of the animated love- happy ending movies. However it is entertaining and funny at some points with nice graphics and clever lines. Plus the soundtrack helps the movie very much. So 5 out of 10 because it could have been better."

","Vampires, zombies and werewolves may be thought of as scary and horrible things. But if you asked Count Dracula he'd tell you that those poor monsters are nothing but peace-loving unfortunates who've been unfairly labeled. He'd readily explain that they're victims of a whole lot of bad press and paranoia. If anything, they're much more afraid of humans than humans are of them.<br/><br/>After all, you won't find monsters storming around in the open, armed with pitchforks and torches, on the hunt for humans.<br/><br/>Anyway, Count's story starts about 115 years ago, right after his wife's untimely demise at the hands of a screaming, angry mob. (See. He knows what he's talking about.) Besides being overcome with grief, Dracula realized he was left with sole parenting responsibilities for his beloved daughter Mavis. Call him overprotective, but stealing her away to be raised in a hidden sanctuary seemed the only safe thing to do.<br/><br/>It was just about then, though, that an idea hit him: Why not turn his reclusive castle into a hotel? He knew plenty of other ghastliest and ghouls who would relish a place to vacation, safely hidden away from hateful humans. He could create a swanky little place with all the latest amenities, like a crock-filled moat, a posh cobweb motif, king-sized beds of nails, the whole shebang. It was a brilliant idea.<br/><br/>Of course, little vampires don't wear their training fangs forever. And though their hotel hideout is cool, by her 118th birthday, well, Mavis is getting a little antsy. She's a grown woman now, ready to spread her wings ¬Ö literally. And Daddy Dracula isn't sure how to keep her from it. The world is such a dangerous place. Is there a way to convince her to stay away from those horrible humans for at least a few more years? A hundred or so ought to do it.<br/><br/>But right in the middle of Count Dracula's daughter-saving schemes, the worst thing he could imagine happens: A lost human backpacker stumbles into the hotel lobby. What a disaster! If the other monsters find out, it could lead to a creature calamity! A Frankenstein freak-out! A bogeyman ballyhoo! --topspot-official.blogspot.com--"
"KineticSeoul","7","2","5","24 December 2012"," Creative scenarios and backgrou is what drives this flick
","This is a fun animated comedy that the whole family can enjoy on Halloween. Yeah it lacks substance when it comes to the plot. But the creative animation sequences when it comes to the different monsters and certain scenarios sort of make up for it. The message of this movie at the end also has been done a bunch of times but it's alright. I was starting to have no good expectations for Adam Sandler movies but this one is good. And it would be cool if his movies start to improve, instead of dumb toilet humors that aren't clever or all that funny. It worked in a couple of his other movies but it's starting to deteriorate. Anyways Adam Sandler nailed it as the voice of a grumpy and yet likable vampire Dracula unlike Barnabas Collins(Johnny Depp). And the romance elements isn't developed enough including the relationships but certain scenes and wacky scenarios makes this movie watchable. The story is basically about Dracula who is owner of a hotel where all monsters gather to enjoy there time away from humans who they think of as a huge threat. And on this occasion to also celebrate his daughters 118th birthday, a daughter Dracula swore to protect from humans. And he throws these lame parties but the daughter wants to go out and see the world outside of the hotel. And when a human teen stumbles upon the hotel things go in a different direction from the generic monsters daily routine in the hotel. Although it lacks depth it's a fun animated movie that the whole family can enjoy on Halloween.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

","I got all the way to the end of this before I realized what was missing - crucifixes. This traditional way of repelling a vampire (here the most famous one - Dracula) is omitted, presumably because a healthy number of the production staff are of Jewish ancestry and/or faith.<br/><br/>I just have a problem with someone trying to re-write fictional characters now grown to legends, just because some details don't mix with their personal beliefs. <br/><br/>I accept fantasy stories within whatever context they present themselves. So when ""Hotel Transylvania"" delves deep enough into Dracula lore to present him sporting fangs, sleeping in a coffin, and wanted by angry torch-carrying villagers sporting wooden stakes and mallets - but omits crucifixes... the whole thing left me feeling a bit cross."

I also appreciate the fact that the characters designs were a bit more stylish and original than in most of the computer- animated films from the recent years, having that special touch that all the works of Genndy Tartakovsky have, at least in what concerns to the visual aspect.<br/><br/>The result, without being a masterpiece, is more than watchable, and appropriate for the whole family.<br/><br/>Even when I'm not exactly Adam Sandler's biggest fan, I have to admit that he did a good job in this movie (A huge improvement over his previous performance in the atrocious animated film ""Eight Crazy Nights"")"

She laughed a handful of times and, as far as I know, she stayed awake. Frankly, it did nothing for me.<br/><br/>It was rather frenetic at the beginning - too much so for my liking. It struck me as being sort of Monsters, Inc. after drinking one too many Red Bulls. The story (of Dracula as an overprotective father wanting to protect his daughter from the outside world) was paper thin. The reversal of roles was a bit cute. In this, the monsters are hidden away from the real world because they're afraid of humans. It was pretty obvious where this was going to go, so there was little to really hold my interest.<br/><br/>Altogether, I found this disappointing.

","""The film brings back all of our favourite scary figures and try's to get as much humour out of them even though at times I felt myself being bored."" <br/><br/>I've alway wondered what it would be like to bring all of those classic monster figures altogether in one film and with this attempt I feel maybe they should stay in their own single films. Dracula (Adam Sandler) at the start has set up this hotel to keep all monsters safe away from all humans who the monsters fear. Then while preparing Mavis (Selena Gomez) his daughter's 118th party the first human Jonathan (Andy Samberg) finds his way to this closed off hotel and Dracula does not want anyone to know so his makes Jonathan out to be one of the fellow monsters.<br/><br/>The film does change when Jonathan comes on as we see a relationship between Mavis and Jonathan start to blossom but also one with Dracula and Jonathan as he try's to get him to leave even after every other monster has fallen for him. The film does use some very fun animation tricks mostly present in the character design which is very good and it shows the looks of the actual actors very well.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler has one bad movie after another lately and this is just another one of those, he try's to do his best Dracula impression but some times I felt myself having to turn away because I could not stand to look at the screen to see what was going on. Andy Samberg does his second film with Sandler this year (""That's My Boy"" was the other film they did together). Samberg plays the same character all the time and once again he is boring unlike other actor he's just being a human with not much funny moments. When the film started and we are introduced to Mavis it took me a while to notice it was Selena Gomez and I think that she was fine but her character was just about freedom and even when the film starts to go for the more touching moments between her and her father they felt unearned and I did not like them. All the other characters are not important and are just there to try be funny. Other actors doing voice overs include Steve Buscemi, Cee Lo Green, Kevin James (Once again working with Sandler) and many more.<br/><br/>This film had to much story to pack into the time it had which amounts up to about 90 minutes. The love story that happens in the film was uninteresting to me. Sandler once again has another film that has made me hate him even more then I once did.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: D (MVP: Adam Sandler)"

","This film opens in 1895 as Dracula is planning to open a luxury hotel where monsters can stay free from the fear that human mobs will burn then, stake them or otherwise harm them... it also means his baby daughter, Mavis, will never have to see a dreaded human. The action then moves forward to the present day and Dracula is about to throw a hundred and eighteenth birthday party for Mavis. She is keen to see more of the world but Dracula has plans to make her change her mind. Then things go wrong... just as the guests arrive a human turns up. He is Jonathan Loughran, a twenty one year old backpacker. Dracula quickly disguises him as a monster so other guests won't think the hotel is unsafe... that is the least of his worries though; Mavis likes him!<br/><br/>There were elements of this film I really liked; the central characters; particularly Dracula, Mavis and Johnathan are a lot of fun. Similarly I liked the child-friendly portrayal of classic horror characters; Dracula, Frankenstein (actually the monster not the scientist), the Mummy and the Werewolf... along with their families. There were plenty of laughs to be had; even if some were a little crude for my tastes. The animation was very impressive even when watched on a small television although it is clear that many shots were designed to make use of 3D in the cinema version. The character designs are good and the voice cast do a fine job bringing them to life.

","Hotel Transylvania, if anything, is a surprisingly fun family film that works on many different levels. Sure, it's not the greatest thing to ever come out of monster cinema, but if you're a monster fan yourself and if you have kids, it's one heck of a fun ride.<br/><br/>What's the story? When monsters want to get away from it all, they go to Count Dracula's Hotel Transylvania, a lavish resort where they can be themselves without humans around to bother them. On one special weekend, Dracula invites creatures like the Invisible Man, the Mummy and others to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter, Mavis. However, an unforeseen complication unfolds when an ordinary human unwittingly crashes the party and falls in love with Mavis.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about Adam Sandler's performance as Dracula. I think he does a great job at the character, and if you hate Adam Sandler's work, don't worry! Dracula doesn't even SOUND like Sandler in this film! He also suits the Dracula character very well with a more comedic-style vampire voice going with the more cartoonish personality of the character. Sure, it's not Nosferatu or Interview with the Vampire level-good style of Dracula, but at the same time, I don't really think that's the intention. Selena Gomez does okay as Mavis, but I feel like the performance could be a bit better. The animation, while zany and out of control, still looks nice, especially with the effects, the backgrounds, and the designs of the monsters. Maybe the character animation isn't the best, but at least it does fit the cartoonish nature of the film. The story seems like a combination of Tangled and Monsters, Inc., but at least the concept of Dracula running a hotel for monsters does sound quite interesting to say the least. Maybe it would've worked better if it was an animated series (even if the Hotel Transylvania show sucks), but I'm fine with what it has to offer.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Hotel Transylvania is hilarious, cute, energetic, and a lot of fun. It has nice animation, good performances, and an interesting concept, even if the quality of the writing is very poor. Ignore the bad stuff and feel good about the good stuff. If you're a Dracula fan- scratch that, if you're a monster fan- you're gonna LOVE Hotel Transylvania. It's an enjoyable film I think the whole family should watch."

","This movie is really great, I saw the movie a few times and I enjoyed it every time. Most of the animations that take about an hour and a half are as if there's one thing in them, but the Transylvania Hotel is all about it. It's also one of the funniest animations I've seen throughout my life. The Wayne character repeatedly laughed me during the animation, and whenever I entered the scene, I smiled without doing anything, because I knew that it was now a funny thing to make me laugh, Frankenstein's character was extraordinary. It's time I did not have time to smile because I was chuckling, especially in the sequence that they were looking for Johnny, and suddenly he saw a man who was playing with a ghastly Dracula dress. Frankenstein said that I would laugh if I remembered. . Murray also had a lot of funny things. Dracula and Jonathan were the best of all, and if they were not, this animation would not be the one of the funniest animations I've ever seen. It was really great, since Johnny explained to Dracula how he found the hotel. I laughed two, singing together in the final sequence as far as they were, and not enough to say about these two and their work. The movie is full of cool and funny characters who do not have everything. Now, if we distance ourselves from comedy, I want to talk about the romantic aspect of animation, which is very appealing. I really feel like I can love to touch this animation and understand it. It's Mavis and Jonathan's love that involved me with this animation. This love takes place during the animation between these two forms, and we are very good with romantic scenes and dialogues, for example when Jonathan and Mavis were on the roof of the hotel, and then Mavis first saw the dawn or, for example, the type of the letter Mavis's behavior and behavior is with Johnny in a very romantic party, and it transmits a sense of love to the viewer in such a way that if an acting could play it, he would have had an Oscar. And, of course, Johnny's and Mavis's romance before their second kiss made me feel sad. In the scenes of love, there is also a drama aspect, but there were scenes that were not romantic, but the drama was, for example, Dracula's words to Johnny on the plane, in particular the scene of Dracula's conversation with Mavis in the backbone, which was a bit sad, and The most sad thing about them was that Mavis said: ""My dad no longer have a dream. Is it terribly terrible to say such a horrible 18-year-old girl? Someone tells his father that I have no idea. Mavis has been hit hard by his father and depressed. Dracula, who sees the gift of his wife, realizes that he has gone all the way wrong, forgetting the most important thing in life, that is, love, who now finds nothing worse than not seeing his daughter upset by looking for Johnny, and that Finds. Truly this romantic story can not be found in any other animation. The latest animated music, which was read by animation characters, was very cool, and it was one of the songs that everybody ever liked to motivate it in their minds. In a nutshell, I saw a striking animation that I would like to follow in order to be able to meet the characters of the movie; seeing this animation was a memorable experience for me, and I'd love to see them again."

","Yeah-Yeah-Yeah - I know that this is, in fact, ""just-a-kiddies-movie"" - But - All the same - Hotel Transylvania's story, literally, managed to single-handedly destroy every horrific myth about every frickin' monster that you've ever heard about in no time flat.<br/><br/>And, then - To top that off - This movie had the absolute gall to reduce all of these monsters to the level of being nothing but cute, cuddly, sweet, little teddy bears, one and all.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","1","2","20 March 2018"," Classic characters lovingly re-imagined with rubbery animation.
","The standard themes of familial acceptance, 'leaving the nest' and putting the needs of others above those of your own are told surprisingly well through suitably rubbery animation, ostensibly ham-fisted voice-work and lovably re-crafted classic characters. 'Hotel Transylvania (2012)' is generally generic but consistently pretty fun, and at times actually funny, to the point where I don't mind the fact I've essentially seen it all before. It's clearly Adam Sandler's best work for quite a bit. 6/10"
"cherold","6","1","2","1 December 2017"," Mildly amusing
","There are a few very funny moments in Hotel Transylvania, which takes place at a monster-only hotel invaded by a human doofus and deals with an over-protective Dracula and his adventurous daughter, but there is a lot of dead time in between.<br/><br/>Overall it feels comfortable and familiar; if you can't predict every turn in the story way before it happens then you just haven't seen very many movies. There is an adequate story, solid animation, and good voice acting, which is enough for something generally watchable.<br/><br/>The laughs pick up a bit in the movie's second half, so if you're mildly enjoying yourself, go ahead and watch it all. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
"ericstevenson","8","1","2","28 October 2016"," Best Adam Sandler movie!
","I'm skeptical to like anything by Adam Sandler, but my hope went up when I found that none other than Genndy Tartakovsky was directing this film. He was a big part of my childhood with cartoons like ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""Samurai Jack"". Now, I know it's hard to make the transition to CGI, but he made it just fine. It's a pity that this movie didn't do too well with critics, although it still got a much higher score than most of Adam Sandler's movies. Tartakovsky is what makes this movie. What stands out as the best parts are probably how beautifully animated this film is. The colors are gorgeous and there's so much movement.<br/><br/>I keep hearing there's lots of hidden things in this, but I didn't see most of them. I'm normally not a fan of celebrity voices, but it was done well here, especially considering the sheer number of bad movies of any kind these actors have been in. While I praise the film for being wacky, I really did get the emotional bits in it. There's lots of great jokes of course. I admit that some parts of it aren't that good. It's weird how they are so easily accepted into the human world. It's kind of a dues ex machina. I saw the second movie first and I think this one is better, but they're both enjoyable. ***"

","Hotel Transilvanien is a good Animationmovie for young and old. The Storyline is a nice but already known story. The Monsters are Simple but very good.<br/><br/>The Sync in German and Englisch is very good (Great Voices). Adman Sandler interpret Dracula like a Genius, gloomy and funny he did a good job. With Selena Gomez Mavis became a perfect fitting voice, it's seems the role is written for her. <br/><br/>In my opinion the Animatiion and Story details are more than great, the Character (the other Monsters) are very Funny and have their one Special Toch. <br/><br/>Fazit: it's a Film you can Watch and you don't waste your Time ;-)"

Can't wait to see ht whew Grown ups 2 also. Johnny Stien is a great character and paired up with Mavis it makes it light hearted and fun for pre-teens and the adults will get a kick out of the rhetoric between Dracula and Frank n. Stien,lol.

"MLDinTN","7","1","2","30 June 2013"," the story has been done before, but I really liked the animation
","The best thing this movie has going for it is the animation. I thought it was really good, not as good as Pixir, but good. The story is a little dated, protective dad wants to keep daughter away from the world and from meeting a guy. Most of the time a princess is involved, but this movie using vampires. Yes, more vampires. So Dracula wants to keep his daughter Mavis from leaving his castle and meeting humans. In order to do this, he builds and fake town and using zombies to act as humans to scare her back. Also, he is throwing a birthday party for her and all his monster friends are at the castle. Then an uninvited guest shows up, Jonathan, a human. So Drac has to do all these funny things to keep the other monsters from noticing that Jonathan is human. All the while, Mavis is enjoying Jonathan's company and hearing about his travels. So of course, eventually the gig is up, but all the monsters come together to do what is right.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:I liked the animation and the film had its funny parts. I thought it was entertaining and I bet 10 year olds would really love it. Worth a viewing."
"shery_hatedevil_7","8","1","2","16 February 2013"," Loved The movie!
","I loved this movie so much that for the first time in my life i am writing a review for a movie. For all the time i watched this movie it was totally worth it for reasons discussed above. First, I really liked it when the movie made me realize that parents matter a lot and they love you very much and try to do whats best for you. Second thing i saw this movie with my small sister and she loved it very much. Third thing the characters of this movie are really dynamic and inspiring they made me laugh most of the time, i really can't forget moments of this movie. This is because I really haven't seen a good movie in almost 2 months as really crappy movies are being made these days but they shouldn't be discussed here. I'd recommend you to watch this movie with subtitles and you will have a lot of fun trust me!"
"schipperm","10","1","3","7 January 2016"," Perfection!!! 118/10
","I love Hotel Transylvania, It is a must see, instant classic. I did not see it in theaters, mainly because I could not drive at that time, and I wish every day that I could see it in theaters, but I didn't see it until September, 2015. After that I immediately went out and bought it and I have seen it 20+ times. The story pulls you right in to their world from beginning to end. The voice actors were the perfect choices for the characters, and the character development is the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I was stunned by the animation and the enthralling story. The movie starts out with Dracula raising his daughter Mavis by himself for about three years, until Hotel Transylvania is built. At which point we are informed that something tragic had happened to Dracula's wife Martha. This is all done to show the strong bond between Mavis and Drac. But, when it fast forwards to present day, they make it seem as if the story is going to be another one of those; She was Daddy's girl when she was younger, but now she a teen and knows everything, kind of movies.<br/><br/>Then they flip it on you, and make it the exact opposite. Mavis is still very much a Daddy's girl and trusts him with her life. Though I could tell what the story was basically about from the commercials, it was never boring. It was exciting, heart warming, funny, and clever all the way through. This movie was pure genius, and I hope that the future sequels will be just as good. I'd say better, but this movie is pretty tough to beat.<br/><br/>This is by far my favorite animated movie if not my favorite movie. The film gets better as it goes along, I hope you see the movie, and enjoy it as much as I do. The emotion in this movie is stronger than any movie I've seen, and personally I don't think the film will ever be topped."

"jboothmillard","3","1","3","4 October 2015"," Hotel Transylvania
","I saw clips for this computer animated film during the time of its release on television, I guessed it would be popular with kids, and adults who enjoy seeing famous horror characters brought together, I decided to give it a try, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of Dexter's Laboratory). Basically following the death of his wife Martha (Jackie Sandler, Adam's wife), at the hands of a mob of humans, Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) designs and builds a massive five-star hotel in Transylvania, to serve as a getaway for all the world's monsters, and a place to raise his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez). The hotel which is completely human-free and safe for monsters welcomes regular guests, such as Frankenstein's monster - Frank (Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne Werewolf (Steve Buscemi) and his wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their massive immediate family, Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade)and Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green). It is Mavis's 118th birthday, Dracula says she can leave the castle to explore the human world, but he has manipulated her to enter a specially built village to make her fear the real human world, Dracula has become too overprotective of his daughter. Things are about to change when a human, teenager Jonathan (Andy Samberg), is unintentionally lured into the hotel, Dracula frantically disguises him, introducing him as ""Johnnystein"", a distant cousin of Frank's right arm, to the other curious monsters. Dracula tries many different ways to get Johnny out of the hotel, but the teenager is not fearful of the monster world he has entered, he is in fact excited to explore it, the other monsters are delighted by his presence and up for lots of fun, especially as they plan for Mavis's birthday celebration, Dracula cannot help but like him as well. Mavis herself finds herself slowly falling for the young fake monster, Jonathan tells her fascinating stories about the real human world, she realises that her father being so overprotective tricked her, and the monsters do discover Jonathan's true human identity. In the end however, after some dastardly behaviour from hotel chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz), everything all works out, Jonathan and Mavis are reunited and share a kiss, and Dracula realises his girl is grown up and can make her own decisions, and everyone celebrates at the party. Also starring Brian George as Suit of Armor and Luenell Luenell as Shrunken Heads. Sandler doing the stereotypical Bela Lugosi impression is okay, Gomez is fine being feisty, Sandberg is likable as the young cool kid fitting into the crowd, and the supporting cast members get their moments too. The animation is terrific as the most famous movie monsters are brought together for a load of fun, the only problem is that the story of an overprotective father and a young person livening the place up has been done time after time, there are too many predictable, and to be honest, unfunny moments, but the young audience won't complain, it's just an uninspired and completely average animated comedy. Adequate!"
"richkaminski","3","1","3","1 October 2015"," The advertisements were the best part of the movie
","I had high expectations for this film but was sadly disappointed. The opportunities for great lines were there but were squandered. It seems that most flicks like this have to have some point to them or a moral or a lesson to learn when no lesson or moral was even necessary. All they had to do was to come up with something funny and run with it but they failed at that.<br/><br/>All the best parts of the movie were in the commercial for the movie which left the audience with nothing but popcorn if we happened to buy it. Big disappointment. Since the cast were all cartoon characters you can not blame it on the acting. That means all that's left to blame is in the writing."
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","3","8 August 2013"," It's good but nothing too memorable
","Dracula (Adam Sandler) opens a hotel for only monsters serving as an oasis away from the humans. His daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) has grown up in the hotel for 118 years not knowing any humans other than the unreal scary stories told by her father. She is still itching to go out and explore the human world. One day, human backpacker Jonathan (Andy Samberg) stumbles onto the hotel throwing Dracula's world upside down.<br/><br/>It's good to see people other than Pixar doing good animation. This one has a good story to serve as a solid base. The monsters have real humanity. The ending is somewhat undramatic. The singalong number at the end flattens any climax it had. It's unlikely they created any breakthrought characters that could lead to a sequel but it's still a good movie."
"MartinHafer","8","1","3","2 June 2013"," This one took me by surprise...and in a very good way.
","These days, CGI films have become very, very common--so common that they seem to zip in and out of theaters with little notice. There are, of course, some exceptions (such as the Pixar films), but when ""Hotel Transylvania"" came to theaters, it came and went without a huge amount of notice. Now that I finally saw it, I really wish the film had received much more attention, as it's far superior to most CGI family films.<br/><br/>This film is a funny look at monsters from their point of view. To them, the humans are the enemy and see them as blood-thirsty beasts. The monsters are afraid of them and are actually amazingly gentle and likable. The main character, Dracula (Adam Sandler) is a very overprotective father and won't let his daughter (Selena Gomez) leave their prison-like castle--afraid that those horrible humans will kill her! However, accidentally, a human shows up when Dracula is throwing a HUGE birthday celebration for his daughter! In order to prevent widespread panic, Drac convinces the young man (Andy Samberg) to dress like a monster and blend in...but the plan works too well, and Drac's daughter falls in love with this horrible human! <br/><br/>""Hotel Transylvania"" is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky--a newcomer to CGI, but a veteran of lots of excellent Cartoon Network shows, such as ""The Powerpuff Girls"" and ""Dexter's Lab"". I think he did an excellent job and think this, along with great writing, made this film fun for all ages--with lots of laughs for adults and kids alike--just like his TV shows. In fact, this is the strength of the film. It had wonderful characters, terrific dialog and a nice sense of humor. The CGI ranges from fantastic (particularly the backgrounds) to average.<br/><br/>So why, if I liked the film so much, did I give the film an 8 and not a higher score? Well, the movie had one area where it was deficient--the songs. Each time a song occurred, it slowed down the film tremendously. On top of that, the ending (which was one HUGE song and dance number) was really weak. It's a shame, but a problem you can easily overlook. Overall, a fine family film that will interest adults just as much as it will appeal to kids--and that is something all too rare."
"jfgibson73","4","1","3","26 May 2013"," Nowhere Near the Level of Pixar
","I saw this movie with a large group of children and adults. The kids loved it, as I think most would. A lot of the adults seemed to enjoy it from the standpoint of harmless entertainment. There were some clever bits, but a lot of heavy-handed schmaltz, too. I personally didn't think it worked for me. When you have choices out there that succeed on the level of a Toy Story 3, why waste time on mediocrity like this? It wasn't the worst concept--of course kids are going to love monsters--but the execution was just enough to get by. Unlike, say, a Pixar movie where they put everything they've got into every last detail, and you can see you're getting something timeless. It'll be fine as something fun to watch once in a while when the kids make me, but not one I'll treasure."
"hendersondamien77","4","1","3","3 April 2013"," AngryFIlmFan Reviews Hotel Transylvania
","So I guess I need to explain something before I start this review. First, I actually plan to skip this movie in general. First, because Sony Pictures Animation is not a studio that makes quality animated films. Second Adalm Sandler's career is dead to me, especially after watching Jack and Jill, and Grown Ups, both being awful comedy films. So when the movie came out, it surprise me that it did get good reviews from IMDb, Jeremyjahns, Spill.com, Chrisstuckmann, and a few others. Then I learned the director was Glenndy Tartakovsky, who made shows such as Dexter's Lab, and Samurai Jack, both among my favorite films in general. So instead coming in with a negative mindset, I actually started to get very hyped for it. I mean people seem to like it, even with mixed reviews from critics. So this sentence, coming from a Glenndy fan, breaks my heart. Hotel Transylvania was a colossal disappointment! When the movie was over, I actually said this, ""Glenndy! What happened?"" The first two acts I joke you not, were Garbage! Why? Well, first off, the story was so generic, and easy to predict, I predicted most of the films story elements, with only my fingers, and I got all of them right! I can't believe that I actually did that with this film, and that was on my first guess. Now other comedies such as Ted, has stories we seen before, such as the Bromance vs Romance plot. But those films at least had overall likable characters. Most of the characthers either served no purpose to the plot, and those who, are even worse. Adalm Sandler's career is still dead to me, as his performance as Dracula is so over the top, and his vampire accent, is either distracting or annoying. Plus, he actually kind of a jerk in the first act, as I said, ""No good father would do that to their daughter!"" He gets a little better in the third act, but little does not mean much in this case. His daughter Marvis is not as bad as Dracula, but she comes off as forgettable, and clich√©d as the movie progress. In fact, as the movie progress, she adds little to the plot, and her romance with Johnny is one I don't care about. Speaking of Johnny, I loathed him. I despise his voice, his personality, his actions, and his characther in gernral. To me, he was the Jar Jar Binks of any film I seen back in 2012. It just a achievement how much I dislike this characther. The side characthers overall are more likable, especially Frankstein, Wayne the Werewolf, Griffen the invisible Man, and Murray the Mommy. Sadly, however, they do little to add to the plot, and are just there to make jokes, even though some are funny. But some do not mean most. Most of the jokes for me were painful, and dumb, and not in the funny way either. The animation shows that Sony Animation Studios need to get some help. First off, the characther animation and design is just way too over the top, it like the Filmmakers, even Glenndy, just wanted to make to make the characthers look and act over the top as much as possible. I find the film has no purpose to be in computer animation, and would look better in Glenndy's 2-D style, which you can see at the end credits. The animation in the end is just too cartoony for me. So form what I said earlier, you may think that I thought Hotel Transylvania was a complete epic fail. Well, no. Like i said most of the side characthers, if pointless are decent and likable. The background animation and special effects look great. The movie has some funny moments. The 3rd act saves the movie from being a total fail. It's got the best jokes, it's a little creative, and has some heart to it. But, the 3rd act ends with a annoying ending song, so that kinda ruined it for me. So, it's time for my final verdict. Had it not been for the 3rd act, I would have given Hotel Transylvania a 2/10. However, the movie's 3rd act, and a couple of other reasons makes the final rating a 4/10. Now other Glenndy fans will rage at me for for my negative review of the film. However, I can see why the sites or the reviewers I mention like the movie more than I did. Humor is subjective, as I know people who did enjoy Jack and Jill. Hotel Transylvania as whole, seems better as a TV series, so story ideas and its premise could more expanded on and be made more enjoyable. As of now though, it's just a meh movie. Glenndy, I love you man, but stick to TV for now. Your movie making skills needs work in my opinion. I see you guys, on the next's review."
"FilmFreak94","7","1","3","26 February 2013"," Fast-Paced, Witty and Just Plain Fun
","Hotel Transylvania is basically a love letter to the classic horror movies and clich√©s that surround them. Dracula is the owner of a huge castle in Transylvania where he invites other monsters to come and spend their time without fear of being judged or hunted by humans. Aptly calling it ""Hotel Transylvania."" The plot kicks off the night before his daughter Maven's 118th birthday. She wants nothing more than to go outside and explore the world but Dracula is reluctant about this because he thinks that humans would kill her without a second thought due to her being a vampire. Things are shaken up though when a human named Johnathan unexpectedly arrives in Hotel Transylvania. Now Dracula has to keep Johnathan's humanity a secret from his fellow monsters and try to stop Maven from developing any feelings for him. <br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is a very fast-paced movie. The humor often flies in your face a mile a minute and each joke will last just long enough for it to resonate in your mind before moving on to the next one. And most of the jokes are actually pretty funny. Granted there's a few obvious puns in there but they're handled pretty well. And the film knows when to slow down in order to let the plot tell itself. Like the scenes with Dracula and Maven. You can tell that Dracula has a deep love for his daughter and only wants to protect her, and that she loves him too but also wants a little independence. Their relationship is actually handled a lot differently than the stereotypical relationship a father and daughter have in animated movies. They hardly ever fight, except for a scene near the middle, and obviously have a mutual respect and love for one another. That was a heartwarming touch that's a real refresher when compared to other animated films like The Little Mermaid.<br/><br/>The animation itself has a nice blend of CGI and Cartoon physics. The characters move very flexibly and often make faces straight out of a Tex Avery cartoon which is a style not often seen in CGI. Each of the characters stand out, there's a Frankenstein (complete with wife), a Wolfman, a Mummy even the Invisible Man shows up. There's also one shot gags and side characters that manage to leave an impression even if they only show up on screen for a few seconds, like a hydra, a fish-man, or even Bigfoot. No character seems to overstay their welcome.<br/><br/>Granted having the movie in such a fast-pace is gonna damage a few things. While the parts that are meant to make you feel for the characters are handled pretty well they often move too fast to really leave that much of an effect on you. Without giving anything away there's a scene in the end which plays with how humans react to actual monsters that felt a little too rushed and too forced. <br/><br/>But overall this film has a lot to keep you invested. Funny jokes, good looking animation and a lot of likable and hilarious characters. The voice acting is pretty good too with an all star cast like Adam Sandler, Andy Sandburg, Selena Gomez and more. I'm glad I saw this movie and it just put me in a good mood by the time the credits rolled. I say give it a chance. Kids are definitely gonna enjoy it's cartoon humor while adults can appreciate the relationship Dracula has with his daughter, friends and even Johnathan. All in all there's something everyone can enjoy in it and that's a real rarity nowadays."
"StevePulaski","8","1","3","3 February 2013"," We need to talk about boundaries...
","An animated film centered around a large group of monsters featuring the voice talents of the Happy Madison gang wasn't a premise that instantly triggered my interest, however, I'm reporting back with a great sense of relieved certainty. Hotel Transylvania is a fun, spontaneously enjoyable effort that is presented with wit and stylistic touches by the highly acclaimed director, Genndy Tartakovsky (whose credentials include the cherished Dexter's Laboratory and Star Wars: Clone Wars), and a storyline that is well-told and, thankfully, refuses to exploit its father-daughter relationship.<br/><br/>This is the second animated film I have seen that was released in the year 2012 and also centers on the complex relationships had by parents and their daughters. The last effort I saw was Pixar's Brave, an unfairly bashed spectacle that beautifully articulated a confident heroine that knew what she wanted to become, refraining from an obligatory subplot about a character lacking in direction, but was met with conflicts from her domineering mother. Hotel Transylvania lacks the moral-heaviness and amplifies the situations and events in a more rambunctious way, yet still not forgetting the elephant in the room. It balances both of these things nicely, and will consistently find ways to delight the little ones and please the older ones.<br/><br/>The plot: We are presented with Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, an enormous castle that has the ability to house hundreds of monsters and keep them safe from the activity of dreaded humans. Dracula is a widow, who is taking precious care of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), who has just turned 118 years old and is young and ready to explore the world. Dracula, as one can expect, is heavy into the suturing aspect of parenting, putting fear and impossibly unrealistic notions of how unsafe and dreadfully scary the human-driven world is, and stages a setup for her to see this when she leaves the castle for the first time.<br/><br/>He believes that after showing her ""the horrors"" of the world, Mavis is at Hotel Transylvania for good. That is until Dracula decides to throw a party, inviting fellow monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), and Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), just when a naive young human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) wanders onto the hotel's territory. Dracula makes every attempt possible to hide Jonathan from the monsters and vice-versa, to show that Hotel Transylvania is the human-free paradise it has been and always will be, but Jonathan soon finds himself romantically involved with Mavis, much to Dracula's dismay.<br/><br/>There are two things that became more apparent to American audiences in 2012 when watching animated films, and those were the revival of nostalgic little things and relationships between parents and their children. Wreck-It Ralph introduced the younger generation to the beautiful machines that were arcades, inventing several new worlds and detailing them all exquisitely, while Hotel Transylvania attempts to further the ""kiddie horror movie"" genre (which has been one of the most consistent genres in animation this year) by introducing them to the classic Universal monsters. It's nothing but apparent that the cast, which is mainly comprised of Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company, has a love and respect for the iconic horror figures that shaped the genre, and in ninety-two minutes they put a clever PG-rated spin that will delight many children and please genre-purists.<br/><br/>Pixar's Brave should be one of the films that serves as a poster-child for parental-child disconnect, where an identity crisis wasn't apparent on the main character and neither was a sense of directionless. The main theme there was compromise between a girl's mother and the girl herself, so that she could pursue the life of freedom she always wanted without contention with her mother. Hotel Transylvania shows a father's protection that goes way past that idea to channel sheltered and anti-social behavior. His daughter just wants to see the world for herself and not be gridlocked to her father's nosy, impulsively petulant nature. What needs to result is something of a compromise, and perhaps parents will see their relationships with their own children in this film and, hopefully, make some fitting adjustments.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is beautifully animated (coming from Sony Pictures Animation, a company that still may have a long way to go before its name hits the majority of households), and occupies a fluency and style that Tartakovsky has made a name for over the years. The only thing I can see being bothersome for audiences, including myself, is the somewhat frantic pacing, which hits near-breakneck speeds in the first forty minutes, but comes to a pleasantly controlled nature for the remaining fifty. There seems to be so much detail, homage, and style in the picture that maintaining a frantic pace throughout the entire course of its runtime would've been lethal to its likability.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, and Cee Lo Green. Directed by: Genndy Tartakovsky."

","'HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Fran Drescher, Molly Shanon, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Chris Parnell and other comedy talents voice this computer-animated kid's monster movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (of 'SAMURAI JACK' and 'DEXTER'S LABORATORY' fame). It was written by Peter Baynham (co-writer of movies like 'BORAT' and 'BRUNO') and Robert Smigel (a long time veteran writer of 'SNL' and 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN') as well as new writers Todd Durham, Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman. The film tells the story of Dracula running a hotel for monsters, to get away from humans, and his daughter, who wants to venture out and see the world. The movie was a huge blockbuster around the world grossing $321 million on a budget of just $85 million. Despite it's immense popularity it only received lukewarm reviews from critics. I thought it was good for a kids movie of it's type but nothing spectacular. I'd put it in the same league as the animated kids monster film 'PARANORMAN'.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler voices Dracula and Selena Gomez voices his daughter Mavis. Dracula is throwing a 118th birthday party for Mavis at his hotel and has invited monsters from all around. Monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James) and Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi) bring their families to vacation there away from the evil humans. Dracula and the rest of the monsters are afraid of humans and do their best to hide from them. So when Mavis tells Dracula she wants to travel out and see the world he freaks out and goes into overprotective father mode. Especially when a 21-year-old human (Andy Samberg) stumbles on to the castle and Mavis shows interest in him.<br/><br/>The movie is really simplistic and uninspired in it's story structure and character development but the animation is cool and the actors are great. I don't usually enjoy kid's cartoon movies like this at all (for the problems I listed about this one) but it is funny at times thanks to the cast. Sandler and his friends do a good job of adding character and a little more flare to an otherwise pretty generic animated movie. Tartakovsky adds some nice visual style to the material as well but you'd think the talented cast could have done a little more with the material.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ"

","So, I don't know what's up with the monster-themed animation movies last year - Frankenweenie, ParaNorman & Brave (slightly monstrous). But, of them all I purely enjoyed HT as it makes you laugh, emote, cry and think!<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, the plot is different and simple, direction is amazing. After all Dexter's Laboratory was epic. Screenplay is great and the animation is just tad excellent! I must appreciate the Sony production for a fantastic outline and for using large amounts of sarcasm. I enjoyed all the satirical takes on various elements. And this movie works as parallel universe - an amazing topic!<br/><br/>It talks about the Father factor and how he strives to protect her; on the other hand the daughter's take on how he behaves and even though it is set in imaginary parallel universe - the values, virtues and principles are similar to the human psychology. Enjoyed it!<br/><br/>I never really got bored while watching this and even though I knew what the Dracula wanted for her daughter, the plot still intrigued me. I wonder why it was not AMPAS nominated. But I will be pleased if it gets the GG.<br/><br/>WATCH OUT FOR: The sarcastic take on Twilight, LMFAO, etc.!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"Anurag-Shetty","8","1","3","8 January 2013"," A very unique animated film about all the famous monsters through history!
","Hotel Transylvania is the story of Dracula(Adam Sandler), who is so overprotective about his daughter, Mavis(Selena Gomez) that he starts the luxury hotel called Hotel Transylvania to protect his daughter from humans. The hotel also works as a luxurious escapade for all famous supernatural creatures like, Frankenstein(Kevin James), The Invisible Man(David Spade) & so on. In comes free spirited human, Jonathan(Andy Samberg) who accidentally barges into the hotel thinking it's just like any other hotel. However, Dracula can't have a human in his hotel, so, he makes Jonathan dress up like the Frankenstein telling all the hotel guests that he is Frankenstein's cousin, Johnny Stein. From here on, hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is one of the funniest movies I've watched in recent times. It's also so unique! How often do you come across a movie which portrays ghosts & monsters as good & humans as bad?! Never! It's been directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of such awesome cartoons as The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory & Samurai Jack. No wonder it's so good! The voice acting is brilliant. Adam Sandler is mind blowing as Dracula. He's done the weird vampire accent & everything! Selena Gomez is great as Drac's daughter, Mavis. However, the standout for me is, Andy Samberg as Jonathan/Johnny Stein. We owe 99% of the funniness in this movie, to him! Kevin James as Frankenstein, David Spade as Griffin- The Invisible Man, & all the other supporting characters are brilliant as well. So, I would like to conclude by saying, Hotel Transylvania is a must watch for anyone looking to have a great time at the movies!"
"sohansurag","8","1","3","14 December 2012"," A Genndy Tartakovsky Original!
","Directed by none other than Genndy Tartakovsky, Hotel Transylvania is one of the best animated movies this year. It basically goes on the lines of Monsters Inc and Paranorman, picturing monsters and ghosts more scared of us, Humans, than vice versa. I am glad I went for this one as I am a true blue Genndy Tartovksy fan. I remember watching countless hours of Samurai Jack & Dexter's Laboratory back in the days. And of course who could forget the Star Wars Clone Wars mini series? Hotel Transylvania stars Adam Sandler as Count Dracula who turns out to be an overprotective father running a Hotel for monsters, completely free of Humans and things go outta control when a human wanders into the castle and falls in love with Dracula's daughter Mavis.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg got a winning duo going on in this after the horrendous 'Thats my Boy'. The memories of that movie still haunts me than the ghosts from this movie. The most fun had in Hotel Transylvania is seeing their characters together in the screen dishing it off, monster magic against human wit. Other monsters as well were voiced splendidly by Kevin James, David Spades and Jon Lovitz. Among them the very Fantastic-Mr-Fox looking-Werewolf 'Wayne' stood out giving some of the best lines voiced wonderfully by Steve Buscemi. And well, lastly, Selena Gomez as Mavis was just meh.<br/><br/>Complemented with some very good music tracks from an assortment of artists the film has a Merry mood throughout. Of course towards the end it gets predictable but still the signature Genndy style was seen all over and being a fan I loved it all. I found the scenes where Drac goes postal kinda weird. I don't know how the kids took it¬Öbut have to admit it was a wee bit disturbing amidst all the jovial stuff that was going on around. So was all the floating Drac thing.<br/><br/>Its a hardcore kids movie but it never says anywhere that an adult cant enjoy the same. I really found my 9 year old self enjoying it way too much. Had I seen it at least 10 years back I would have loved it even more. Though seems a sequel is in the making and I have crossed my fingers for it nonetheless."
"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","3 December 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Hotel Transylvania
","It's without a doubt that the trend of recent animated films have to revolve around the horror genre and/or involving legendary characters reworked to offer a unique selling point. And because the target audience is primarily the kids, the scary bits have all been toned down, becoming comedic event, to tell stories that possess feel good themes around stuff like family, friendship and the likes. So if you've not said hello to ParaNorman, Rise of the Guardians, or Frankenweenie, then why not check in to Hotel Transylvania?<br/><br/>As you would have skimmed the story from the trailer, it involves an over-protective father, the count Dracula himself (voiced by funnyman Adam Sandler), who have for the longest time looked after his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) as a single parent, and convincing the child that the big bad world out there is full of vengeful humans who won't bat an eyelid to get rid of those who are innately different, namely the vampires like themselves. And to fulfill this grand plan, comes his creation of Hotel Transylvania, which doubles up as safe haven for his monsters brethren to check in, and seek vacation and refuge from their human pursuers.<br/><br/>But as Mavis becomes a teenager at 118 years old, one would come to expect the usual rebellious and curious streak in wanting to get out, explore and experience the world for herself. Then comes the surprise visit by a human - Jonathan (Andy Samberg), whose identity gets kept secret by Dracula for fear of losing his client√®le who have turned up in droves to celebrate the birthday of Mavis, and try as he might to get rid of Jonathan, one thing turns into another, with Jonathan more than welcome to stay by the hotel's guests while under disguise, and inevitably falling in love with someone who's very much his age.<br/><br/>Directed by Genndy Tartakovsky with screenplay written by the team of Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel, Hotel Transylvania is chock full of sight gags, and inside jokes that involve the many monsters in its ensemble. There are enough surprises thrown up as the many pop cultural references get weaved into the classical backgrounds of classic monsters such as Franenstein (Kevin James) and his loud wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), the werewolf (Steve Buscemi) and his pack of kids, and he Invisible Man (David Spade), all making leading appearances, with most of the best scenes in the film involving almost everyone on screen at the same time. The romance bit perhaps came on a little too late to breathe some life into the final act, but it's something of a loose end that had to be tied up.<br/><br/>Despite having an ensemble voice cast and a myriad of characters, some that only appear for a few scenes such as the blob, or big foot (used to great comic effect exploiting its size), the best repartee irrevocably belongs to the adversarial Dracula and Jonathan, with one adamant in getting rid of his human gatecrasher, while the other just finds the place radical enough to want to stay a little longer, at the expense of dangerously bringing himself exposed to the truth by some naysayers. Coming a close second are the rip-roaring one liners spouted by the Shrunken Heads, which convey notices outside each hotel room door.<br/><br/>There's hardly a scary moment save for Dracula's first instance of fury which the little ones will get used to, before Hotel Transylvania takes the bull by the horns and tackle issues like for parents to let go and have trust that their children will turn out alright as they venture on their own, and for the kids to realize that their parents have nothing but their best of interests at heart. What surprised me a lot more is its square take on discrimination, and reminder on never jumping to conclusions about others, and being all inclusive and accepting of those who are different. How's that for a monster movie?<br/><br/>The Hollywood animation formula almost always work with comedy and quality animation, and Hotel Transylvania is no different, except that it made a conscientious effort in putting together a coherent story that showed rather than told, and had good heart (Even though it's about monsters!) to teach the little ones a thing or two while having fun with its material. Recommended, and a surprise package indeed!"
"g-bodyl","8","1","4","15 March 2014"," Better Than Expected!
","Hotel Transylvania is actually a decent family film and that is something I never expected to say considering that this is an Adam Sandler film. But yes, it's a decent family film that has colorful animation, a good story to tell and one that will bring out the kids in adults, has some funny moments, has a solid voice cast, and has some good moral themes.<br/><br/>This film is the debut for director Genndy Tartakovksy and not a bad debut at all. This film reunites all our favorite monsters such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy in a kid-friendly way. Dracula has created a hotel for monsters in order to avoid humans. Dracula's daughter is celebrating her 118th birthday and that is when she will meet a human boy for the very first time....<br/><br/>This film boasts a colorful voice cast and they seemed to have a fun time. It's rare for Adam Sandler to foray into animation and children films at the same time, but he actually does a good job here. His usual friends such as Kevin James, David Spade, and Andy Samberg are here as well.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that surprisingly, both adults and children should both like. It's nothing special, but it's not the disaster people were predicting. It's funny despite several lame jokes(looking at you bleh, bleh, bleh.) It aims to be a good family movie and it certainly achieves that goal. I rate this film 8/10."
"fredberglyle","7","1","4","4 February 2014"," Fine One and half hour stay at Hotel Transylvania
","The plot is unique that shows Count Dracula as the hero and humans bad. Reminds me of very few movies like Ferngully and Cannibal Holocaust that too shows humans as villains. Movie brought a good message and quite decent for children to view. Great voice by the characters and fine visuals throughout the movie. The Character designs were so good with good animation that could make children scream 'awwo!' at the monsters. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that, except from being predictable and it must be for children, I enjoyed watching all other aspects of the movie with my 3 year old niece and it did bring out the child within me."
"ng_open_air","7","1","4","16 January 2013"," Children's flick
","This film doesn't bring anything new to the overstuffed animation scene.<br/><br/>The idea itself is somewhat interesting, presenting monsters as good guys and humans as villains (although actually there are no REAL villains here, every character is quite lovable and friendly). Perhaps this idea could have been developed somewhat more seriously, thus making the film emerge from the vast sea of similar flicks, nevertheless it's interesting enough to watch without getting bored.<br/><br/>I would say that for grown-ups, this movie won't be too interesting to anyone, except the die-hard animation fans. To children, however, I believe this would be a very interesting film, especially those that fear of monsters under the bed or in the closet - this one might just put those fears to rest."

It is the old clich√©s that made Dracula and all the monsters who they are and if you don't find the enjoyment in that then it is your loss.<br/><br/>It is also fun to listen to the usual Adam Sandler crowd doing monster voices, especially Sandler himself who does a great job playing Dracula. <br/><br/>There are tons of Christmas cartoons in the world and not enough Halloween cartoons that kids can enjoy as well as adults and I feel this one is perfect for this season.<br/><br/>The animation is also beautiful.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who loves the clich√©s and anyone who can let down their annoying tough ""nothing is original"" front and just enjoys a good laugh!"

"jaxbubba","6","1","4","12 October 2012"," All in all, a nice seasonal film.
","As far as cartoon animation films go, this film actually delivers. An original plot, some memorable characters, and a decent script, which all provided plenty of laughs from the Sony Pictures Animation department. My only issue with this film is that the last third of the film fails miserably, as compared to the first two-thirds of this film. If the anticlimactic ending could have been as fresh and exciting as the beginning of this film, this movie could have been a huge hit, with a plethora of options to continue the storyline.<br/><br/>The plot of the film centers around Dracula (voiced by Adam Sadler). In an attempt to protect his daughter, Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez), from the mean and wicked ""humans"", Dracula has constructed a fortified castle / monster inn. Creatures near and far migrate to this demon dwelling so they can socialize freely amongst their own kind, without the fear of being terrorized and hunted down by the awful and depraved human populace hot on their trail. The purpose of Dracula's Castle / Inn is also to keep Mavis from wondering about in public, thus confining her to live her life within the protective castle walls for eternity. However, once a year, all of Dracula's friends (the Werewolf, Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, the Mummy, etc) come to Dracula's Castle to celebrate Mavis' birthday. But this year, an unexpected guest arrives, Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg), an American teenager backpacking his way across Europe; and for the first time in 118 years, Mavis has something to be excited about.<br/><br/>The thing which makes this film original at first, is the thought that these mean, evil, nasty entities in which awful human books are written about; are in fact afraid of common ordinary person. In fact, humans are the bad guys, with their ""fire"" and ""pitchforks"", and they are the principal villains in the scary bedtime books that ""monsters"" read to their children to scare them into being good. It is this premise, which makes this film works¬Ö for the most part. However, as the film progresses, the writers/director seem to veer off this established principal, and this is where the film seems to suffer.<br/><br/>All in all, a nice seasonal film. I have to admit that I did laugh, and was pleasantly amused at times throughout this film. With a couple of different plot choices at the end of this film, the movie could have been perfect. This film has that ""Monster, Inc"" mentality and feel; however, this film is definitely not in its same class. Still I can and will recommend seeing this film. The casting is by far the best part of this film, in addition to the voices of Sandler, Samberg, and Gomez; also featured are Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, and Cee Lo Green, just to name a few. So if you are looking for a family friendly film for your 8 year olds and up, then this just might be the family-friendly film that you are looking for.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","4","1 October 2012"," A witty and inventive screwball animated adventure.
","It is probably hard to drum up much excitement about an animated comedy with a title like Hotel Transylvania. You might expect a lot of puns and sight gags and jokes that you heard back in daycare. Not so fast. Hotel Transylvania is actually a witty, lively, funny and inventive screwball animated adventure that mashes up all the classic movie monsters and puts them into a movie that is worth your time. It's no masterpiece but unlike the dreary ParaNorman, this one keeps its comic tone and doesn't drown itself in overwrought melodrama.<br/><br/>The story is simple, but not simple-minded. It opens in 1895 as we meet Count Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), a widowed father raising his infant daughter Mavis. We see him teaching her the basics, like how to fly while wearing a safety helmet. Then he teaches her how to transform herself into a bat. At night, he sings to her: ""Hush little vampire/don't say a word/papa's gonna bite the head off a bird."" We also see him reading to her a book of horror stories involving human beings. Those scenes are funny and unendingly cute.<br/><br/>Cut forward to the present day and we find that little Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez) is all grown up and about to celebrate her 118th birthday even though she still looks like a teenager (actually she looks a lot like Winona Ryder). Her dad, meanwhile, has turned his castle into a vacation spot for all the urban legends and classic monsters as a getaway spot from the tyranny of the human world ‚Äì turns out they're more afraid of us then we are of them. Descending on the hotel are The Wolfman (Steve Bushemi), Frankenstein (Kevin James), his bride (Fran Drescher), The Invisible Man (David Spade), The Mummy (Cee Lo Green), and also Bigfoot, The Blob, The Fly and a four-headed hydra. The hotel staff is made up of zombie bellhops, witch chambermaids and Quasimodo himself (Jon Lovitz) who acts as the head chef. The monsters are played for laughs, none is seriously threatening, not even Dracula who claims that he's given up drinking blood for a healthier blood substitute.<br/><br/>The conceit of the story is that Mavis knows nothing about human beings and her dad goes to great lengths to keep it that way (he has a reason that isn't immediately clear). He tries to scare her by dressing up his zombies as human beings with pitchforks so she won't want to leave the castle. That gets the attention of a dimwitted slacker dude named Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg) who is backpacking through the nearby woods and ends up at Dracula's front door. He's a wide-eyed innocent who refuses to leave and Drac goes to great pains to keep him a secret. He knows that a human being in the house could be bad for business, so he dresses the kid up like a monster to keep him hidden in plain sight.<br/><br/>Dressing Jonathan up like Frankenstein hides him from the other monsters, but another problem arises when he and Mavis fall in love. That opens another story arc as dad doesn't want his little girl to find love, especially with a human being.<br/><br/>It is difficult to describe Hotel Transylvania in words without making it sound like a snooze. What is best about this movie are the visual gags, not the story. It comes from the mind of Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of such classic Cartoon Network hits as ""The Powerpuff Girls"", ""Dexter's Laboratory"", ""Samurai Jack"" and the original incarnation of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"". What those great shows - and this movie - have in common is a certain comic inspiration. Tartakovsky has a talent for comic timing. He animates his characters in such a way that they move at a rapid-fire clip that gives the movie a great comic pace akin to the Looney Tunes. There are facial expressions, movements of the hands and of the feet that give the characters more dimension and more comic depth than you might expect.<br/><br/>Now the million dollar question: Will kids like it? The answer: Absolutely. Although this is a movie brimming with monsters and ghouls there's nothing scary here. All of the monsters are cuddly, not scary, the action is fun and nothing they can't handle. There are some serious moment late in the picture that kind of deaden the pace a little bit, but the movie is entertaining and doesn't cop out on the laughs ‚Äì clean laughs. There is no objectionable language or overtly rude humor. The most refreshing thing is that adults won't be bored by it; there are some wonderful cultural references that kid other current vampire movies, especially a comment by Dracula about Twilight, which won't be spoiled here.<br/><br/>*** (of four)"

I expected a mature vampire film but Genndy ruined it, especially its upcoming sequel. Genndy needs to work on Samurai Jack again. I love Genndy but he needs to work on his Samurai Jack movie.

So now he's made this computer-animated one about Dracula and his daughter and his attempts to keep her from encountering some humans since he's very much prejudiced against them which gets a good explanation as the film goes on. I'll stop there and just say how funny and touching the whole thing was which wasn't surprising since not only was Tartakovsky involved but a lot of former ""SNL""ers which not only included co-writer Robert Smigel but also the voices of Adam Sandler, Molly Shannon, Jon Lovitz, Andy Samberg, and Chris Parnell. Oh, and one of my favorite lines concerns how the Dracula character is appalled by how some people think his kind says ""Bla, bla, bla"". How hilarious! Okay, so on that note, I highly recommend Hotel Transylvania."
"RainDogJr","5","1","7","3 October 2012"," Average material; it wastes the cool thing of having tons of classic monsters together
","HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA wasn't as clever (nor as fun) as I imagined. I even went for it during my birthday; since 2009 I've been celebrating my birthday by going to the cinema and this year I had three potential choices: THE WATCH, DREDD 3D and this one. It was a question of time that I ended watching ""Transylvania"" over THE WATCH, which was the one I truly wanted to enjoy. Anyway, I have to mention that one of the trailers I got to watch was the one of the upcoming Disney film WRECK-IT RALPH; it seems that ""Ralph"" will not miss the chance to deliver really clever material out of a mash-up of classic characters (video games characters, like Nintendo's Bowser, in that case). ""Transylvania"", on the contrary, missed its chance with the classic ""Universal Monsters"" (Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man) and some others monsters. <br/><br/>It's clear that the whole horror atmosphere was the reason I wanted to check this one out. Here's a piece of advice for anyone who wants to watch it as well as a horror fan, looking for some nice and fun references or something like that: watch this year's PARANORMAN instead, or something like MONSTER HOUSE (Gil Kenan, 2006), as there's pretty much nothing worthy of admiration here. <br/><br/>Well, there's something nice in the last section of the film and I will explain it to make a point. The core of the storyline is that Dracula (voice of Adam Sandler ‚Äì definitely his best or better said, his only honorable work in the last years) built a place for any monster that wanted some peace; a hotel nowhere nears a human civilization. So we have monsters that basically don't know humans; the nice thing comes when they finally go out and get to see some horror fans (in a way this thing is like that with Johnny Depp, as an 18th-century vampire, waking up in the seventies, from DARK SHADOWS); eventually, there's a terrific joke on the TWILIGHT thing: we have Dracula (or ""Drac"", as he is referred during the whole movie) totally disappointed after getting to see how humans represent the monsters by watching some TWILIGHT!<br/><br/>Good stuff, right? However, the point I want to make is that there's always a problem when a movie that judges how awful the horror genre has been treated lately is itself making, for instance, a Kanye West sort-of rapper out of Dracula. I mean, I get it, I get that right from the first scene of the movie we are going to watch a different version of Dracula, as, after all, this is a kid's flick (in fact, we have Dracula as a single father!). However, the whole thing is sort- of annoying, even if you accept it as something completely unrelated to the classic monsters. <br/><br/>It's one of those, like the last MADAGASCAR, with lots of things going on. There's a lot of noise but nothing that truly gets you or that makes you laugh hard (there are, nevertheless, some funny bits involving the Invisible Man). That's on one hand, and on the other we have a formulaic story about an over-protective father and love. In conclusion, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is average material that totally wastes its main attraction. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 02 October, 2012"

Next to a few DreamWorks films, such as ""Shrek"", ""Kung Fu Panda"" or ""Mega Mind"" or the Illumination hit ""Despicable Me"" it is this movie from Sony that I actually like a lot. Even if it isn't the awesome film I considered it to be when I was only twelve years old, I still think it is worth giving a watch and a welcome alternation from all the masterpieces from the other studios, even from a today's point of view. And since it was the birthday of my younger sisters and they got to decide what to watch, I thought I would join them. As I said before, I like to watch it from time to time, even if it has some undeniable massive flaws I cannot close my eyes to. What I think makes this film so cute is how it introduces children to the classic monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein etc. and gives them the chance to get to know them for the very first time in their life. For avid horror fans it probably is also a nice welcome to see their favourites in a child appropriate way and it might even be some sort of fun to try to spot all the Easter eggs and variety of classic creatures used in this flick. I mean, you even get some middle-aged Gremlins that want to relax at the pool. How cool is that? Even when the premise of ""What if monsters are actually scared by humans?"" was famously illuminated in the Pixar classic ""Monsters Inc."" it is still tolerable in this case, as it adds another facet to it: racism. Yes, indeed, this film deals with the problem of stereotypical thinking and the general danger of racism and teaches the younger ones about it in a child friendly manner. On top of that it depicts the monsters as harmless and gives them human characteristics. The Werewolf is an exhausted family father with God knows how many children, Frankenstein's monster looks like a middleclass man with a middleclass job and the Invisible Man is ... well, he is invisible, but the main focus of course lies on Dracula and the close bond with his teenage daughter Mavis. Who would have guessed that the bloodsucking count is actually a caring and worried father, if not control freak? The animation style and narration are far away from being as deep as the titles from its competitors, but still it conveys an easily understandable message for both kids and parents: sometimes you got to let your kids decide on their own and sometimes it is necessary to rethink about specific things. Like, you probably don't want to be responsible for your child missing their Zing, right? This film could have been immensely better if it wasn't for one thing: Sandler. While I am personally able to laugh about most of his films, each has this typical Sandler thing to it. Any film contains at least on moment of sheer stupidity and this film makes no exception. It has this typical pinch of ""I am trying to be funny"" Sandler-esque nonsense in several scenes that made it extremely cringey and disturbed the experience a lot. Oh, and don't get me started about that dance party at the end of the film. I absolutely hate autotune and the music genre attached to it. It makes me break out in spots in the matter of seconds. Urgh. All in all though, this film is a decent flick I like to rewatch from time to time and even when it is far away from reaching the high quality of the other studios, it works for younger children and that's the audience this film has aimed for. It is cute, has a lot of good ideas and most importantly, doesn't lack any heart. It is nothing an adult would probably consider to be the best, but a fun flick to watch in between with your kids. To be honest, I am going to check out the sequels as well. Let's see if they are at least as enjoyable as this one."

In a film that has a core message that teaches children not to judge others for their actions or for being different. All of the relationships presented in the film are heterosexual relationships. For a movie that was made in 2012 I wish they could have pushed the boundary pertaining to relationships and gender roles within them."

","Hotel Transylvania is quite a standard and average animation film. With a very typical and predictable plot outline which has been done before. Ex: An over protective father is worried about his teenage daughter growing up, she falls for a boy- father doesn't like the boy at first than eventually bonds with him and settles that his daughter is okay being with him. The only difference that separates this typical plot is that they are monsters (Draculas).<br/><br/>The animation is decent, some interesting characters but the comedy isn't anything special. A few laughs (more so chuckles) but nothing that really stood out. Somewhat surprised how this film has spawned two more sequels."
"shimenpf","7","0","1","20 July 2019"," Very fun
","This movie has it all: a very intriguing concept, that is well executed, characters you learn to love (or at least to empathize with them), and very good comedy, for both kids and adults. I really enjoyed it and absolutely recomend it. My only complain, small maybe, was in the third act, when the monster crew stumbles upon a human monster-fest. This whole sequence felt, for me, unreal. The way the humans acted (protective instead of frightened to the monsters) even if we're watching a parallel version of our world, felt too convenient, and even unnecesary. I think this happens because the writers felt there was a loose end in the character arc, when there wasn't. Most of the movie, Dracula deals with two problems that get mixed: His fear/hate to humans and his inability to let Mavis make her own decisions and give her freedom. When her decision becomes to love a human (right when act 2 begins) the two issues merge into one. And when Dracula decides to go after the kid right into the third act, that's when he's defeated both issues: He's got over the fear/hate of humans by respecting his daughters decisions. Therefore, the whole sequence of the humans protecting him from sunlight becomes pointless. The denoument was, I think, a better moment to add a scene of him interacting with humans, perhaps in Hawaii, emphasizing his learned lesson and showing us that Mavis actually got there, as opposed to having a singing number. Aside from that, the movie was good and is recommended."

","Sony's animations are usually hit and miss for me. Infuriatingly they all contain traits that really are destroying the genre. The story centres on Dracula as he creates a hotel for monsters to stay in order to seclude them from the treacherous human world. Preparing for his daughter's birthday party, a human waltzes into the hotel to which Dracula must hide him from the rest of the guests. Hosting an array of famous movie and literary monsters, we are presented with a tsunami of related puns. ""Scream cheese"" springs to mind. A few hearty moments in an attempt to create some touching scenes ultimately fall flat due to the unfunny screenplay. It tries far too hard to make us laugh, that subconsciously I'm ensuring I feel dead as a zombie whilst watching it. Soooo yes, I didn't smile once. It also gambles on dealing with racial stereotypes, yet fails to make the theme stick with the audience. That's not the biggest crime though. Pop music. God. Damn. Pop. Music. Why? In what world do we witness monsters rapping and dancing to multiple LMFAO songs? There is no point to it. I honestly don't even think children want to watch that either!? It's a trend in the early 2010s that really irked me. The animation was fine, nothing outstanding but fluid enough that they can easily replicate it in order to start a franchise (hint hint...). The voice cast was mediocre, Sandler seemed to be having fun though. The story was a montage of ""funny"" scenes tied together at the end to create a young romance. Remember kids, don't be a control freak...because it's not fun. I just...I just feel nothing towards this. It's absolutely suited to its target audience, just the lazy and uninspired approach prevents this from being good."

"phubbs","6","0","1","25 September 2015"," Hotel Transylvania
","This year is really a good year for spooky Addams Family style halloween goth freaks like myself. So far we've had 'ParaNorman' 'Frankenweenie' and now this Adam Sandler animated vehicle. Yes that's right...Adam 'I'm not funny anymore' Sandler.<br/><br/>About 10 minutes into this film you can tell its clearly been made for kids. Nothing wrong with that of course but this isn't Toy Story- smart with little winks for the older folk, its way more tuned for the younglings. This is very evident with silly jokes, huge prat falls and a very loud in your face approach much like many kiddie cartoons, dare I say childish to the max.<br/><br/>Yes childish but did I expect more? well maybe yes, an Adam Sandler fronted film? I did think it might be a little more risky in places, or even a tad scary judging by the concept. The best thing about the film in many sequences is the dialog from the brilliant voice cast line up. This is what the adults will enjoy, especially with the dry wit of Spade and Buscemi who give Werewolf and The Invisible Man some cracking moments of verbal humour. Naturally Kevin James is in here too, can't have an Adam Sandler film without his tubby sidekick it seems. There was a time when it was Rob Schneider, not anymore.<br/><br/>The animation was split right down the middle for me to be honest, at times some sequences looked fantastic, where as others looked rather uninspired. The flashback sequences for Dracula were especially lovely with stunning colours, and the best animated motion capture was again easily Dracula. Some gorgeous looking work as we see Drac glide across the hallways, flap and twirl is cape, slink amongst the shadows and sail through the air...its all in the cape work. Other characters are well designed too, I like the blue collar look of Werewolf, the obvious simplicity of The Invisible Man, the gigantic foot of I presume a Yeti and Mummy, who looked a lot like Oogie Boogie from 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.<br/><br/>There are an impressive range of monsters shown throughout the film from standard skeletons to a Pumpkin King-esque character. The main characters are the best looking naturally, where as the rest don't seem quite as well crafted.<br/><br/>I must just add, is it wrong that I found the young female character of Mavis (Drac's daughter) kinda hot? I mean look at it from my point of view, I'm into the whole goth look and vibe. So for me the sight of an attractive slim pale female with black lips, dark eye shadow, black fingernails and raven black hair, wearing a surprisingly sexy tight black number complete with arm stockings was really quite sexy. It was like watching a young animated Winona Ryder...rawr!!<br/><br/>But I digress, the film is a simple love tale between Mavis and a random human lad who turns up at the hotel, nothing more. Its very sweet, very charming and will thrill the kids. I did enjoy it mainly for the monster mash aspect and of course the kooky vampire/haunted mansion side of it (if you haven't already guessed).<br/><br/>The animation in general was a slight let down for me (some characters aside) as I did expect something a bit more original, quirky or diverse from director Geddy Tartakovsky. It all looks good but too generic for me, nothing trailblazing like his Star Wars work. Also I was hoping for something a little more adult orientated in places with the monsters but alas. Jokes are a bit forced, hated the pop songs included and the horrendous ending almost ruins the entire film Jesus! but it still just about made me smile. <br/><br/>Not as unique, amusing or moving as 'ParaNorman', so far that is the front runner for fun halloween flicks. Watch out for Geddy's unique and much better hand drawn animation in the end credits, maybe they should have done the whole film this way?<br/><br/>6/10"

","Hotel Transylvania (2012): Dir: Genndy Tartakovsky / Voices: Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi: The title references the idea of sheltering those deemed different or outcast. Dracula struggles to shelter his 118 year old daughter, Mavis who yearns to see the outside world. Dracula pulls off various scams in order to keep her away from humans. Various monsters show up for his daughter's birthday. Frankenstein and his wife arrive via postal package. The Wolfman arrives as a harassed husband and father of a big litter of disruptive pups. The Invisible Man arrives bearing glasses. Finally a 21 year old guy shows up accidentally and Dracula wants him gone. While director Genndy Tartakovsky has fun with the creature references, it should be noted that the movies for which these creatures are based are not aimed at children. The animation is comical and appealing but its target audience is off. Adam Sandler voices the over protective Dracula who goes to great lengths to prevent union between his daughter and the human. Selena Gomez voices Mavis the 118 year old teenager who desires to see the world outside the castle. Other characters are merely appearances done with appealing voice talents as various creatures featured in horror films superior to this. The human, Johnny is more annoying than anything, and one can only wish that Dracula extinguished him as oppose to the predicted happy ending. Animated monsters have their comic moments but the screenplay is bland and drained just like Dracula's victims. Score: 5 / 10"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","22 June 2015"," Entertaining from start to finish
","""Hotel Transylvania"" is an animated movie from almost 3 years ago that features the voices of Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez for the central characters. The movie managed a Golden Globe nomination in the animated feature category, but came short at the Oscars. It runs for pretty much exactly 90 minutes, but if you exclude the very long closing credits sequence, it's really only around 80 minutes. I have to say this film was a success. Even if it almost never reached moments of true greatness, it managed a pretty perfect mix of dramatic sequences and hilarious comedy. The more serious topics include the death of Dracula's wife, the struggles in his relationship with his daughter and, directly connected with this one, the very negative and outdated perception these ""monsters"" have from humans in general.<br/><br/>I will not name any particularly funny sequences, but there were quite a few. I enjoyed the humor from start to finish and the love story between the two younger characters was pretty sweet as well. It's certainly a good watch for animation lovers and I'd even recommend this film to fans of the horror genre as this film is packed with references about all kinds of known horror movie characters residing in Hotel Transylvania. No less than five people worked on the script and this time it is no example of how too many cooks spoil the broth. Other projects these writers worked on include ""Borat"", ""The Lego Movie"" and ""Saturday Night Live"". The director is Genndy Tartakovsky, not born in Romania where Transylvania is usually located, but at least in Eastern Europe. He has also finished directing the sequel which will be released in roughly 4 months from now and Adam Sandler worked on the script this time. I am fairly curious about this second installment and hope it will be as good as the first one, which I definitely recommend."

Indeed some of the jokes do fall down, but other than that, the fast pacing, the constant movement, the acting and the general tone of the whole thing is just a ton of fun to watch!<br/><br/>So what's the pickle? After the death of his wife, Dracula opens up a hotel in Transylvania for all the ghouls and monsters to come and relax at away from the fear of humans, whilst at the same time trying to manage his daughter's leaving home at the sprightly young age of 180 (I remember that age well, not nearly as exciting). Anyway, Dracula is rumbled when a backpacker comes across the hotel, and it's up to the famous creature of the night to keep him hidden whilst also running a hotel and managing his daughter.<br/><br/>To be honest, there's very little you can say about this film because there's really just so much to enjoy. The animation and design of the characters is fun to watch and great to look at, and the pacing is done so quickly that you can't help but laugh at the physical humour because there's so much going on at once! The problem however comes with some of the verbal jokes, which do fall down in places. I mean they're not particularly bad, but they don't exactly make you laugh either. But the rest of the humour in this movie is very, very good!<br/><br/>The story as well is also quite a unique tale, especially the story revolving around Dracula and his daughter, which makes you feel for and understand their plight and why they're so reluctant to come into contact with Humans.<br/><br/>Other than that though this movie is a million flavours of fun to watch, being fast, witty, clever in places, with fantastic characters, animation and design, and just generally being amazingly pleasant to watch!"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","21 November 2014"," Best Adam Sandler movie in years
","Adam Sandler more often than not leaves me absolutely cold. His sense of humour is too simplistic and lowbrow for me to enjoy it. That being said, this is a great movie. It's a simple concept. What if Dracula had established himself as a hotel owner to shield all the monsters in the world from those heinous humans with their pitchforks and torches. And what then, if one day a human found his way in. Nothing extraordinary, but the execution is so good here that it simply works.<br/><br/>The characters are the main focus. Dracula (Sandler), his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Jonathan, the human (Andy Samberg) are the main actors and all do a good job in selling us both the humour as well as the drama. All are somewhat stereotypical, but in a good, humorous way and they work together extremely well. Especially Dracula and Jonathan.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are familiar monsters, ghouls and aberrations from various mythologies and stories. All are given enough of a twist to make them unique and their various quirks are fun to witness.<br/><br/>The animation is also superb. Extremely fluid and smooth as well as fast-paced to the extreme. It also has a good distinctive style that suits the comedic tone. Not the best animated film I've ever seen, but it can easily stand next to anything Pixar or Dreamworks put out.<br/><br/>As a whole Hotel Transylvania was a pleasant surprise. Definitely recommended for all ages."

","91 minutes never passed so quickly while watching an animated film. This is such a great production! The voice actors were fantastic and perfect for their characters. This is a story about a vampire who's wife was murdered by humans. He decides to protect his daughter by keeping her as far away from them as possible. He takes drastic actions to make sure it stays that way for as long as he can. Then one day, by pure chance, a man of the human kind walks into their lives and to make matters worse; his daughter falls head over heals for this unwelcome guest. It is a really funny, heart warming and moving story that both young and old can enjoy.

"Angels_Review","9","0","2","5 May 2014"," Twisting Horror classics into childhood fun!
","So what would happen if Dracula had a daughter and the only thing he wanted for her was to keep her safe locked up in a tower? That's very similar to the plot of Hotel Transylvania. Seriously, if you took Rapunzel, made her vampire, and sent her off to a remote place that no one would go to, you would have this particular story. The basics to the over lining story is so clich√© that you would think it would get boring watching, and yet, it's not boring at all. With all the twists that they did in having the monsters being the ones in distress instead of a human makes for a lot of speculation on how family life for a monster would be. They have Werewolves with a whole pack of little ankle biters (yes, they really would bite them), Frankenstein who travels by mail instead of using a plane, and even a very lively mummy. It makes the place look like it's never dull.<br/><br/>We have the rather old school father trying to protect his child after her mother has passed away. It's a simple story and surprisingly, instead of following the daughter like I thought it was going to do, it followed her father learning how to have fun and stop being so stiff. When I see a story about a father protecting his daughter, one thing comes to mind. It's the thought that no matter what, the father is going to get in the way of the romance, try to pull his daughter away from whomever it is that may take her away and the daughter fighting and sneaking out. Sometimes that would even go as far as her running from her father just to be with someone. It really caught me off guard when it turned into a story about Dracula instead of his daughter. On the other hand, the guy of this story was a little bit to hippie-ish for my taste. When he first comes in talking like a surfer, I was just about to switch the show off and say 'Nope! Done!' because I thought he would be like that the whole time. Luckily, he calmed down a bit in how he talked as the show went on but his first impression was one I could not stand.<br/><br/>You can't really say that there was an antagonist or a real enemy that the characters had to fight, making it slightly different then any of the other shows I've seen. When you think a character is going to be the antagonist, they turn around to make it similar to a hero. The only one that comes close to being an antagonist would probably be the chef Quasimodo and his rat Esmeralda.<br/><br/>The artwork is rather good though with a lot of squash and stretching. It's not what kills the show though as even though no one would ever bend the way they bend, it adds to the comedic affect of how the show is. For a show about monsters, there really isn't any horror in it at all. In fact, even when they try to be horror-istic (made up word alert!), it's for comedic affect. The colors are bright surprisingly for a show about monsters and the designs really stand out. Some of the monsters I had to stop and ask 'what are they' but most of them were based on what we automatically think of when someone says Dracula, Mummy, or Frankenstein. Others had nice twists like making the invisible man have a red afro (I do not know this for sure. It is what is hinted). The credits were fun because they used rather old cartoon graphics that feel like I'm watching a silent cartoon film listening to an awesome song 'I'm a Monster'. Then to add to it, they had some wonderful water color concept art that I think was for what happen afterwords. It's a bit dark and grimy looking and yet has almost a 'Paris style' quality. What I mean when I say that is that the watercolors and how some of the storks of designs remind me of Toulouse Lautrec and some other famous painters from France.<br/><br/>The voices fit the characters really well from what I would imagine, to a point I don't exactly know what to say. It's just what makes the show even better and is like icing on the cake. I wish we had a few more accents is all I want. The Mummy didn't have enough of the Egyptian sound to him, the gremlins sounded like everyday people and so on. Maybe it's me being 'racist' in that aspect but I think it would have made the show a little more fun. The only one I found annoying was Frankenstein's wife who sounded like she was a hairdresser in New Jersey, at least the stereotypical one played in most movies. That kind of annoys me a little bit but she was not on long enough to make it to bad."

"CinemaClown","Null","0","3","28 September 2013"," One Of The Most Amusing Comedies Of Its Year
","Brimming with surplus energy, hilarious from start to finish & a rib-tickling homage to horror classics of the past, Hotel Transylvania is an unabashedly funny, immensely enjoyable & thoroughly entertaining feature from Sony Pictures Animation which effortlessly succeeds with its primary goal of satisfying its target audience & is a good enough choice for anyone looking for a light-hearted fun ride.<br/><br/>The story of Hotel Transylvania concerns Count Dracula; the owner of the titular hotel which he built to raise his beloved daughter in a safe environment but the place now also serves as a vacation spot for monsters looking for a break from human civilisation. When a human inadvertently checks into the ""no-human"" hotel, Dracula has to keep him hidden from the guests & also protect his daughter from falling in love with the mortal.<br/><br/>While the narrative here isn't even close to Pixar-level stuff, Hotel Transylvania makes up for what it lacks in the storytelling department with plethora of fascinating characters who are very much alive n kicking, plus the slapstick humour is brilliantly handled throughout its runtime & offers plenty of laughs for kids n adults alike. And the animation is worthy of appreciation as well for it looks incredibly rich, detailed & gorgeously rendered.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Hotel Transylvania is one of the most amusing comedies of its year that features a very simple plot that never takes itself seriously for the most part, is filled with characters that are colourful & fun to be around, nicely parodies many horror films of past n present, and is an amusing family feature that may leave few slightly disappointed in the storytelling department but purely from the entertainment perspective, it's wild, joyful & hilarious as hell. Delightfully recommended."

","Back by poplar demand, it's ""Matthew Praises"". When I heard about Genndy Taratovsky's HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA, I was excited to see it. Apparently, I was busy with college courses, but at least I saw it on-demand, and let me tell you, it was better than DESPICABLE ME! This was the MAD MONSTER PARTY of 2012. I mean we got Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, his bride, the Mummy, the Wolf-man (who has a wife and a litter of kids), the Invisible Man, Quasimodo (a.k.a. The Hunchback of Notre Dame), Mr, Hyde,The Fly and plenty of gill-men, witches, skeletons, zombies, big feet (plural for bigfoot) and a few mythological creatures thrown in here and there such as the Hydra, cyclops and the minotaur. It is great fun (for the family that is). I love the character designs there because it is totally his style. There is a lot of celebrity voice talent going on there. Being someone who watched DEXTER'S LABORATORY religiously, I noticed some certain trademarks that got recycled into it. If you are someone who watched a lot of episodes, then take a look. Genddy is no monster-kid like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson or Tim Burton. He grew up on cartoons. Now one more thing, I heard that his next project is going to be POPEYE. I am excited to hear that because I grew up on POPYEYE. If Genndy Taratovsky grew up on Popeye, the I am sure he won't mess this up. I can understand that. Because all this Popeye merchandising is popping around here and there. We got clothes, toys, and a comic book reboot, so yeah, I think Popeye DESERVES to have a come-back. Bottom line: If you love monsters or grew up watching old classic monster movies, then give it a watch. 10/10. I highly recommend it. Rated PG for mischief crude-humor, wacky going- ons and a few scary scenes."
"JolinKnight","8","0","2","12 September 2013"," Your children will like it!
","The reason why I say that your children will like it is that my ten year old little friend really loves it. He is just like a ordinary boy who like to play games like to watch comics and like to talk as the curiosity of everything. We became friend because of talking, due to my poor English I can only have a wonderful chat with little kid like him, so sometimes I feel like I went back to my childhood. For this movie, I am sure he loves it as usually he probably has fallen asleep at 22:30. However that day we projected this animation for him, he stayed up to the end which is 23:30. And he was still very excited talking about the plot in the picture.<br/><br/>It is undeniable that this is a interesting animation no matter from the way the characters talk or the story. I think each successful animation cannot be there without those good voices of characters. For this one I would vote it a perfect voice play, the voices are all what they exactly are, what their personalities exactly are and they really touch your heart. Lots of conversations are so funny that even adult like me can be moved by them.<br/><br/>In addition, it doesn't forget to beg some tears from audiences, of course, it's because of movement rather than sadness. There are some plays can make me burst into teas, it is really overwhelming. At least, if you will cry when you see a athlete flies the flag for your country in Olympic, you will must be moved by this one.<br/><br/>Anyway, it to some extent worth you to spend time and money to have a look."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","0","2","12 July 2013"," A funny family halloween movie
","How many times are creatures and monsters ever portrayed in a human like fashion? Not often. As for this movie, it is one of the few who come out of the woodwork and display a sense of creativity, charm and even a life lesson. And to be honest, just from the trailer, it seemed that careful thought was put into making this movie be as good as it is. For his first feature film, director Genndy Tartakovsky's direction in animation and character design have a very unique style. And although this is his first time taking on a movie, he is able to display his talent thoroughly after directing several other animated cartoons like Samurai Jack (2001) & Dexter's Laboratory (1996).<br/><br/>The story is about an over protective dad / hotel owner, Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) who only wishes to keep his free spirited daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from visiting the outside world. Thankfully, the hotel he has created is what's supposed to keep the outside world from coming in. This allows the Count and his daughter to live safely along with every other monster / creature one could think of that would want to spend time at his hotel. Little does Dracula know that someone from the outside world will come strolling in, a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg). But when this happens, things turn around for the better.<br/><br/>Along with Sandler, Samberg and Gomez are various other popular comedians like Kevin James as Frankenstein, Fran Drescher as Eunice (his wife), Steve Buscemi as Wayne the werewolf, David Spade as the Invisible Man, Ceelo Green as Murray the Mummy and tons more. Together, they make characters so likable that it's hard not to resist them. Again going back to Tartakovsky's direction, the way each character looks, resembles their actors quite proficiently. Compare Dracula and Adam Sandler and you'll understand. Plus, the computer animation is so evenly mixed together that the whole movie will feel like a very smooth ride, which is great.<br/><br/>The writing isn't mediocre either. If there's one thing I'll pick at, it's that for a while when Jonathan (Samberg) entered the frame, there seemed to be no break or pause between the dialog which made me feel like the characters were on a sugar rush. It did slow down later on but before that it was moving very quickly, almost to the point where I felt like I wasn't catching everything that was being said. But besides that, I love how the story starts and ends. What's even more interesting is how the story doesn't revolve around Mavis (Gomez) as much I thought it would. Mavis plays an important role but the character development of her father Dracula (Sandler) is what stands out. And to be honest, seeing the character development in Dracula was more gratifying than if he were to take a back seat by the third act. <br/><br/>And although the story is clich√© in some senses with finding true love and everything is hunky dory at the end, there are two things that must be understood; it's a family movie and that particular part isn't necessary to get upset over for this kind of movie. Along with the actual story, the comedy was also well executed. There are several things people will be able to relate because of how Dracula and his family perceive to handle various situations as us humans would. They even mock at Twilight (2008), talk about breaking the fourth wall huh? The musical score provided by composer Mark Mothersbaugh did a decent job too. I didn't hear a main theme but to be honest, it wasn't needed this time. His music flowed with the movement of the picture and it worked nicely.<br/><br/>The animation is smooth, the actors use their voices effectively and the comedy is strong. But what makes it good is its story with an integrated moral lesson."

I let my dislike of Sandler get in the way of watching this extraordinary film. Luckily, I found it -albeit a few months later- and it's easily among my favorite animated films. It's smart enough for adult audiences and yet, still has that ability to nurture and cultivate one's imagination. Thank you for the laughs and the tears and the wonder, Hotel Transylvania!"

","Vampire movies eh. A lot of TV shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer,Angel,The Vampire Diaries heck even movies like Dracula and Twilight all contain vampires. So the creator of Dexter Laboratory decided to direct a movie that was sorta copying this genre,and that movie is Hotel Transylvania and boy what a movie it was. The animation was good,and the voice acting was great you've got Adam Sandler,Selena Gomez,Adam Sandler's new BFF Kevin James even the woman from The Nanny Fran Drescher is in this movie. So without further ado lets dive into the story.<br/><br/>The story has been done so many times before and its about Dracula voiced by funnyman Adam Sandler(who stars in A lot of mediocre movies BTW) who's daughter Mavis voiced by Selena Gomez is celebrating her 18th birthday and raises her on his own(oh jeez DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR...aka Tangled with Rapunzel being 18 and celebrating her 18th bday)as he doesn't want her to get in contact with ANY humans. Problems arise though as a human called Johnny voiced by Adam Samberg discovers the hotel of Transylvania,that Dracula built in order for his creatures to be safe from humans and falls in love with Mavis. But will Dracula approve of this and are humans REALLY that bad.<br/><br/>So I'm gonna tell you what I like and didn't like about the movie.<br/><br/>The Good: The animation is great and the effects are good,also I thought Adam Sandler was and I have to say this actually very good as the voice of Dracula,he speaks in a Russian accent and I liked that he interpreted a different accent for the role and was being himself as A lot of celebs just walk in and use their actual voice like in Madagascar and Megamind.<br/><br/>Now to the bad: The ending now I know this is a HUGE SPOILER but GOD hearing Cee-Lo Green's auto tuned voice in the end was such a pain to listen to as well as the rap song Im a Monster Remix sung by Becky G and Will.I.AM who is ANOTHER artist that uses auto tune. Heck even Adam Sandler raps and GOD it was just so bad and terrible.<br/><br/>But if you love horror films or like me a sucker for fantasy films and animated films then be my guest but this isn't a film you'd watch over and over again and praise it as being good.<br/><br/>Its a pretty average flick.<br/><br/>Im giving it a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Also keep an eye out for a certain Twilight Reference."

","This cute fish-out-of-water story centers around Jonathan, a human hiker who stumbles upon Hotel Transylvania, a hotel for monsters, vampires, werewolves, and more run by non other than Count Dracula himself. Trouble ensues when old Dracula's daughter, Mavis meets the human Jonathan, a romance that Dracula will do anything to end. <br/><br/>Drawing on the classic set of spooky characters, the writers have a lot of material to work with. What the film becomes is a delightful Halloween romp with a slew of clever characters. The celebrity voice cast do a modest job of bringing these ghouls to life and the writers really play with the notions of these characters that we've all become familiar with. That being said, the film never veers into the hilarity of the animated films at Dreamworks, and, though it attempts at an emotional father/daughter relationship, it doesn't end up with the emotional pull or sheer animation beauty of a Pixar film. However, it is a witty, fun, and ultimately worthwhile trip, especially during the Halloween season, where family films seem to be in the rare. <br/><br/>B-"

Storyline is full of interesting characters and thats probably is the most amazing thing about this movie.. Even if they don't seems to have anything do with the real plot you'll enjoy their individual portrayal in the movie. Dialogues are funny most of times and comedy is quite timely.

The plot in this movie is the overprotective-father-and-his-teenage- daughter relationship and ZING at first sight. Dracula (Adam Sandler) runs Hotel Transylvania, a castle known to be completely cut off from humans. On his daughter Mavis' (Selena Gomez) 118th birthday, he invites his monster friends ‚Äî such as the Mummy (CeeLo Green), Frankenstein (Kevin James), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) ‚Äî to come and celebrate. However, his party is very predictable and boring. Mavis is now 118 years old and wants to experience the world and does not want to be in a kiddie's birthday party. Mavis is not having any fun at her own party. However, the party begins when a backpacking human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) accidentally stumbles into the castle. My favorite part of this movie is when Dracula slashes out at his friends and point out all the annoying things for each monster and they are all offended. The truth is not very pretty sometimes. However, it does have many feel-good moments in his tantrum. The quality of the 3-D in this movie is awesome; you can see all the details of the monsters popping right in front of you! I jumped out of my seat several times. I love the creative designs on how they make all the monsters to be nice and fluffy instead of mean and scary. The voices are brilliant; the special effects are so awesome. The message in this movie is not to judge anyone until you get to know them. The only part I did not like is how the monsters view the humans as fat and mean. My favorite character is Jonathan. He is so fun to be around and always focuses on the good side of people or monsters. I rank this movie four out of five stars (due to some scary parts). I give this age ranged 5 and up. <br/><br/>For more reviews on Hotel Transylvania, go to kidsfirst.org"
"southbase","6","0","5","23 October 2012"," Three howls out of 5
","(3D viewing) Frantic, kid-friendly, pleasantly oddball CGI-mishmash supervised by comedian/producer Adam Sandler can't quite be labeled as either steadily charming (the expensive voice cast--with the possible exception of Steve Buscemi portraying a flat-headed, rolling-eyed werewolf--appears to be trying too hard, mostly force-fit together by voice editing and constantly abrupt scene transitions) or profoundly unearthly (the monsters deal more in competitive magic and mesmerism than spoofing outright terror). But as Sandler's ingratiating, widowed, porcelain-skinned Dracula successfully weans his teenage daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) past puberty into her 118th birthday, the cruise-ship-type monster revelry at his Hotel Transylvania resort castle is invaded for the first time by a dreaded, freckle-faced backpacking American mortal, Jonathan (Andy Samberg), who manages to fascinate and charm Mavis into the threat of an actual monster/human romance. Film's middle--as Dracula 'trains' Jonathan into masquerading as a monster to deflect suspicion or anti-human bigotry from Hotel's labyrinth number of creature-guests while hopefully wearing down Mavis' earnest new attraction--isn't narratively smooth but does feature the requisite 'wild' chases, adolescent and familial longings, and character contortions & gesticulations expected of these computer animated films nowadays. Director & former 2D/Cartoon Network animator Genndy Tartakovsky doesn't reinvent the wheel here, and the almost infinitely detailed digital texture mapping on display is second to no one else's. One does have to wonder however if/why either Sandler or Tartakovsky agreed to keep the film's rubbery interpersonal relations, character massings/groupings used solely for punch lines, and juvenile societal identities set rather low even for contemporary animated features (perhaps to avoid the overly melodramatic lecturing some kids' features descend into, if indirectly.) The climax--where a remorseful, fruit-bat-looking Dracula chases down a home-bound, jet-planed Jonathan to bring him back to Mavis and everyone at the resort--provides enough final giggles/smiles to make HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA a genial, occasionally very-well-imaged animated comedy entertainment that--although it may not have gone far enough for real literature-based horror fans or animation critics--will probably be in serious rotation in your minivan DVD player or kid's playroom TV."
"TheSquiss","6","0","4","22 October 2012"," Fun but not really funny, enjoyable but not enthralling, merely an appetizer for Frankenweenie.
","Today my ten-year-old niece overruled me. Her treat, her call and Hotel Transylvania won the duel over Frankenweenie. Oh well, she'll learn and Burton's latest will earn a review later in the week.<br/><br/>Hotel Transylvania is the latest in the current wave of kiddie horrors and certainly better than last month's Paranorman, but let's hope it isn't as good as it gets.<br/><br/>Following the death of his wife, Dracula (Adam Sandler) creates his Hotel Transylvania as a resort where monsters can holiday safe from the intrusion of nasty humans and where he can ensure his daughter, Mavis (Selina Gomez), can spend her life under his (over) protection. Fast forward a century and a bit to her one hundred and eighteenth birthday and all of Dad's friends arrive for the 118th time to celebrate. Daddy Drac is trying to organize the same party he's staged for the past century and Mavis is monumentally cheesed off by feeling trapped when the door opens and in stumbles Jonathan (Andy Samberg), the kind of human your father would groan at and your mother would pity if you brought home.<br/><br/>There follows 90 odd minutes of Dracula's ineptitude, Jonathan's geekiness, Mavis' frustration and a predictable meeting of minds (of sorts). Oh, and love might be in the air. While Hotel Transylvania flows fairly smoothly and it entertains, it never really hits any great heights and the final act is tied up rather too neatly, obviously and without imagination. Whereas animation was once the domain of Disney, Pixar appears to own it now (and, yes, they are now part of Walt's company) but Sony Pictures Animation is trying hard to catch them. Their highpoints, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Aardman's The Pirates! In an Adventure With Scientists!, fall short of the brilliance of Pixar's WALL.E and Monsters Inc. but Hotel Transylvania is a definite step forward.<br/><br/>While none of the voices stand out in the way Robin Williams did in Aladdin, all are suited to their characters and nothing jars, though no-one makes the ears tingle. That said, any film is improved by the presence of the put-upon Steve Buscemi, in this instance playing werewolf Wayne, long-suffering father to an anarchic brood too numerous to count.<br/><br/>Whilst the belly laughs are non-existent, there is a real joy to be had from watching the disparate crew of monsters dancing and performing water aerobics, the animation is expressive and detailed and, overall, Hotel Transylvania is a very enjoyable, if unremarkable viewing experience, although the biggest smile of the film occurred when, upon the date appearing on the screen in the prologue, my niece whispered, ""Uncle Yed, were you born in 1895?"" Her verdict? 8 out of 10. I'm going to downgrade it to six because it could have been so much more.

He got terrified by a scene in the beginning where it looks like people are on fire and trying to kill a girl. It ruined the whole thing for him and he asked to leave about 25 times after that. As soon as the credits started rolling, he jumped out of his seat and started heading up the aisle out of the theater. And he said ""I didn't like that scary movie"" over and over on the drive home. He isn't a kid that is scared of much. The only thing I can think of would be the ""scary bear"" in Brave (and he wasn't scared of that nearly as much because he LOVED that movie and made us go back to the theater and see it a second time). Otherwise he's seen almost every kids movie (new and old) I can think of and hasn't been scared of any of them.<br/><br/>Do with that information what you will. I just felt like it was something other parents might be wondering so I thought I'd share our experience."
