","Great drama moves you. It excites you. Scares you. Makes you sing. Makes you cry.<br/><br/>The Big Short makes you shake your fist. The Big Short is driven as much by its Iago as it is its Othello, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>The events in the story did happen. Many people still don't care. The Big Short gives you reason to care. That is what separates this film from being merely a documentary and turns it into high drama. <br/><br/>No matter your politics - mark this, like Citizen Kane, as a movie that should be seen at least once. It is not always comfortable to watch. And that is a good thing - The Big Short is a documentary of a real life horror that unfolds in slow motion, and reminds us that even after the fact - no one is listening. Because truth is like poetry."

","I appreciate that The Big Short tries to dumb down the housing crisis of 2008, but, apparently, I'm still not smart enough to fully understand it. A lot of this movie went over my head, but I grasped the generalities and it kept me entertained, so I applaud it for that. This film also featured some great performances by the cast, who lose themselves in their respective roles. This movie is a downer, but it's an educational downer."
"texshelters","9","346","386","28 December 2015"," ""The Big Short"" is educational, relevant and entertaining.
","Nothing Small about ""The Big Short""<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is based on the book with the same name by financial journalist Michael Lewis. It is about collateralized debt obligations, subprime mortgages, credit default swaps and bundling. A snoozer right? Not one bit. ""The Big Short"" is more entertaining than most films in the cineplex this holiday season. Even if you don't know much about the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, you will recognize a quality film and want to know more about the world economic collapse when the film is over. <br/><br/>The film uses a multitude of techniques to tell the story. There are fourth-wall breaking monologues, a model in a bubble bath explaining economics as well as a singing idol and a celebrity chef using metaphors of cooking and gambling to explain the economic crisis. There are jump cuts, slow motion, foreshadowing and flash backs. The filmmakers use any and all tricks to explain a complicated mess of financial chicanery in order to help the audience understand. The banks, mortgage brokers, the credit ratings agencies and the government manipulated people in the nation and world into investing in worthless packages of bonds, and it behooves the director and writer, Adam McKay, to use all cinematic tricks to explain and untangle the financial corruption. The miracle is that the film deciphers the economic melt-down well while entertaining its audience. <br/><br/>The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. They aren't just playing a role, they embody characters during a remarkable time in history. My mother thinks Steve Carrell was the best actor in the film, for she did not even recognize him at first. He plays against character and she liked that. However, my mother had never seen Carrell in ""The Office."" His character, Mark Baum, is much like the boss from that television series. However, in ""The Big Short"", he plays it straight. He is a boss of a fund under the umbrella of Morgan Stanley (but it's not Morgan Stanley, and his team likes to point out), and he is on a mission to bring down banks, to show them up, and to prove he's been right about the financial warning signs. He is betting against the hand that feeds him, Morgan Stanley.<br/><br/>I preferred Christian Bale's performance as Michael Burry, an unselfconscious, manic math genius. I haven't seen that frightening look in Bale's eyes since ""American Psycho"", but this time he's only killing the mortgage backed securities market. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt, under- playing another disaffected former banker, Brad Rickert, helps two friends make millions while they bet against terrible investments, or ""play short"" the mortgage market. His backstory is revealed steadily and in a way that makes us wonder why he briefly got back into the investment ""game."" Even Ryan Gosling makes his mark in this star-studded cast playing the prescient ""Jared Vennett."" Remember, all the characters in the film are based on real people. And that is what makes it so remarkable. <br/><br/>The other major players in the film are Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, and a slew of investment houses who at best ignore the coming financial crisis or at worst, colluded in its creation. From the realtors selling the mortgages, to the banks loaning at subprime, to the banks bundling the worthless packages, they were all making too much money to want to stop. This is exactly the kind of over-exuberance that occurred in the 1920s stock market crash, but few payed attention then or in 2007. <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is a dramatized film of true events. And to make sure we understand, the actors break the fourth wall several times to tell us what part is true to the detail and what part is fictionalized to make it more dramatic. But if you are still incredulous, read the book. The events are all sadly true, and we are still paying for it. <br/><br/>Rating: Pay full price (but you might want to see it twice.) <br/><br/>It will take at least two viewings to catch half of what is embedded in this film. This film is entertaining, educational and relevant. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"
"Zuranthium","10","459","557","15 November 2015"," An unexpected and necessary masterpiece
","Comedy is tragedy + time, right? We're now over 7 years out from the apex of the American financial crisis, which spiraled outward across the world, and yet what has really changed? People are still making millions/billions off the suffering of others, corporate control reigns supreme, fraud is common and remains largely unknown, wealth continues to be ever more concentrated in the grasp of a few, and the remainder of the populace are treated as proverbial rats and made to feel uncouth should they question the system and question not wanting to live their lives playing this sadistic game. Taking 2 pennies and selling them to someone for a hundred dollars remains a legal activity, just call those pennies by a different name and suddenly it's okay to pass them off as fair market.<br/><br/>It doesn't sound funny at all, but The Big Short succeeds in turning this demented and corrupt circus into something improbably hilarious and probing. The power of comedy is its ability to let us see something from a different viewpoint, allow us to process it in ways we wouldn't have been able to otherwise. As we might laugh at children for the hilariously unaware things they say and do, so too will humankind in the future hopefully laugh at how completely pathetic and ignorant our present society has been. Martin Scorsese opened the flap up into the circus entrance with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and, while making good points, was perhaps a bit too concerned with his own technique and had a bit too much indulgence, reveling in the frivolity of it all. The Big Short completely blows the top of the circus and dissects it in every way, starting with the widespread fraud and greed in business, and then examining how it has seeped into our entire existences. Even the good guys here are ultimately out there to make money, lots of it. Isn't that what society tells us we must to do, in order to be valuable? It's sick.<br/><br/>McKay's approach here is ""throw everything in, including the kitchen sink"" and that creates an energetic, brilliantly matched representation of the subject matter. This does not mean he is lacking control, however. The story being told includes so many facets and characters that it easily could have fallen into disarray, but McKay makes every single character memorable and illuminates every piece of jargon that could be confusing from the outset. It's a huge accomplishment and a far more important one than might seem apparent. The things that were allowed to happen in the realms of business, finance, and banking are absolutely INSANE and unbelievable. It has to be largely comedic because there's no other way of delivering this vast amount of information and complete failure of our entire society and make it all snap into place so continuously, without being ripped apart by the overwhelming darkness of it all. This isn't simply circumstantial and theoretical and mysterious to a degree, as in Oliver Stone's ""JFK"", but the cold hard truth.<br/><br/>It's not enough to even ask for the truth anymore and ask for answers, we need to question the entire system, a whole web of poisonous bonds that have tightly wound themselves so entirely around us. The work of the film itself is allowing us to project our thoughts, our fears, our anger, and our confusions into this convoluted conundrum. All while being told the truth, so that we at least have a place to even start down the correct path of understanding. It's acting as our own investigative journey in a time when actual news and journalism has become a tiny spec of its former self. We now have more information than ever available to us, yet it's often so shrouded and twisted as to become unrecognizable. There are still those who fear education for what it would do to their own position in life, how it would challenge their own reality. We are still held under the thumb of ""greed is good"", ""thinking you're inherently better is good"", ""vanity is good"".<br/><br/>The shiny mainstream hallmarks of a typical Hollywoood commercial product - the agreeable lighting and manicured actors and tidy locations - are so perfectly representative in this film of the emptiness within the characters and indeed in our entire society. After all the progress we think we've made towards world peace and human rights and medical advances and the stability of the human race, have we lost sight of what a fulfilling life and a world of justice should really be? Aren't we still captive to the same pointless rituals and superficialities, doesn't a veritable monarch and royal court still control most everything? We are now living our lives working for something that can be wiped out with the stroke of a keyboard. We are told something of monetary worth that is non-existent, for all intents and purposes, is something we should strive for. Making a bet on the outcome of another bet is a whole industry. The non-existent and ridiculous and pointless directly hurts the lives of many.<br/><br/>The Big Short is one of the most important films of this era and one of the best. I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. It is an illumination, a magical pairing of a director's sensibility to exactly the correct form that most fully allows it to blossom and hold water. It is water which the film warns us will be the next basic human necessity to be denied by those few who hold power."
"A_Different_Drummer","9","176","215","24 December 2015"," Two-Sided Look at a Great Film
","First for newbies, the events here took place prior to the Kevin Spacey film Margin Call (2011). So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.<br/><br/>Back to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie.<br/><br/>One that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor.<br/><br/>Finally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over.<br/><br/>Duh!"
"JackCerf","8","156","190","28 December 2015"," Smart Greed
","Harry Knowles once wrote a review of Das Boot that said the movie was so well made that you'd find yourself rooting for Nazi sailors trying to sink American ships. So here. You find yourself rooting for clever ""outsiders and weirdos,"" as one of them puts it, who saw what nobody else wanted to see -- that an immense structure of mortgage based securities was doomed to collapse because it rested on the backs of subprime borrowers who couldn't support the weight and should never have been loaned the money. We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication. Then you realize that their vindication means the collapse of the American economy. They were the guys on the Titanic who knew what the iceberg meant and booked reserved seats in the lifeboats.<br/><br/>Michael Lewis, from whose book the movie was adapted, got his training at Salomon Brothers in the mid-80s, as mortgage based securities were being invented. (There's an early shout-out to Lew Ranieri, the Salomon trader who invented them.) As anyone knows who's read Lewis's memoir of those days, Liar's Poker, the culture at Salomon was that your job was to be smarter than everybody else in the bond market, understand values better, and know what other traders were going to do before they knew it themselves. If you were smart enough, you deserved whatever you took away from somebody less smart on the other side of the trade. That's why Lewis admires his protagonists and that, despite a thick coating of moral outrage, is the heart of the movie. The guys who shorted the housing market weren't any more virtuous or less greedy than the great majority of complacent, conventionally minded bankers who believed that the trees would keep growing all the way up to the sky. They just saw more clearly and had plenty of nerve and faith in their own judgment. If they had been wrong, as shorts often are, they and their clients would have been wiped out. When they turned out right, they took the money and kept it, even if some of them felt guilty about it.<br/><br/>I know somewhat about this area, having litigated some of the aftermath. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate -- the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant. The key concept of the credit default swap comes out nicely through the dialogue -- a chance to buy fire insurance on the house down the street just before it catches fire. There are a couple of more points that could have used the same thing, especially when people start talking about ""FICO scores."" It could also have been a little more clear that the eventual collapse was delayed because the smarter investment banks like Goldman finally woke up, saw it coming, unloaded their CDO inventory on investors who were still asleep, and cut their losses by buying swaps themselves. But this is a smart, entertaining telling of an outrageous true story. It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and maybe an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. If it teaches people without a financial background a little of what went on, it will be more than a momentary entertainment. But it will certainly entertain."

"HollywoodGlee","9","151","193","13 November 2015"," Four ""outsider"" Wall Street entities capitalize on an impending financial collapse of the US financial system.
","Reviewed by Larry Gleeson. Viewed during the AFI Filmfest 2015.<br/><br/>""The Big Short,"" directed by Adam McKay, based on the book by Michael Lewis, was adapted by McKay and Charles Randolph and made its world premiere Thursday, November 12, 2015 at the historic TCL Grauman's Chinese Theater as the closing night film for the latest edition of the American Film Institute's AFI FEST film festival.<br/><br/>The film's narrative is driven by four cynical, fringe Wall Street entities disgusted with the large banking institutions' overriding greed for profits. They make the decision to capitalize on the ensuing housing market calamity and the financial meltdown of 2008 upon discovering the market frenzy is being driven by worthless collateral debt obligations.<br/><br/>McKay chooses to inject a significant dose of humor in the early scenes to condition the audience receptors for what they are about to experience. Utilizing the Martin Scorsese docudrama style in a similar setting with ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" a strong narrative voice dominates particular moments. Several of these deliberately break the 'Fourth Wall"" in the style of ""Wolfie,"" Jordan Belfort, as the characters, including a hilarious cameo by Selena Gomez, speak directly into the camera to explain the complexities of Wall Street finance. The overall effect adds additional humor and adds another layer in creating a sense of authenticity and truth about the film's subject matter.<br/><br/>After a rather lengthy dizzying, yet delightful, character introduction, the film picks up pace as the drama begins to unfold. Dr. Michael Burry, an eccentric financial analyst, with complete autonomy of an investment fund, uncovers variables in his economic forecast indicating a massive housing market collapse. He informs his higher up, Lawrence Fields, played convincingly by Tracy Letts, of his discovery and creates a financial prospectus. In essence, he creates a commodity of selling short on bundled mortgages.<br/><br/>The bankers laugh as they willingly sell Burry all the ""insurance"" he wants. Word quickly spreads of Burry's perceived madness in a after-work cocktail scene. With interest piqued upon overhearing the Wall Street gossip of the day, Jarred Bennett, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, scoops up the essence of Burry's move. Soon, he sells a group led by Steve Carell's all-too-human, Mark Baum to buy in.<br/><br/>As the debacle is in full free-fall, Baum struggles with disbelief as he and his group have bet against their own umbrella entity, Morgan Stanley. The final team that has uncovered the impending financial crisis, made up of two Wall Street neophytes and veteran Ben Rickert, played by one of the film's producers, Brad Pitt, also struggles with the imploding financial system caused by corporate greed and indifference.<br/><br/>With a mammoth cast, McKay draws on a plethora of talent in the likes of Hollywood A-listers including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, Christian Bale, Karen Gillan Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Melissa Leo and Finn Wittrock. McKay and Randolph create characters with witty dialogue coupled with complementary cinematography provided by Barry Ackroyd. The soundtrack carries a similar tone of ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" with a compilation of classic rock anthems. Nicholas Britell widely recognized for his work on Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave,"" where Britell composed on set the on-screen violin performances, work songs, dances and spiritual songs rarely misses a beat this time out. Much like another AFI FEST 2015 film, ""The Clan,"" Argentina's official entry to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Best Foreign Language Category for Oscar, ""The Big Short,"" musical score is often in juxtaposition to the the narrative and mies-en-scene adding a deeper visceral quality to the viewing experience.<br/><br/>In its most basic essence, ""The Big Short,"" builds on the visceral truth of Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street."" It depicts a not-so-long-ago present where a noble ideal, making home ownership a reality for Americans, is bastardized by the indifferent market forces of capitalism. Probably not what Adam Smith had in mind when he penned his treatise, ""The Wealth of Nations."" Warmly Recommended."
"RossRivero99","9","26","30","23 February 2017"," One of 2015's best films
","Adam McKay's ""The Big Short"" is the best financial movie I have seen since watching Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987), but the only difference between these two movies is that this movie was based on true events. The film takes place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspects of this movie are pretty funny if you ask me. The movie was adapted from the book by Michael Lewis and it basically starts off with Dr. Michael J. Burry (Christian Bale) who was the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually betting against the housing market before it actually happened despite everyone else thinking that he was a crazy person. Then 20 minutes into the film we see a banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) talk to a Morgan Stanley employee named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his coworkers and Vennett tells them that not long from now the economy is going to collapse and that nobody was even talking about it. also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversations Baum is going through a personal tragedy that I will not reveal in this review for those people that haven't seen the movie, and Baum is getting comforted between phone calls and at home by his wife (Marisa Tomei). The screenplay for this movie by McKay along with Charles Randolph took home the Oscar last year for best adapted screenplay and I had a few minor gripes with it here and there but then again it was directed by a man who normally does comedies. Then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) end contacting a retired trader by the name of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who is the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market. the only major problem I had with this movie was the shaky camera angles which could have been improved on, and also I think that Adam McKay could have been more impartial instead of openly mocking the corporations but then again that is just my opinion, but otherwise the performances from Bale (who got an Oscar nomination), Gosling, Carell, and Pitt are top notch, as well as Marisa Tomei's. This is one of last year's greatest achievements in film, and I stand by this review."
"StevePulaski","8","120","158","29 December 2015"," A delightful merging of information and comedy
","No subject in the world is inherently interesting or uninteresting, for it's always about the communicative method or channel used to promote or inform one about the subject that is either interesting or not. Having said that, some subjects are more alienating than others, and one of those subjects is economics/finance, largely because of its dependency upon a plethora of terminology and jargon that usually cannot be adequately defined without including other terminology or jargon. Before you know it, searching the definition of something like a ""Roth IRA"" leads you to Google searches about embezzlement and quantitative easing in efforts to try and circumvent and define what you were originally looking for.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Adam McKay's The Big Short assumes the audience is fairly stupid and blissfully ignorant when it comes to the interworkings of what led to the global economic crisis of 2007-2008, which saw record unemployment and catastrophic results for the usually reliable housing market. In true movie fashion, we observe the financial crash, not from an insider standpoint, where sure-fire, grade-A trades and exchanges are being made, but by a plethora of quirky outsiders trying to run away from a boulder that keeps gaining on them until it flattens them and everyone in their tracks. The only ones saved are the ones who didn't manage to fall or stumble when pushing said boulder down the hill in the first place.<br/><br/>We initially meet a quirky hedge fund manager named Michael Burry (Christian Bale), who discovers that the U.S. housing market is based on a series of subprime loans (which, we are told by Margot Robbie as she soaks in a bubblebath whilst sipping champagne, may as well be synonymous with ""s***"") and is inevitably going to collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007. Being that the housing market is often viewed as the safest bet in America, Michael begins to go around to different banks to bet against the stability and long-term security of the housing market in efforts to profit from the impending disaster.<br/><br/>Then there's Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a fairly small-time investor, who winds up putting in his own money to bet against the housing market, along with Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a cynical and depressed banker of many years. The two wind up discovering that the market collapse is further aided by the solicitation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), basically collections of the aforementioned subprime loans that come packaged together and market as competent and reliable investments.<br/><br/>Finally, there's Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), two young-bloods anxious to break into the financial market. The inexperienced duo enlist in the help of a retired, conservative banker named Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who helps them make decisions with their money. Unlike the other more experienced men, both Charlie and Jamie lack the kind of gusto and namesake that allows them into the offices of big name bankers. As a result, they pine for a bigger piece of the pie in a smaller way, largely by lounging in their parents' basements, hunched over their iPads.<br/><br/>The Big Short functions as a competent, satirical anthology that breaks down the financial crisis - that is now nearly a decade old, if you can believe that - enough to be informative and entertaining. Considering this is from Adam McKay, a frequent collaborator with Will Ferrell and Funny or Die, responsible for films like Casa De Mi Padre, The Other Guys, and Step Brothers, this is a huge step in the right direction for him as a name in comedy and satire. Rather than focusing on a bargain-barrel Spanish telenovela satire or a tired, mean-spirited comedy based around who can yell the loudest, McKay sets his sights on peddling information through the most communicable form - entertainment. If you can succeed in meriting consistent laughs while teaching an audience something, you have profoundly succeeded at two things many have a difficult time accomplishing in a separate sense. That alone is worth considerable praise.<br/><br/>While the screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph is undoubtedly a big part at why this film succeeds, The Big Short is a true testament to brilliant comedic acting on various cylinders, as well. The men of the hour, specifically, are both Bale and Carell, seriously taking on opposite personas that they pull off to a tee. Bale plays confused and downright quirky with just the right amount of edge to make him believable rather than hopelessly incompetent or downright silly, and Carell's sporadic bouts of rage and lack of self-awareness make him all the more watchable screen presence. Other performances, like Gosling's, who serves as the infrequent, anti-hero narrator, is notable for its brash charm, in addition to Pitt, who works largely because he's even more understated and harder to define than in his latest film By the Sea.<br/><br/>The Big Short has a lot of comedic value, but it's nonetheless a frightening depiction of where America is currently at; a depressing oligarchy, controlled and manipulated by those with money at the mercy of those without. We've seen ""The Great Recession of 2007,"" as it's sometimes called, plunge numerous working class and poor families into further states of hopelessness, while those who helped cause and further the effects of the recession have gone on to have a road of many ups and few downs since then. McKay's eye, ear, and talent for conducting satire in a way that's simultaneously uproariously funny, in addition to having the ability to be truly upsetting, is quite marvelous and unexpected, and one can only hope that with proper recognition and compensation for his efforts on this film, he furthers down this path rather than the one he was previously on."

","""The Big Short"" is a good film but also a film that would be tough for the average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although the housing bubble's burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples' lives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks were foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn't possibly afford these homes)....but that's about as far as their understanding goes. And, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it's sure to confuse more than entertain. <br/><br/>What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with explanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to further clarify what is happening. I've seen several Japanese import films like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that most non-Japanese viewers would miss. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the average person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost.

","'The Big Short' is a winner. Based on Michael Lewis book of the same title, it tells the sorry story of the fraud and deceit practiced on the American people, nay, on the world by Wall Streets finance capitalism. We know the culprits: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Bros., Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Wachovia, Crdit Suisse, UBS and on and on who invented financial instruments such as CDO, credit swaps and other fancy unintelligible names, based on mortgages, with the connivance of the credit agencies--Dow Jone, Standard and Poors and Fitch. 'The Big Short' with a light seriousness is a crash course on the duplicity of Wall Street investment bankers who earned large fees on junk bonds with triple A ratings; who bundled junk to palm off on an unsuspecting public looking for big gains by pandering to the snake oil exilir of getting rich quickly; and who feed on the niavety of the broad American have-nots with the dream of owning a home of their own. And so with some humor but much sadness are we lead through the byways of four different groups of bankers who saw the hoax for what it was and its impending implosion that would bring down the deck of cards of capitalism. And the took out bets on the market, by buying short. And they won big time! But the banks are still around, and the ratepayers footed the bailout, but at what cost! And we see this in the turmoil of the Republican party: for the discontent abroad in the US has thrown more than 25 percent of the population into poverty, loss of jobs, home, into heavy debt and no future for their children. And these banks have not reformed their ways...now they've come up with the same of gimmicks with a fancy name--something like beneficial financial tranche--as the play the same old mug's game. And like the Bourbons, t The cast is stellar--especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as well as the minor players. And like the Bourbons, in the words of Talleyrand, 'they learned nothing and forgot nothing', but the contempt they have for all of us.

What astonishes me is that he wastes his considerable talents on dreck like ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers."" Why? I mean, WHY?!?!?! It just don't add up! The man should stick to smart and insightful films like ""The Big Short"" and leave the juvenile, unfunny comedies to Kevin Smith and Seth Rogan."
"TheRenegadeTaoist","9","29","38","2 January 2016"," Tough to watch... for all the right reasons
","This film is tough to watch having lived through the housing crisis and unemployment meltdown of 2007 to present. It inspires righteous indignation and they are a lot of unlikable people that you encounter throughout the film. Don't get the wrong impression, this film is an absolute necessity on raw economics majors and even the fringe behavioral economists.<br/><br/>We now spend a tremendous amount of time discussing the poor leadership and lack of responsibility that we encountered during that time period but nothing of such gross negligence should escape unnoticed (according to the film maybe it didn't).<br/><br/>That it still shows that intelligent people will prosper even from the most ignorant, gross misconduct is somewhat painful to watch.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, these are the films that don't make a lot of headway on the road to the Oscars but the cast is very stellar and is undeniable in their efforts to bring the story life from a very real point of view. Not shocking to me, Steve Carell turns in a superb effort with a highly nuanced performance overall. I wish them all the best on the road to the Oscars.<br/><br/>Having lived through the time period, I never read the book but the last 6 to 10 minutes of the film make your stomach hurt long after the ending. If the point in cinema is to get a reaction or some sort of a dialogue started this movie is highly successful.<br/><br/>This movie may bore the poop out of kids through the mid- to late 20s... but it is a hot weapon against the machine for anybody who is beyond that age range. Historical economic movies don't usually do well at the box office but pick up a hellacious head of steam later on if they're on target and this movie is.<br/><br/>I recommend you catch it in theaters and have an interesting conversation on the way out to the parking lot and beyond."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","107","165","16 January 2016"," Informative and somehow interesting...
","First of all don't be fooled by other reviews. This movie is neither a crap nor a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It has a lot of technical terms and jargon from the world of economics and despite the obvious effort to explain things (including breaking the 4th wall (i.e. talking direct to the audience while looking into the camera), and cameo appearances from movies stars like Margot Robbie and Selina Gomez) you will probably fail to understand in depth the mechanics of what is happening.<br/><br/>The world of banks, funds, bonds, financing and the stock market will remain a mystery for most of the viewers.<br/><br/>Big names of Hollywood star in the Big Short including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and others. They play real persons, who had an insight on the global economic crisis we probably still experiencing.<br/><br/>As a movie it has its own style. Something of a documentary, a comedy sometimes, but essentially a drama since the crisis cost 8 million people their job and their homes.<br/><br/>People who are impressed easily might tell you this is a ""masterpiece"". Believe me it isn't. But I recommend to see it. Even better at home where you can pause or rewind the movie to understand better. It is lengthy (130min) but you won't get bored. It needs some patience though especially in the beginning and not to be disappointed when terms like CDO, payouts etc. are starting to emerge."
"Hellmant","9","13","16","5 January 2016"," It almost has you rooting for the U.S. economy to fail!
","'THE BIG SHORT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed comedy-drama flick; about the financial crisis, of 2007 to 2010, and the clever businessmen who were able to profit from it. The film was directed by Adam McKay (who's helmed such other comedy classics as 'ANCHORMAN', 'STEP BROTHERS' and 'THE OTHER GUYS'), and it was written by McKay and Charles Randolph. The movie stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, John Magaro, Finn Wittrock, Jeremy Strong, Hamish Linklater, Rafe Spall and Brad Pitt. Along with it being impressively critically rated, the film is also expected to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards (including Best Picture). I found it to be a very insightful, and highly entertaining, movie.<br/><br/>The story begins in 2005, when Michael Burry (Bale), a socially awkward hedge fund manager, predicts the upcoming financial crisis (due to the unstable housing market) and decides to bet against it. Burry creates a 'credit default swap market', much to the dismay of many of his investors. Multiple other businessmen catch wind of Burry's plan, and decide to pursue similar financial ventures. They include trader Jared Vennett (Gosling), hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Carell) and retired banker Ben Rickert (Pitt). The true story follows three different groups of people; as they follow their American dream, of becoming rich (while everyone else's dreams collapse). <br/><br/>The movie is very informative, about what caused the economy to fail (in 2007). It's also very detailed, and educational (in it's explanations), while trying to remain entertaining; at the same time. I still got lost, multiple times, but I also learned a lot too. Besides being politically fascinating, the movie is hilarious, and full of complex characters. It's a lot more insightful, than anything McKay has done before. What's really odd about the film, is that it almost has you rooting for the U.S. economy to fail; just to prove it's likable characters right (I especially like Bale's character, Michael Burry).

"AudioFileZ","9","8","9","9 January 2016"," Entertaining Movie Expose Corruptness Eisenhower Warned Us Of
","Did you lose everything in 2007? Probably not, but you lost a ton anyway and here's a movie that sheds some light on how much that was. Oh yeah, if your tax money, and lots more printed just for the heck of it, didn't shore up the international banking economy you'd be looking at all your former bank account balances at ZERO.<br/><br/>Adam McKay and Charles Randolph's ""Big Short"" is a Cliff Notes like distilled version of what was going on in the American Banking Industry in early 2004. Things had become so obviously ""short"" that few could actually see how criminal the whole system had become. But, like in everything...there were those who actually saw how corrupt things were. And, there were a few of these ""visionaries"" that gambled on the fact that there would be a day of final honesty whereby the fake rated investments would have to revealed for the worthlessness that they really were.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is ruthlessly brilliant. It really doesn't hit you over the head with the fact our whole banking system is totally corrupt...nope, it slowly allows you to question it and come up with your own conclusion. Kennedy knew something when he began to print money not tied to a system that was hopelessly based on criminal quackery, but, wait, he was assassinated. And years later we have this. We also have a generation of hard working Americans whose nest-egg was obliterated in a few days. A government that is perpetually at war, as well as not subservient to the average citizen, because the warning Dwight D. Eisenhower gave us wasn't really taken to heart and didn't include the Federal Reserve. This movie exposes the greatest threat to the American Dream and it ain't got a damn thing to do with Communism. To bad there wasn't a second American Revolution, one that finally righted a sinking ship. This movie makes that fact woefully clear and it is absolutely brilliant in that it is highly understated and wonderfully entertaining. Alan Grenspan should by any measure of a honest system be in prison and if he sang like a canary the depth of it would be so profound our monetary system would have to be rebuilt from the ground up instead of letting guiltless millions bear the brunt of a totally fake monetary system propping it up. You can't write fiction this unbelievable, but you can get a movie that distills it down to two hours. Take note: our current economy has nothing except intention backing it up. Let's hope China never calls our bluff."
"maurice_yacowar","9","12","15","30 December 2015"," Reconstruction of the 2008 banking meltdown.
","I can't think of another film like The Big Short. It explains the economic meltdown of 2008 with a rage at the fraudulent banking system and the government that coddles it. But this — in effect — lecture is presented as a satiric montage of cultural references woven through the stories of the five principals who bet on the mortgage bubble collapsing and taking the economy down with it. They bet their success on the economy's failure. <br/><br/>The five lead figures are variously outsiders who see past the industry's smugness and are disturbed by the banks' corruption and irresponsibility. Each has his own quirks and offbeat temperament — because only they can strike an outside perspective on the system. <br/><br/>Paradoxically, the first to see through that system is the one-eyed maverick, Michael Burry, an MD turned investment broker. We're not told what kind of doctor he is, but to through Wall Street like that he must be a proctologist. In the kingdom of the willfully blind the one-eyed man is king. <br/><br/>In contrast, the Standard and Poor exec who reluctantly admits the bond ratings are sham wears dark wraparound shades, that express her inscrutability and compromised vision. <br/><br/>At least three — Burry, Mark Baum and Ben Rickert — are idealists, with an earnest desire to see justice served on the corrupt banks. Charlie Geller and Jaimie Shipley are spirited young hustlers itching to crack the closed game. <br/><br/>Our interest in the five engaging men gives this economics lesson a real hook. The human drama brings the financial story to life. Adding to the film's humour and wild spirit, director Adam McKay tosses in comic inserts. In a bubble bath a sexy champagne-sipping blonde explains one matter of high finance, a famous chef another. To distance itself from its corrupt characters, sometimes a character admits to the camera that a scene didn't really happen the way it's being played. Sometimes for emphasis he tells us that an outrageous scene actually happened that way. This reminds us we're watching a story more truthful than the usual ""based on"" fictionalization. This is our financial system and government at ""work.""<br/><br/>The montage of shots from the media, from a tent city, from activities across the American social spectrum, make a key point about this bursting of the mortgage bubble. The drama didn't happen in isolation, however detached the moneymen may be. As the retired Rickert reminds his two celebrating colleagues, the social collapse inherent in the short-sellers' success means thousands will lose their jobs, their homes, their pensions, their futures, their families and lives. The mortgage bubble didn't happen in a bubble but with wide-ranging and real, tragic consequences for thousands of innocents. The cultural references remind us that the cut-throat capitalism we see here is not a freakish exception but indeed an essential element of the capitalist culture. <br/><br/>Indeed the film packages the dense information and historic reconstruction as a very human story, primarily through our engagement with the characters, but also through the comic play in the additional material. The sombre subject matter closes with the ominous warning that the same corrupt practice continues, with no reform to the economic system and virtually no punishment for the fraudulent bankers whose greed almost destroyed the world economy. But the human stories, the jokes, the rich vein of visual material, make this tragedy feel almost comic. The film doesn't change the economic fraud or end the greed, but it makes the hard lesson not just palatable but a pleasure. <br/><br/>Perhaps the film's key justification is the quote from Mark Twain: ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" Now we know how wrong our trust was in our economic system, in our banks and our brokers, and in the government that's supposed to place the common weal ahead of its rich friends'. <br/><br/>From novelist Haruki Murakami comes the climactic resignation: ""Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come."" Bernie Sanders must love this film."
"howard.schumann","9","19","26","3 January 2016"," A fast-paced ride filled with fascinating personalities
","When everything in your life is looking rosy, there is always someone who will tell you that your happiness is on shaky ground. Though most of the time these nay-sayers will not profit from your misfortune, such is not the case in The Big Short, Adam McKay's (""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"") hard-hitting comedy/drama about the collapse of the housing market in 2008. Based on the book ""The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine"" (2010) by Michael Lewis with a screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph (""Love and Other Drugs""), the film centers on a group of Wall Street functionaries who, despite the industry, government, and media telling them otherwise, discover that the market for bonds based on subprime mortgages is on shaky grounds and is doomed to collapse.<br/><br/>Supported by an outstanding ensemble cast that includes triple A-rated performers like Brad Pitt (""By the Sea"") Christian Bale (""Knight of Cups""), Steve Carell (""Foxcatcher""), and Ryan Gosling (""Only God Forgives""), McKay takes highly complex material and molds it into an involving narrative that follows three sets of characters, each running on parallel paths, all intent with cashing in on the system at the expense of the average citizen. The film is narrated by Ryan Gosling who explains at the beginning that our picture of bankers as stolid and conservative citizens no longer fits the reality. They have gone, he says, ""from the country club to the strip club."" Like Michael Burry (Bale), they even go barefoot, sport a glass eye, listen to heavy metal music and are not the least concerned with what passes for social graces. Burry examines thousands of individual mortgages and realizes that a large number of subprime housing mortgages are ""junk"" and will collapse sooner rather than later. With no purpose in mind other than to benefit financially from the expected bursting of the housing bubble, Burry puts over a billion dollars of his company's money into what are known as ""credit default swaps,"" an agreement insuring the buyer in the event of a loan default, in essence, betting against not only the housing market but the American economy.<br/><br/>These investments, disparaged by the banks, come to the attention of Jared Vennett (Gosling), a subprime mortgage bond manager who goes into business with hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Carell). Baum, still mourning the recent suicide of his brother is, in many ways, the film's most interesting character - abrasive and bullying, yet honest with a fine-tuned BS detector. The business also proves interesting to young investors Charles Geller (John Magaro, ""Carol"") and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock, ""The Submarine Kid""), who recruit the knowledgeable ex-banker Ben Rickert (Pitt) to use his connections to help them work directly with the banks.<br/><br/>At one point, Baum's team investigate a housing subdivision in Florida where they find out that many homes are in foreclosure, that mortgages were bought using the name of the family dog, and a stripper owns five homes with variable rate mortgages. Baum shudders when some young brokers tell him how they have made millions by selling subprime mortgages to the poor and to unsuspecting immigrants. To add more spice to proceedings, McKay uses celebrities talking directly to the camera in order to explain the complicated terminology used by bankers to make sure the average person has no idea what's going on.<br/><br/>Provocatively sitting in a bubble bath and drinking champagne, actress Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") explains the ins-and-outs of mortgage-backed securities, while TV food personality Anthony Bourdain compares an unappetizing seafood stew with banks who market bad mortgages as a triple-A rated financial product. There is also a clever demonstration at a casino gambling table using actress Selena Gomez (""Behaving Badly"") to show how Credit Default Obligations (CDOs), the bundling of bad mortgages, can lead to layers and layers of speculation. The three groups of characters cross paths at the American Securities Forum in Las Vegas where it soon becomes evident that the housing market is built on fraud and the banks are massively concealing the worthlessness of their holdings.<br/><br/>The Big Short is one of the best films of the year, a fast-paced ride filled with fascinating personalities that entertains even when it infuriates. The mood only turns dark when you realize that the stakes are bigger than winning a game of Monopoly, bigger than who was right and who was wrong. When the market collapses in 2008 sending the economy into a tailspin, it is Rickert who points out to anyone left who still cares that the consequences for real people are not the loss of stocks but the loss of their homes, their livelihood, and, in some cases, their lives. Not to worry, though, it's not personal, just business."

","As a person who understands how this housing bubble burst (not affected personally) - this is a well told story. The acting is great - the inserts of a chef explaining things, and a pop star - very interesting tactic. The individual characters are all well acted and developed. Many people do not get that the banks play games with the average person - as it says at the end of the movie - they just use different words for their products. The main focus of the bank is to make money - not help the consumer and this was rampant in the 90's. People need a place to live - do not put down your income-or lack of. Leave some of the questions blank - no one will care by the time it gets passed off and passed off and passed off and approved. ARM's - to me an automatic money maker for the mortgage holder and not the homeowner - oh that is right the mortgage holder owns the home.

You have a perfect storm. I am NOT a Brad Pitt fan, however, he puts in a solid performance. Steven Carrell (sp) is one of my favorites because he brings it. He brought it in The Office (TV), Brad Almighty, Foxcatcher, and now - The Big Short. He carried the movie well.

Mostly funny. Ultimately bleak."
"bob-the-movie-man","9","16","23","31 January 2016"," Gripping and original - one of the films of the year so far
","The Big Short is not an easy film to watch on a number of levels. At a basic level, and speaking as a pretty well-educated film-goer, it requires quite considerable concentration to keep up with the financial jargon thrown at you. At a sociological level, the fraud and corruption that were endemic within the venerable institutions portrayed is just unbelievable. And at a personal level, as someone who lost big time when a property deal in Florida went South, some of the scenes are physically painful. But I was lucky in comparison: my loss was 'just' money. Many millions of Americans and then, through the global recession, many millions more around the world lost their jobs and their homes through the ensuing collapse. And for many, that led to loss of life.<br/><br/>It's 2005 and Christian Bale plays Dr Michael Burry, a character whose manner suggests he might be high on the autistic scale. Burry appears to be solely in the driving seat of a huge investment fund - in itself, a surprising fact. Burry sees what no one else has seen - that the whole of the US mortgage market is built on a lie; a lie that the banks and even the supposedly independent financial ratings companies are complicit in for their own short-term gains. Burry is effectively the small boy laughing at the emperor's new clothes: but going beyond that, he bets all of his company's investments on that radical view.<br/><br/>We also follow two parallel but unconnected groups chasing the same bet after hearing of Burry's ideas: struggling broker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) brings the proposition to a team led by Mark Baum (Steve Carell). Baum is a disillusioned and self-righteous professional struggling with his own personal tragedy. On investigating the depth of the crisis, Baum progresses through incredulity to increasing anger; and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) are two up-and-coming youngsters who team with grizzled and retired veteran trader Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) to help leverage their limited funds into the game.<br/><br/>The chips are down and as the financial world turns increasingly toxic there are two questions to answer: a) who blinks first between the serried ranks of the institutions, desperate to maintain the status quo, and the maverick brokers; and b) when the music stops, will there actually be any pot left to win? The director is Adam McKay (""Anchorman"", ""The Other Guys"") and his style is both quirky and brilliant - well deserving of his place among the Oscar contenders. We keep breaking away from the action to get insightful explanations from some surprising people (some who make it extremely difficult to concentrate on the message!). The fourth wall is constantly being broken to comic effect, particularly by Gosling who is a pseudo-narrator at times. This is a dangerous ploy for a movie, as this type of narration can be highly irritating to an audience (e.g. as in ""Joy"" and ""Jersey Boys""), but here it works brilliantly. Clever interweaving of newsreel and media footage, and some extremely sharp editing (a well deserved Oscar nomination for Hank Corwin) add to the magic.<br/><br/>The script by Adam McKay and Charles Randolph (gaining another Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay) makes an impossibly complex concept more accessible without resorting to Sorkin-levels of verbosity.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, surely one of the most unpredictable and charismatic actors today, is also in contention for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but that belies the stupidity of these categories: who is the ""Lead"" actor in a film like this? Outside of that debate this is a film which, as for ""Spotlight"", could be considered for an award for ""ensemble cast"". In a movie with great cameos from the likes of Melissa Leo, Karen Gillan (""Dr Who"") and Marisa Tomei, it is Steve Carrell in particular who stands out as a dramatic force, following up the impact he made in last year's ""Foxcatcher"".<br/><br/>An extremely entertaining, yet intellectually demanding film, this is a one deserving of multiple watches to help unpeel the onion of understanding. The year is yet young, but this rates as one of my films of the year so far.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks)."
"vsks","10","9","12","5 January 2016"," Wall Street still won't take the blame; movie shows why the should
","Five stars for this comedy-drama based on the best-selling Michael Lewis book about the 2008 financial crisis and the lonely voices in the wilderness calling, ""Housing bubble,"" ""Housing bubble,"" ""This will end baaaadleeee."" The idea that mortgage-backed securities could be anything other than rock solid so went against conventional wisdom that no one listened. But, as we know now, these securities had become more and more vulnerable as riskier loans were bundled into them, and the chaff soon outweighed the wheat. It takes a bit of understanding about how this financial market operated to grasp the significance of the action. Director Adam McKay, who wrote the screenplay with Lewis and Charles Randolph, cleverly provides the necessary background, having characters break the fourth wall to speak directly to the audience. For example, from her symbolic bubble bath and sipping champagne, actress Margot Robbie tells us what a financial bubble actually means. It's "" a terrifically enjoyable movie that leaves you in a state of rage, nausea and despair,"" says A.O. Scott in his New York Times review, which includes a clip from McKay on some of the clever ways the film explains the financial goings-on. The cast does an exemplary job of embuing characters with strong personalities. Christian Bale plays Dr. Michael Burry, a loner physician-turned-hedge-fund-manager who figures out the problem early (and whose character confirms my aversion to heavy metal music). He takes the unprecedented step of actually looking at the individual mortgages bundled into the securities being offered and sees that many of them are weak and involve adjustable rate loans. When their interest rates go up, the homeowners will default. This, to him is an investment opportunity; he'll bet against the mortgage market. The banks are happy to back his scheme (involving credit default swaps), seeing it as a sure-fire winner for them. One of the banks he approaches has on staff a skeptical analyst, played by Ryan Gosling, who believes the good doctor may just be right. He convinces the unconventional trading firm led by Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to invest in the swaps, too. In one of the movie's funniest sequences, Baum sends staff to Florida to investigate some of these mortgages. They find unbuilt houses, a forest of ""for sale"" signs, and two beach-bum mortgage brokers (Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen) , who don't hesitate to say they will insure basically anything. ""Why are they confessing?"" Baum whispers to his staffer. ""They're not confessing. They're bragging,"" he replies. Similarly, Melissa Leo, as an official at an investment rating agency, is badgered into explaining how, if her firm rated investments accurately, the banks would just take their business down the street. In a Colorado garage, another pair of youthful investors (played by John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) wants to parlay $30 million into a bigger fortune. They set out to New York to figure out how. There they stumble onto the real estate problem and see the credit default swaps as their big chance, but they need connections, and they get help from their neighbor back home, a disenchanted former investment banker (Brad Pitt). It's telling that the few people who foresaw and took advantage of the inevitable crisis were all, one way or another, Wall Street outsiders. They weren't unaware that their gains were made on the backs of everyday Americans who lost billions in housing value, jobs and homes, pension fund value, and savings. Meanwhile, the many individuals and institutions whose carelessness, greed, or criminality created the bubble in the first place have not been called to account. No less an expert than Paul Krugman has written, ""I think (the movie) does a terrific job of making Wall Street skulduggery entertaining, of exploiting the inherent black humor of how it went down."" And, even more important, he says it ""got the underlying economic, financial, and political story right."" And it's still a story lots of people don't want Americans to hear."

","Wow! I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that entertained the way that The Big Short managed to. Somehow while sitting there I learned a 1,000 things I had no clue happened during the housing market collapse of 08, while laughing out load every 15 minutes and feeling like I was going to throw up during others. I love movies where the underdog wins or in this case is right. I love movies where the underdog gets rich even more. I don't know that I can say that any of those types of movies have ever taught me anything important about recent history. Erin Brockovich might be the last one that even came close and that story did not impact the world the way the housing market collapse did. <br/><br/>The acting was amazing! Ryan Gosling and Christian Bale hit it out of the park. Steve Carell who I have never been able to see as anyone other than Michael from the office gave the best performance of his life. Overall this was a stroke of genius in casting. The only criticism I can give would have to be with the shaky, unfocused single camera approach that they took with shooting this film. It is just not my cup of tea. It looks cheap and annoys me. Sure this was supposed to be a documentary style type of a thing where the characters break the fourth wall every chance they are given, but still. I hate it and I always will. You can thank Cloverfield for that. <br/><br/>Overall this was a great way to kick off 2016 at the movies.

And what they are talking about is that the entire world economy is a big giant self serving fraud.<br/><br/>The amazing cast of the film is not only great at acting, but clearly motivated by the subject of the movie. People like Steve Carell that are acting all seriously and angry, people like Christian Bale playing the role of a semi-autistic number cruncher, people like Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling in secondary roles with a lot of - basically - cameos from actors that clearly want to make a statement.<br/><br/>The statement is at the end, when one banker from Swiss is the only one who is put in jail, while people are bailing out the banks that started and continued this disgusting system, while losing their jobs and houses in the process.<br/><br/>But more than that, I loved the way the movie was created. It is a well done movie, from script to editing and soundtrack. I loved the scene where for dramatic purposes two guys find a very important information on the ground, discarded and ignored, then one turns to the screen and says ""it didn't actually happen like this, but like that"" and then they go on.<br/><br/>Watch it. You will not understand most of what they are talking about, but it is not necessary. You will not want to hear it, because it sounds fantastic, but it is real. Unfortunately, you also have nothing you can do about it."

","Director Adam McKay has a very unique style of filmmaking. You'll probably love it or hate it, with little in-between. For me, his crazy antics work perfectly in ""The Big Short"", telling the story of the 2008 housing crisis and subsequent Wall Street meltdown.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how Wall Street investors and bankers created a housing bubble that essentially broke the economy. Ostensibly narrated by the Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) character, it also focuses on Mark Baum (Steve Carell), an investor betting against the ""common practice"" for his own profit, and Michael Burry (Christian Bale), another man doing the same but who initially discovered the housing market being propped up by smoke and mirrors.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a straight-forward, ultra-dramatic treatise on the subject, you've come to the wrong place. As I mentioned, McKay just doesn't do things that way. Instead, you'll find characters breaking the fourth wall (turning to talk to the audience), dance breaks, freeze-frames, celebrity cameos, and all other manners of craziness. Instead of being distracting, though, these interludes instead always serve to illustrate a particular point. This is still a comprehensive tale of the housing collapse, but just without the rigidity or serious nature usually reserved for such ""event biopics"", if you will.<br/><br/>What really helps pull off McKay's vision is the incredible cast, led by Gosling, Bale, and Carell. Those three alone are enough to carry the weight, but even the supporting players provide interesting character opportunities. Add in the humor, music, and genre-defying format that McKay presents, and there's a lot of reasons to get sucked into the proceedings.<br/><br/>Perhaps most impressive, however, is that this film will leave you with a lot to think about in terms of who were the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" in the entire scenario. Things are far from black-and-white in this case, and McKay does a great job of portraying those tensions. Even the characters (like Bale's) set up as ""heroes"" to begin with only do so by exploiting the very market they inevitably save (albeit through near-total economic collapse).<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Big Short"" is an excellent film that successfully recounts a real-life story in a supremely entertaining fashion without being too serious or too over-the-top (though it does come close on that latter front a few times!). This is probably even better than the more recent McKay project ""Vice"", as nothing feels quite so personal here. If you want the sub-prime montage scandal explained to you in a quasi-understandable way while at the same time being entertained in nearly every scene, ""The Big Short"" is the film for you."
"derektetlow-459-856509","5","22","38","10 July 2016"," Entertaining, but tells only part of the truth
","The Big Short is a very entertaining and enjoyable film to watch. The acting is top notch, it's got some great humor, it's fair share of dramatic sequences, and the characters describing complex financial instruments was both funny and a very creative way to get the point across. For sheer entertainment value I would give it a 9.<br/><br/>However, I'm afraid this film is blatantly guilty of the crime of omission. The obvious tone that was set throughout the picture was that the only reason for the financial meltdown of 2007 was due solely to greed, corporate malfeasance, and outright corruption when it came to the housing market. No doubt all those were indeed factors in the financial crisis, but there were a whole host of other contributors that the film conveniently leaves out.<br/><br/>One of the first things I noticed that was left out of this film was the fact that the US government played a very large role in the 2007 financial meltdown - this was never mentioned anywhere in the movie. There were a few mild references to the SEC (our supposed government financial watchdog) in the film, but you really had to be paying attention to catch it and they were very insignificant. If you didn't know any better, if you'd never done any objective reading on the 2007 financial crisis, and you took this movie purely at face value, you would've thought the huge 2007 mess was all caused by greedy right- wing corporations out to make a buck any way they could. This angle is only partially true. <br/><br/>There were some bad actors in the corporate and financial arena when it came to the housing market, yes, but The Big Short makes it seem like every financial corporation and financial corporate employee was out to screw your average American who just wanted to own a home - it's just simply not true!<br/><br/>Not to give a massive financial history lesson here, but the government contributed in the following ways to the 2007 crash: 1) cheap money, 2) very low interest rates for too long, 3) the Community Reinvestment Act (forced banks to lower their lending standards, especially to minorities and poor Americans), 4) promoting quasi-government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (they loaded up on sub-prime mortgages), 5) very bad fiscal policy, and 6) loosening of the lending standards for mortgages. Each one of these aforementioned factors is complicated and not easy to explain, yet The Big Short never mentions ANY of these ANYWHERE in the film.<br/><br/>Another thing that was bothersome is that this film attempts to portray the borrowers of these sub-prime loans as just poor suckers who got taken advantage of at the hands of everyone from the banks all the way down to the greedy real estate agents. There is one scene where an exotic dancer admits she owns five houses and a condo all financed with sub-prime mortgages. I'm sorry, but to make it look like these people had guns held to their heads to take out these loans and that they weren't taking advantage of the real estate boom themselves is disingenuous at best. <br/><br/>If you want to watch a good movie for two hours of entertainment, then I think you will enjoy The Big Short. But if you're looking for a docu-drama style film that explores all angles of what happened back in 2007, then this movie falls miserably short."

","I would've given The Big Short an 8/10 if I just understood it better. I definitely get its premise and focus, and the ultimate plot, but I don't quite grasp the mechanics of the situation. This is in no way the film's fault, this one is purely on me.<br/><br/>For instance, when the movie ended, Michael Burry went to his board and wrote; +489%. I thought what had happened was, even though Burry was right, sadly because of the Bank Institutions Fraud, his $1.3 Billion investment dwindled to $489 Million (there is an email he sends), in a scrabble to sell off Swaps he purchased, thus perhaps dropping the value of the Hedge Fund to around -55%, especially since the Fund just kept losing more and more value due to the payments Burry had to make to those banks. But then underneath, was the $2.69 Billion total profit. So, is he closing down the Fund because the business murders ones soul or is he leaving because he lost, though cheated. There were many other points that maybe were a bit much for me to grasp, however, that is a plus for me with this particular film; it got me so invested, I wanted to understand every bit of it.<br/><br/>The Big Short is, the type of eye opener that makes one wonder if maybe, this is now finally being exposed, as a strategy to hiding an even bigger agenda. Get us to focus on something that happened so many years ago, to get our eyes off what's starting to happen now. In a nutshell, The Big Short awakens paranoia. Is that a good thing? As a film, definitely.<br/><br/>Christian Bale just blew me away. I loved Gosling, Pitt, Carell and even Magaro and Wittrock, but Bale, was amazing. Honestly, Carell too was amazing. The writing, the story, the directing, absolutely stunning. All this time (prior to watching the movie) I thought the main characters are all in this together, just to find that they're not... But, they are.<br/><br/>""They knew. They knew the taxpayer would bail them out. They weren't stupid, they just didn't care"". That is just too, too profound. It's not a script. It's not fiction. This, actually, happened, in the very reality in which we exist.<br/><br/>This film is possibly an 8 and above out of ten, but, there were parts that I didn't understand, again, not because the film fell short, but rather because my knowledge lacked. So, 7.5/10.<br/><br/>P.S. Michael continues to flex his ability to foresee impending doom. A water crisis is not a movie anymore, it's happening, it's now. To me, to you, IMDb, United States to South Africa, from Paramount to all of us. Burry is not wrong... He is a genius. Ben Rickert too, is on to something."
"billcr12","8","6","8","14 February 2016"," Complicated
","The Big Short uses comedy to try to explain the credit default swap fiasco which culminated in the mortgage crisis of 2008. Christian Bale is excellent as the real life hedge fund manager who besides being a doctor is a wizard of Wall Street. Dr. Berry figured out years before the collapse that the mortgage industry was mostly fraudulent and being covered up by the big banks and the bond rating agencies. He figured out a way to bet that the bubble would burst, and he was correct. It can be a bit difficult to follow, but writer-director McKay uses cameos by Selena Gomez and a world famous chef to explain some of the esoteric financial terms. The cast, led by Bale, and reinforced by the always good Steve Carrell and Melissa Leo, is uniformly excellent. The topic is interesting and by the end of the movie, you will be infuriated by a completely corrupt political and financial system."
"davidstillson-493-816310","10","14","23","17 December 2015"," Excellent Masterpiece
","I just want to say that this movie blew me away. As a person who was personally affected by the housing crash, this was a very poignant film. I had an advantage going into this movie, because I knew a lot about how sub-prime mortgages were sold in bundles to investors. However, the film does a wonderful job of breaking down the financial ""jargon"" so everyone can understand. In other words, you don't need to be an amateur economist like myself to thoroughly enjoy and grasp the story.<br/><br/>I think this is an important film that everyone should see. If nothing else, you will get a very in-depth dramatic representation/explanation of just exactly what went so terribly wrong in 2007."
"HEFILM","5","48","99","10 January 2016"," convoluted
","Famous writer director, Bill Wilder said if you are telling a complicated story you have to tell it in a simple way. He was right. This film wants to be funny and savvy and meaningful those are all great goals but it doesn't really achieve them. The story telling is as spastic as the camera-work is jerky, and the more it tries to make the back room dealings of corrupt banks make sense the less it does.<br/><br/>Another key thing is that our main characters goals are to profit from the impending doom of the economy and though a few moments are supposed to make us care about them we really don't. They still come off as amoral socially odd business men out to make bank so why do we care? We don't.<br/><br/>The attempts at hip comedy fail and are distracting--characters suddenly talking to the camera--directly to the audience, celebrity cameos trying to explain what's going on. These are just distractions. I guess they wanted an almost Michael Moore type vibe but in a more fictional type presentation. It's especially frantic on the big screen almost headache inducing during some of the 20 sec flash cut montage scenes that keep popping up.<br/><br/>It's great the director wanted to go for a ""real"" movie, that he doesn't succeed is too bad. A for effort as they say does not mean he gets an A."
"srdjan_veljkovic","8","9","14","2 January 2016"," A great explanation of the mechanics of the financial crisis of 2007/08
","This movie is best seen as an explanation of how the financial markets crashed in 2007/2008. It is very well done, and not just because it's Margot Robbie doing (some of the) explanation in a bubble-bath.<br/><br/>Other than that, it is funny at times, tries to make you care about some of the characters (like Steve Carrel's character and his relationships with his wife and brother), but, actually, all that is for its main purpose - the explanation. A dull explanation of all of this, with some charts, would not have done a good job. It would feel dry and detached. I actually tried doing the ""required"" reading on this a few years ago and just gave up - for someone not in the financial industry, it's just way too much unknowns to grasp in a short time.<br/><br/>It is also nice that it doesn't try to be preachy or condemning. Things are as they are. If you learn that you shouldn't trust your banker and/or financial adviser just because they wear nice suits, have great hair and a good education, that's good. But, if you don't, that's fine too. Also, about your banker, she's just trying to make a living, she didn't invent the system. She should find some honest work instead, though."

"ahassan-12342","8","4","5","28 June 2016"," Quirky but educational insight into the financial crash
","Adam McKay is certainly no stranger to satire with the Anchorman films and Saturday Night Live to his name. Interestingly, he also considers The Other Guys as a satirical work and though I loved that film, I can't say that I saw it that way. This time he tries his hand at satirising the financial crash of 2007-08 in a film based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Michael Lewis. In the most entertaining way, the film depicts the greed and stupidity of banks which led to the suffering of millions of people by preying on their dream of owning their own home.<br/><br/>The film is unique in a number of ways. Firstly, there are no heroes in this. The protagonists in the film are bankers themselves and by betting against the economy, their financial gain leads to many millions suffering. However, the film alludes that they are not just doing this for personal gain but to punish the banks for their hubris and so at least we can cheer them on for that. Its a strange film in that we know exactly how it ends yet it's enthralling nonetheless.<br/><br/>At times it was shot in a mockumentary style- a one-camera setup similarly seen in the The Office- and this technique works as it reminds you that the events that occur on-screen actually happened. The film does not pull many punches when it comes to using financial language and while I struggled at times to keep up with what is meant by a CDO, you can understand the overall arc of the story. Where it struggles to work for me is the Family Guy-esque cut scenes like Margot Robbie in a bathtub explaining complicated financial terms. Particularly as there are so few female characters, scenes like that are especially not funny. The other was the breaking of the fourth wall by characters speaking to camera. The film was thoroughly engrossing but gimmicks like that ruined the moment at times.<br/><br/>Despite this, it is an entertaining and informative take on one of the most stupidest moments in human history."
"jtncsmistad","9","4","5","22 May 2016"," ""The Big Short"" is long on all the gory details and lotsa fast-paced entertainment!
","I had heard that Director Adam McKay (""Anchorman"", ""Anchorman 2"") takes the colossally complicated details of the catastrophic 2007 U.S. housing crash and parcels out the grim details to the audience of his extraordinary film ""The Big Short"" in unusually palatable ways. As soon as I saw the fetching Margot Robbie explaining a portion of these perplexing particulars while enjoying a bubble bath and drinking champagne served from a (no doubt most grateful) butler, McKay had me eating up what he was serving with just a big ass appreciative spoon! <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is a two-hour-plus dissection of and dissertation on greed and unspeakable institutional incompetence and arrogance that succeeds in never once feeling as if it is dragging on. Not an easy trick to pull off. And all credit for doing so, and in stunningly spectacular fashion, goes to McKay's snappy style and breakneck pace working in seamless tandem with flawless ensemble performances from the superstar stable of Bale, Carell, Gosling and Pitt. Each actor absolutely nails their real-life character here as they collectively make a financial killing at the expense of the American homeowner and right under the clueless upturned noses of the nation's banking and mortgage industries along with a feeble federal government.<br/><br/>Any film that can (and almost without realizing it is happening) have you veritably rooting for these self-serving guys who see themselves as merely taking advantage of an insidiously flawed system whose pompous proprietors are fast asleep at the wheel is doing something right.<br/><br/>Even if nearly everyone involved in this seedy story is doing practically nothing but dead wrong."
"muhammedelgammal_","9","4","5","27 April 2016"," How the people were screwed
","This is one movie that almost everyone can relate to because it somehow impacted each of us in different ways. This movie is based on the events that led up to the housing market crash in the year 2008.<br/><br/>This really gave an inside look at what the bankers and investors on Wall Street were doing in order to fulfill their own personal financial gain at the expense of the people of the nation. Bankers were approving a significant increased amount in subprime mortgages, and the bankers knew that those subprime mortgages were going to default. But that did not matter to them because the bankers got their bonuses for each signing; once the mortgage defaulted, the bank gets the house back and could do it all over again.<br/><br/>But as the amount of subprime mortgages increased, investors began to recognize an opportunity of arbitrage (basically to make a substantial amount of money in an extremely short period of time). So investors, also knowing that these subprime mortgages would default, were bundling them up in groups and selling them as bonds. Then, still knowing they were going to default, they would bet against them. The process continued, and continued, and kept on escalating. There were billions upon billions of dollars being gambled with, and it was all at the cost of the middle class.<br/><br/>After all that, the market crash was inevitable, and it happened. Millions of people lost their homes, jobs, and pensions. All that chaos of 2008 that the people suffered from and many still are, and it is all because of the greedy and unethical bankers and investors of Wall Street.<br/><br/>This movie did a great job showing what the bankers and investors were doing. It briefly showed what happened to the people, but it was discussed all throughout the movie."
"Hitchcoc","9","4","5","24 April 2016"," So Much Greed/So Little Compassion
","I have to admit that I don't understand all the intricacies of the bond markets that were being manipulated here. Whether one is a Wall Street maven or not isn't the issue. The fact is that people sold mortgages to others who had no business getting into them. I recall a 60 Minutes report on the bubble before the crash took place. The expert had them drive through a desert area, filled with enormous houses, all of which were in default. If one looked in the windows of these, you could see that some of the tenants had stripped all kinds of fixtures and walked away. There were two types of buyers, it seemed. Those that were trying for the fast buck and those that really had no clue what they were getting into. The balloon mortgages took them from affordable to bankruptcy. This was unsustainable and it wasn't long before the banks found themselves with armloads of houses and buyers with hopeless debt. The guys in the movie are aware, but, for the most part, aren't all that sympathetic to these foibles. They go in to make money and they manage to do it. The whole thing that overrides this entire film is that all the evidence was right there, but the greed of most of the parties supersedes all of that. I thought this was a fine movie with a superb lesson. To the new generation. You may not be entitled to have whatever you want without paying your dues."

A brief cut to Margot Robbie to explain technical details, was undeniably the lowest point, a sort of try-hard tactic, which left the audience feeling a little patronised.

Ryan Gosling narrators how this discovery was made and how these few people were able to profit off of a devastating event for so many people. The language in this film is advanced and includes many complicated business acronyms. However to ensure that everyone could understand and relate to the film the director, Adam McKay creates comic relief. When a new complicated concept was introduced the camera cuts to a celebrity (Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez etc.) who then explains the concept in simpler terms. Also Ryan Gosling's narration provides comic relief amidst the confusing and complicated plot. I believe that this film is not only creative and intriguing, more importantly it is the untold story of the corrupt economy in our country.

It is kinetic and absorbing, it is self conscious, it breaks the fourth wall, but it is never over bearing or excessive as something like ""Wolf of Wall street"" was. It always gives you everything in the right dose and keeps you stuck and enchanted to the screen for its whole duration.<br/><br/>This film is one that truly succeeds because of the greatness of the sum of its parts, molded into one big flowing narrative that is kept together by fantastic work by Adam McKay.

Now I am the first that loves and praises filmmakers for trusting their audience, and they certainly do here and it pays off. Yet, I think there is a limit to everything and whilst the film never made me feel stupid nor did I ever fall behind to what was going on thanks to the narrative, there would be a scene once in a while where I would just phase out completely. People would just start talking numbers and names and would never stop for the scene and I have to admit that I would have like to get a little deeper understanding of some of the parts.<br/><br/>Still, I understand how difficult it must have been just to put forward some of these concepts and I applaud the filmmakers for it.

In this case it was Cousin Samie instead... who ended up in bed with you know who. The movie is full of good metaphors like that. Apparently, of all people, only a young man figured out what was going to happen early on. His name is Michael Burry. All the Big Wise Men didn't, or didn't want to. We'll never know. As a footnote, Michael Burry wrote an op-ed in the NYT in 2010 asking the Big Question. Within a month he got a visit from the FBI and four audits, probably IRS, SEC, etc. You'd think Uncle Sam would want to hire him instead."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Since there are so few subjects more hilarious than the 2008 financial crisis, let's get the writer/director of Anchorman and Step Brothers to adapt the Michael Lewis best-selling book. OK, so it's improbable that was the thought process, but kudos to whomever was responsible for bringing Adam McKay to the project. Before you go assuming it's a poor fit, it should be noted that McKay is also one of the creative minds behind ""Funny or Die"", a site filled with political and social satire. It's that satirical approach that makes this explanation of what went wrong so accessible to the masses. Make no mistake  this is entertaining and educational and thought-provoking and nauseating and infuriating and funny and disheartening.<br/><br/>If the film were described as a tutorial on MBS (Mortgage-backed Securities), CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligations), Credit Default Swaps, Tranches, Bond Ratings, and Sub-Prime ARMs, most people's eyes would glaze over and they would keep skimming for showtimes of other new movie releases. In truth, it is those things – and so much more. This is the story of how the housing market collapsed leading the government to the massive bailout that saved some of our largest financial institutions  and how a small group of people recognized what was happening and literally bet against the U.S. economy. It follows the bread crumbs to re-assemble the slow process of spotting the fault in the analysis that lead to massive corruption that finally crossed over into systematic fraud  and does so by using creative presentation approaches like a Bond Rating game of Jenga, and celebrity snippets for definitions and examples.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling stars as Jared Vennett (based on Greg Lippmann), a slick Deutsche Bank trader who acts as our guide through the muck of shorting securitized mortgages, while simultaneously working the system for his personal benefit. He works with Mark Baum (a character based on Steve Eisman, played by Steve Carell) who manages FrontPoint Partners, and Baum's team played by Rafe Spall, Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong (whom you might remember as Lee Harvey Oswald in Parkland). While this is going on, there are two other similar story lines we are following. The first is Christian Bale playing hedge fund manager and savant analyst Dr. Michael Burry at Scion Hedge Fund. Burry is often cited as the first to recognize the impending collapse and invest against the market. Finally, we have the ""garage band"" investment company based on Cornwall Capital run by (names changed) Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Gellar (John Magaro) with a big boost from former trader Ben Rickert (played by Brad Pitt in a role based on Ben Hockett). The stellar cast is rounded out by Marisa Tomei as Baum's concerned wife, Tracy Letts as the head of Scion, Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen who play cocky and clueless subprime mortgage brokers, and Melissa Leo who plays a Standard & Poor's employee.<br/><br/>It's difficult to tell this story without casting blame, and few escape the wrath of Lewis, McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph. Those absorbing shots to the bow include: the Federal Reserve, the SEC, Rating Agencies, big Banks and Investment firms, Fund Managers, Traders, Realtors, and Mortgage Brokers. Companies specifically named include JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, WAMU, Option One, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and The Wall Street Journal. The point made is that the problem goes/went beyond greed, and is/was truly system-wide, with each segment protecting themselves and their turf. Somehow the name Barney Frank is not mentioned, and FNMA and FHLMC escape mostly unscathed, while CRA lending requirements are not discussed. It's not politically correct (and not mentioned here) to question why so many borrowers who couldn't pay their rent regularly accepted loans that they knowingly couldn't afford to repay. But that's a topic for another time.<br/><br/>With full disclosure, I will admit to having been in the mortgage business for 18 years. Though I was never involved with subprime loans, I will always disagree with the stance that the industry and institutions were not aware of the risk and impending collapse. It was common knowledge that ""no doc"" loans were absurd, and the adjustable rate schedules and prepayment penalties for subprime (and some conventional) loans were beyond impractical and more like homicidal (from a lending perspective). In the film, Baum interviews an exotic dancer who owns multiple homes  all loans made with minimal documentation due to the cash basis of her business. The terms of the loans set her, and other similar borrowers, up for financial ruin  right along with the housing sector and economy. The subprime mortgage brokers portrayed by Max Greenfield and Billy Magnussen may seem cartoonish, but Baum's confusion with their ""confession"" versus ""bragging"" is spot on. There were many just like these two clowns who considered themselves ""rock stars"", when in fact, there were really ""bartenders who now own a boat"". These weren't the type to question whether the loans made sense  only how many could they close to pad their 5 and 6 figure per month income levels. Of course, in defense of these morons, it was the banks and lenders who designed the loan programs to ""feed the machine"" with more and by necessity, higher risk loans  to the point where it was no longer possible to spread the risk wide enough for protection. Hence, the collapse.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, you should expect to have a headache and feel quite cynical towards the system. Despite the humor interjected by quick-hit segments from Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdoin, the seriousness of the topics is more than bubble baths, blackjack and fish stew. The film leaves us angry and nauseous from what happened in 2008, but more importantly questioning  Has anything changed? Have we learned anything? These answers are likely to cause a more sickening reaction than looking back seven years."

","'The Big Short' fascinated me into seeing it without hesitation, had always wanted to see it but it took me a while to get a chance to do so. Have a lot of respect for any film that takes on complex serious subjects that absolutely should be portrayed and the talented cast. While the awards attention (particularly for the script) and critical acclaim (almost universal) interested me further. Plus it looked good. <br/><br/>Good 'The Big Short' indeed was. Very good in fact and while it was not quite perfect it is deserving of the acclaim it got and still gets. Not quite one of the best films of the year for me but very close, with the good things being many and being exceptional in quality. 'The Big Short' took on a subject that needed to be told and holds relevance today and found myself admiring how it approached it while also making something of very high quality as an overall film.<br/><br/>Structurally, 'The Big Short' can get a little complicated and not always easy to follow. Never incoherent as such, just sometimes not always as clear as it could have been.<br/><br/>It definitely would have benefitted from doing less than it did, perhaps not having as much going on and having less characters.<br/><br/>However, 'The Big Short' is well-made with mostly slick photography, despite the odd shakiness that distracts a little, and a fine eye for detail. Furthermore it is smartly directed, keeping things involving throughout the over two hour length, paced in a way that it doesn't feel that long and one is not feeling the seconds.<br/><br/>All the cast are terrific and embody their characters instead of just playing them. Christian Bale's confident quirky performance rightly garnered him an Oscar nomination and Ryan Gosling has one of the film's more challenging roles and essential to anchoring it and he is suitably despicable, not a side we see much from him and it was both interesting and slightly unsettling to watch. Steve Carrell plays it straight while still adopting a jokiness that doesn't feel out of place, he is fun to watch while showing an anger and torment that makes him moving. Brad Pitt does well too and the cameos don't jar or bog things down.<br/><br/>The script is one of the reasons why 'The Big Short' works as well as it does and deserved its Oscar win. It does a great job entertaining and informing and doing it in a way that's taut, smart and making one feel the right emotions. Even though there are issues with the structure, the story is still incredibly compelling, with the interconnecting subplots being involving and developing the compellingly real characters well, and have a lot of admiration for its handling of the subject. It's a very serious, brave subject and not an easy one to bring to film but a subject that's a relevant and important one to tell, 'The Big Short' does remarkably in this aspect. It's always engaging, and it is also funny and informative while also making me feel shocked, angry and emotional as the events unfolded.<br/><br/>Overall, very good with many wonderful things. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Danusha_Goska","10","8","13","17 January 2016"," Masterful Filmmaking; Hope It Wins Best Picture
","I walked out of ""The Big Short"" experiencing that unique high I get from an excellent movie. As much as I loved ""Spotlight,"" I really want to see ""The Big Short"" win the 2016 best picture Academy Award. <br/><br/>I don't know anything about money and I rarely see movies built around finance. ""The Big Short"" is all about men's cut-throat competition with each other in a world as testosterone-fueled as the military or professional sports. Its virtuosic filmmaking is what glued me to the screen, ready to learn, laugh, and, yes, cry. <br/><br/>A barefoot man in a t-shirt is pouring his heart out, in an utterly unselfconscious way, to another man, who is wearing a suit. At the end of the conversation, the man in the suit timidly asks, ""So, do I get the job?"" It's a surprising and very funny moment. It tells us about the childlike soul and lack of social skills of the casually dressed man. It's quick and it doesn't beat you over the head. Either you caught the depth and the humor in the scene, or you didn't. <br/><br/>Next, we are in a support group of some kind. A member is sharing a personal heartache. Another man bursts into the room. He is talking loudly. He drowns out the first man. Everyone stares at him in anger and disgust. The rude, oblivious man makes himself a cup of coffee, and then uses his cell phone and leaves the room. He is one of the most insensitive, obnoxious people you've ever seen. The movie tells you his backstory, and it's so complex, and so heartbreaking, that you fall in love with this character. <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" seduced me through terrific writing that captured characters in quick, deft strokes, and made me care about those people, people who are human just as I am human, and, through my caring about their humanity, made me care about their very alien world. I have no money and don't understand how it works. They play with billions of dollars before breakfast and then go to strip clubs. Masterful filmmaking. <br/><br/>The supernova cast puts the story across. Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Marisa Tomei, and every secondary actor is superb, like Jeremy Strong as Vinny Daniel. The one performance that made me sit up and want to shout, ""Hold everything!"" is Steve Carell as Mark Baum. If you cherish the experience of being so moved by art that it changes how you view a person and how you view the world, you will want to go to see ""The Big Short"" just so you can see Steve Carell's performance. <br/><br/>""Mark Baum"" is a fictional hedge fund manager inspired by a real person, Steve Eisman. In the film, something tragic happens in Baum's life. That event is fictional. It didn't happen to Steve Eisman. <br/><br/>This is what is not depicted in the movie, at the request of the Eisman family. The real life hedge fund manager Steve Eisman had felt that he had an angel on his shoulder that looked out for him. He felt that nothing bad ever happened to him because of this angel. This is what common mortals like us assume about the superrich – the Richard Cory fallacy. One night, a nurse hired to look after Eisman's newborn son, Max, rolled over on top of Max in her sleep. Max was smothered to death. Eisman changed after that. <br/><br/>That's the character Steve Carell plays in the movie – a man touched by tragedy. He is the moral gravitational center of ""The Big Short.""<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" knows that it is selling something few viewers will want to buy. The 2008 economic crisis was caused by very complicated financial manipulations. Many people, including me, don't understand it. Too, people want to lay the blame on their villains of choice. Left-wingers want to blame greedy Wall Street oligarchs. Right-wingers want to blame Democratic politicians who won votes by making unfulfillable promises and greedy, lazy borrowers. <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" addresses the difficulty of its subject matter by occasionally reverting to docudrama mode. It breaks the fourth wall. Ryan Gosling plays Jared Vennet, a character based on Greg Lippman, aka ""Patient Zero,"" that is, the first person who saw the crisis coming and figured out how to capitalize on it. Gosling is a supremely charismatic actor. He turns to the audience and explains what is going on on screen. Because this is a Hollywood movie and not a science class documentary, he uses stars like Selena Gomez and celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain to educate the audience in what all this financial mumbo jumbo means. For example, Bourdain, in a restaurant kitchen, says, ""What if I buy too much fish. I chop it up and resell it as fish stew. It's not old fish; it's new stew."" That's how wheelers and dealers resold bad mortgages.<br/><br/>Too, the characters on screen are often confused by what is going on in their own financial world. Steve Carell as Mark Baum is one of those confused figures. He needs other characters to explain to him. Gosling explains by bringing wooden blocks to a meeting. The blocks represent ""tranches,"" or financial products. As each tranche is pulled away, the entire structure becomes weaker, and collapses. <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is intriguing enough that it made me want to read about the 2008 financial crisis. It's easy to find articles online, like one by Michael Grunwald at Politico, stating that the film is incorrect in its depiction of that crisis. Even if Grunwald is correct, that the movie made me want to read more about the crisis is testimony to its achievement."

Note: Based on real characters, only Bale's character's name is actually used in the film. While it's evident the banking community has not learned from their mistakes, the film does brings into perspective what the banking system was/is doing, why the collapse occurred and what a few people saw and tried to do before and after the world came crashing down. McKay has gathered another one of 2015's great ensembles, with awards recognition talk for all involved. However, Bale's quirky and old ball character is the stand out here. Your head may be spinning from all the financial lingo tossed around in this film, but McKay (through the use of several terrific camera appearance explanations) does his best to put things into laymen terms. ""The Big Short"" is an engrossing film, bringing to light a terrible time in our recent financial history."

","Full Disclosure: A close relative of mine sold out and ended up working as a lawyer in the derivatives department at Bear Stearns during the crash and promptly lost her job. To her credit she left the sleazy world of Wall Street to raise a family. I personally received an application for what is now called a Liar's Mortgage in 2007 from State Farm! I had the good sense to realize that not having to have the information on my application verified was cause for alarm! I still rent to this very day.<br/><br/>With that said The Big Short is a very powerful movie with three true stories intersecting on what would be a scandal that could have led to a worldwide collapse of the world's economic system. Nobody talks about this anymore. The Republican critters running for office pretend it never happened even though it is the single most important event of the 21st Century! <br/><br/>The Big Short made me feel uncomfortable, like it should. I identified with all the main characters since I come from a family of business men. In every disaster there are good guys who play by the rules and get screwed. The near global catastrophe was caused by fraud on such a huge scale that it defies the imagination. How could so many people willingly conspire with each other and do so much harm to the rest of the world and go scot-free? At the very least there should have been a Truth Commission like they had in South Africa.<br/><br/>The Big Short is such an important movie that every MBA student should be required to watch it before graduating along with every history major.

"Turfseer","7","6","9","14 January 2016"," Highly educational distillation of 2007-2008 financial crisis despite non-heroic nature of film's protagonists
","Adam McKay, former head writer for Saturday Night Live, co-wrote and directed this black comedy based on the 2010 book of the same name by Michael Lewis, all about how a few quirky finance guys foresaw the looming financial crisis of 2007-2008, and ended up profiting from it.<br/><br/>The main character played by Christian Bale is Michael Burry, a former physician turned hedge fund manager who discovers that the US housing market is unstable due to risky sub-prime loans. He becomes convinced that the financial crisis is unavoidable and creates a ""credit default swap market,"" convincing various banks to accept his ""bets"" that the housing market will collapse. The banks, convinced that the market is stable, gladly accept his investments on behalf of the investors in his hedge fund.<br/><br/>We find out a little about Burry's background—that he lost an eye as a child. suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, and was always a maverick who didn't fit the typical profile of a hedge fund manager. McKay establishes a conflict between Burry and his jittery investors, who stand to lose millions, if his prediction does not come to fruition. How Burry copes with the pressure is where the comedy comes in— although it's certainly not laugh out loud funny. And it's also quite interesting how Burry ultimately prevents all his investors from panicking and cashing in all their chips—he does this by creating a moratorium on all withdrawals, right before the big economic collapse!<br/><br/>When trader Jared Vennett of Deustche Bank (Ryan Gosling) hears about Burry's credit default swap market, he decides to get in on the action too. Vennett's wrong number phone call alerts our other protagonist, Mark Baum, another quirky, curmudgeonly hedge fund manager adroitly played by Steve Carrell. Baum and Vennett join forces and Baum begins to investigate the depth of the problem with the US Housing market. Baum is a sensitive guy who was deeply affected by his brother who committed suicide. He discovers that collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are loan packages bundled together and given AAA ratings by unscrupulous rating agencies. McKay wisely takes us out of the finance board rooms and has his principals attend a big housing forum in Las Vegas where Baum in particular meets a fat cat businessman who has profited greatly by creating synthetic CDOs. Baum ultimately convinces his business associates to adopt Burry's stratagem.<br/><br/>Also in the mix are small-time, young investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) who learn of the swap market and then must conscript a retired banker, Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), to get them in the game. Rickert, now a new age type (and one who has a conscience like Baum), castigates Geller and Shipley for celebrating over impending profits, at the expense of the millions of people who will lose their jobs and income due to the financial collapse. Geller and Shipley try to atone for their selfish attitude by attempting to alert the press about the impending collapse, but to no avail.<br/><br/>McKay may see the protagonists here as heroes merely for their foresight into what is to come, and for bearing witness to the fraud they uncovered. Nonetheless, despite their guilty conscience, they ended up profiting from other peoples' misery. Despite their foresight, they're really nothing more than vultures feeding on the carcasses of the millions wiped out in the financial downturn. But it's really the entire financial industry as well as the US government whom McKay is indicting here—a corrupt system that allowed swindlers to convince low-income people to live beyond their means and obtain mortgages that they couldn't possibly pay off.<br/><br/>In the end it's the film's educational value that makes it worthwhile. The 2007-2008 financial collapse is a topic that is difficult to understand. McKay has his characters explain the financial jargon and even brings in celebrities such as Selena Gomez to explain arcane terms that pop up in the narrative. While some of the characters' machinations become somewhat repetitious, I still was able to learn quite a bit about a topic that isn't ordinarily so easy to grasp."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","7","11","15 January 2016"," A Great Movie, But More Importantly Does A Great Job Explaining A Complicated Subject We Could All Stand To Know More About
","With all the media coverage of the collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2008, anyone who hasn't read the book The Big Short or have an intimate knowledge of the finer details of this event might be dismissive of this movie. It's understandable but it's unfortunate nonetheless. What we were presented with from the media may or may not have been completely accurate, having been filtered through a scope. We need more stories like the ones that are presented here, to help the public grasp what happened and as the film points out, how easily it could happen again.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) serves as the narrator but we don't actually get to meet his character until later in the feature. He introduces us to what the banking industry used to be in the 1980s, a boring job with an uninteresting salary. Then traders of Salomon brothers changed that by creating mortgage bonds that pooled thousands of mortgages together to create a mortgage backed security. It revolutionized the banking industry and helped banking become one of the most profitable if not the most profitable sector of the American economy and eventually was the primary cause of the 2008 collapse. But as Jared tells us there were a few people who saw this coming and even though they were ostracized and laughed at by the industry leaders, they were eventually proved correct and in the process made millions of dollars off of what would be a horrifying experience for millions of ordinary citizens of the developed world.<br/><br/>The Big Short largely centres around 5 characters. Dr Michael Burry (Christian Bale) an eccentric west coast hedge fund manager, Jared Vennett a sleazy trader employed by Deustche Bank who primarily peddles the credit default swaps to financial big wigs, Mark Baum (Steve Carell) may be the most bearish Wall Street hedge fund manager you would come across who runs a fund that is involved with Morgan Stanley, and Charlie Geller (John Margaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Whitrock) two investors who happen upon Vennett's material on how profitable these swaps could be and decide to do everything they can to get involved. Being an ensemble piece, it's hard to attach yourself to every character that gets a chunk of the screen time but one of the things The Big Short accomplishes is that you get to know all these characters and you get involved in what they're caught up in. They all have distinct personalities (Vennett describes the rest of the main cast as freaks) and are all interesting. You can relate to their struggle even though you're not the one gambling with giant sums of money. We know what's going to happen, we all lived through it in some capacity but I found it more and more gripping as the movie went along and I wanted to know what happened to these people after they finally were exonerated.<br/><br/>When I described the characters up above, if you didn't know anything about the tale you might think I was describing a thriller. Thankfully, this is not what the film is. Another feat of the movie is how well the movie balances both the comedic and dramatic aspects of the story. I was laughing really hard at points and I was ready to cry at others but it all fits together pretty organically. Helping this along is the celebrity cameos that appear intermittently and while I don't want to spoil too much about them, they are interesting and surprisingly informative. They help take deliberately confusing concepts and boil it down into something we can understand. To be fair though, you still might not pick up everything that's going on but in terms of things being identifiable, this is probably as close as you're going to get.<br/><br/>The acting is award worthy by some and at least satisfactory by all. I thought Steve Carell did the best job as Baum, his character is the closest you get to a moral centre in both the book and the movie and while even though he's not losing his job or his home, like his wife points out, you feel the pain and anger of this crisis through his performance. Christian Bale delivers in fine form as Dr. Mike Burry, throwing his all into it. Ryan Gosling had to stretch the least (in terms of his appearance) in his part but that's offset by how funny he is and how he does such a good job at playing a morally loose dirt bag. Keep an eye out for Brad Pitt in a small role but he nails it as well.<br/><br/>The Big Short has great witty dialogue, awards calibre acting, and a message that needs to be taught which they do in an interesting way. My one complaint is that the movie is filmed in a very scatter-shot way and it took me a little while to get used to it but by the halfway point it wasn't a problem any more. Be prepared, the movie is a lot of fun but the ending is a sucker punch to the gut and you will leave ready to bawl or ready to smash something. What happened in 2008 was terrible and as the movie reminds us where these executives got their golden parachutes and avoided jail time (which they frankly deserved), it was the rest of us that had to deal with the mess and the ending doesn't pull punches about that. I was entertained throughout and I can't recommend it highly enough. It would make a great double feature with the fantastic documentary Inside Job, if you're looking to learn a little more about what really went down with the World economic collapse in 2008."

","Superb - intriguing, funny, edifying, scary and moving.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar's Poker and Flash Boys, amongst others), the true story (though most of the main characters' names have been changed) of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.<br/><br/>Incredibly interesting and informative. Maybe you have to know finance and investments (as I do) to understand some of the concepts, but the mechanics of the market and their proposed investment (their big shorts) are fascinating. What is even more interesting is that market so structurally flawed can even exist, especially without any decent regulation...<br/><br/>Quite funny too. Director Adam MacKay's previous feature films have all been comedies - Anchorman, The Other Guys, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers - and here he lightens the mood (at relevant times) with some great humour.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on, however, it takes on a more serious and sombre tone. This conveys well the impact of the bubble bursting. The ultimate feeling is one of helplessness and anger.<br/><br/>Superb performances, especially from Christian Bale and Steve Carell. We expect this from Bale but Carell is starting to throw off his comedy past and put in some fine dramatic performances. Foxcatcher was the start and here he is in fine form again. Considering how different the two characters he played (in Foxcatcher and The Big Short) are, he is not only a good dramatic actor, but one with decent range.<br/><br/>Good supporting cast which includes Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and Marisa Tomei. Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez appear as themselves and provide some of the film's wackier moments.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a great exposition of the greed, stupidity, self- interest and lack of regulation that caused the 2008 Global Financial Crisis."

","The Big Short is a playful attempt at one aspect of the housing crisis in America which many have likely never even heard of. Based on Michael Lewis's book with the same title, and directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman, The Other Guys, Step Brothers, and much more), this is a new look at one of the more unpleasant parts of American history.<br/><br/>The film addresses a select few individuals who were able to predict the housing crisis only moments before its inevitable collapse, and in doing so were able to take full advantage of what was to happen.<br/><br/>The past two years have been ones of great transformation for Steve Carell. In Foxcatcher we see him take on a new role which is far from more typical comedic ones noted in the past. Carell once again does something amazing through playing Mark Baum (a representation of real life Steve Eisman). As an interesting side note, Eisman was reportedly on set to help Carell in portraying him for the film.<br/><br/>Steve Carell shows that the Comedy genre is not the only brand of film he can successfully take part in. I was thoroughly impressed with Steve's performance and am looking forward to future roles to come from the now multi-dimensional talent.<br/><br/>Another notable performance is that by Christian Bale. Boy oh boy, this was a fantastic job by the renowned method actor. In an interview on NPR, director McKay describes the many transformations made by Bale, including actually learning how to play the drums.<br/><br/>But what truly amazed me about Bale's performance was how believable he made the character with which he portrayed. He played Michael Burry, an American hedge fund manager who was into heavy metal music (and I mean HEAVY metal, screaming, yelling, and loud noise) as well as obtaining a degree in neurology from Stanford. What made this character so interesting was that financial investment was merely a hobby he played with at nights when not studying for school.<br/><br/>Often in films with a top-tier cast, you find the film itself falls short in many regards ...but not here. I say well done to McKay.<br/><br/>This film was made in such a way to allow for all types of audiences to enjoy. And that precisely is what happened.

","""The Big Short"" is the screen adaptation of a book by the same name written by Michael Lewis, one of my favorite writers. Lewis also wrote ""The Blindside,"" an award-winning film and several other books on the financial markets.<br/><br/>Lewis focuses on the few oddballs who could foresee the financial meltdown, partly because of their personality quirks. The film brings real- life characters to the screen. These are the few people who knew for a certainty that Wall Street was laying the foundation for a massive meltdown in the financial markets.<br/><br/>The screenwriters did something which seems impossible: they made this material very funny. Nearly every working American was touched by the meltdown. Their pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s suffered horrible losses, and the real estate sector of the American economy was crushed. We watch these brilliant misfits sleuth their way to an understanding of the complex, multi-layered fraud that was the sub- prime mortgage world.<br/><br/>The failure of institutions to protect investors is a background story. In the foreground are truly interesting characters who were like the Paul Revere's of the avoidable crisis., but no one would listen. <br/><br/>Fraud paid much too well, and there were no grown-ups in charge of our banks, government agencies, rating agencies or real estate firms.<br/><br/>This film is fun."

","A vapid, preachy and historically false movie that is based upon fiction that the uneducated and uninformed will obediently lap up. <br/><br/>The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 added thousand upon thousands of pages of regulations that forced banks to lend money to low-income areas. Yes, forced. <br/><br/>This is the typical liberal prescription for all the ailments of society: Throw logic and reason out the window, and use a warm and fuzzy touchy-feeling legislation to try to fix an imagined injustice. <br/><br/>The Federal government (through the FDIC and FFIEC) required banks and mortgage companies to advertise and make super-low mortgage loans to people who should not have been buying a house in the first place. <br/><br/>If the banks refused to take on these dangerous loans, they risked steep fines, being audited, and even being taken over by the government while that particular bank was being given (yes, given) to another bank in the area. <br/><br/>So what did banks do? They made loans to everyone. What did that do? Made house prices SOAR. Which did what? Turned a $50,000 house into a $150,000 house.<br/><br/>Now you have a family, who barely had any money to being with, trying to pay a $1,000 mortgage when their total income was maybe twice that. Their home gets re-assessed by the government, then their property taxes skyrocket. <br/><br/>Why? Because the leftists and liberals said 'everyone deserves the right to own a home'.<br/><br/>People began defaulting on loans. Missing payments. Houses were repossessed. The market crashed."

","Not really an accurate portrayal of the housing bust. The movie makes it out like these few people were the only ones who knew there was a problem brewing. Uh, no, zillions of people knew as early as 2004, including me, and I'm no Einstein. What set these guys apart is that they figured out a good way to profit from the coming collapse, although it was never made exactly clear just what sort of percentage return they made.<br/><br/>The Michael Burry character was portrayed as an annoying mental case which seemed wrong to me since I've seen videos of the guy giving various speeches and he never struck me as a nutjob except in this movie.<br/><br/>Didn't care for the bimbo in the bathtub explaining financial jargon to the viewers. Very contrived.<br/><br/>No laying of any blame on the people who bought houses they couldn't afford. A lot of those people were closer to idiots than victims.

","The Big Short tells one story too many and feels jumpy and haphazard – especially since the characters in each storyline never intersect. It's really three movies in one – and would have been better served by being two stories well told.<br/><br/>With a frenetic ""turn five cameras on and let the actors improv"" style, the film's hyperactive chattiness completely strips the emotion from every scene. It's all pretty headache inducing to be honest.<br/><br/>The film also has 10 minutes of unnecessary exposition done with a ""wink wink"" style that makes you not even pay attention to what's being said. For a second it feels clever until you realize that the content really is superfluous, interrupts the narrative, and pulls you out of the film.<br/><br/>For me, the Big Short's final nail is the overly-preachy ending where the film revels in its own self-importance.<br/><br/>The performances are GREAT, however, with Steve Carell destined for an Oscar nom. Ryan Gosling shows some real talent. Wait for Redbox on this one."
"alcucchiara","6","10","18","27 January 2016"," A thorough analysis of the 2008 financial collapse with an oxymoronic title
","One would think that in the absolute least it would be extremely difficult to make an intriguing movie about the housing market and the US banking system and the greedy people who invest and gamble with our country's future... while keeping a cyber-age audience entertained, but The Big Short not only manages to accomplish that goal but does it excellently. The major drawback to this film is that the pace is too fast for an average viewer to sort out who's who from a host of actors, each of whom portrays a key player in a complex intertwined financial system. That being said, this film targets the painful nerve of every American, a nerve that careens through their job security, affecting their monetary value and terminates in the core of their family's welfare: the place they cherish and call their home, for every man's home is his ""castle"" and whoever messes with a man's castle, is messing with the man's family. The repressed anger of the American people over the 2008 crises and the memories of the financial loss they have endured will be inflated as they watch this film and then ""pricked"" by the irritating, aggravating and infuriating outcome. Those who plan to watch it should plan on watching it twice and plan to clench a lead bullet between the back teeth."

","When four outsiders saw what major banks, media and government refused to, the forthcoming global collapse of the economy, they had an idea: The Big Short. <br/><br/>Their bold investment leads them into the dark underbelly of modern banking where they must question everyone and everything.......<br/><br/>I must be missing something, something really fundamental about this film, because of all its accolades, great big fat thumbs up reviews, I hated the film, and smarmy characters that were 'affected' by the films narrative.<br/><br/>But it want boring, it just made me angry, looking at these smug, consumerist bloodsuckers doing what they can for themselves, and then feel really guilty/happy/depressed about it come the end. <br/><br/>And what makes it worse is the fact it's awards season, so we get our favourite actors being shouty, or wearing wonderful hairpieces for a little bit of recognition. <br/><br/>Gosling here is at his most smug, being all Jerry Maguire but without any soul, and then breaking the fourth wall just to let the audience what a complete inhuman parasite he really is. And for some reason, he seems to channel Ray Liotta from Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Then we have the forty year old virgin himself, Steve Carrell, doing his best 'shout really loud' voice, which is supposed to indicate that he is miserable, stressed, or suffering a loss, but again, he comes across more of the bloke with the big mobile phone from Trigger Happy TV. He does play the key victim/Victor in the catastrophe, but when revelations become apparent to him, he gurns within an inch of his life. And for some reason, he seems to channel Joe Pesci from Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Pitt has no reason to be in this film, apart to prove that he can do serious, and do it good, but he was fantastic in Moneyball, and he's barely in this, looks out of place. A more seasoned actor, such as Gary Oldman, would have fitted the part better, and we wouldn't be comparing him to a 1970's TV quizmaster, like I did when ever he stumbled on screen.<br/><br/>Bale is the saving grace here, he's actually quite endearing as the 'Eureka' part if the. Movie, but as soon as you learn about his glass eye, and his wonderfully Foghorn Leghorn like stutter, you start to feel less empathy for him, and just wish he would stop banging his drums in that 'no one understands em' type of way. <br/><br/>What's surprising is that the rest of the cast, like Rafe Spall and Jeremy Strong are the most humanistic people in the film, and whenever they are alone on screen, I their secondary group, the film picks up slightly, rather than us having the big A-Listers doing their caricature like schtick.<br/><br/>Heavy on propaganda, and showing too much sympathy for the wrong people, apart from the one ethnic family in a car, The Big Short is just another in a long line of Oscar baiting true stories, that show abhorrent, poisonous rich people feel sorry for themselves, because something went wrong.<br/><br/>Why could they not have made the film from the point of view of a low income family affected by this instead.<br/><br/>Its like someone has took The Company Men, Margin Call, Glengarry Glenross, and wig r' us, and made them sit in a room and fight.<br/><br/>I know I'll be in the minority, but I hated it."

","Some good acting (I especially like Bale) and interesting tricks like having actors talk to the audience and having celebrities explain complex financial deals.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it distorts reality to match a Leftist viewpoint, and repeats ad nauseam how evil bankers are. Conveniently left out is the pressure the government put on banks. Check out the history of the Community Reinvestment Act, particularly Bill Clinton's ""coup de whiskey"" which forced banks to accept junk housing loans. This is why such a large percentage of mortgages failed. This was NOT mentioned in the film; how can this not be relevant?<br/><br/>Also, it was well known that housing loans were in trouble before the crash. I remember a cover article in The Economist predicting disaster in housing around 2005. I think the bankers were thinking, yeah, it's crazy, but the government is forcing us to do it so they are going to cover these loans in the end so they are secure.<br/><br/>At least with Michael Moore you know he is lying to you; with this movie a lot of people accept it as fact."

This makes no sense, he probably meant loan to equity. The Jenga tower was made wrong. It was showing AAA to be most risky. Most of the speeches were cynical with little meat.

"The-Sarkologist","9","6","10","16 January 2016"," Betting Against the American Economy
","Basically this is a movie about the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and how three individuals picked up on the coming financial Armageddon and decided to play the market at its own game. In a way it is part a documentary, and part a story about how these individuals (though one of them is actually an independent arm of one of the major investment banks) decided to bet hundreds of millions of dollars against what many saw as being a rock solid economic foundation. In fact what they were doing was not just betting against the American economy, but also betting against the stability of the world economy.<br/><br/>What the movie does is that it attempts to explain what the main causes of the the catastrophe where, namely the fancy financial instruments that were created with the belief that the market would always go up, and that real estate is always a rock solid investment. However as some of the characters begin to dig deeper, whether it is looking at the figures that go to make up these financial instruments, or whether they go out and put their ear to the ground, they become ever more convinced that there is a serious problem within the economic system.<br/><br/>It was interesting how one of the characters, the head of a Californian investment fund, came to discover the shaky ground that many of these securities were built upon. However, there was no financial instruments that allowed him to bet against it, which meant that he had to go out and create them himself. Mind you, when he first suggested these investments to the large Wall Street banks, they simply laughed at him, however since they have no problem taking people's money, they were more than happy to comply (particularly since they saw it as easy money).<br/><br/>I could go on for ages taking about this crisis, however I will pull back a bit and simply talk about the film – it was really, really well done. The director did a great job of explaining how these financial instruments worked in a fairly clear manner (though the problem with some of them is that even those who created the instruments didn't actually know what they were supposed to do). It also gave a pretty clear indication of the risk these people were running, especially since they were making a bet against something that nobody could ever conceive happening (and even now, after what happened in the United States, if you raise the suggestion of an over-inflated housing market people will simply laugh at you and claim that you have no idea what you are talking about – the situation in the United States was different).<br/><br/>I have to say that I loved a number of characters in the film as well – especially Mark Braun – I never even realised that this was Steve Carroll until I checked the cast list at the end. I'm so used to him playing comedy roles that when he comes along and takes the role of a guy that isn't afraid to say it like it is, and to call out the fraud that he sees around him, then I have to say that my impression of him as an actor increases. In fact there were a couple of characters here that were rather odd, including the fund manager who spends the day listening to Metallica, bashing away at his drums, and coming to the office casually dressed. I guess to stand out from the crowd in the Wall Street game one needs to be a little odd and eccentric.<br/><br/>Mind you, if you are looking for a film that offers solutions, then maybe this isn't the one for you. Still, it is a great film that clearly paints the picture of how much of a casino culture our financial world has become. In fact it is quite interesting to discover that the securitisation forum was being held in Las Vegas of all places. The problem is though, our world hasn't gone back to the time that it was in prior to the Financial Crisis. In fact it has never even recovered and we are still experiencing shockwaves from it eight years after the fact. Maybe it was the biggest short of the century, but ever since then the financial system hasn't been the same.<br/><br/>Oh, and as usual Brad Pitt was also outstanding (I didn't even realise that he was in the movie until I read a review on IMDb)."

He's AMAZING!!!<br/><br/>Christian BALE, Ladies and Gentlemen, when will this man receive an Oscar for Best Actor?!!!!!!! Everything, every little thing he does is in the character. It is deep inside. Feels so right, so true! <br/><br/>When he falsely laughs to reassure his wife while heavily breathing from playing drums! exactly how you would do if you were caught in a tantrum and didn't want your loved one to worry.<br/><br/>STEVE CARELL! Fantastic! This man is also heading for the Oscars In character, totally! You can see it in his eyes, in his whole being. Beautiful! <br/><br/>MELISSA LEO!!! You must see her decay!<br/><br/>And its' not only the big names that are amazing! It's all the scenes, all the details, all the supporting actors : watch with full attention the scenes where there are many actors...<br/><br/>Yet, it is never about the performance. It is always about the message. The performance serves the message.<br/><br/>Now the editing, the score! So well chosen! The angles, the cuts and returns!!<br/><br/>You know, sometimes in a movie, some effects look like there just for us to enjoy! But not here. Again it is always about the message. When the camera slows down to show us all the protagonists leaving Vegas, it is not to say: ""look!, I am a great cameraman, I can do that"", no, instead it gives us time to take a good look at the tragedy that is occurring, and to reflect on this as some of the protagonists also do while leaving when others just show an unchanged GREED in them. <br/><br/>Too bad some acting bothered me. I really was annoyed by Gosling's hairdo! atrocious, and his tan, which looked like painting. Also his acting... Too closed. I almost felt something at one point of his last scene, but it was for like half a second. Maybe the director wanted to show a banker like that... Dunno. And Marisa Tomei... Usually I like her. But here her actions as the character didn't seem real. Maybe because I would have not reacted as her if my husband finally talked about his terrible burden... Except for these two, I'm telling you, it is a to watch movie. <br/><br/>And I hope it encourages us to BE MORE AWARE OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN AND HOW OUR GREED AFFECTS ALL. Peace.<br/><br/>PS : <br/><br/>Lastly, frankly, I'm usually not into comparing two movies. Simply because it is in a way impossible. <br/><br/>But this time, this movie really reminded me of the Wolf of Wall Street as these two movies share the same core message. But it felt as if this movie succeeded where the Wolf of Wall Street did not. Let me explain : WWS was beautiful and funny, perfectly filmed, but too perfectly, too beautiful, too controlled, for us to feel the pain. It's like a beautiful painting that blows your mind with all its vivid colors and marvelous shapes : you lose the message. <br/><br/>Also in WWS you can see Leonardo Di Caprio, who I have real affection for, always trying to make his best performance as an individual. You see the actor. Not just the character. And maybe the wonderful Martin Scorsese is trying too hard too... Plus there was some default in his editing... I'm telling you here is the Gem!"
"thependragonscribe","9","6","10","1 January 2016"," From the director of ""Anchorman"" comes a mockumentary ""Wall Street""
","Having browsed the Michael Lewis source material, it is a compelling examination of the 2008 financial crisis, starting from its roots on the housing and credit bubble to its fruits on the Wall Street. Strings of business jargon and crass pop culture from the book makes this as a fitting material for ""Anchorman"" director Adam McKay to take the helm.<br/><br/>The movie glances on three interconnected stories of New York-based firm personalities who engaged on earning big from a marketing bubble on the credit and housing sectors. Each story has its own quirks and stakes to an impending crisis. The source of its growth comes from hedge fund manager Michael Burry (a sardonic Christian Bale, redoing a calm but crazy Patrick Bateman), who predicted the collapse from loan numbers he received and devised a way to profit from it by betting on the big corporations. His plan was realized when Deutsche Bank investor Jared Vennett (a snarky Ryan Gosling) decided to get involved in the credit swap, dragging along trader Mark Baum (an outstanding Steve Carell) and his firm. Burry's predictions also catch the eyes of junior investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), who set a credit default swap deal with several officials, with the assistance of veteran banker Ben Rickert (a low-key Brad Pitt). All stories intertwine to what becomes the horror story for the world economy but an accomplished mission for those people who profit from it.<br/><br/>The main topic that surrounds ""The Big Short"" is a complex issue that truly requires an unorthodox method to boost interest. Adam McKay's approach goes for the mockumentary style, complete with hand-held camera-work, supportive montages and jumps from scene to scene. Also adding to McKay's oddities is the splurging editing (thanks to deserving Hank Corwin), which spans from the surrounding pop culture of the period, and the sudden fourth-wall breaks. It seems in favor of the source material that McKay and Charles Randolph narrow down to directly tell the complex tale of the 2007-2010 financial crisis. It also helps that the cast ensemble are at their full game through the proceedings; Carell's Baum being the most sympathetic and Bale's Burry as the golden goose. This makes them one of the most compelling casts in a comedy- drama. And a must for ""The Big Short"" because this is a crucial piece of informative cinema, from the outrageous mind of Adam McKay."

THE BIG SHORT shows that these Bankers own the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and the rest of U.S. Media, which is why the outrageous story of these 200,000 Banker murders and 8 million stolen homes is almost totally suppressed right up till today, and not a peep of citizen outrage hits the media. As long as Americans have to claw tooth and nail to keep their TVs going from one meager paycheck to the next, no one has a moment to question the System. We callously dismiss our killed-off brothers and sisters, as well as homeless parents and kids as cases of ""bad luck,"" or the ""cost of doing business"" for the ""privilege"" of breathing in America. When the Banks say ""Jump!"" we simply quiver, ""How high?"" We cannot organize, since the Banks own all the media. THE BIG SHORT suggests that a few thousand (or hundred) Big Bankers will continue to doom the rest of us to increasingly tiny, hopeless, more squalid existences. We Nation of Sheep probably will simply cross our fingers and hope to be dead the next time Bankers have an itch to steal $5--or $50--trillion in one fell swoop."

","The movie wasn't entirely accurate some average people did know that subprime mortgages, balloon mortgages (5 year balloons which proves this happened entirely on Bush II's watch), etc. were a ticking time bomb. I was one of them, in 2005 when I invested in the mortgage business specifically in an outfit called American Home Mortgage, I only invested in them because they did not engage in subprimes or other risky loan practices, but guess what while on vacation in Orlando with my family, summer 2007, I saw my position and my kids positions in American Home Mortgage disappear via a Treo phone. American Home Mortgage was the 10th largest mortgage company in the country and it was the first to go! Anyone with half a brain saw the bubble but virtually everyone I knew, including my fat redneck boss, 
hung on every word spoken by Alan Greenspan and Alan was telling everyone to stay the course and all was well. This movie shows the criminal dealings of Goldman Sachs but they got bailed out and no one went to jail. This will happen again! This country is nothing more than a criminal enterprise! Kudos to Iceland for jailing the banksters and helping out the homeowners! By the way words right out of the idiots mouth: ""We can put light where there's darkness, and hope where there's despondency in this country.

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","30 January 2016"," The Big Short is a bit short of being a masterpiece for me. I felt like it was just alright.
","I have mixed feelings about this movie based on author Michael Lewis' non-fiction book of the same name. The reason why, is because it's might be, a little too loosely based on true events. While, the Big Short, definitely shows that the U.S housing market, was built on a house of cards. I felt like the movie directed by Adam McKay really doesn't go deep enough into the 2007 financial crisis, as it should. It puts all the financial blame on the evil bankers. Yes, bankers at the time, are too blame, and they are greedy, but the government at the time is just as bad. After all, it's the past, 3 presidential administrations that pressured banks to help poor people become homeowners. If anything, blame them, as well, movie. I also didn't like, how the movie doesn't even, address Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac, much. You would think, those two, would play a big factor in this film. Then, you got no mention of corruption in the Federal Reserve. Where was that? I was really hoping for this movie, to spill the beans. Sadly, it only scan the surface of the financial issue. Another thing that bug me, about this film, is the movie pacing. The pacing somewhat lose directions, at parts. I really don't get why the film love venturing into bizarre sub-stories, about having a fake eye, or a brother that commit suicide. It felt like filler. Don't get me wrong, it's nice that they're trying to build, character's backstory, here, but it wasn't really needed. All that fast cutting editing for these scenes, just made the film, more annoying, disorienting and frantic for me. I really didn't care about them. All, I wanted is the movie to examine the housing problem. That's all. I do like the how the movie have sequences in which, famous celebrities cameos like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain explain, more of the complex economic terms with more, flashy, quick-witted layman's terms. Just think, how more awesome, it could had been, if the movie got its original celebrity cameos in, like Scarlett Johansson, Beyonce, and rapper Jay Z. No matter what, some of the other humorous way of story-telling sequences, seem not to work as much as it should. I really didn't like how the artist, 'Ludicrous' rap music video was being mixed with scenes of Wall Streets. I'm sorry, I find his music, to be very awful. Another thing, I really don't understand, why there was a laugh-track, during the whole discussion about synthetic CDOs. Are we, supposed to find it, funny? I really don't get, what the message, was supposed to be, there. Another thing, I don't get, is the whole 'break the fourth wall' gags. It's a bit funny, at times, but I found them to be, somewhat distracting and jarring. While, are these people repeating lines!? It's too confusing. Another thing, that made me, dislike the film, a bit, is how, they made these investors seem like the heroes. Honestly, as much as the movie wants us, believe that these hedge fund investors have a moral code. In truth, these men, are not somebody to root for. After all, all the characters profit hugely as the housing economy crumbles in 2008 and really didn't do anything to stop it. They are just as much to blame, as the stockbrokers in Wall Street. These are not modern day 'Robin Hood and his merry men"" fighting against the corrupt banks. They were in the scheme as much as the banks were. Just note, that Saints don't live in Park Ave, when watching this film. Despite that, the All-Star Cast did an alright performance. I found the characters in which they play; Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Charlie Geller (John Magaro), Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) & Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) all very interesting characters. What I don't like, about the characters, is how many of the real-life names were changed for this movie. It gives me, the impression that they're trying to hide something. Out of the four main characters, Michael Burry is the only character whose name wasn't changed for the movie and whom character seem like the real-life couther-part. The real Michael Burry spent a total of roughly 12 hours talking with actor Christian Bale for this role. For the most part, having seem real interviews with real Michael Burry; I believe Christian Bale master his behavioral traits, very well. As for the others, Steve Carell did met with Steve Eisman, the real-life person in which, his character was based on, however, his version of him, was a bit over the top preachy. The movie made him, seem like too-much like an activist for the righteous, when in truth, Eisman was once, indicted with allegations of inside trading, within his own company. It got so bad, that Eisman had left FrontPoint Partners in 2011 amid investor withdrawals. Another thing, it does not appear that Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt were in touch with Greg Lippmann and Ben Hockett, the real-life counterparts to their Big Short characters. If anything, I have a strong feeling that, these performances are not that accuracy to the real-life characters, as well. Also, where was the character of Meredith Whitney in this film? She predicted the demise of Citigroup and Bear Stearns, and was mention in the book, but she's nowhere to be found in this film. How come, they cut out her story? Another problem, is how, of the central supporting characters; only Michael Burry and Baum's employees are the ones that kept their real names. Why do they so differ from the source material?

Most of the biggest troubles was that camera that never stopped shaking and zooming in and out and moving up and down with no sense even in the most quiet portrait. There is no need to play with moving camera in senseless way to make the story more dramatic. Big disappointing even in some characters there. Not professional. Pretending! I would ask to this director to give me back the time i spent to watch his bullshit and maybe to tell to him how he can do this movie in more positive way."
"nysalesman","3","16","37","16 February 2016"," Short on Truth
","I found it ironic that a movie that preached about the truth went out of its way to lie. It's as if the screenwriters started by listing every politically correct message (including blaming the evil 1% - of which Pitt, Carell, Bale, and Gosling are a part) and wrote the story around it. Lies of the movie, the true facts, and where to find them:<br/><br/>1. Mortgage funds were greatly profitable for the banks by filling them with riskier mortgages (sub-prime). Banks that did not engage in taking on shorts broke even between the profit from the bonds and losses of sub-primes. HISTORY: 1977: Carter passes the Community Reinvestment Act which still called for sound banking practices. So Carter started this but was not the true architect. 1995: Clinton amends the Community Reinvestment Act to abandon sound banking practices and impose heavy fines to banks if they turn away sub-primes for minorities. These loans were then vetted and backed by Fannie and Freddie. 1999: Clinton repeals the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932 allowing banks to invest in the stock market. 2002: Dems saw fit to exclude mortgages from SOX regulations as no sub-prime mortgages would pass muster, which would effectively end the Community Reinvestment Act. It also gave Fannie and Freddie a license to steal. IN A NUTSHELL: The banks were forced to accept bad mortgages (sub-prime) by the gov't and were losing money. After Glass-Stegall was repealed, the banks put the bad mortgages in bonds to trade them for profit. The people buying and trading the bonds, not the banks, were making a killing (among those people BTW, were the Clintons). 1999 – 2007: Fannie and Freddie cook their books allowing the problem to balloon into a huge bubble and crash the world economy. An astute federal regulator caught this and hearings pursued. The Dems blocked the hearings and ran interference for Freddie and Fanny to continue to cook the books so no-one would be aware of the coming crash. 2007: Wanting an October surprise, Chuck Schumer's office leaks the true housing numbers to the media. The next day it is reported and public and the economy crashes. The Dems (counting on the ignorance of the public who don't bother to educate themselves) blame the Republicans and get their October surprise. Obama's poll numbers (which were failing since the Republic Convention) go through the roof and he becomes the next President of the US.<br/><br/>2. The movies says nobody knew about the upcoming mortgage/banking crisis and no one is paying attention, because the banks are making money hand over fist. This just isn't true. There were warnings about this as early as 7-years before it happened. As I stated before, the gov't knew about this and the Dems kept blocking it from being investigated, resolved, or leaked to the public. This is where the Republicans are also to blame and they also did not 'leak' this info to the public back when the damage could have been managed. This was at the bequest of the Dems to be bi-partisan. Just Google Fannie-Freddie hearings of 2004 to see for yourself. Additionally, Paul Kasriel of Northern Trust on July 30, 2004 (before the geniuses portrayed in the movie every saw this) warned that 60% of banks earnings assets were mortgage related twice as much as in 1986 and if the housing market would go bust, then it would devastate the banking industry and the economy (Forbes).<br/><br/>3. The movie first says Greenspan was clueless, then the movie said he was the architect. First, how can Greenspan be clueless if he was also the architect? Second, I've shown above, that Clinton was the true architect of this debacle. Greenspan warned about this in his annual reports but shrugged it off because he miscalculated that the housing market consisted of multiple bubbles so if one failed the others would not be affected.<br/><br/>4. The movie shows sub-primes as having been taken by typical white people, knowing full well that the Community Reinvestment Act only applied to minorities. The end of the movie even goes so far as to have Steve Carell monologue about how this will be blamed on minorities and poor people as it always has been in the past. I don't remember a bad economy ever being blamed on poor people. Second, it was the minorities that caused this by taking loans that they couldn't afford because the gov't told them they had it coming to them. The makers of this movie are so afraid that people like me would expose their lies that they take the time to stereotype us by saying we just want to blame minorities as white people always want to do.<br/><br/>5. The big banks were wrong for creating the shorting market because they thought it would be easy money. These are the only banks that needed help after the crash. The small and medium sized banks were fine, because they didn't get greedy. The fact that Bush and Obama gave bail-outs to save the big banks is the real crime. Who should have gone to jail: Franklin Raines of Fanny Mae (a gov't appointee who cooked the books and made millions).Instead, Obama rewarded Raines by appointing him as an economic adviser.<br/><br/>If I learned one thing from this movie, or more accurately the reviews of this movie: ""Why We Should Hate Corporate America,"" ""A Story that Must Be Told;"" it's that even with the Internet providing a wealth of information at the touch of a button, the majority of US citizens are woefully ignorant and deserve to be treated like idiots by Hollywood and their government."

Those who want to be the misunderstood rebel, well... give us products like The Big Short. Nine minutes in, easy choice to abort and refund. The producers and editors who couldn't make the cut to get in to MTV, go to Hollywood. Whoever was involved in the funding of this movie, needs to be fired.

","I will be quite blunt. And very short. Avoid this item (I would not call it a movie) at any cost! First of all, this is not a feature film. There is a story but annoyingly not adapted through a 'movie screenplay'. Too bad Randolph! I'd rather call it a hybrid of a feature and a documentary but a badly mutilated cloning job by Adam McKay. Acting is generally OK, but Burry's character is really annoying. Worst is its infuriatingly hopelessly portrayed by Bale. Pitt is not worth his salt and Steve Carell is the only one worth mentioning. The main problem with this item is the absence of electrifying and captivating connection that is really needed in each frame of the movie on one of the biggest financial scams of our time. Just lame!"
"tmccray","2","15","35","18 January 2016"," I Don't Get It
","Why is this movie so critically acclaimed? Why is it winning so many awards? I'm baffled. It's categorized as a comedy, and I don't understand why. Is it a black comedy? When the actors break the fourth wall, turn to the camera and have to explain why what's happening in the scene is so outrageous... is that supposed to be funny? <br/><br/>For the average movie-goer I think it will be an even more boring experience than it was for me. I'm a finance professional, so I already have some understanding of the jargon. I've also watched documentaries about the mortgage collapse (which were far superior to this), so this topic was not new to me. For someone without this background watching this movie must feel like being forced to sit and audit a college course in finance. <br/><br/>Why is Christian Bale winning Best Actor awards for his performance? He plays a one-note socially awkward, introverted shut-in. How hard is that? There was no range or depth to his role. <br/><br/>If you were working in the extended market of mortgage-backed securities during this time, you might find the irony played out on the screen, or the cartoonish characterizations of some of the key players amusing, but for the wider general audience, I don't get how they could be entertained by it. Maybe it's because Adam McKay's brand of humor does not resonate with me. I didn't think the Anchorman movies were funny, I thought they were dumb. Perhaps his target audience for this film is the same as for those and they will appreciate this type of ""humor""."
"TheMaster01","5","12","27","21 February 2016"," The Big Mess
","Okay. So why is 'The Big Short' an average film?<br/><br/>It's messy. Tonally, it's all over the place, featuring inconsistent uses of fourth wall breaks, random advertisements and clips scattered throughout, and sitting up in the director's chair, we have Adam McKay. The director of Anchorman (along with many other Ferrell-starring comedy vehicles), was not the right man to tell this story. Don't get me wrong, the subject matter is very interesting and necessary, adapted from the 2010 book of the same name which focuses on the financial crisis that hit in '07; but with such an important story to tell, was McKay the right man for the job? I'll let you decide. Unfortunately, I feel though his vision is scattered and the final product is rather uneven. The Best Director Oscar nomination is certainly surprising.<br/><br/>It's the inconsistencies and lack of attention to the small details that bothered me. The film has an excellent soundtrack, in terms of song choices, but the way 50% of the songs are used, feels very poorly applied. Jarring cuts, odd mixing levels, etc. The same goes for the fourth wall breaks. We meet Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling, who is excellent here) within the first few moments of the film, who essentially introduces the subject matter to us. It's okay, I can buy that, it's sort of reminiscent of Leo's discussions with the camera in The Wolf of Wall Street. But the fourth wall breaks that feel totally out of place, were (to name a few) the cut to Margot Robbie in the bubble bath, Selena Gomez gambling, even the ones between various supporting cast members. It took me out of the film for sure, I don't know about you. Gosling does get the most frequent asides though, which I was okay with. He certainly has a Leo-esque style about him.<br/><br/>So, it's 2005. Bare foot, shorts sporting Dr. Mike Burry (Christian Bale) has realised that the American housing market is very unstable, as it's built upon subprime loans that are providing fewer returns. In the film's terms, the market is built upon a bubble that he predicts will 'burst' within the next couple of years. Burry decides to bet against the housing market, creating a credit default swap (CDS) market which the banks gleefully accept, since they genuinely believe that there's no way in hell that the collapse will occur.<br/><br/>It's Burry's actions that are the catalyst for those of the film's other major players. Vennett, previously mentioned above, hears of Burry's unusual actions and comes to the realisation that he is absolutely right. The market is becoming increasingly unstable and so as Vennett jumps on board Burry's train of thought, Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) by accident hears of his actions and... yeah, you're getting the picture. Baum joins Vennett, hoping to profit from the CDS's as the result of the economy's collapse.<br/><br/>Other players include young naïve investors Charlie and Jamie (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock), who come across one of Vennett's papers; and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired banker, and old friend of Jamie's, who is one of the few figures who have a genuine fear concerning the losses of jobs and homes as a result of the eminent bubble burst.<br/><br/>I'll say it again, the information is important, the subject matter is brilliant, but at times, the way McKay and Randolph's screenplay ""dumbs-things-down"" for it's audience is totally ridiculous. And even then, watching a nude bathing Margot Robbie is enough to completely distract so you don't know what the hell she's talking about. Other points in the film throw so much financial jargon at you, it's hard to keep up, unless you go home from the cinema and try to google everything before you forget what you heard. If you can completely understand the concept of CDO's (basically ""re-packaged poor loans""), after one viewing of this film, then I take my hat off to you.<br/><br/>This review makes it sound like I hated the film, I realise that, but there is a lot to like here. Gosling's performance (and in particular the workplace bathroom scene) deserves praise. The honest human empathy and fear of the future reality expressed by Pitt certainly restored my faith in what seemed to be a world of greed and ease associated with turning a blind eye. Rickert states ""If we're right, people lose homes. People lose jobs. People lose retirement savings, people lose pensions. You know what I hate about f_cking banking? It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number - every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die, did you know that?"".<br/><br/>But I can't seem to shake how disjointed the whole film is. The poor music cuts, the uneven direction, the (overrated) dodgy editing; I genuinely wish I liked it more than I did, because it's got the appeal, but sadly, falls short on both style and occasionally, substance."

There is no dramatic material, but yes, there is a story, with two words, it is economic crisis, but the film itself is too informative. It was a motion picture, but on the other hand, not exactly. As for the acting, Bale just delivers, he was incredible! Steve Carrell was appreciable, but he was not as amazing as he was in Foxcatcher. The Big Short seems a hilarious joy ride, but it is not (considering only the first half of the film) The director tries some tricks to make the movie interesting, but it does not help. The Wolf of Wall Street which has a similar tone and plot looks like a real masterpiece in comparison with The Big Short despite ""Wall Street"" was not a perfect or amazing film considering other Scorsese masterpieces. As for Ryan Gosling, he is a joy to watch, but his character was boring. Brad Pitt? In the first half, he appeared for three minutes or something, then in the break, I walked out and I don't know about the second half. All those confusing and senseless terms make the movie more unbearable, but it was OK. Since my cinema experience was almost zero, I just couldn't make it. I don't know how can somebody tell us this story in a different way, but if there is not, maybe this could have been a mini TV series, semi documentary, a TV show or even a ""mockumentary"" Sincerely I apologize from all the actors in the movie who gave their best effort, the director and all the cast members and crew."

","The Big Short should be required viewing for everyone in the world affected by the financial crisis in 2008, which means almost everyone in the Western world and certainly everyone in America. Michael Lewis seemed to be one of the few journalists who actually understood what was going on and described it to readers in his book while Fox News was blaming the whole thing on a few deadbeat homeowners who didn't know the difference between a variable rate mortgage and money left on the street. Even the film tried to place at least part of the blame on strippers with a couple of home equity loans which is complete crap. <br/><br/>One of the conversations in the book went something like this: ""Who would take out a loan on a house if they couldn't make the first payment?"" This was countered by Steve Eiseman, ""Who would give a home loan to someone who couldn't make the first payment?""<br/><br/>The housing meltdown was the biggest crime in US history and, as the film points out, no one went to jail for it except one unlucky Wall Street slob. The truth is that the police should have taped off all of this end of Manhattan and designated it a crime scene and out courts should have brought a huge crowd of people to justice. Instead no laws were changed and the same thing, or something even worse, is likely to happen again sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>The film does a marvelous job not only of making the technical details understandable to the layman but in making a supremely entertaining film (the most important thing in cinema). Spoiler Alert: The bad guys win in this movie. The rest of us lost and will continue to lose until we stand up and do something about it."

The acting was mostly melodramatic and Steve Carell was terrible and miscast as a brilliant investor. Nothing about him screams brilliant. Annoying, yes; brilliant, no. <br/><br/>The saddest part about the movie is that most viewers will see it as a tell all on the financial crisis because they'd rather get their news from Hollywood than from the research.

","Well, people with knowledge about economics and loans will understand this film better than most. Most will spend the film trying to wrap their heads around what is being said. This is the exact reason there are moments in the film which break the fourth wall - specific celebrities are depicted (as themselves) giving oversimplified analogies directly to the audience to help them along the way. Thanks for the help, but it would be nice to be able to understand what is said in the first place than to be patted on the back by the filmmakers who are saying ""it's okay, we know you're trying your best but we're here to help.""<br/><br/>In the sense that the economic jargon is complex the film is not necessarily bad, but it fails to be entertaining. What IS entertaining is the acting. All good performances here. Christian Bale plays a manic with subtle giveaways such as his distracted persona and his jamming out to music and nonchalant failure to wear shoes in the office. It's hard to say whether his manic depiction of Michael Burry is accurate, but it makes sense and is well-done since manic is very close to genius sometimes, which is exactly what Burry proves to be in this film. Bale can definitely play unstable from viewing previous performances in American Psycho and The Fighter, and he does it again here. Ryan Gosling adds personality to the film, not falling short when portraying a self-righteous jerk whose narration is not that different than DiCaprio's narration in The Wolf of Wall Street. Steve Carell is great in a dramatic role once again after proving his dramatic ability in roles in Little Miss Sunshine and Foxcathcer. Brad Pitt is okay - we don't really get to see much of him in the film, but he plays his character as it was meant to be played. There is a good moment when his character acts as a moral voice of reason, and that is probably the most emotional moment for him in the film and it is very quick.<br/><br/>Discussing The Big Short after viewing it is a recommendation - it might help to clarify that the story in general is understandable and deals with good questions about morality versus greed.

And successfully so if you can trust awards bodies. Same goes for Christian Bale (and Steve Carell to a lesser extent). However, I can not share the praise that this film has been getting. Bale and Carell have some good moments, but are occasionally over the top too. Gosling is pretty embarrassing with his talking to the audience as a younger, very poor man's version of Marty Kaan and I am not a fan of ""House of Lies"". Brad Pitt (also a producer here) is almost unrecognizable because of his makeup and adds nothing memorable to the film either. There are enough characters in here, but you never feel for any of them.<br/><br/>Early on, the film starts with pretty pretentious quotes by famous writers. Not much later, the film says that Wall Street profits a lot from people not understanding economical terms used by businessmen. All this is certainly true and I hoped that this film would become easier accessible at this point when it made said statement. It did not. People may not understand businessmen, but we also do not understand the men in this film either. Funnily enough, they use text to explain stuff mentioned by the characters on 1 or 2 occasions, but it's so random and doesn't help at all in the grand picture. It tries to be a documentary occasionally, but completely fails in getting the audience involved. McKay must have realized this and that's why he included the sob story for Carell's character completely out of nowhere.<br/><br/>I really wish the movie would have run 100 minutes max instead of 130 and actually managed to teach the audience something. They did not succeed on an informative level. They did not succeed on an emotional level. Honestly, they basically did not succeed on any level. I am writing this as somebody who does not have much of an interest into economy. But this is not a film that will get you interested. This is a film that will entirely shut you out if you do not have a profound interest in the matter. This is quite a shame as the contents in this movie were one of the most important developments of the 21st century that affected millions of people. I wish McKay could have given this a shot easier to access, like for example Reitman did in terms of unemployment with ""Up in the Air"". Baco to this one, it baffles me to see all the favorable reception from audiences, critics and awards bodies. I guess their egos in most cases are too big to admit that they had no clue what was going on in this borefest. Not recommended and 4/10 stars is actually pretty generous."

","I gotta admit, I didn't watch the Oscars but this movie was up for an award and I'm now convinced that the Oscars are probably fixed because The Big Short cannot be enjoyed by an average viewer and so I'm wondering who exactly watched this movie in order to get it nominated for best picture.<br/><br/>I'm being completely honest when I say that the only people who can watch and understand this movie are people who are directly connected to or effected by the subject matter, which is the housing bubble that allowed people to get home loans whether they could afford a home or not and then when the rates went up, many people lost their home.<br/><br/>The dialogue is so complicated and sophisticated that unless you are a real estate agent, a stock broker, a banker, or an employee of the housing administration, OR someone that lost their home, you will not understand this movie because it's a bunch of numbers and real estate jargon and very fast paced and hard to follow !<br/><br/>The all- star cast is probably what got this movie nominated for an Oscar but the movie itself is not for the average Joe."

","The Big Short cannot be dedined as a bad film. It is funny, interesting and in general a very good satire of the high life in America. The film also boasts a massive cast, all of whom do well, in particular Steve Carell and Christain Bale.<br/><br/>However, the film tries to do too much for a single film. There are too many characters, organisations and terms to keep up with and as a result the film becomes very confusing. The celebrity cameos work very well in explaining certain terms. Unfortunately there are only three of these in the entire film. <br/><br/>Its also a classic case of style over substance. The film tries to give off a modern, cool feeling which does not apeal to all viewers. The final result feels more like a sketch show about a few flashy Americans with a plot so complex that it tends to alienate the viewers and failing to actually inform, which is what most viewers want from this film."
"bkoganbing","7","3","5","16 March 2016"," People Always Pay Their Mortgages
","The Big Short is a good if not entirely successful attempt to explain the economic collapse of the housing market. Banks lend money to people for mortgages, issue bonds based on the money that gets paid like clock work from hard working people who pay their mortgages to own their own home. I remember in the late 80s my mom paid off the final installment on a house my parents bought in 1955.<br/><br/>But my parents weren't deadbeats and banks started getting looser and looser with easy credit. They began issuing what was called sub prime loans which is below the interest market rate. Those did go more and more to deadbeats and there's one great scene where a well proportioned woman tells us exactly what sub prime is and to run whenever you hear the words mentioned.<br/><br/>Several people in the brokerage and the banking businesses got a scent of what was to happen to the various brokerage houses and the investment portfolios that had those bonds. People lost billions and that is no exaggeration. Like in the Stock Market crash of 1929 people saw that coming and sold out as well. A few got rich and even richer like Joseph P. Kennedy then. Most went bust.<br/><br/>Some of the people who got the bad odor from the banks were people played by folks like Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling, John Magaro, Finn Wittrock, and Brad Pitt who was in the investing game and has an interesting role as one who is now living a modified hippie lifestyle. Magaro and Wittrock have their own small brokerage firm and Pitt gives them some sage advice.<br/><br/>I liked Carrell the best because he has the best scenes in the film, when he personally investigates who some of those mortgages have been issued to. His scene with the stripper is priceless.<br/><br/>It might help to have a business background, but The Big Short breaks it down for you as simply as possible. I might not have understood all the nuances, but I was entertained."

","A few days ago, my wife told me that the French President, who made finance his personal enemy in election days had just voted a law, making people losing all their money if their bank were out of business, no one knew that, it was during summer. But she knew, she works in a bank. And God after watching ""The Big Short"", I'm not the least surprised. When will people understand how the game works, dammit? <br/><br/>""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.""<br/><br/>As much as I like this Twain quote, I wish they used instead ''A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain."" <br/><br/>The greatness of Adam McKay's biographical tragicomedy (tragedy emphasized) lies in its pedagogical value: with fourth-wall breaking, a dense but easily-digestible script (co-written with Charles Randolph) and brilliant cameos explaining the complex intricacies of the credit system, you quickly catch the drift. The umbrella metaphor would've been one of these images that speak thousand words. And on that level, the collapse of the housing market in 2008 isn't exactly a 'Gene Kelly' rain, more of 'Noah's ark' one.<br/><br/>The film, like an ominous ticking bomb, chronicles the chain of events leading to the disaster, just like ""Titanic', we know the end but the dynamite-editing makes the experience so exhilarating. It's like ""Crisis for Dummies"", the dummies we were for trusting our bankers more than our intelligence. How a credit works, where your money goes, and how you fill the portfolio of poker-face crooks who know how to make a delicious stew out of rotten fish heads.<br/><br/>Cheating is such a part of the game that the question is not 'how did that happen?', but 'how could that 'NOT' happen? The very premise of credit is fallacious when you think about it (and this comes from someone who's still paying his studies loan debts after 14 years). The greatest trick of the credit system is to make you believe that you can buy something you actually can't. And this is why sub-prime loans (high risks for fewer returns, worthless mortgages making as worthless bonds) have been created, this is the butterfly's fart that will end up in a hurricane, and hedge fund manager Michael Burry( (Christian Bale) smelled the fart before everyone else.<br/><br/>Burry checks a few lines and columns on Excel, and decides to ""short the bond"", meaning to bet against the housing market by creating a credit default swap market. Let's just say, it's like investing on pharmaceuticals when you're the only one who knows about the imminence of a bacterial war. Many banks accept his offer, which implies that he'll hit the jackpot only in the (then unconceivable) case that the housing market collapses. It's one of these cases where even Bale can betray in his eyes, the one that works anyway, something like ""I wish I was wrong"", and he's not the only one who feels this way.<br/><br/>There's Mark Baum, another hedge manager who's alerted by a trader played by Ryan Gosling about Burry's move. They can see the sword of Damocles over their heads and do their own investigations, from estate agents bragging about their exploits: selling expensive houses to poor schmucks or Standards & Poors selling lousy debt obligation with excellent ratings (law of the market), they know there's something fishy. Meanwhile, two young investors (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) learn about the situation and with the help of a retired banker, played by Brad Pitt, they go to Mortgage Securities Forum in Las Vegas and make enough deals to be able to buy out the same 'insurance' than Burry, they're on the safe side.<br/><br/>And this is when Pitt's character interrupts their celebration by reminding them, that lives will be lost at each percentage of unemployment rising, and that there's nothing to be joyful about. And that's what makes ""The Big Short"" such a magnificent storyteller. Just when you get an overdose of financial jargon, you have Margot Robbie in a bathtub explaining to you the mortgage system (the script should win the Oscar just for that), just when you wonder what has become of this character, you get to him, and just when the comedic tones gets too palpable, you have a moment of genuine decency reminding you that that the film is the chronicle of a predicted tragedy.<br/><br/>There's a similar moment where Mark Baum discusses with a businessman who created synthetic CDOs, increasingly large bets on faulty loan brilliantly explained by Selena Gomez who plays a black jack player inspiring many viewers to bet for her on the basis that she had won every time. She'd lose ultimately but it's one thing to lose five thousands on a risk that cost you five thousands, but when financial tricks turns the five thousand into millions, in terms of massive destructive weapons, these CDOs are the real stuff, and Baum knows the bomb is soon to explode. It's almost ironic that his name sounds like Boom.<br/><br/>It makes sense that some cultures forbid interest rates on the basis that nothing should be bought above its intrinsic value. Metal has value, salt has value, but what value has paper than the numbers written on? Why should it take you 20 years to buy an apartment thrice its price? Because finance says '1$ today isn't 1$ tomorrow', I know, but well, whatever these billions were worth before the crisis, they totally vanished in 2008 putting millions of people jobless, homeless and many of them lifeless.<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is an important movie with the epic ambition of Michael Moore's docs, the spellbinding editing of ""JFK"" and the fast-paced entertainment of ""Goodfellas"" except that this time, the gangsters are not arrested in the end."

","The Big Short (2015) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Four different groups of people notice that something isn't quite right with the housing market and soon make a large wager that the economy is going to fall apart.<br/><br/>Trying to sell America on a film that deals with a true story of the market collapse isn't the easiest thing to do and I must admit that I was shocked when THE BIG SHORT became a modest hit at the box office. I was even more shocked when I realized Adam McKay was the director behind this film but I was even more shocked at how wonderful he handled the material once the end credits started to roll. I mean, who thought that McKay would handle such a tricky story just like you'd expect Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman? <br/><br/>I purposely used those three filmmakers to make my point. The Hitchcock connection comes from that director liking to let you know you're in danger and then he milks the suspense. THe same is done here as you know going into the movie that millions of Americans are going to lose their homes and their jobs so McKay lights the bomb at the start of the film and THE BIG SHORT just grows with tension leading up to the final collapse. The Altman connection is how McKay uses four different groups of people acting during the same period to build up to the conclusion. All four stories are all very interesting on their own and the director perfectly mixes them together and plays them well off of each other.<br/><br/>As for the Scorsese connection, there's a whole lot of creative style on display here and just look at the wonderful cinematography that pretty much throws you into the middle of these meetings and you almost feel as if you're listening and watching something that you're not supposed to be. The style also really shows off the various lifestyles and the wild nature of Wall Street. Scorsese had tackled the excess in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, which would make a perfect double feature with this film. The score, the music selections and the dialogue just jump off the screen and perfectly create a world that most watching the film probably won't be a part of.<br/><br/>Of course, then there are the wonderful performances that bring these characters, the situations and the dialogue to life. Christian Bale, is there anything this guy can't do? He plays another weirdo here but is there anyone who does it better or more believable? Steve Carell plays perhaps the most troubled character here and the actor turns in the greatest performance of his career. Ryan Gosling's dry humor is perfect for the black comedy in the film and Brad Pitt is also extremely good even though he plays the most laid back character. Throw in Marisa Tomei, Melissa Leo, Rafe Spall, John Magaro and Finn Wittrock and you've got some of the best acting that you're going to see all year.<br/><br/>THE BIG SHORT left me a tad bit nervous the first ten minutes because I wasn't quite sure if it was going to be able to grab me and hold my attention throughout. After all, it's story is a confusing one that you have to keep up with but McKay does a marvelous job at using humor to get the more confusing parts across and it works perfectly. This is certainly a very intelligent film that gets its message across without having to scarifies the entertainment level. It's certainly a creative gem that actually works."

","I gave this film the highest rating because it goes beyond entertainment to attempt to explain how the system could be so fatally flawed. I think I will watch it again so I can thoroughly understand the details. The movie is not partisan. But if you get your economic views from Fox or Drudge you will hate this movie. Both sides were guilty of the asinine deregulation of the banks that created casino capitalism. As late as 2008 one presidential candidate was saying that ""the fundamentals of the economy are strong"". The movie shows how the rating agencies that gives the bonds their letter grades are both incompetent and corrupt. The ending is remarkable because it lays out in stark terms how the bad guys not only won but got the US taxpayer to subsidize the bank CEOs' and managers' multi-million dollar bonuses that they are still getting. Only one low level banker got a prison term for this evil act of raw greed and corruption. <br/><br/>The American people still don't understand what happened (because a lot of people at the top don't want them to know). This movie is a long overdue first step in explaining it."

It's a story better told than acted, and just not very entertaining as presented. It might be at least a little interesting to someone who is very much into stock trading, history, economics, or wall street, as long as they are not concerned with a very accurate representation of what went on. If you just want to hate Wall Street, and the high rollers, this might give you some satisfaction, but I wanted some entertainment, and it was severely lacking.

","I had mixed feelings before watching this movie - many people were saying this is one of year's best, but it's also on a such of specific matter-the financial crisis in the middle of the last decade. I don't want to go into details regarding the movie, but it was done in such a manner and in such a language (it's supposed to be in English :)), that for a person who is not personally involved in the financial world and terms, it is completely not understandable. After watching it, I was thinking: I lost 2 hours of my life watching a movie (not for the first time), but after these 2 hours I have nothing to show for - I didn't understand anything of it (maybe for the first time). OK, I said even if it's not my kind of movie, I should at least know what is going on in it! Well no-it was done in such a way, that I am pretty sure, even the actors in it didn't know what they are talking about. And these are some great actors-Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian Bale... They played good, but they had no clue, what's going on! Even if the original idea was good-to make a movie about this, it was done in completely the wrong way! The Globes nominated it for best picture comedy (and what's horrifying me, it's probably gonna win), but let's be honest-there is not a single funny moment in this movie. I have never watched my watch so many times in the course of 2h. In my opinion this was one of the worst and most boring movies of 2015!!! This is a proof how you can waste such a talent - and the talent gathered in The Big Short (very short) was great."

","The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay and is written by Christian Randolph and Adam McKay. It stars Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, Marisa Tomei, and a slew of other talented actors. <br/><br/>Four outsiders in the world of high-finance who predicted the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s decide to take on the big banks for their lack of foresight and greed.<br/><br/>The Big Short can best be summarized in 2 words; Wildly Uneven. It is a well written, well directed, and well acted spectacle, yet I didn't care about most of it's real life subjects and was infuriated by its execution and its overly fast pace.<br/><br/>This complex tale of corporate greed at its most nefarious lies squarely on the shoulders of its two writers. What they create is thoroughly entertaining satire, even if they did not fully explore the complexities of its real life story. Accomplished writer- director Adam McKay unleashes one the funniest and most insightful scripts, he has ever put out. With a strong hold on pop culture, fourth wall breaks, and narration as well as a deft mixing of dry and wet humor, The Big Short is one of the most formidable political comedies. There lies the problem. Unable to skillfully shift between a light comedy to a compelling drama, this film features some jarring tonal shifts, which really plucked me out of the movie. This accompanied an over use of jargon and a lot of underdeveloped, unlikable lead characters.<br/><br/>The direction of this movie is just as tangled as its writing. Though intense and passionately filmed, the decidedly speedy pace compromises the merit of both the script and the direction. Rushing through important details, audience members are given no breathing room and no time to process the information launched at then.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is pristine. The only problem is most of the characters, though well portrayed, come of as top shelf hypocrites, which makes it hard for me to relate to and even harder for me to care about them. With that said however there were three stand out performances that somewhat break this mold.<br/><br/>Steve Carell delivers a nuanced performance as shares manager, Mark Baum. Demonstrating a keen sense of justice, Carell brings Baum to life, even if he does over act at times. Ryan Gosling, my favorite character in the movie, embodies the fact that he's a scum bag and just rolls with it, offering an entertainingly slick performance.<br/><br/>Though Carell and Gosling are very good, I personally feel that Christian Bale stole the show in every scene he was in. The only genuinely relate able character in the lot, Bale conveys one of his more complex characters with a great deal of sensitivity, making it one of his best performances to date.<br/><br/>The Big Short is thoroughly watchable and entertaining, even if it is completely uneven. The Big Short gets a B or a 6/10."

","I would say this movie is for certain people who are smart enough to remotely understand what actually happen back in 2007. <br/><br/>The Big Short uses comedy bits in which they would get people to explain complex finance to the dim crowd (like Margot Robbie explains triple A loans while bathing in a bath tub). I'll be honest with you, I did not fully understand, but that is not important. <br/><br/>The style of them explaining it to you is to grab the attention of the people who got screwed or just felt screwed because the banks screwed up and screwed us. <br/><br/>It's one of those movies that gets the Left wing cheering cause it smartly exposes something we all already know. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie was actually the performances of the actors. Steve Carell is known for his comedic acting, and he's able to take that talent and put it into a drama, easily. Christian Bale's awkward genius was genius and brought some steady humor. While Ryan Gosling was the key element of this movie. He was charming and likable even though he was playing the guy we should all hate. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a great attempt by director Adam McKay to dress up a serious movie as a comedy, And it is really easy to like cause he's exploiting everyone's harsh feeling on the Real estate bubble burst."
"JaysonT","10","4","8","30 December 2015"," One of the BEST Films of 2015!
","Just finished The Big Short- blows Spotlight out of the water! I loved it. The first 10 minutes made me think it was trying to ripoff The Wolf of Wall Street and GoodFellas with ""gangsta tawk"" voice- overs and camera stills, but trust me- this is not a distraction once the story gets going. While Spotlight focuses on the topic of scandalous Priests and the Catholic Church, The Big Short focuses on the housing market crash and corporate greed. In terms of topics alone, Big Short feels more important. I'm not downgrading the former movie's subject matter and dismissing it entirely. I'm simply stating Big Short already has a theme voters will relate to more.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the rest. First of all, Kudos to Adam McKay- this is a splendidly vibrant and compelling movie, and his direction is quick and alive. I think he's a VERY strong contender for Best Director, not only in the nomination department- but also the win. We'll see what DGA says, but right now he's in my predictions. <br/><br/>The acting was stronger then the ensemble work in Spolight, the former movie having a solid cast but no one seemed to really come to life save Tucci and Ruffalo. Where as here, EVERYBODY is electrifying. Christian Bale and Steve Carell are the standouts, and Bale def deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Carell also - WOW- just didn't expect him to be this good after being slightly underwhelmed with his work last year in Foxcatcher. But he's brilliant in this- and both him and Bale are also very funny! I also enjoyed Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Finn Wittrock, Jeremy Strong, John Magaro and Marisa Tomei (the latter being a relief to see playing a wife who's actually the proper age; if this movie had been directed by David O. Russell, ten points for guessing who he would have cast). <br/><br/>The screenplay is also fresh and informative. Even if you're someone like me who doesn't understand all the fundamentals or backdrops for what caused the housing market crash or how banks operate, this movie breaks it down so it's a little more clear- and in fun, innovative ways including a cameo by Selena Gomez playing blackjack in Las Vegas. <br/><br/>I know Spotlight is still the favorite, but with a year so open and full of surprises- looking for an alternative to go against it might be The Big Short and not the sci-fi threesome (which may be a two pair or just a loner by Oscar Nomination morning). The Golden Globes are on January 10th- and if any movie is beating The Martian for the Comedy Globe, this is your horse to bet on. The SAG Ensemble award also could be going to The Big Short cast, which in my eyes did a hell of a better job then Spotlight's must quieter group"

It uses creative film-making techniques (film buffs will love it), it is entertaining and suspenseful from start to finish, it has a powerful sense of humor, it pulls up big emotions in an honest, non-cheesy way -- and most of all, it puts the truth about something BIG that's wrong and evil in the world in a plain and blunt way. The director is known for big, satirical comedies like Talladega Nights and Anchorman, and here he makes use of really wicked (good) satire to tell the story of the financial collapse of 2008 in a way that stays interesting and, for most of the movie, a lot of fun. The fact that the movie is so skillfully crafted and so enjoyable to watch only makes the impact of the real tragedy at the end (the financial crash and the fact that most of the crooked bankers GOT AWAY WITH IT) that much greater.

His books tell the story of their abnormality. The financial world is just the background. In other books, he has used baseball as the background. Billy Beane in ""Moneyball"", for example.<br/><br/>The movie makers invert the emphasis and makes the financial background the foreground and makes the book's fascinating characters little more than decoration. The book is mostly about Mike Burry and explains how he always though of himself as different because of his glass eye, but it turns out that it was really because he had Asperger's Syndrome, which isn't even mentioned in the movie. Instead, we get Christian Bale walking around in bare feet and playing loud music in what is surely one of the worst written characters and shoddiest performances ever to be seen in a major movie. It was just painful to watch and has no resemblance to the Mike Burry of the book They couldn't even be bothered to give him a glass eye, which is the dominant part of his appearance.<br/><br/>The reason for the inversion is obvious - so that left wing Hollywood could make an attack on their favorite target, big business. While they got some things right, they selectively omitted a lot. Like how pressure from left-winger politicians like Barney Frank and Mario Cuomo lit the match on the melt down by forcing banks so abandon sound lending practices and give loans poor people who would never be able to pay them back. Or how many state governments tried to reign in subprime lending but were attacked by do-gooder housing advocates and couldn't get legislation passed. Or how the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae used same do-gooder housing advocates to prevent any oversight and allow them to run wild buying subprime securities with losses insured by taxpayer money. Or how academic computer quant nerds told Wall Street that they could sell the subprime securities with virtually no risks. Or how most of the subprime money went, not to first mortgages, but to speculators and refi's, greedy homeowners who used the money to live beyond their means. Most of all, they ignore the fact that the little band of heroes were actually throwing fuel on the fire by buying the credit default swaps. Each credit default swap equaled the creation of thousands of new toxic mortgages.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but you get the idea. If you want to see a good movie about the financial crisis, try ""Margin Call""."

","Most reviews rave about the accuracy of this film. The saddest thing about our country is how terrible our schools and media are now. Yes, this is a truly great film from a story and acting standpoint, but it is fiction and propaganda.<br/><br/>If you want the real story read nysalesman's 3 star review ""Short on Truth."" Blame the Clintons, Bush, and Obama for high crimes against us all. The banks and corporations will always try to make money as each of us does in our own way to survive. But in this case the banks were forced to lend to anybody who wanted a house no matter how bad their credit or employment history, as long as they were part of a minority. If lenders did not fund every loan there were huge fines to pay, not to mention total government takeover. Many other things were done by Congress to make this happen but basically no one ever paid the price besides us. Bush added 5 trillion to the debt and Obama 10 just printing money and borrowing from China to pay for it.<br/><br/>I have been researching Hollywood historical pics made during the past 40 years. Never believe a biopic or historical drama unless you have already done thorough research yourself. They are always lying; propagandizing, and convincing who to hate. They stoke emotions for their agenda and make up facts. Don't forget who caused the Great Depression: Congress and the Fed, not Wall Street."

But just because I didn't understand it doesn't mean I'm going to give it a bad rating. This movie is filled with fantastic performances from the whole cast. Also the editing of this movie is what honestly made me keep watching. Some people might find it annoying but I thought it was terrific editing.

"dbowtell","6","2","3","24 May 2016"," A tough gritty movie - fractured
","It is hard to describe this film, and perhaps even harder to say whether it is a good film or a bad film. It is certainly one that make you emote and you can read that in the other reviews. It's aim is to lay bear the scandalous behaviour of the banks and how the financial system let us all down with their bad behaviour. To this end the film does its job, the problem is how it does that.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's character typifies the problem with this film. His character is a borderline autistic genius investor who is the first to lay a long and obscene bet against the market (a short). But since his character is largely devoid of character we just see him mooning about his office so bored that he looks like he'd consider another Batman role. Once he lays the bet he has nothing to do till the money roles in. And this the problem: we all know where this is heading so the though part is to inject drama and interest into the tedious nature of jargonised banking. This is never going to be riveting stuff.<br/><br/>However, as tough as the subject matter is the weird and clunky direction does not help. At times it appears that the director got bored and just ended scenes on the cutting room floor. Other times the strange use of celebrities to explain the jargon is distracting, patronising and somewhat sexist. Margot Robie's turn in a bath tub just seemed weird, rather than knowing and cool.<br/><br/>The subject matter is important, but it's failure to really entertain is its biggest problem."
"dikaea","10","2","3","26 February 2016"," The financial Matrix and guess who the batteries are...
","I saw the movie just a few hours ago. I liked it. I have no training whatsoever in the banking-financial system. I have watched a few documentaries (as I am sure most people have done) about finances and the economy and I used all these knowledge to help me through the movie. I had to pause and rewind a few times to try to get the idea of what was shown.<br/><br/>Definitely it is difficult to understand if one does not know the banking lingo. But any kind of movie that deals with a specific subject will have to use the specific lingo. For example if it is a movie about a sport, or a technical subject etc etc or something you are not familiar with, then you will hear a lot of terms that have to do with that specific subject. And if you have no or little idea about the subject, you will either get confused, bored of feel stupid or won't care. <br/><br/>And THAT it is clearly pointed out in the beginning of the movie. You will either get confused, bored, feel stupid ooooooor you will just not care......<br/><br/>It is a Hollywood movie after all and that will make someone not trust it and say ""well it is a movie and not all facts, hell most of them are just a story and are not true or made to look a certain way to serve some side"". Well, I will have to agree. Hollywood is a well oiled ENTERTAINMENT machine to ""feed"" the masses and serve a purpose.<br/><br/>Confused and bored I understand... maybe even stupid cause 90% of us have not studied banking/economics. But how can anyone not care about how some F#$@#$%^ers have designed and used all these scams to F$%^&* up the economy and people's lives worldwide!?!?!?!?!?<br/><br/>Not all movies are made to ENTERTAIN. Some actually are made to say something even if they are done the Hollywood way. And it is up to the individual to get interested, to get thinking, to dig dipper, to want to learn more. What they come up with is solely up to them.<br/><br/>I read reviews on the movie. For those who didn't like it cause it wasn't entertaining I have no argument with. They watch a movie, any kind of movie, only to be entertained and that is their right. But for those that didn't like it cause it was difficult to follow or cause they saw it from a political point of view, I believe they have lost the whole point. Some reviews asked the question about the demographic of this movie. In my opinion it should start with 15-16 year old teenagers, boys and girls of course of all races and religions. Just like in that age one begins to get to know how to drive and gets sexual orientation that can actually understand the why and the how and all that is included. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, a parallel is made with the Big Depression 80 something years ago. I have read in the reviews that there is no mention about the Federal Reserve and how it operates. That was totally spot on cause that is the base for all financial and fiscal matters and how the economy is being run. Democrats and Republicans (chose whichever political sides in the country you live in) don't matter. Only the FED(and the equivalent of any country you live in) does. But that is a story to be shown in another movie..... or anyone can look for details in writing or in documentaries. If one does so, then one will better understand the movie in discussion and have a better idea what banks/bankers are all about in collaboration with the governments (all kinds of political side governments) all over the world.<br/><br/>There are no good guys in this movie, in this story. There are only people who operated in the system, found a flaw? in it and manipulated it to benefit from it. Like Steve Carrel character's wife tells him: ""Saints do not live on Park Avenue"". Some of them felt shitty about it one way or another, some didn't. Characters in this movie/story are not portrayed so that the majority of the audience can like or identify with them. <br/><br/>So, it is upon the viewer and how much information they have or want to have."
"john_seater","8","2","3","24 February 2016"," Well done, grossly misrepresents the real causes of the collapse
","This movie is very entertaining. It does a good job of explaining some rather abstruse financial instruments. Overall it is informative. Unfortunately, it also is grossly misleading about what really caused the housing bust in 2007 and the financial turmoil of 2008. Both were almost entirely the result of misguided federal policies that accumulated over several decades and that reinforced each other. The movie, in contrast, makes it seem as if the only important cause was greed by the financial institutions.<br/><br/>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which exist because of federal policy, funneled excessive funds into housing. They did it in response to federal policies of the 1990s that pushed or even required lower lending standards. They also did it to curry favor with Congress after they were found to have been lying in their accounting in the early 2000s. The Fed kept interest rates abnormally low, making loans cheap to take out. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1992 reduced taxes on capital gains on houses, making houses more attractive investments, thus stoking demand still more. Federal law makes mortgage loans no-recourse, encouraging speculation. The SEC required big financial institutions to get bond ratings from only those ratings agencies approved by the SEC. That was bad enough because it prevented competition through entry, but the SEC's attention wandered and it allowed the original 7 approved agencies to dwindle to 3 by 2007 because of closures and mergers, further eliminating competition. The Community Reinvestment Act required financial institutions to make unsound loans. The SEC did not bother to investigate the new financial instruments (well-described in the movie) to see if they were sound. Eliot Spitzer (at last a non-federal player), using his office as Attorney General of New York as a springboard for the governorship of that state with his eye on an eventual run for the US presidency, abused his office to abuse financial institutions, leading directly to the destruction of the big financial institutions' research departments. Research personnel in 2007 were half what they had been in 2000, directly the result of Spitzer's shenanigans. There's more, but that's already perhaps too much.<br/><br/>The Big Short gets *NONE* of that right, except for a slight mention that the SEC fell down on its job. That's because The Big Short completely ignores all of it to push the easy but misleading drama of corporate greed.<br/><br/>The Big Short also misrepresents the housing collapse of 2007, presenting it as largely driven by sub-prime mortgages. In fact, default rates for prime mortgages were just as bad.<br/><br/>As of this writing, The Big Short is a leading contender for a Best Picture Oscar, largely because it portrays an event of considerable national importance. It doesn't deserve the award on those grounds (though it is in fact a fine movie) because it grossly misstates what happened and thus lays the foundation for subsequent bad public policy to fix the problem. That's why I give it an 8 rather than a 10.<br/><br/>The acting was very good throughout. Everyone is making a big to-do about Christian Bale's performance. It was OK but nothing special. I though Steve Carell turned in the best performance and deserved a nomination.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, about that nasty Chinese guy in the movie who explains CDOs and CDOSquareds and who obviously was behaving in bad faith. He was real, and he was found guilty of gross professional misconduct, barred from working in the financial industry, and given a big fine. His company had to pay a separate big fine. He didn't go to jail, but at least he won't be deceiving the public again."

","If ever there was a film that typifies the last 10 years, it's The Big Short. It's filmmaking in its quickest form. And much credit goes to director Adam McKay, who has made a film so rapid fire that it even makes Vince Vaughn stop to catch his breath. It mirrors what goes on in today's multi-tasking society. But also what Wall Street has been doing for decades.<br/><br/>Connecting three stories without much crossover, The Big Short deals with what led to the financial crash of 2008 and the radical few who had the wisdom and the gall to see it coming and act upon it.<br/><br/>It starts with Christian Bales' character, Dr. Michael Burry, a Silicon Valley hedge fund manager who spots an instability in the United States housing market, predicting that the market will collapse in a few years. Much to his investors' dismay, he goes out and bets against the housing market--something that apparently you just don't do--by purchasing $500 million in credit default swaps. Many others catch wind of this, but only several are keen enough to spot the method to Burry's madness. <br/><br/>The film tries and succeeds at making a dry topic appeal to the audience it wants. There's a lot of technical jargon, but McKay makes it easy for us to stay in the loop by doing unusual things like have ""Margot Robbie in a bubble bath explain it to you"". These celebrities explaining things happens a few times throughout the film for our enjoyment. McKay has such an unorthodox way of filmmaking, but it works here. Characters break the fourth wall about a dozen times, and he enjoys flooding the screen with intercut stills. It's actually very highbrow, but never makes us realize it. <br/><br/>It has a mockumentary feel to it at times, which explains why Steve Carell makes sense here. He plays Mark Baum, a Wall Street hedge fund manager who gets approached by Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) to invest in this whole credit default swap thing.<br/><br/>A third story revolves around these two young investors who happen to get wind of Gosling's plan. They contact Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), their financial adviser, who helps back the idea.<br/><br/>Each sub story is just as entertaining as the others, so you're never sitting there waiting for so- and-so to come back on screen. You never think about the fact that they're gone, but realize you missed them when they come back.<br/><br/>It's a powerful film, even though it might not seem like it is. It never strays from its point just to get a laugh. Each laugh feels deserved and the humor organic. And with a killer soundtrack (especially if you were a teenager during those years), it's definitely one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 98"
"manosnb","9","2","3","17 February 2016"," If you are into finance this is the movie for you..
","I have to admit that I have watched many ""wall street"" movies but none felt so real as this one. The fact that the script is based on a Michael's Lewis book obviously contributed significantly to that direction. In addition, the cast in this movie is amazing. I really appreciated the performances of Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, what truly made this movie shine was the lively description of so many different little aspects of the finance industry. From the bargaining with clients and the worries of an investment manager that he will face devastating fund outflows to the greed and hubris of the biggest investment bank employees. Yet, despite the fact that there are many things in this movie that you can't understand if you are not strongly familiar with the finance industry, the end and the main message is unambiguous to anyone. In my opinion, this movie got a bimodal distribution of ratings with two means, 9 from people in the finance industry and 8 from the rest."
"donegalcat","8","2","3","31 January 2016"," Witty expose of the banking crisis
","The Big Short focuses on four individuals who predicted the banking collapse of 2008 and so bet against the banks. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, a hedge fund investor who in 2005 predicted that the housing market would collapse and bring down the banks. Other investors, played by Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt soon get wind of Burrys prediction and decide to follow him. When they bet against the banks, the bankers laugh but take their bets thinking its easy money. But of course, as we know, these people were proved right as a mortgage crisis led to several banks collapsing while others were given huge government bailouts. The film does very well to explain the jargon behind the banking. Although the idea of getting celebrities such as Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain to give the explanations does wear thin. The film is very well acted, particularly Carrell who is on top form. Unfortunately the film does descend into Wolf of Wall Street style excess at times which can be wearying and seems to be a desperate attempt to add a bit of thrill to what is otherwise very dialogue heavy film. Women have a very small role in the film, other than when they are strippers being objectified. By the time Marisa Tomei reappeared near the end of the film, I had forgotten that she was in it. And while there is some mention, certainly more so than in WoWS, there could have been more about the consequences of the banking crisis for ordinary people who lost their homes and jobs. Overall though, the film is enjoyable and informative."
"BlackLemonTea","9","2","3","30 January 2016"," A story that was necessary to be told
","""The Big Short"" centers around a few outsiders who want to make huge profit of the falling housing market which is connected to the huge economical collapse in 2008/2009. Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt lead the cast. Although it is a very serious topic the story is narrated in a humorous way.<br/><br/>Let me start off with the many positive aspects of the film. To begin with, I liked how some characters broke the fourth wall occasionally. That is a very nice way of narrating the intricate topic. I am not really into economy and trading and have barely knowledge in that area, and I guess I am not the only one. I believe screenwriter Charles Randolph and director/writer Adam McKay knew this and tried to find a good and entertaining way to solve this problem. By breaking the fourth wall the audience gets ""taken"" into the story, we are made part of it (and if you think about it, we actually are part of it since the demise of the housing market influenced many of us). At many points I felt as if it was an educational movie. I really liked that. Moreover, the fourth wall played a vast role in terms of comedy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I absolutely fell in love with the editing. Extraordinary work was done by Hank Corwin. Some of the best editing I have seen this year. It was an unusual kind of editing and I needed some time to ""adapt"" to this, but the result was phenomenal. Quick cuts, freezes, zooms, unexpected cuts, montages etc. Outstanding work, I wouldn't be surprised if ""The Big Short"" wins the Oscar for ""Best Editing"".<br/><br/>Another great aspect of this movie was the acting. Steve Carell, you're a genius. The way he played his highly-flawed character was simply gorgeous. You hated him, but you loved him simultaneously. Christian Bale impressed me, too, as always. That guy is a chameleon. The roles he plays are simply unique and he always ""transforms"" to that character. I loved it. While Steve Carell and Christian Bale were the standouts, the rest of the cast did a very good job, too. I am not only talking about Brad Pitt, who played a different kind of role this time and from whom I would have liked to see more, or Ryan Gosling, who made a splendid comeback after having an acting break. I am talking about the whole cast. Everyone in the movie did a very solid job and fulfilled their respective role. Even the minor roles impressed heavily. That must have been one hell of a casting director.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the movie is narrated in a funny way. I liked the humor. It was a perfect mixture of comedy and drama. They did not overdo it with the jokes. Additionally, the timing was immaculate every time. But I think what made the movie funny was the result of characters that were ""caricatures"" of real people. The exaggerated way they were represented made it so much fun to follow the characters that partly drove the story.<br/><br/>The only thing missing was a memorable and unique soundtrack in my opinion. Do not understand me wrong, the tracks used in the movie were good, but one soundtrack with one ""theme"" would have been better I guess (see ""Spotlight"" for instance). The track that was playing during the trailer for example was fantastic and I would have preferred to hear more of that.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Big Short"" was an important movie telling a crucial story that addresses us all. It was a necessary piece of work. I loved the way it was narrated. The fourth wall, the editing and of course the writing played a big role in that. Did I understand everything? Hell no. Do I feel a little bit more educated? Definitely. The motion picture fulfilled its role in a funny and entertaining way. 8/10"

","After it won the PGA and became the front runner for the best picture Oscar, I decided to dive into the Big Short, one of the only nominees with a legitimate chance that I hadn't seen yet.<br/><br/>It's a pretty clever movie, and probably is deserving of best picture over the other contenders. Unlike Spotlight, which is similar in the sense that they are both about uncovering fraudulent and illegal activities and both are based on true stories that occurred during the early to mid 2000s, The Big Short uses much more clever dialogue, camera-work, soundtrack, and humor to make a story that may have seemed boring and flat and turn it into an enjoyable film watching experience.<br/><br/>Of course, it is not the most exciting of movies and it may be confusing at times for people who don't understand the Wall Street housing market lingo, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot of things you probably should know about, in addition to being exposed to some wisdom and inconvenient truths along the way.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how good the movie was since all of the Oscar buzz has been about Spotlight, which I didn't find nearly as entertaining as this, and the Revenant, which I liked but does possess some flaws that would be difficult for the academy to overlook if there was another serious contender. I highly recommend The Big Short as one of the best films of this year and one that will not disappoint, especially if you really are interested in learning about how the housing market collapse of 2007-2008 transpired and took place.<br/><br/>Bale gives a solid performance, Carrell is very good, the smaller roles are all fundamentally solid, and there is plenty of funny moments, lines, and humor sprinkled in so you'll get some laughs along the way too.

By the end of the film, I was sitting there glaring at the screen, trying to contemplate the film I had just seen. By the end of the film, I hated Wall Street and all the bankers that are involved there. By the end of the film, I was hoping that some sort of consequence will be given to these bankers, as I result of the big short.It is one of the most risky films of the 21st century, and I'm sure some big fish at the major banks are unhappy with this film.

","Paramount Pictures' The Big Short, based on the best selling novel by Michael Lewis, is the star- studded film that meticulously recreates the course of events that led to the worst financial crisis to hit the United States, and by extension the world, since the Great Depression. It isn't often that when I leave a movie that I instantly feel like I need to watch it again, but this is definitely one of them! Furthermore, this is a fantastic film to show any business or financial class on the graduate level. Brilliantly casted and directed, this film will have your utmost attention the entire time. In fact, when it's over, you will most likely want it to go on. Screenwriters Adam McKay (also the director) and Charles Randolph create a movie with such realism and candor that you will be able to truly understand the foundational problems that aided in creating the mortgage-backed security crisis which led to the housing meltdown and the loss of millions of jobs. The scariest part is, at the end of the movie, you will read that starting in 2015 that big banks are once again engaging in similar behaviors under a new name. The utter greed, absurdity, and naivety on display in this movie will leave you astounded.<br/><br/>The Bg Short is a biographical documentary-like drama that goes behind the headlines and years before the height of the financial crisis (now referred to as the Great Recession) and reveals the actions of big banks and front-line mortgage officers alike that contributed and eventually causes the housing meltdown. After one major hedge fund investor discovers that the big banks are buying up and selling bad mortgages, he takes actions that create a ripple effect amongst a small group of hedge fund financial investors that begin to sound the alarm that big banks refused to listen and believe. Against the odds, this small group of investors attempt to warn the big banks that the US financial system, and by extension the world, is in grave danger. This film follows several key players in this movement and sheds light on what was really happening behind closed doors.<br/><br/>If you want to gain a better understanding of what caused the housing meltdown and financial crisis, then plan to see this movie. Or, if you are just looking for a fantastic movie with suspense, mystery, and action, then plant see this movie. It is of no surprise as to how this movie has received Oscar nominations. The phenomenal cast brought these recent historical figures to life in only a way that a cinematic story can do. Full of intellectual action, this movie successfully delivers a powerful message with a brilliant story. Many times, the best stories are true ones, and it doesn't really get any truer or more visceral than this one. Not often can a movie capture a historic series of events with such accuracy whilst delivering a cinematic experience. More than a documentary, this film possesses a brilliant approach to the visual storytelling of a real modern-day crisis that isn't that far removed from today.<br/><br/>The combination of mostly an objective perspective with a healthy helping of subjective points-of- view makes this a unique experience. Watching this movie, I couldn't help but imagine that t almost plays out as something fabricated, made up for a gripping and dynamic plot; but the fact of the matter is that this really happened. Moreover, if the big banks continue in their ways and not learn from their mistakes, it could happen again. Although this is definitely a visually driven story, there are times that there is commentary or further information in the form of text or actors breaking the fourth wall. Ordinarily, I don't typically like moves where the characters speak directly to the camera or audience, but the manner run which the asides were written into this movie worked extremely well.<br/><br/>I will keep this review short because I definitely want to encourage people who want to gain a better understanding of the financial crisis to see this movie and experience it for themselves. You will definitely not be disappointed."

Christian Bale plays Michael Bury, a hedge fund manager who shelters himself in his office with the company of head phones and loud music. He discovers that the United States housing market is quite unstable and finds a way to profit from the situation leaving banks that he visits shaking their heads at the absurdity yet his prediction of the collapse rings true.

Steve Carell plays Mark Baum, a hedge fund manager troubled over the suicide of his brother during another financial loss. Baum is flustered over the crises to come and attends several meetings in attempts to sort out the mess but ultimately cannot avoid the questions that haunt him. John Magaro and Finn Wittrock play young investors eager to profit from the credit default swaps but seek refuge from a retired banker, played by Brad Pitt but he doesn't share their enthusiasm for what this will result in. Director Adam McKay steps away from the clever comedies that he has previously made and churns out this portrait celebration where the smaller factors suffer the worst. It is high end greed with consequences that result in many losing their homes. McKay is backed by witty writing and a grand scale cast who play host to the minds engaged in the most blatant get rich quick scam. Score: 10 / 10"

","Like Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short is another darkly comic biographical drama examining the morally bleak world of Wall Street. Whilst The Wolf revels in narcissism and vanity, The Big Short weaves moral ambitions into its story, which is told through the eyes of a number of investors who seek to exploit the 2008 US economic crisis. Outside of sharing a rather niche genre, other stark parallels include; utilising a narrator, a rapid editing style and delivering an exceedingly well made film. The Big Short may not reach the extravagant heights of The Wolf, however it succeeds more than amply on its own merits. Christian Bale's portrayal of socially incompetent investor Michael Burry transcends the rest of the cast and cements Bale as one of the most versatile actors today."

No one made money like they expected and simply by some turn of events, the whole corrupt and stupid system always tries to f**k up the common people and anyone who's not big enough. The cameos and the 4th wall breaking kept the narrative a fresh feeling and to a point was also educating. At the end, we see the rich get richer the poor get poorer and the guilty go free and this is a true story. Yet the blame is on immigrants and the poor.

Chrisitian Bale is just too f***ing good (excuse my French) in his role as the nerdy broker whose meticulousness is well complemented by his non-exuberant non wall street demeanour. Ryan Gosling is convincing as the plagiariser who knew what to do with the golden nugget of info. Steve Carell is probably right after Bale, if we choose to rank performance, that is. His rather unusual role as the uncaped crusader of wall street is interesting, and probably the most unlikely character but nonetheless one of the most pivotal ones as well. Brad Pitt was short and effective, and unremarkable, which is exactly what the story required.<br/><br/>But, again, the cameos. I don't really care if the top critics have a distaste for such stunts, but they were such a welcome footnote in bringing in some lightness to the convoluted jargon of finance. They were the garnish that's just makes the meal flavourful and a sight to behold.<br/><br/>And as a music lover, the end theme was right on the money.<br/><br/>Although, I have to admit, the amount of s**te that year produced, I believe my praise is kind of biased.

","The housing collapse of the mid 2000's affected just about everybody in many humanistic ways. The loss of jobs, homes, retirement, dignity, hope and dreams. The end results are shown through this film showing the greed and Teflon coating of Wall Street, here is relation to the mortgage industries and the trading involved surrounding the performance instability of their assorted products. The pop culture of Americans at the time is shown as establishing shots, and it's quite sad to see what is celebrated as success. ""It was too good to be true"" rings throughout and the moralistic viewpoint is driven hard. As a mortgage industry professional, I see this as a brutally honest overview of the attitudes of those who stood to profit on the retail side of the issues. Those Florida Loan Officers are portrayed quite accurately. There is a solid amount of audience participation, experienced through actors speaking directly to the audience out of character to ensure the x's and o's of the discussion are clear as crystal. As Wall Street jargon and the speed of which it is ""name dropped"" for showmanship also is brought down to the viewer level through celebrity cameos reiterating the fancy scenario is fast paced, but still plain English. This is where the movie works best, as you can not expose an issue if the audience doesn't understand what you are saying, and it's not entertaining is taught as a school lesson. A necessary film and an honest experience perked up with clever perspectives."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","1","17 April 2017"," a robust picture wrestling with something dauntingly intractable
","It takes guts to make a film has an indignant through-line in its core: the capitalistic turpitude resides inveterately in human's speculative and grasping inclination, because there is no redeeming feeling of triumph or sympathy with which one can empathize in the ugly truth. In the hands of those privileged few (bankers, financiers, mortgage brokers, real state agents, etc.), millions of ordinary people suffer as the brunt of its disastrous repercussions (the global financial crisis in 2008), and what's more unnerving, the same skulduggery is wheeled out under a new name soon after, and it will only take time to reach a boiling point again, there is absolutely no cure to change the status quo, because that's nuts and bolts of capitalism, who dares to overturn capitalism?<br/><br/>In the face of such exasperation and pessimism, which director Adam McKay has no scruples to force down viewer's throat (for some it may seem like a bolt out of the blue, but for majority of its audience, it is like flogging a dead horse: bankers are evil, roger that!), THE BIG SHORT pluckily alternates its three strands of individuals who successfully presage the crisis and leavens its mass appeal by using a mordant fourth-wall-breaking tack to elucidate its arcane gobbledygook and bean-spilling (sometimes with star cameos, for instance, Margo Robbie in her bathtub), interlaced with signposting snapshots and burnished by a cutting-edge montage job from Oscar-nominated editor Hank Corwin. In toto, it rounds outs as a disarmingly sleek infotainment.<br/><br/>But, there is a catch, reckoning the nature of those real-life characters' actions, they are whip- smart profiteers, who jump on the window of opportunity and feather their nests in the wake of others' miseries, yet, McKay and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph also try to hold some of them in the moral high ground - namely Steve Carell's Mark Baum, who is deviled by his conscience and brims with sense of justice, and Christian Bale's Michael Burry, an one-eyed geek who at least invests his Brobdingnagian gain into good use (says the film's epilogue) - which is a safe move but clashes with the cynical reality it depicts, whereas both Oliver Stone's WALL STREET (1987) and Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) are much more honestly unsparing in scrutinizing the too-big-to-fall pathology and its fetidness. So a skeptical mind would unavoidably question, whether the supposed compassion towards these characters belies McKay's unsavory agenda to veer the film's tenor from a stringent exposé to an adulation of their (self-seeking) acts? That is a dangerous signal.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is blameless though, Christian Bale's Oscar-nominated turn is hyperbolically eccentric, but he is competent enough to not let him slide into caricature and brings out a nice patina of ambiguity, dispassion and even pathos (why should we feel sorry for him?). Ryan Gosling is unapologetically bumptious (fun to watch thought) as the chief narrator and Brad Pitt, again, takes a beneficent role without too much challenge (12 YEARS A SLAVE 2013, remember?), which leaves Steve Carrell, who, actually, materializes a toothsome performance in a border-line leading role, carries the momentum engagingly until an eleventh-hour capitulation, only undercut by the conservative slant of the writers': kitted with such ammo, instead of rubbing the salt into the still- fresh wounds of a dysfunctional society, why not leaving a chipper mood to suggest opportunist can still run away with it? That is a minor disgrace in an otherwise robust picture wrestling with something dauntingly intractable.<br/><br/>P.S. My inner dialogue: ""- Hey, it is a biographical film, those who are still alive can sue us for calumny! - Yeah, than don't make a biopic, cinema is composed of lies, and reality sucks!."""

The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) removed the barriers created after the 1928 crash which now allowed investment banks to also buy and sell mortgages (among other things usually limited to smaller local banks).

","Cinema should inform, entertain, edify, provoke and incite curiosity. The Big Short has it all. It takes material that is difficult - deliberately fabricated to be difficult, as they point out - and makes it easy to understand without condescending to the audience. Having well-known celebrities explain the fraud highly-paid bankers, raters and other morally bankrupt individuals deployed is a marvelous, startling conceit. Breaking the fourth wall to explain what actually happened, and what the filmmakers added for dramatic effect, is simple, elegant and gratifying. Watching this in 2017 gives added hue - as the film presciently states, the poor and immigrants are being blamed for a crisis that a bloated, self-absorbed, callous elite brought down on our heads. And to our shame, we have forgotten, moved on, and seem destined to repeat the same mistakes. Outstanding performances from all the actors, doing an incredible script the service it deserves. Humorous at times, it also strives to be corrosively satirical, and empathetic to the true victims of this narrative. A perfect film, that I will watch again and again."

","The Big Short is a movie based on a book by Michael Lewis who has brought us such stories as Liar's Poker and Moneyball and who bluntly is a national treasure. Nobody seems to be able to explain complex ideas about Wall Street as well as he does and the movie adaptation does a fantastic job explaining how various bond instruments work and how people ended up buying junk which was rated AAA.<br/><br/>As someone who has worked on Wall Street (and Broad and Midtown and Boca Raton ) I have a good foundation of what happened and even I found myself learning something and having complex things explained in such a way as an aha moment clicked in.<br/><br/>Now I don't want to make this sound like a dreary documentary. This is more The Wolf of Wall Street than a Ken Burns documentary. The film follows some of the people who realizing that there was a housing bubble and deciding to try to short the market. The Big Short emphasizes that even if they were right (and they were) they still could lose everything by getting the timing wrong or simply by having the investment banks refuse to price the instruments accurately. This brilliantly creates a true tension where the film could have simply been a disaster film with the audience screaming at the screen don't invest in that house.<br/><br/>The Big Short sometimes is too on the nose for its own good. (=As an example having the spokeslady for the rating agencies wearing giant glaucoma glasses is a sledgehammer where none was needed. But the film quickly redeems itself with some wonderful fourth wall breaking where one of our heroes explains they did not find the answer in a pile of discarded prospectuses in an investment bank waiting room but actually by doing research but that we need a Raider's of the Lost Ark type discovery because movie. <br/><br/>A great film that entertains first.

Government mishandling, regulatory body incompetence, banking misadventures and mortgage sellers fraudulence combined to create one of mankind's greatest synthetic disasters.<br/><br/>The underlying themes are complex to why it all happened, but as an introduction and understanding there has been little better as a package than this film. Having read the book, I'm happy that the film makers took the material as reference, and filmed this in their own way. It does a fine job in taking us thru the multitude of characters who are responsible for the disaster, explaining in some wonderful scenes the products behind the problems.<br/><br/>Whilst all this is happening, we are following a handful of people who take advantage having seen the truth behind the sham. Our mixed cast is given mostly equal billing with Brad Pitt (mostly unrecognisable), Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling playing their roles perfectly.

Try it out."

","Twenty years of my life were spent working in housing finance economics. I got out in the early 90s after the first housing crash (when the savings & loan industry also collapsed). The things I saw that inevitably led to that first crash at the end of the 1980s, were repeated on a grander scale and with even more arrogance, greed, and callous criminality than what went before, and led to the economic crash of 2008. This film, while meant as entertainment, is also a primer on what led to the worldwide economic downturn as well as what is still wrong with financial markets today since no substantive changes have been made to prevent a recurrence. Nevertheless, it's a very watchable film with terrific performances from the entire cast, including many who are essentially walk-ons with only a few lines. It's neither dry nor dull. In fact, it's very entertaining, depressing as it can be when you realize that almost every bit of it is true."

","Why this movie is also categorized as humor is a thing I don't get. Is people losing their money, their jobs, their entire savings funny maybe? That aside The Big Short is a biographic drama. Not the type of movie I would go for normally. Just because the theme is Wall Street and finances, and those are things I don't get or/and I'm not interested in. But I watched it, and even though I didn't understand more then 10% of the financial stuff in the movie it still remains a good movie. The cast is just excellent. For once you can see Steve Carell in another role then a funny one and it worked well. Christian Bale is also excellent in his role. Brad Pitt has a smaller role, and his disguise was so well done that I actually only realized it was him after one hour. The whole cast is very good actually. The story is based on true events and even though it is difficult to follow if you're not from that world, it is interesting to follow and to see how corrupt the whole system is. But that's a thing I already knew for years. Never I would take a loan for anything, never did and never will. My motto is if you can't afford to pay it cash then just don't buy it. And that should be the lesson for a lot of people in this world. Banks are the most corrupt systems in our society and by dealing with them you're contributing. If everybody would retrieve their savings from their bank the whole system would collapse again, because the banks actually don't have your money. Anyways, the movie is already entertaining for a guy like me, so I guess for people in the financial business this movie is a gem."

Quite frankly, it is an event I'd rather forget.<br/><br/>But I'm glad I did see it.<br/><br/>Not only did it add to my understanding of the whole sorry saga, but it was surprisingly entertaining – full of dark humour.<br/><br/>The Big Short is essentially the true story about a few clever people who actually foresaw the crash coming and bet everything they could get hold of on that certainty. We, the audience are given an easy to follow lesson on what caused the recession and just how corrupt and deceitful the whole crazy US financial system turned out to be.<br/><br/>It is also a cliff-hanger, in as much as these disparate entrepreneurs who gambled their lives on the system crashing, were nearly derailed by the utter corruption of the financial establishment. Even when it was commonly known throughout the markets that the sub-prime bonds were worthless, none of the major banks would admit to it. <br/><br/>Even worse, (if that's possible) the disgusting rating agencies colluded with the establishment and continued to rate these worthless bonds as triple 'A' bonds. Yet they freely admitted they knew the truth but were worried about losing their rating business.<br/><br/>We can't help but applaud these clever folk who foretold the market crash and succeeded in becoming multi-millionaires. We also deplore the fact that nothing much seems to have changed, and not one of the principal criminals has spent a single night in jail.<br/><br/>It is an excellent, entertaining movie and definitely worth a viewing, but I'm not totally convinced it was worthy of nomination for the best film Oscar."
"saymaraza","9","1","1","28 March 2016"," The Big Short review
","I thought this movie was great! As soon as i saw the trailer, this was a movie i was looking forward to. Being directed by Adam McKay, this is a very different film for him to be directing, as normally he does comedy films with Will Ferrel, my favourite being 'Step Brothers' But even though this film wasn't a comedy, it still had a comedy feel to it, it had it's moments which worked really well in the film. With the storyline being focused on the marketing crashing, it sounded very dull and not my sort of film at first. But, when i saw the cast set up, it convinced me to go and see it. I'm a big fan of Christian Bale in movies, i think he is one of the greatest actors of all time, and i do like Ryan Gosling in films as well, so i just had to go and see this. Whilst watching it, i was drawn into the film, and i thought the idea of Bale's character Michael Burry having a glass eye made his character immediately memorable, and his kind of difficulties he had with his character. He brought a sense of difference compare to the other characters, for example, he never wore socks or shoes in the office whilst he was working on his research for the marketing, and he had a big love for heavy rock music. That sequence with him on the drums was particularly effective to me, as it showed him at home, and he spoke about his private life on camera. In scenes, it reminded me of the TV show 'The Office' which also starred Steve Carrel. I thought the comedy parts really worked in the film, as they made it different compare to any other movie i've seen. It was unlike any Adam McKay film i've seen, that shows that he has a wide range of ability in his directing. This film is definitely worth seeing even if you aren't a fan of the marketing business, or even a businessman, because i'm 17 years old, and i am a big Movie fan, who tends to concentrate on the Acting side of things when i watch films, but i still found this film very interesting and amusing."

","""The Big Short"" from 2015 is another look at the big crash of 2006- 2007 which wrecked the housing market, the bank, brokerage firms, and lots and lots of people.<br/><br/>There were, in this true story, a few investors who realized that the mortgage-backed securities business was a big fraud with nothing underneath it, and they bet against it. But they didn't understand how deep the corruption of the banks went and just how bad the crash was going to be for everyone.<br/><br/>The film stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, and Brad Pitt with some interesting guests, including Chef Bourdain and Selena Gomez, brought in to explain aspects of the mortgage-backed securities. I've seen so many different films and documentaries about the crash, but this makes the story really understandable.<br/><br/>The director, Adam McKay, has an excellent handle on what could have been a confusing, muddled film. He not only gives us some excellent characters but a clear understanding of the situation, rendering it comical. Like Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room documentary, the things the SEC, brokers, etc., are willing to overlook or simply not check because of greed is outrageous. <br/><br/>One thing that bugged me - the character Christian Bale plays, Dr. Michael Burry, one of the people that realized the fraud, has a ""glass eye."" Why must people continue to use that term? Does anyone realize how heavy a glass eye is? Artificial eyes have been made of a light acrylic for decades, yet this term is constantly used.<br/><br/>I am not sure how they did it, but the same thing was done in ""Valkyrie"" -- somehow at certain angles, the artificiality is indicated with a slightly droopy upper lid or a lack of energy - remarkable. Also, the way it would occasionally bother Bale was subtle but accurate.<br/><br/>Standouts in the film, besides Bale, are Pitt as an ex-broker who helps a new firm, Steve Carell as an outspoken broker, and Melissa Leo in a small but effective role as someone working for the SEC, and Hamish Linklater as Porter Collins, one of the men interviewing brokers and clients, trying to get some answers.<br/><br/>This is such a disturbing story, all the more horrible because of its ramifications and the fact that absolutely nothing was done about it. The banks were bailed out and paid big bonuses with the money. No one went to prison, any reform was stopped -- because the corporations are the ones who call the shots. <br/><br/>The big question asked here by several brokers of the banks is, how are you screwing us? Good question. And they're still doing it."
"Screen_Blitz","8","1","1","21 March 2016"," Top-notch, entertaining, but at the same time infuriating look at the economic collapse
","After his work with Will Ferrell on the wild laugh-out-loud comedies such as 'Anchorman', 'Step Brothers', and 'The Other Guys'; Adam McKay is one of the last people you would expect to take on a dramatic and particularly complex subject. Much to surprise, his efforts on adapting Michael Lewis's novel 'The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine', revolving around the 2007 financial crisis pays off shockingly well, featuring a powerful cast, a stunning screenplay by Charles Randolph, and McKay's overall strong direction. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, a hedge fund manager of a Manhattan bank who spends his days in office in shorts barefoot, playing drums on his knees, and blaring heavy metal on his radio. Upon examining the country's financial records, Michael predicts that the housing market will collapse in 2008 . In response, he makes a massive bet against the country's economy and begins tossing millions to credit swaps. His actions gain the attention of Wall Street investor Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Reynolds), and the quick-tempered hedge fund specialist Mark Baum (played by Steve Carroll), along with several other investors. This strategy leads Michael and fellow investors to strong wealth, while the economy takes a turn for the worst.<br/><br/>Director Adam McKay makes a crucial point in this dramedy centered on the corruption of the financial business and how the devastating effects it had on the country's economy, while balancing a comedic undertone to lighten the dramatic subject matter. As this film is inspired by true events, it showcases the story on how the housing market was in critical condition and the ignorant actions these bankers took in response to the discovery. Then the film progresses into great detail on how the bankers lead themselves to fortunes while millions of families are left unemployed and losing their homes. With this done by powerful writing by Charles Randolph, what results is a film that is both entertaining, but at the same time effective enough to cause outrage in viewers, particularly those who were effected by the economic collapse. When the characters are introduced, viewers begin with believing them as heroes before the film progresses into their fateful actions, revealing them to be ill role models and difficult to root for. By then, the film becomes more emotional and effecting, while managing to carrying out a comedic undertone. Some scenes will have you laughing, while other scenes will have growing a strong emotional and occasionally anger feel.<br/><br/>This film does a magnificent job on touching the significance of the financial business and the consequences of the greed in these bankers, though it sometimes a bit too hard to explain the structures of the bank operations to where viewers who aren't too educated may struggle to comprehend but teaches you valuable information about money investing. Plenty of dialogue dealing with mortgage rates, stock funds, and other complex terms by Christian Bale who gives off a purely outstanding performance, Steve Carroll who pulls off another powerful performance, and Ryan Gosling who plays a Wall Street investor with great complexity, and the film at times feels the need to dumb it down by the character breaking the fourth wall, including a short cameo by Margot Robbie and a rather odd one by Selena Gomez explaining the process of gambling. Breaking the fourth wall is a bit overused here, but does works effectively at times. Then there is Brad Pitt as a financial adviser who is not giving too much screen time, but serves a significant role in the plot with diligence. These actors really strive in their roles, and play a highly solid aspect in the film.<br/><br/>The Big Short is top-notch and entertaining that embraces its complicated subject with wittiness and intelligence, and will leave viewers captivated and at the same time, angry at learning the poor decisions that played a factor in the crash of our economy, at least for those who are able to understand it. The film is fantastically directed, powerfully acted, and definitely one of the best written films recently."
"Icedooitle","8","1","1","20 March 2016"," The Ultimate Side Bet
","I can only imagine there will be two emotions after watching The Big Short, confusion or anger. Confusion is natural; there is an enormous amount of information about an intentionally murky system. The financial structure that led to the housing collapse and largest recession since The Great Depression has enough information to fill a library. This is no exaggeration. The sheer scale of data, cause, effect and global impact could take lifetimes to truly understand. What The Big Short succeeds at more than anything else is dumbing it all down in a way that makes you angry at the system for needing it dumbed down. If this world, which all of our well-beings are slave to, were easily understood than there would be no story for the handful of people who saw the collapse coming. What makes these people special is a mix of in-the-know brilliance, and a pessimism that requires a dark capitulation of the finish line.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, an investor on the spectrum who clues into a default trend for sub-standard housing loans Had I not just seen the movie, this sentence would have been nearly meaningless to me. What is important is that this story is not about protagonists who are clamoring to prevent a crisis. These are self- interested people who may lament the collateral damage of the impending hell, but at least know how to hedge bets so they won't be in its path. Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Bale, Brad Pitt, John Magaro, and Finn Wittrock are only half the players portrayed in this high stakes game of Jenga. They are somewhere between the victims of the general populous and the perpetrators that obliviously helped move pieces into the decaying structure. They are not around to elicit our sympathies; they are there to court us through this quagmire of jargon and elicit emotions on our own behalf. Stands a good reason why I was so engaged and furious by the end of it.<br/><br/>The end-game for these characters is to bet against the housing market; the largest medium of investment in our country. When the bubble bursts, the side bet they made on it pays out with outstanding odds. Because we live in the future to these events, we know from the beginning that this is a sound business strategy if not just making lemonade. What their personal stories reveal is just how corrupted the system really is. Even with all of their foresight, these characters wait unreasonably long for the truth to come out. This is due to a national evasion working against any prevention by not recognizing the wound until the body is already bled out. It's the difference between seeing your guilty child next to a cup of spilled milk and that child distracting you at the door while the carton is still spilling in the kitchen. If there is redemption for these characters, it's how little they gain from their fortunes. The realization that the humanitarian cost for their monetary prosperity is too high to celebrate. These subtle character pivots are the endearing entertainment to an enraging story. <br/><br/>If you knew anything about Adam McKay prior to this movie, about the only thing you were thinking during the pre-view was ""where's Will Farrell?"" When so much of McKay's previous work was hinged on improv comedy, it was enthralling to see that he helped pull off an Oscar- worthy screenplay. The comedic notes throughout The Big Short made this upsetting story easier to take. Were this a documentary, it would have been equally as informative, but less engaging because of the unrelenting waves of infuriating facts. With a very talented cast, these characters unburden us by feeling so much on our behalf. Steve Carell is especially fun to watch as he maintains a constant anger that mirrors our own. The entertainment factor is probably little consolation for the thousands of home buyers in 2006 who look on thinking ""Great, now I know specifically how I got screwed."""

","""The Big Short"" is a good film that offers insights into the economic collapse of 2008. The perspective of the film is from a group of wise investors who recognized the coming collapse and in effect bet against the brokerage firms, banks, and mortgage industry. The dialogue is crisp and lively, and the male-dominated cast handles the pace deftly.<br/><br/>The theme that emerges from the film is the greed that consumes nearly every character. Even the savvy investors who recognize the fraudulent practices are motivated primarily to gain for themselves on the collapse. The most interesting role is Mark, as played by Steve Carell, who comes the closest to a character with a conscience. Due to the suicide of his brother, there is a greater personal dimension to Mark than the other characters, who remain fairly one-dimensional.<br/><br/>The film goes so far as to suggest that the problems at the heart of the 2007 crash have not been remedied, and the cycle of corruption has started anew. For this reason alone, the film is worthwhile viewing."

This is why it's important for our government to oversee and audit activities happening in places that can affect everyone. Elizabeth Warren is a HERO for taking on Wall Street. We need more people like her.<br/><br/>This movie tells a story of greed. A story of how a few felt it was more important to become rich than think about the security and safety of thousands. America should never again turn a blind eye to such activity. We should learn from our mistakes and put in place laws and security measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.

","The Big Short is a well acted movie where the character driven sub stories meld perfectly into the main story of the mortgage fraud of the U S housing market. Pitt's, Bale's, and Goseling's performances were believable money people. Pitt is an introvert whose quirks make the money man see the truth. Bale is an exesentialistic thinker who is ahead of the curve for market trends, Goseling is a slick Wall Street salesman. Surprisingly, Carrell stole the show as the hyper, (every one of the these movie characters would be regrettably labelled with a disability instead of a gift by today's mainstream society) brutally honest moral conscience of The Big Short. What The Big Short does well is merge the sub stories into explaining the complexities of the mortgage crisis. The biggest fraud in the history of the U S. Investors were fraudulently buying crap, bundled mortgages, which creates false demand and price increases in the housing market. As with all realists , ridicule and attacks follow until proved right. What hits most is when Carrell's character wallows in disbelief over the corruption as the housing market crashes, He refuses to sell his shares wanting to be proved wrong. He was hoping he was wrong. Seven out of ten stars. Time well spent."

","Have you ever sat down and watched a film, enjoyed it, but have no f*cking idea what just happened and what you just watched? Well that was my experience with the Big Short.<br/><br/>Adam McKay, director of many a Will Ferrell comedy including Anchorman, presents the best comedy about the 2008 American economic collapse to date. The screenplay is extremely intelligent and funny as it attempts to explain how exactly the banks ran the housing market into the ground because of greed and stupidity.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was underused in this film as Michael Burry, not really given much to do, confined to one room for 90% of his scenes, but to be fair there wasn't much more he could have done due to the truth in the story. Steve Carrel was brilliant as Mark Baum, constantly driven by anger and cynicism. His motivation certainly rubbed off on me as I left the theatre rather riled up (in a good way) for unknown reasons.<br/><br/>I don't know anything about banking, not even the basic knowledge the average person would know. CDO's are said a hell of a lot but I still have no idea what a CDO is. Because of this I feel that the problem I have is not necessarily the films fault. It tries to explain how simple banking is and how the bank complicated things through its choice of vocabulary and acronym's, but ultimately, it's narrative was lost on me as I feel it easily could do with some audiences.<br/><br/>I would imagine that if I saw this film a second time and really got into the zone, concentrating hard, I would probably understand it. I would still recommend you see the Big Short (especially if your IQ is large) but I would also highly recommend multiple viewings as I think there is more to be learnt and understood about the economic crash the more times you watch it's Oscar nominated film."

He did a great job of directing The Big Short and deserves a lot of recognition for it. <br/><br/>The Big Short was educational to me since I am young enough to not have fully understood how this event took place. I thought the material would be over my head for some parts, but McKay found a funny and unique way to explain the difficult subject matter. Overall, I was able to keep track of what was happening.<br/><br/>The acting was one of the better casts of the year, with great performances from Steve Carell and Christian Bale. Bale had one of my favorite performances of the year, but I may be biased since he is one of my favorite actors. The cast was extremely believable and fit the mood.<br/><br/>By now everyone knows the basics of the story. The Big short will leave you feeling confused and angry about how everything went down. The little guy suffers, while the rich don't get hurt. If anything, The Big Short did a remarkable job of making people angry that this event actually happened. <br/><br/>This is a good movie, but not a great movie. I liked how everything was put together in all, but the subject matter within the overall story can be boring. I found myself lacking some attention because of how detailed and confusing the small details were presented. <br/><br/>The Big Short is a good movie that deserves a watch; 7/10."
"AliceofX","6","1","1","2 February 2016"," High Quality Docudrama
","This is the part where I would say The Big Short is a movie about this or that, but I'm not sure if I can even call it a movie. It seems more like a high quality docudrama with some parts like something out of a Youtube video. It's very informative if verging on being too wordy.<br/><br/>However I'm struggling to find more words for it. Its lack of a people centred narrative makes it hard to compare to other films. The film's main star is facts and hard history and that might be offsetting to some viewers. But to be fair I'm not sure how it could have been done differently.<br/><br/>How do you make a movie about such complicated and hard to understand things without giving the audience a bunch of lessons? To the film makers credit The Big Short is a fun film, it certainly won't bore you, which is not an easy feat to manage with such material.<br/><br/>It is well acted even if the actors don't have much to do and there are some emotional moments.

","The big short starts off at a frenetic pace, but writer director Adam McKay eases you into this world of sleaze and thievery run by people that make a living off of making the entire world think that only they can do what they do. Using ingenious celebrity cameos, the audience gets to witness firsthand the fraud, stupidity, and ignorance that led to the 2008 Wall Street crash. Movies like Wall Street and the wolf of Wall Street used the frenetic and confusing nature of the financial world to keep the audience at an arms length, to show how truly brilliant these thieves are. The big short reverses that trend and exposes that the only brilliance in Wall Street is the ability to bury the truth in mountains and mountains of bullshit. The movie depicts the people that were able to see through this mountain, dig it out, and come across the hidden sewage beneath it. The performances are brilliant, each actor making his or her mark on a situation so fraught with moral hypocrisy. Steve Carnell and Christian bale are the standouts here, the former as an angry investor who wants nothing but the taste of corporate blood his mouth, but understands that he and a few others will be the only people in America to benefit from the situation. Christian bale stars as the troubled but brilliant Michael burry who craves attention for making such a grind breaking discovery. Other impressive performances include Ryan gosling as the narrator and the man who sees the situation in the most objective light, and Brad Pitt as the ex banker who sees this as a way to get back at the profession that left such a scarring impression on him. Overall, the big short is a wonderfully entertaining movie that knows just when to slow down and remind the audience why they're having so much fun."

Despite not knowing the rules or having ever played a game of chess I was mesmerised by these matches. This film was the same for me. I definitely enjoyed this film but despite them trying their best to explain what was going on it wasn't sinking in . It doesn't matter what you do to jazz it up , banking is and never will be sexy , even if you do involve Brad Pitt and Selena Gomez ! Despite that , this is a fairly entertaining film. I thought it might go down the Wolf of Wall Street route and focus on the excesses of the bankers but it concentrates more on their stupidity and then their absolute gall in getting away with what they did.

","I enjoyed this movie even if it made me feel somewhat uneasy. Any film,doc or book that explains how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) occurred I tend to be interested in.<br/><br/>My main issue with the movie is that it portrays that main protagonists as heroes but the reality is they profited from the collapse of the financial system and all the pain it subsequently caused. The irony is that the credit default swaps (CDS) that they purchased (essentially going short on the collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)) were a main cause of the collapse of some of the big financial institutions. By purchasing CDS s they were essentially betting that the mortgage instruments (CDOs) would fail . Of course once the big banks got wind of what was going on and began to realise how bad these sub prime mortgage instruments were they started furiously buying the very same credit default swaps.Subsequently once the CFC occurred large institutions such as Lehman Brothers failed as they couldn't make good on all the credit default swaps they had sold.<br/><br/>I feel the movie glossed over this aspect so its main characters came out looking like they took on the big banks for the little man. This was never the case. They did it for their own benefit pure and simple and this money stayed in their own pockets along with their investors.<br/><br/>Apart from this it was well acted, good story line if somewhat slow in parts.

","The Big Short, is based upon fact and deals with the people and businesses involved in the recession we had in 2008 as well as the major housing bubble that attributed to this recession and the failure not only of the big major banks, but Wall Street itself, and the many businesses and individuals who were affected because of this. Because this is still such a recent event, I am sure that it is still fresh in everyone's mind who is reading this review. It was all you would see on the television and print news back at the time and to say that it was not a big deal would be a great understatement. Based on the fact of enormous greed and people who had no scruples and to some extent having no clue what they were doing all these businesses were shut down and many people went bankrupt and not only lost their homes, but everything else they had as well. The whole situation was investigated in a fascinating and yet powerfully disturbing way in Michael Moore's documentary, Capitalism: A Love Story. At the time I saw the film, I claimed that it was probably the most disturbing film that I had seen that year, more so than any horror film, or thriller that had come out of Hollywood and I still stick with that statement. With the film adaptation of The Big Short, director and co-writer Adam McKay brilliantly blends fact and real events with comedy and entertainment and brings us one of the most entertaining films of this past year, but also one that will leave you furious and totally indignant with the whole banking system and everyone who was in charge of this massive mistake that was done out of sheer greed and stupidity. I think to a certain extent that you should have some knowledge of Wall Street, or banking rules and terminology to get all the facts as well as the jokes that are so important to the script and to the film itself. Then again, I know that financial literacy is not particularly a popular thing, nor is it something that you are taught in school unless you pursue post secondary education, but I think the film still manages to initiate the uninitiated in the whole world of banking and the endless language that they have seemed to have made their own with their own words and jargon to describe everything in words that most people would never understand (and maybe in a sense that is part of the point of doing so). The film will still make sense to those unfamiliar with all this and prove to be a still vastly entertaining and powerful film experience. Adam McKay who is mostly known for his comedies with Will Ferrell which range from being somewhat decent to sometimes unwatchable has created a brilliant piece of work here. The dialogue is sharp, fast and snappy and the characters are all extremely interesting and captivating to watch. They all have their own set of quirks and eccentricities and yet that is part of what is so fascinating to watch about them. There are also some wonderfully done celebrity cameos here and the use of quick editing and jump cuts is done so well here that is is one of the best uses of editing that I have seen in a film this year. The screenplay with it's razor sharp dialogue and it's blend of comedy and fact does a fantastic job of doing the unthinkable which is making a film on an event like this and making it interesting to viewers who would normally never care about this type of thing and end up being one of the best and most entertaining times at the movie of this past year. The film is funny in many ways, but at the same time it never forgets that the subject matter that it is dealing with is because of what happened to innocent people that it is both tragic and heinous what happened and how these bankers got away with all of this. You will walk away from this film entertained, but at the same time you are furious about it all as well and I mean that strictly as a compliment. The acting ensemble here along with Spotlight and Straight Outta Compton, is some of the best of the year and any nominations for the acting, writing, directing and editing are totally and completely justified. This may not be the easiest watch for those unfamiliar with all this, but I ensure that if you give it a chance you will definitely be surprised at what a great film this was. Alas, if only The Wolf of Wall Street could have been this good. Nevertheless one of 2015's best films."
"jadepietro","8","1","1","8 January 2016"," For a Few Dollars More
","(Rating:☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: A dark comedy that informs while it cashes in on its serious subject and sees it only for its entertainment possibilities.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for The Big Short, I thought, ""What a depressing and boring topic for a film! What possessed these filmmakers to put all their time and effort into an global event that hurt so many people financially and has them still reeling from its long-lasting effects? Nobody is going to want to see this movie! It will bomb big time!"" <br/><br/>￼Well, I was partially right. Despite all of its critical praise, the movie is not breaking records at the box office. The subject of our economic collapse as a nation is more gruesome and messier than any Tarantino blood-fest, far more realistic and deadly. Moviegoers are staying away in droves. But the film is sharp, witty, and informative, that I must admit, so on that count, the filmmakers were absolutely right. The subject needs our attention...and fast! While The Big Short does have some difficult plotting issues that are hard to comprehend, the film succeeds with its imaginative retelling of the financial meltdown of the world market.<br/><br/>Swaps, synthetic stock options, CDO equity...it's like speaking a foreign language, and I must admit, I still don't understand most of the economic jargon, even after the film tries to dumb down the financial rhetoric in the cleverest of ways by using celebrities to simplify the actions on the screen. Appearances by Margot Robbie discussing stock trading in a bubble bath, Anthony Bourdain cooking day-old leftovers, and Selena Gomez at the gambling tables of Vegas are wonderful parodies that help explain the global crisis that befell us in 2008. (I wish these smart distracting ""short"" infomercials were used more often throughout the film as the topic of stock market trading is a dry discussion point.)<br/><br/>￼Solidly directed by Adam McKay, The Big Short takes its serious theme and analyzes the repercussions of the ""Greed is good"" mentality that permeated Wall Street then (and now) by focusing on four central players and their roles in masterminding this international Ponzi scheme. <br/><br/>The casting of this quartet of stockbrokers is marvelous. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, a frantic man-child genius, better equipped to deal with numbers than people. Ryan Gosling is Jared Vennett, a slick money broker who discovers the housing market bubble to his advantage. Brad Pitt adds more interest as Ben Rickert, a jaded former stock broker who distrusts banks and businesses. Especially effective is Steve Carell. The actor portrays a fictional Mark Blum, and walks the fine dramatic line between anger and guilt in his skillful interpretation of one of the few businessmen with a conscience. Fine supporting performances are given by Finn Wittrock, John Magaro, Hamish Linklater, Rafe Spall, and Jeremy Strong in smaller but pivotal roles.<br/><br/>￼Special mention goes out to the rapid-fire editing by Hank Corwin, whose quick cuts of images add a stylish pop quality to the proceedings and an intelligent screenplay by Charles Randolph and the director establishes its despicable well drawn characters and makes them surprisingly compelling and likable. Everyone of these corporate high rollers is in it for the money and makes a profit on everyone else's misery and financial downfall, but we moviegoers are caught up in their illegal shell game, a plan that doomed the housing market and crippled the banks and mortgage companies worldwide.<br/><br/>￼The Big Short is well made and compelling, although its script still was unable to clearly elaborate the complexities of its topic. The film settles for the smaller picture, a behind-the- scenes look at the traders and their game, rather than delve into the larger ripple effects that created financial ruin to many families caught in the mortgage debacle. That aspect is glossed over rather quickly. But the film does serve not only as a reminder of what was, but also a warning of what may come...once again. Let the buyer beware!<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"sage4676","8","1","1","8 January 2016"," The truth hurts and isn't actually funny
","Why this is considered a ""comedy"" has me wondering. Was ""Too Big to Fail"" considered a comedy because it was about the same timeline and events. There were many funny moments to me but neither of these are comedies. A comedy is where I go and expect to laugh out loud, roar and tell stories about the jokes. Not chuckle a few times and remember the events and dread of the years in that business. ""The Big Short"" wasn't meant to be a comedy but more like a serious look a foolishness and greed that gets into everyone. <br/><br/>There are many funny moments but not meant to be considered a comedy movie like ""Trainwreck"" or ""Sisters"". Comparing those movies in the same category is like saying ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a musical competing with ""Pitch Perfect 2"". Both are fun but alike at all. Why some get put into certain categories is silly.<br/><br/>At any rate. "" The Big Short"" is a great film. I know it because I was a serious money manager way back when all this happened."

","Steve Carell leads the motley crew of a cast in this thoroughly entertaining flick that would not disappoint you but may leave you a tad disturbed . The plot revolves around the ignominious financial crisis of 2008 and a sequence of contemporaneous events involving a diverse set of individuals thriving at different levels of the food chain in the world of finance.<br/><br/>The film progresses at a comfortable pace . There is no ostensible rush in the screenplay. There is no dearth of humour - be it situational, dry or in the form of sarcasm. <br/><br/>Moving on, the editing is quite impressive making the movie viewer friendly. <br/><br/>The characterization is for me the most remarkable aspect of the movie. Notwithstanding the plethora of characters in the movie , almost the entire lead cast is graciously introduced to the audience . There is a depth to each character, that adds credibility to the dialogue (whenever delivered). <br/><br/>The story itself is quite engaging and plays upon the thematic elements elegantly. <br/><br/>In the acting department , there is no much to complain. For me the pick of the actor is Steve Carrel , who may be called the operative protagonist of the story. Christian Bale does justice to his part . So do Gosling and the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>The movie , however, falls short of capturing the entire procession as brilliantly as it could have . Some sequences are brilliantly shot and yet others seem under-treated. Towards the end of the second half of the movie , there are some loose fragments which disturb the general design of the film.<br/><br/>I would end this review by the saying that movie brilliant and extremely intelligible for a film dealing with fairly confusing financial concepts ."

","You'll want to be on top of your game because this movie is an education that should be required viewing for anyone in, aspiring to be in or have even considered getting themselves and their money in bed with the financial industry.<br/><br/>Watch and re-watch the trailer a few times while taking notes. Familiarize yourself with some of the terminology because even though this movie does a great job trying to represent some of the more complex and even incomprehensible, doing a little homework ahead of time will give you a greater insight and appreciation of the depth and gravity of this tangled web of deceit."

","The Big Short is one of the most important films of 2015, it's a film based on true events which shows the banks and governments frauding the people into a global financial meltdown. This film is loaded to the top with a great lineup of actors, the story is top notch, and I cannot stress the importance's of the knowledge it shares.<br/><br/>Now something that confuses me about the world we live in today is, ""if someone breaks into your home, isn't someone supposed to suffer the consequence?"" In The Big Short (2015) is shows the banks knowingly ripping off the people causing millions to lose their homes, jobs, and much more, though the ending result is 1 person got punished!??? I do not believe that this type of outcome she be, I means an eye for an eye; right?<br/><br/>The Big Shorts story shows that there is documentation out there that pinpoints everyone responsible, and this film is based on true events which makes this movie perfect for many reasons. This is a great film and we highly suggest it."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","1","7 January 2016"," Adam McKay is a genius
","Six men saw what no one else did. The Big Short manages to balance three stories and weave them together seamlessly, without any feeling of its characters being undercooked or overindulged. Paul Haggis meets Aaron Sorkin, and in my opinion, The Big Short's screenplay is better than the one Sorkin actually wrote this year. <br/><br/>McKay and Randolph take complex economic concepts and explain them to us with both humour and gravity. The random ""here's X to explain it to you"" scenes are utterly brilliant and work extremely well as a break from the frenetic film and as a quick lesson in an important scene. Throughout the film, people use complex language and then another character follows up with ""so you mean like this?"" Its not forced because that's how people actually talk. The third wall breaks are hilarious and charming and entertain whilst also instructing us. Even when the real life story is changed to make the movie work better, characters acknowledge the change to the audience. It shouldn't work, but my god it DOES. The result is a highly interactive film that makes learning fun! The story takes huge sweeping ramifications and represents them to us with powerful scenes - take Burry's mentor demanding his money back to represent the many people who would have felt that way in real life. One man and his kids is powerful enough to convey to us the dire situations of soon to be millions of Americans. A pretty young compliance woman tells her ex-boyfriend's brother ""we don't do much because our funding got cut"", which is representative of so many overseers who got lazy. But even more impressive is the humour, which never suffers at the expense of the drama or vice- versa. Never going for cheap laughs, McKay instead constructs scenes that are hilarious by their very premise. Something about Carrell and a stripper discussing sub-prime mortgages during a lap dance is way funnier than anything that happened in Ted 2. Recurring jokes about one of Carrell's co-workers who always likes food and Jarred's vanity have their place and never dominate importance scenes. The screenplay is likely second only to Spotlight's this year, and only by a hair. <br/><br/>Beside the economic concepts, we have a story about very different people, and the two who are treated with utmost respect and depth are Burry (Bale) and Baum (Carell). Bale completely vanishes into yet another chameleonic performance, the one-eyed, Aspergers, quiet genius. It is unfathomable that this is the same man who played Bruce Wayne and Patrick Bateman. You can see plainly written across Bale's face the remnants of a childhood marred by his disfigurement. When he says he cannot deliver compliments properly and then demonstrates, it is extremely uncomfortable. The look on his face as a group of people whisper together while he sits alone speaks volumes. Steve Carell goes back to back with his absolutely brilliant performance in Foxcatcher last year to portray Mark Baum, an raging, depressive shatterpoint of a man whose sheer disgust at the broken system is the highlight of the movie. We find ourselves tensing up for one of his outbursts just as his on-screen friends are. Ryan Gosling is flawlessly cast as the vain, pretty boy Jarred Vennett, Brad Pitt has a grave and dignified role to play as Ben Rickert and of the extended extra cast, Jeremy Strong stands out as a great foil to Carell. Its unfortunate to see Marisa Tomei and Melissa Leo completely wasted in tiny roles.<br/><br/>McKay's direction is without a doubt some of the finest of 2015. His choices are utterly brilliant. He introduces Bale's character as a loner by splicing him swimming (the ultimate solo sport) with him messing up team sports as a kid. He introduces Carell's character as a raging loudmouth by having him barge into a therapy session and speak over everyone, only to storm out at the first distraction. He establishes the suicide of Baum's brother brilliantly in a two second scene that speaks volumes. Throughout the film, his use of visual aids (dictionary definitions, quotes), fast cuts of people shouting, lingering takes on email inboxes and steady takes of empty trading rooms are all hole-in-one choices. While people are on the phone to people off-screen, he flashes a picture of them so we remember who it is. McKay is the master of context-building. <br/><br/>The end of The Big Short is grave, almost horrifying. Brad Pitt nails a short monologue about what his young companions are celebrating and the mood shifts very suddenly. The final text reads almost like 12 Years A Slave in terms of the injustice you feel. A true story hasn't affected me in this way for quite a long time."
"rseny","9","1","1","7 January 2016"," Entertaining and educational
","First let me say that this movie was hardly a comedy for me- i didn't laugh even once. Though the atmosphere is light and playful, the subject is very serious. Adam McKay did great to adapt the novel and direct this film- it has great phase, explains the complex banking terminology and the events as they unfold. Yes, the events unfold 4 years- Michael Burry caught eye of the oncoming catastrophe 3 years before the actual collapse (which tells you enough about the government oversight, banking employees competence and rating agencies honesty). One guy with a computer and a M.D. did better to foresee the future of the US than all of the above - outrageous is too soft of a word to describe. As many others said - this is a must see educational experience! The whole cast did great to portray the characters involved- they are all profit driven individuals, but to blame them for capitalizing on others financial incompetence is hardly fair- they even tried to warn the people (motives for which are questionable), but got turned away by the ""serious"" media outlets. What else were they supposed to do- post their prediction on the Huffington Post?? Great movie experience through and through."
"in1984","10","1","1","6 January 2016"," The Truth is as Corrupt as Fiction
","9.75 of 10. For those who have seen American Psycho (2000), there's extra beauty in this with Christian Bale portraying a different, but nearly as odd if not as sociopathic, type of American Wall Street oddity. In fact, the film captures the wide variety of borderline sociopaths occupying banks and Wall Street.<br/><br/>While technically a comedic thriller, satire, based on the very true and vivid recent history of banks, it would be accurate to call it an acted documentary too.<br/><br/>Besides being amusing and educational on the history of the big bailout, it weaves in energetic music, scenery, and well-acted eccentric characters so that it overcomes all the usual complaints about documentaries and historical re-enactments.<br/><br/>About the only drawback involves how it decides to dramatize and then tell the truth about one particular dramatization when it wasn't really necessary and added some unneeded length to the film. Fortunately, the film doesn't depend upon it and it is interesting even if somewhat pointless and detracting from the immersion."
"castlecorey","1","15","48","31 December 2015"," one of the worst movies i've ever seen
","i thought that the reason to watch a movie was to care about the characters, but this had no characters to care about. The direction was great, in terms of the ideas shown in the movie, but it was f-ing awful. I liked the asides to the camera, but the shots of moving images was dizzying. As a person who is not into wall street and trading, i didn't understand half of the film. Sorry, but this ranks as a complete waste of time in my books. The actors were great, but I didn't care about any of them. Nice to see Brad Pitt again, but no one made me care about their story. I guess if you understand wall street and it's lingo you would care more about this movie. This is my first review on IMDb and the movie so infuriated me that I felt I must write a review to express how deeply I hated it."
"spotifeyeball","1","7","19","26 March 2016"," Very boring and patronizing
","I have been a fan of Steve Carrell since The Office so I was looking forward to this movie, especially with the glowing reviews.I have to think Hollywood and their reviewers truly live in an alternate reality. Two and a half hours of soporific boredom and yet another ""hate the big bankers and capitalism"" sermon-movie shoved down out throats.<br/><br/>First of all, Steve Carrell's hair was so distracting, it was so obviously a wig that I could not concentrate on him but on his hair! Then the accent-- he was trying' really haaahd to do a New Yawk accent (a Jewish one to boot) but it did not work.<br/><br/>What is also distracting (and very disagreeable and annoying) is curse words coming out of the mouth of every one in nearly every sentence. Is this necessary to get your point across? Then of course since you could not get sex out of this R-rated movie about bankers, you throw in the obligatory topless stripper. I mean, really? Finally it is the story line and delivery itself. I fell asleep three times watching this! The point was lost in jargon (which a cook and naked lady in the tub and some of the actors are supposed to help us ""understand"") and the whole tone was steaming ""hate the big bad bankers"". From what I have been reading there was government pressure to lend to people (i.e., poor people,minority poor people) who could not afford the homes they were buying.Did no one really not see this coming? At any rate the story seems to be really lop-sided and incomplete and more propaganda than reality.<br/><br/>Buurrrgh! I wish Hollywood could make compelling movies without constant curse words, obligatory nudity (and/or sex) and liberal/left ideologies. And then I woke up."
"Matt-144-792009","8","4","9","3 January 2016"," Unexpected Big Laughs, not short on great on screen talent.
","In the Big Short director Adam McKay directs a very talented ensemble cast of characters based on the book by Michael Lewis. In which Jared Vennett, played by Ryan Gosling narrates, highlighting the key players of the events leading up to the housing market collapse. With Christian Bale as Dr. Michael Murray, Steve Carell as Mark Baum and Brad Pitt as Ben Richert the audience is entertainingly explained what happened in what was and in some lasting instances still is a very turbulent time in the America and the world's economy.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for the Big Short I was immediately excited by the cast, the mad cap back and forth made it seem very Wolf of Wall Street (2014) reminiscent. Although given the topic, I felt under the wrong director with a message driven cross-to-bare we could have a two-hour snooze fest. Great performances loaded with dialogue heavy dramatic scenes. Then I noticed the director, Adam Mckay. For those of you not familiar with his work, Adam McKay is usually at the helm of such Judd Apatow produced affairs as Anchorman (2004) and Step Brothers (2008). Heavy on the sophomoric pull my finger hilarity not ripped from the headlines current event pictures. A film like this you would expect to see a David Fincher, Danny Boyle or even Oliver Stone directing. Only that would only add sawdust to what is already dry material. What Adam McKay brings is levity and comedic irreverence. In the spirit of shows like the Daily Show or Last Week Tonight with John Oliver a spoon full of comedic sugar makes the news worthy information go down; infotainment at its best. In a brilliant bit of A.D.D. pandering direction, unconventionally placed real life celebrities explain some of the more hard to pay attention to plot points. Example: hot Hollywood starlet Margot Robbie explaining Sub-prime loans from a bubble bath, Brilliant. This movie marks a very exciting change in trajectory for Adam McKay's career, leaving me anxious to see his next project. There are some great as to be expected performances by Christian Bale and Carell; but for me it was Ryan Gosseling's Leo in Wolf of Wall Street style narrative that kept me laughing while learning. This film is important in that America needs to have a more informed level of outrage in response to the housing market collapse. Now I realize this may not be the best way to inform, with a Hollywood film. But then again is that any worse than Fox News. This film is universally informative and fun, extremely palatable for any level of taste, education or humor. A great selection if it's your turn to pick."
"kpender-64884","7","4","9","30 December 2015"," A little one sided
","The Big Short does a good job of showing the flaws in the system and criminalizing the actions of the big banks and ratings agencies. A very interesting and entertaining perspective.<br/><br/>While it shows the evidence that the general public was also to blame for the housing demise, i.e., distracted by pop culture, purchasing multiple subprime mortgages. It doesn't point the finger back in their direction. As if the American Public are susceptible, but ignorant, and their ignorance is OK because the government will not only bail out the banks, but the American Public as well. It emphasizes the American Public is paying the price, but shouldn't they be held accountable too?<br/><br/>That is the main problem with the movie. The movie is very patronizing, and the cameos to explain in layman's terms are only describing the surface level points. The attempt at humor is appreciated, but could be avoided by taking the time to explain the industry lingo that is used. As several people have noted, they will watch a second time to fully understand.<br/><br/>It also does not define a ""big bank"" to lead the audience to believe all banks and bankers are bad. It doesn't do a good job differentiating a ""wall street"" banker from the person who helps your small business or helps you obtain a ""real"" mortgage.<br/><br/>This movie will confuse, outrage, and ultimately stir the pot for those who have no knowledge of or interest in the financial world.<br/><br/>It does however portray the cynics as protagonists, so that can be appreciated."

","I'm sure a lot of this is going to be dense for people not read up on subprime mortgage loans. But they simplify it by allowing cameos to instruct you like a hygiene film back when I was a kid. It's comical in that it's told to hold your interest on the insanely ridiculous way the government sold the American dream and then...allowed the banks to dick us. If you believed in those types of things. Because the victims are watching the movie, slowly fuming, while the real people out there who fleeced us...well, they keep living.<br/><br/>This movie should be required watching to anyone who trusts people in suits too much. Hard work and earning a plot of land is a perfect way for these wolf in sheep's clothing to sell you. Worse, when they are your neighbor. Now the interesting thing about this movie, is that we are watching the hunter watching the wolves watching the sheep. Yep, it's that dense. And I am sickened at the very thought that there...well, I won't give it away only that it's eye opening, sobering system of capitalism, that you can believe or not. I think it happens. I've seen some of my friends who've bought into the system, only to have a ghost town pop up where there was once hope. It's a haunted house story at one point. The remnants of dreams are far scarier than any murder. Because, the system runs deeper than we realize. How do you plug a dam after the hole has exploded? Why grab some buckets in start baling? Nope. Continue the path that we've set out. All to get richer. You know what that is? Morally bankrupt people. The movie does a great job in fleshing out the groups of people who did cash out on the insanity. But, they aren't proud of themselves. They are just as brutalized when some conclude the resolution didn't adjust the moral fiber of the American Dream. We sold ourselves way too short, in essence, when we wanted something for nothing. I blame our easy to gain mind numbing pop culture that has sold us wants, instead of remind us of needs.<br/><br/>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. And is a must to see when the holidays die down. It is very sobering to the holidays, and is a shame it will probably lose out to...well, ironically the movies that keep us in the fog. I don't mind the fog. I prefer the fog. The fog is where life is happier.<br/><br/>Please go see this movie."

","The finance system machinations were virtually unknown during, now that we have crashed there are a few hundred books written. They do a good job of explaining them here. They probably thought they were upholding the spirit of All the President's Men, brave exposure of a corrupt system while events are fresh in mind and people will leave the theater armed with insight to demand change. Like Redford's film, it is too close to events to do more than chronicle them. Unlike that film, it's barely a film.<br/><br/>It's an illustrated article with a few name actors in enactments, never convincing it has any other reason to be. It does drum up anger and frustration at what a sorry affair the years leading to 2008 were and a Michael Moore kind of disgust at how the same affair is allowed to continue. Government ineptitude is confined to a regulations agency woman mooning over a Goldman Sachs exec (the type she's supposed to regulate) in a Vegas pool party in hopes of landing a more lucrative job there.<br/><br/>So this is fine as an article I guess. But a lot of it is inane. It's the cinematic equivalent of a CDO. A triple A rated product (vetted by the ratings agency of the Oscars, a great film we're told) that is really made up of little tranches of subprime crap.

"bdbsimonsen","9","3","6","28 January 2016"," A Film Everyone Should Be Forced to Watch
","The Big Short (2015)<br/><br/>Adapted from the book by Michael Lewis, The Big Short is the true story of the guys who predicted the eventual crash of the US housing market in the mid 2000's, and if that sounds like the most boring movie you've ever heard of, don't worry, you're dead wrong. Directed by Adam McKay and starring Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt, this is one of the funniest and one of the craziest films of the last year, and at the same time, probably the most infuriating film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>One of the best things that this film is able to accomplish, is to break down extremely complicated Wall street jargon and financial principles into everyday language so that everyone can understand them. This is effective for two reasons. Number one; you don't need to be educated on the topic beforehand, which makes this movie accessible to anyone willing to pay attention (and you really do need to pay attention to be able to follow). I have never had an economics lesson in my life, I had no idea what a sub-prime mortgage was, no idea what a credit default swap was, but this movie has a very efficient, funny and direct way of explaining these concepts to the point where I would recommend this flick on pure educational value alone. (Especially if this does NOT interest you.) Number two; it makes it absolutely crystal clear the kind of slimy, disgusting, unconscionable fraud that was taking place right in front of everyone, the kind of criminal activity that went completely unpunished and the blatant outrage that the taxpayers were then asked to pay for the worldwide consequences of those actions. And on top, the film does all of this while being consistently funny throughout its two hour, ten-minute run time.<br/><br/>The Big Short is first and foremost an insane movie. From the way it's directed with documentary-like camera work, narration and the breaking of the fourth wall (talking to the camera), to the risky, yet brilliant premise of mixing such dry subject matter with hilarious satire. Also, bear in mind that the film is technically listed as a drama and although I found it to be very funny, not everyone will. While most of it worked for me I will admit that the purposefully crappy camera- work (we're talking crash zooms, extreme close ups and continual movement of the camera) got to be slightly over the top at certain points and I wish that McKay would've turned it down a notch. However, the craziness is necessary to the story, the fact that this could happen is crazy, that everyone knew what they were doing and did nothing to prevent what was coming is absolutely crazy, and if the film wasn't also crazy I'm not sure it would be possible to tell this story in a way that was entertaining, understandable and historically accurate.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the movie is phenomenal. Christian Bale as usual is great, Ryan Gosling, fantastic, and Steve Carell, probably the best he's ever been. Brad Pitt gets slightly less to do on screen, but he, as well as the many other actors that feature in the film, also does a fine job. (Pitt was also a producer on the project.)<br/><br/>The Big Short is a film that everyone should be forced to watch (yes I really mean forced, just look at what they did to the world, just take a look) it's funny, it's devastating, and the more you think about it, the angrier you'll get. This is a film not just of Paramount Pictures, but of paramount importance.<br/><br/>The Big Short: 9/10"
"tjgoalie13","8","3","6","13 January 2016"," A Funny, and Educational Drama
","The Big Short is one of those films that everybody could enjoy, and everybody should see. While the film is not perfect it is very funny, probably because the director is comedy specialist Adam McKay, and is also a somewhat important film because it's very revealing. The Big Short is interesting and educational, features a great ensemble, but is subject to some distracting camera-work. For anybody interested in the 2008 Housing Market Crash this film is perfect.<br/><br/>The film begins with narration that addresses the biggest problem the film will have, which is that the Housing Market Crash of 2008 was an extremely complicated issue, that is why so few saw it coming. The story is so complicated, because it requires some understanding of how the housing system worked at the time, which apparently most of the people running the system at the time didn't even have, so the film ends up teaching the audience how the crash happened. That sounds boring, but the film does a brilliant job by doing it through hilarious cameos and lacing the overly informational pieces with humor. The film accomplishes the very hard task of making the mess understandable, and even teaching those interested enough about how it went wrong.<br/><br/>When looking at it The Big Short clearly had a great script, with dialogue that just rolls, but in such a complicated movie the acting had to be good. Christian Bale is very good as the wacky Dr. Michael Burry, often embodying the odd personality he was tasked with, and even handling the task of showing a misunderstood genius. The other performer who was terrific was Steve Carell, who has consistently proved that he's not just a great comedy actor. While Carell is known for films like The 40 Year Old Virgin, last years Foxcatcher and now The Big Short prove that he can give a performance with emotional depth, and a sense of humanity.<br/><br/>The only thing that the film really doesn't well is it's camera-work, which in such a complicated story seems too distracting. The Filmmakers felt they needed to rely on Close-Ups, rack focuses, and shaky movement. To be clear the film only feels so shaky, because much of the film is shot hand-held, and in close-ups, which will accentuate movement. It's easy with a lot of soft focus, which this film plays with a lot, to be pulled out of the film, and thus it requires even more effort from the audience to follow what's happening. To make an example it's like if somebody pointed at something in a dark cave at night, and then pointed a flashlight in your face, as you looked for it.<br/><br/>In the end, The Big Short is a funny, intelligent, well-acted, and interesting view of the few men able to make money when everybody else was losing money hand over fist. The entire ensemble of talented big name actors carry their own weight, and some even rise above expectations. To be honest everybody should watch this film, because it tells the ever important story of how ignorance caused a worldwide meltdown, and we're apt to do it again if we don't learn from our mistakes."

","Adam McKay (the director of Anchorman and Step Brothers) has recently teamed up with Adam Davidson to create a new podcast for Gimlet Media. The premise is simple: take a topic that sounds incredibly uninteresting and present it in a unique light such that people are pleasantly surprised. Recent topics include ""mold"" and the breakup of the band Chumbawumba. They call it ""Surprisingly Awesome"". The launch of this podcast coincides with the release of this film which is essentially a feature length visual-driven extension of the series focusing on the subprime mortgage crisis. Throughout, Ryan Gosling serves as our narrator, taking us swiftly through the history of finance and who occasionally breaks the fourth wall as if engaging the audience in a discussion. Instead of lecturing us on esoteric financial terms, though, he cuts to Margot Robbie (in a bathtub), Selena Gomez (at a blackjack table), or Anthony Bourdain (in his kitchen) to illustrate these concepts in a humorous yet accurate manner. Yet McKay takes this one step beyond amusing lecture. He gives us great character development and he builds great suspense despite his audience knowing the ultimate outcome. This is an engaging, humorous and sobering film on an important period of recent history. It may not be enough to incite reform, but it is a powerful piece that can be added to the conversation."

","A moving about the financial crash of 2008 sounds both daunting and depressing. After all, most common folks understand nothing about high finance and were just victims of the credit crunch.<br/><br/>Turns out that this was a most entertaining movie, explaining among many other things also how big banks make high finance impossible to understand ON PURPOSE. Personally, I am a ""common folk"" but I always got the impression bankers and financial institutions were out to sc**w me. Turns out I was right, but like the Steve Carell character, saying so does not makes me one bit happy.<br/><br/>The plot follow the three main players (and group of players), all involved in finance and among the very few who understood the house market was going to crash because of subprime and fraudulent practices. Despite the heavy subject, the movie is edited in a quirky, entertaining way and all the actors give excellent performances. <br/><br/>I particularly liked Christian Bale (never one of my favorites) and Steve Carell. But Gosling was equally good playing unlikable guy from Deutsche as were the two younger guys Magaro and Wittrock. The three actors playing Carell team were equally good. Pitt plays a minor role in an understated way. Wonderful cast with no star performance stealing screen time.<br/><br/>You will probably leave the cinema enlightened and embittered, but also a lot more the wiser."

","Here's something that won't shock you: America's big banks are all kinds of corrupt and full of fraudulent leadership. Here's something that WILL shock you: the movie about that fact is immensely engaging and hilariously entertaining. Director McKay (Anchorman) has found a way to make the financial sector of American economics one of the most spastically fun films in theaters. Without glossing over the sickening and infuriating lack of justice in these too-big-to-fail organizations, The Big Short makes even its most openly educational moments funny and interesting through noble directorial experimentation and bombastic performances. It's 2005, and a small band of misfits and outsiders begin predicting what all of us now know to be true: the housing bubble collapse of 2008 and ultimately the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Who doesn't love an underdog, whistleblower tale, especially when their takedown is targeted at corrupt old billionaires and annoying young dude-bros? However, much like this year's superb Spotlight, we and our protagonists quickly realize that what we're rooting for is more complex than a simple victory. Full of empathy for all involved, the all-star cast is given room to shine, as the story allows for equal parts ethos, pathos and downright hilarity. Most wonderful is the way it plays with the conceit of the ""true story"". Instead of trying to be too authentic or too Hollywood, it presents each in new and daring ways, never letting its audience get ahead of its story. Did I fully understand the details in the math? Not really. Did it matter? Not at all. Bold and energetic, The Big Short is a numbers movie, but its sum far exceeds its parts."
"jdkraus","9","3","6","1 January 2016"," One of this year's best movies!
","Though marketed as a comedy, ""The Big Short"" covers some very serious issues. Based off of the book with the same title, the film goes in great depth of the reasons behind the 2008 economic catastrophe. The focus is on a group of individuals that foresee the economic bubble burst and decide to take advantage of it. Among them are a savvy, but socially awkward hedge fund manager (Christian Bale), a short-tempered, no-nonsense trader (Steve Carell), a banker seeking a huge payday (Ryan Gosling) and two young investors that want to make it big (John Margo & Finn Wittrock) — who enlist the help of a retired trader (Brad Pitt).<br/><br/>The plot jumps from one group of characters to another, covering nearly every angle possible of the behind-the-scenes financial industry that most everyday people do not know or understand. Even though the multiple subplots and some of the technical jargon in the dialog may prove confusing or daunting for the viewer, director Adam McKay and screenwriter Charles Randolph break the subject matter down enough so that the audience can follow along. Often times, they blend humor (such as characters breaking the fourth wall with one- liners or using a chef to explain CDOs) to get their explanations across. <br/><br/>The controversial topic that the movie captures is insanely well-written and the actors perform brilliantly in their roles. Christian Bale went so far into his character that he wore the clothing of the man his performance was based on. However, it is Steve Carell who steals the show. With his disheveled hair and East Coast accent, he is unrecognizable. Like with his work in ""Foxcatcher,"" Carell once again shows that he can do drama. His character has a lot of passion as he tries to make sense of the impending economic disaster. In a way, he becomes the voice of the viewer, wondering how capitalism can spin so far out of control.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have with this movie is the heavy-handed message. Like the 2010 documentary ""Inside Job,"" ""The Big Short"" paints Wall Street and the banks as the main culprits responsible for the economic ruin. As a result, this gives the audience someone to vilify. Besides this personal opinion, ""The Big Short"" is an exceptional film and one of this year's best. I am probably in the minority here, but I think this is better than the new ""Star Wars"" movie. It is a film that both entertains and makes you think."

"dave-mcclain","7","3","6","28 December 2015"," ""The Big Short"" does a very good job overcoming a high degree of difficulty to tell a very important story.
","Because of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 ""The U.S. entered a deep recession, with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009 U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30% on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50% by early 2009... The stock market recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevated."" That was Wikipedia, not me. When I research the historical background of a movie based on a true story, I look at multiple sources, gain a working knowledge of the topic, summarize that knowledge early in my review and use what I've learned to help me write the rest of the review and evaluate the film. Not this time. I'm no financial expert. The best I can do is pick out what seems to be the most appropriate quote that I ran across in my research and encourage other people who, like me, have very limited financial knowledge to study up a bit before seeing ""The Big Short"" (R, 2:10).<br/><br/>Much of that first paragraph talks about the results of the Great Recession, but this story is about the few who saw it coming and profited from that knowledge. The central character is Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an ex-neurologist who became a savant-like hedge fund manager. Looking where he says no one else was willing to look, he came to the conclusion that the housing boom of the early 2000s was actually a housing bubble that was getting ready to burst. He became convinced that the large amount of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages would cause a collapse in the housing market in the second quarter of 2007 and he bet that he was right. Burry used his personal investment capital, and that of his fund's investors, to buy credit swaps from the big banks. This basically amounted to an insurance policy against bundled mortgage funds which would only pay off if the market collapsed. Reasoning that the housing market was ""rock solid"" and that people always pay their mortgages, financial managers were more than happy to take his money – and laugh all the way to their banks.<br/><br/>The problem for those banks – and homeowners across the country – was that Burry was right, although only a small number of people realized it at the time. Burry had to weather severe storms of investor discontent in an effort to hold the credit swaps long enough to profit. As Burry shopped his idea around town, what he was doing became public knowledge. Most people were as perplexed and/or amused that Burry was shorting the housing market as those bankers who sold him those credit swaps, but some were intrigued enough to look into the situation for themselves. Among them was fund manager Mark Baum (played by Steve Carell and based on real-life fund manager Steve Eisman). ""Mark"" set his team at FrontPoint Partners LLC (a unit of Morgan Stanley) to digging deep into the housing market – on paper and in person, so they could decide how to proceed. This puts them in business with investor Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling and based on real-life investor Greg Lippmann), a man whose honesty is brought into question more than once during the movie. Two others who catch wind of Burry's scheme are talented and hungry young fund managers Jamie Shipley (based on Jamie Mai and played by Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (based on Charlie Ledley and played by John Magaro) who bring in retired banker Ben Rickert (based on Ben Hockett and played by Brad Pitt) to help them navigate these treacherous financial waters. In short, ""The Big Short"" is about the people who arrived at the same conclusion about the weak U.S. housing market, what else they learned and what they did about it.<br/><br/>This film does as well as could be expected in making its subject matter understandable and compelling and may even be said to exceed expectations. Directed and co-written by comedy writer/director Adam McKay (who only got the job after agreeing to do the second ""Anchorman"" movie) and based on Michael Lewis' 2010 book, ""The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine"", this film simplifies and explains things fairly well without dumbing down its subject matter or sacrificing the points it wants to make. Sometimes McKay's actors break ""the fourth wall"" and talk directly to the camera, while other times celebrities like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain show up to take us through object lessons of complex concepts. For the most part, it works. Strong acting from several previous Oscar winners and/or nominees also helps make the plot understandable and lends gravitas to the story. Handicapping the film's entertainment value, there are no heroes in this movie, which boils down to greedy people profiting from other greedy people who took advantage of unwise people. However, the film brings to a mass audience important lessons that we all need to understand on some level. ""The Big Short"" gets credit for that and for very nearly overcoming its topic's very high degree of difficulty. ""B+"""
"shakawtwf","3","5","13","11 January 2016"," Takes a confusing situation and makes it more so
","I feel this film fails on a number of levels: 1) It centers on a bunch of characters that I couldn't care about. It wasn't so much about what caused the mortgage crisis but about people who took advantage of the crisis to make money for themselves. I didn't understand what they were doing to accomplish this. They were doing ""something"" that would make them a lot of money if mortgages failed but I never really understood what that was.<br/><br/>2) The frenetic style of the film was disorienting and distracting.<br/><br/>3) The asides with famous people explaining things was irritating. And the famous people weren't A-list celebrities, it was like these were the best ones that they could get.<br/><br/>4) After being spoon-fed information, I still feel like I didn't understand what they were talking about. (Perhaps I just didn't care.)<br/><br/>5) Perhaps if they included how the mortgage crisis affected real people, that might have helped (they showed ONE family leaving in their car but these folks were renters and could move elsewhere). They didn't ACTUALLY lose their own house.<br/><br/>6) There's a line from an episode of ""Frasier"" where Roz says, ""Throw in a couple of strippers and that still sounds dull"". There were a couple of strippers in this movie for NO good reason and it was still dull.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie self-indulgent on the director's part (""Hey look ma, I'm a director!"") and on the part of the characters. I don't feel I learned anything. And apparently no one involved in the financial world did either."

"stephendaxter","5","4","10","15 January 2016"," Well...... That was disappointing......
","'The Big Short', nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.... and i have just one question. Why? I thought the trailer looked pretty good, it was about a somewhat interesting topic that i knew jack about, but with big names attached and a very positive response, i was expecting more, a lot more. This is not going to be a popular opinion as clearly lots of people love this movie, but i must have missed something, or lots of things as for a good 50% of this film i was bored out of my mind. This was a Drama/Biopic focusing on a very serious and from what i gathered very complex topic revolving around the collapse of the economy, bank stuff, the housing market, and a tonne of other stuff i have no idea about. So it had an uphill task from the beginning, trying to get me interested in the film for 2 hours. And in the end, it only managed to do that for about half of the film. I thought the acting was definitely a positive from everyone, the flicker of humour was well implemented and some unique or interesting choices made in the editing of the film had me really enjoying it at some moments. But everything else..... yeh not so great.<br/><br/>The film started out rather engaging, being introduced to all these various characters was fun. It had a serious yet slightly quirky tone, and i gotta say it was great that they kept that tone consistent the whole way through. I was following what was going on, and it was going at a nice calm pace allowing me to pick up most things and piece things together. The film at this point was very interesting and entertaining and had pleasantly surprised me with the editing choices made so far. And that lasted for about an hour, then it just kept going, and going, and i began to lose interest fast, to the point where 20 minutes later i just wanted this thing to be over. I was barely following what was going on with all these numbers and who all these people were and their connections to the story, and it severely hurt my enjoyment of the film. The film even tries to carry people along by stopping the film to have various famous faces explain some of the concepts and banking terms being used. Now although i found these moments surprising and rather fun to watch, i was still just as lost afterwards as i was before. All of this may just be my inability to understand what was going on, or the story maybe was presented in a shitty incomprehensible manner with terrible writing. I'm not right and i'm not wrong.<br/><br/>The acting all across the board was really good, Steve Carrell did a great job as whoever he was, Ryan Gosling put in a strong performance, Brad Pitt was good i guess, and Christian Bale did a great job also and was probably the best of the bunch. They definitely committed to their roles and each one of their personalities felt different and their characters at times had some very interesting dialogue and things to say. But their performances just couldn't get me invested in what was going on. The humour was well delivered, i laughed a few times, and it was a pretty nice blend of humour into this very serious topic and breathed a bit of fresh air into the film. But for me, after that half way point i just couldn't appreciate any of that stuff anymore because i was so bored from my lack of interest in what was going on. I am not saying this is a god awful movie, and i'm definitely not saying that it doesn't deserve to be nominated for all of those Academy Awards, but if it was up to me, Terminator Genisys would be up for Best Picture before i even consider this.<br/><br/>So if you really want to see this film, go right ahead, you will probably get something out of it that i most certainly did not. If you end up agreeing with me that's great, if you end up completely disagreeing with me then that's even better.<br/><br/>4.8/10"

","Please don't shortchange me in a big way if I invest in a wealth of puns on my review of the financial dark comedy ""The Big Short"". Writer-Director Adam McKay focuses on a number of financial outcast wizards that via circumstance and research predicted the housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000's. The film was enriched with eccentric characters which gave the film a big bonus; but it was the performances that made its stock rise. Most notably, the great Christian Bale as Dr. Michael Burry, a rebellious glass-eyed financier who noticed the first inkling of the collapse. I hope the Academy does not Bale out Christian in the Best Supporting Actor category. Other fine thespian turns derived from Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and a very brief but whopping performance from Melissa Leo. McKay's direction and script (which he co-wrote with Charles Randolph) is on the epitome of financially complex terminology & comprehension; so it would not be a bad idea to take your personal CFO when heading out to view ""The Big Short""; and yes, multiple viewings is a good idea for further numerical knowledge; and you can take that to the bank!

","I finally learned the meaning of big high-finance words like synthetic CDOs, MBS, shorting, sub-primes, hedge funds, bonds and so on. Cognitive thoughts flew in my face at the speed of light and big high-finance words bombarded me at Mach3. This is scathingly funny, whip smart, surprisingly intelligible to laymen and a crackerjack of a movie and the best part is it actually has a conscience beating at its centre. <br/><br/>In 2005, eccentric and socially awkward hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) discovers that the U.S. housing market is extremely unstable, being based on subprime loans that are high risk and providing fewer and fewer returns. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007, he realizes that he can profit from this situation by creating a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against the housing market. Banks thought that he is giving ""free"" money and accept his proposal. Burry faces pressure from every direction and finds solace in his Death Metal. He continues to beat the drum at his own pace and eventually brought in 489% profit while the rest of the world are covered in red. <br/><br/>Then we have a trader named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who hears of Burry's actions from one of the bankers he dealt with, and soon realizes that Burry's predictions are true. He decides to put his own stake in the credit default swap market. A misplaced phone call alerts hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to his plans, and Baum is convinced to join Vennett. Baum is a man who sees the world as one big giant surreal Enya MTV and he runs in counterpoint to everyone, circling the brim of anger and madness. <br/><br/>Finally, we have a pair of eager young investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) who discover a flyer by Vennett and also decide to become involved in the credit default swaps. Since they are too inexperienced to pull off the trades necessary to profit from the situation, they enlist the aid of retired banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt). <br/><br/>Together these individuals discovered the groundwork for the financial crisis of 2007-2010 and managed to profit enormously from it, but are ultimately left with their faith in the system shaken. This isn't a poor to riches or a ""I told you so"" story. These people are drawn like antiestablishment reluctant heroes calling out the big financial institutions for their greed and lack of foresight. In the midst of the narrative's relentless propulsion it retains a compassion for the everyday American without the histrionics. <br/><br/>For a movie with so many high concepts flying around, it is surprisingly easy to understand. Part of its marvel is that the film employs a very creative way of making the concepts digestible and scintillatingly funny. Imagine Margot Robbie in a tub, Selena Gomez in a casino and Anthony Bourdain in a kitchen using simple setups and tools to explain the high finance concepts. It is so funny but yet educational. The best one has to be the one using Jenga bricks to explain the housing bubble. These are scary big financial terms invented to screw with your brains but after this 2-hour tutorial you will be smarter. I guarantee you will remember the concepts better than what your university professor had lectured. <br/><br/>The energy is recklessly infectious and I was easily caught in a whirlwind of euphoria. Using an unreliable narrator who breaks the fourth wall and even lays out all the Hollywood contrivances, we get a very entertaining film that throws everything including the kitchen sink at you. A film that is so top heavy should by logical sense be bogged down by the sheer weight of its self-importance, but Adam McKay didn't make that film. Thankfully, in the midst of all the reckless abandonment, it retains a core of seething anger at the fraud of the institutions which were at last bailed out by the very taxpayers they were out to screw in the beginning. Contrary to what Gordon Gekko has proclaimed, greed is not good."

Without a significant hero, the choice of the cast is definitely perfect - Bale, Carell, Gosling and Pitt perform extremely well, together with the supporting casts to play around with mortgage, subprime rates and credit debts. Despite illustrating this subject in a triumphant way, it has also successfully delivered self- awareness regarding desperation, political corruptions and collateral damages in economy slowdown; leaving an impression of skepticism on Wall Street while restoring some faith in Hollywood's capability in making great films."

Lewis's book points out the role of the Federal Government in loosening lending requirements and in abolishing Glass Steagall; the film doesn't touch that aspect of the story. Instead it focuses on the obsessive outsiders who actually read the contents of the mortgage bonds and couldn't believe what they saw.The ensemble cast is excellent, and the various threads are drawn together expertly toward the looming disaster. The metaphorical relationships and settings equate American capitalism with gambling in Las Vegas. The house always wins and the losers are the average chumps. <br/><br/>The film subverts the satisfactions of the ""heist"" genre because the victory of the ""heroes"" (Burry, Baum etc.) comes at great cost to everyone else, even though there is satisfaction in seeing these prophets in the wilderness vindicated. Ultimately, this movie is about how difficult socially and financially it can be to tell the truth, even when it's in plain sight. <br/><br/>If you lived in New York or in Florida at that time, you will chuckle at the evocation of the bubble period (not that long ago but it seems like a million years ago)."

","American comedy directors/writers have been getting a bad reputation over the last decade. The visual grammar of American comedies has gotten to the point of glorified improv as proved from the yearly Will Ferrell vehicles to Hollywood's insistence that Kevin Hart is a leading man. Adam McKay has certainly been no stranger to such rigmarole and truth be told I have written him off as a comedic dilettante of nearly Todd Phillips-like proportions. The Big Short may not be McKay at his most serious or even at his most ambitious yet there is a alluring mix of humor, pathos and true-story tropes that may have just changed the grammar of both comedy and biography for the better.<br/><br/>The story follows an ensemble cast of middle-to-high-class white guys who caught onto the ambit of the 2008 financial crisis two years before anyone else. Among them is Dr. Michael Burry (Bale) a California hedge fund manager and admitted ""outsider"" who became the only one who bothered to check the subprime mortgage loan market in- depth. Leading banks at the time were all too happy to sell him credit default swaps on a housing market that has ""never"" seen a crash. Then Dr. Burry's investing caught the eyes of others including a duo of young money managers Collins and Geller (Wittlock and Magaro) and all independently looked to short the stocks; i.e. bet against the housing market and the American economy as a whole.<br/><br/>If it all sounds complicated, it's because it is. Even the demurring Gosling states this fact in an aside while musing stockbrokers and bankers purposely make it complicated to justify their own position. It's a statement that walks the line between self-evident platitude and mind-boggling absurdity to the point where McKay seems like a laudable choice for director. McKay creates a kaleidoscope of intellectual montage and employs a number of dramatic devices all in the service of a story so ludicrous it must be true. There are asides that boil down the complexities of financial markets into dynamic mini-lessons complete with diagrams and buzz word definitions; there is frenzied footage of news, entertainment and reality TV inter-spliced with the action to create an almost documentary-like pacing and there are even random cameos that are just plain brilliant.<br/><br/>Thematically many would link The Big Short to Wolf of Wall Street (2013) or Boiler Room (2000). Those who do are making a mistake. For while avarice and it's consequences are apparent, the common thread here but stupidity. Stupidity in the face of fraud and lack of foresight. Margin Call (2011) brought an equal amount of scrutiny to the financial markets and the regulators who are supposed to mange them. Yet while pre-dating this film by four years, it wasn't the galvanizing force it should have been. It also wasn't quite as entertaining.<br/><br/>The Big Short is one of the best films of 2015 and arguably the most important movie about the 2008 financial crisis. It is at all points crass, educational, heartfelt, angry, sincere and riotously hilarious. It features great performances by its largely male cast and the mis en scene can be seen as a meta-analysis of how we view not just the Great Recession but movies as well. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated, ""I discovered a flaw in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works."" As we see now, the world works in an almost tragicomedic way. I suppose we've gotten to the point where we can all laugh about the 8 million American who lost their jobs and the trillions of dollars lost; after all, there comes a point where you have nothing left to do but chuckle."

","The story is simple - a few guys knew the housing market and banks were going to crash and each wondered how to profit from this information before the market reacted.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays the mathematician who figured it out first and over time others caught wind of his research. <br/><br/>The financial instruments and definitions are explained outside the story with humour. Some parts of the story (like the trip to Florida) are made more shocking because of the casual nature of those involved.<br/><br/>In fairness - if you have money invested in the stock market, after watching this you may seriously consider digging a hole in the garden to bury your treasure or investing in something you understand and control more.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't recognise Brad Pitt until his final scene, he was so transformed. Rafe Spall, who seems to be everywhere all of a sudden, has a decent American accent. Marisa Tomei, who is great in everything she does, could have had a bigger part rather than all of the Steve Carell energy.<br/><br/>It has a great script and directing but the acting was not extraordinary, perhaps because the story is so gripping. It isn't a thriller in the way 'Margin Call' was because the badie here is the system, 'going along to get along' and a lack of consequences.<br/><br/>I suspect more than one person will buy seeds after seeing this film!!"
"KineticSeoul","8","2","4","1 January 2016"," A story that needed to be told
","This was a really interesting film based on a crazy story that needed to be told. I will start out by saying this is a film you need to turn your brain on and focus in on it to get what is going on. The film is about corruption, the collapse of the housing market and the people that was in on it. Some having more of a conscience to do the right thing or at least caring more than others. Because it deals with screwing over hardworking Americans by giving them false hope. Now I am not a numbers guy, don't really have much passion for economics and banking. So I was confused about few of the technical terms they share, but this film had my interest and attention all the way through because of how it's constructed and orchestrated. What interested me is how it plays upon human psychology. At that time betting against the housing market was thought of as ludicrous because most people thought the system was stable. However Michael Burry who is a fund manager finds a crack in the system and decides the capitalize upon it. And while this is going on people either think he is crazy or wants to be in on it as well. People got a sniff of this huge money making chance and it revolves around people that wants to be part of it. Despite them basically making money off of the suffering of others. How innocent people will lose their homes, their jobs, their retirement over this. Throughout this crazy story, a lot of integration of logic and equation gets put into action. It is a complex plot, but I thought they did a good job of using certain analogies to help the mainstream audiences get what was going on. More than the directing style, it's the plot which is based on a true story that intrigued me through out the whole ordeal. And because of the cast fit the roles so darn well, except Christian Bale as Michael Burry. I mean he is a good actor and he did a fine job, but he just didn't seem like Michael. So it's not that Christian Bale put on a bad performance, it's a bit of a miscast. However Bale will be a part of marketing this film. To viewers that didn't really know in depth what happened in this huge financial crisis will be in shock. <br/><br/>8.3/10"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","4","30 December 2015"," An intriguing, fascinating, often exhausting and flawed tale
","Overall, a pretty great film that manages to work on both a story-telling level and on a character level, despite how busy it all is. The problem is in essence how busy it all is when it didn't need to. All of the side-explanations, the wink-wink, fourth-wall breaking stuff should not have been there. It was all meant for humor more than actual explanations, and that's fine in aim. It just wasn't funny and felt both condescending and just really annoying. The screenplay did a fine job of really telling this story so all of that was just distracting. I also think the editing at times attempts to show off just for the sake of it, but it also was able to provide the story with a much- needed pace. It's a conflicting editing achievement, no doubt. I think both Christian Bale and Steve Carrell provide some fine work, the latter in particular is more convincing here than he was in last year's Foxcatcher. Both are the emotional anchors of the story and they do very well. The entire cast is superb though, and really gives the Spotlight cast a run for their money."

If well done then maybe. They were not well inserted into the theme, they were added awkwardly and attached more confusion to what already was a confusing subject to some. Insulting and baby-like explanations that really pulled your thoughts away then your mind had to settle back into the main storyline once again. If meant to lighten up a heavy subject they did not work. Even if the director thought putting Margot Robbie naked in a bathtub, covered only by bubble bath, and having her explain Wall Street terms made them more understandable - she did not. Otherwise well-done and saved by a great cast."

","I do not grasp what Hedge Fund Managers do, or what Collateralized Debt Obligations (CODs), Credit Default Swaps, Mortgage Backed Securities (MPS) and subprime mortgages are, and what it means to ""short"" something, but director Adam McCay's THE BIG SHORT based on Michael Lewis' book is an excellent film - both comedic and forcefully tragic with many fine actors making this a movie that is both entertaining and deceptively poignant. Surprisingly we do get to understand a lot of what was going on in the fiscal system without having to take a course in the particulars. This is accomplished through visuals - quick flashes of TV shows, cinema and pop stars, artworks, news headlines, sports figures, etc. all subliminally flashing before our eyes embedding the culture of money into our psyches. Throughout the film, there are witty respites whereby the camera exits the narrative, and various actors in wildly strange settings explain Wall Street jargon with idiosyncratic humor to make the ""wheeling and dealing"" more comprehensible. <br/><br/>I left the theater with an abysmal feeling of sadness, my voice cracking and tears in my eyes - not wanting to betray my emotions and my fierce anger at a capitalist system gone completely awry; rigged and fraudulent in handing the money of everyday working people whose pensions, domiciles, and livelihoods were placed into the hands of manipulative, raptor-like greedy banks and money managers. Billions - not millions - of dollars are just abstract numbers to be gambled with as the ""party"" keeps blasting upwards and onwards, monetary gains piling up, until it all implodes with aftershocks eventually destroying the income, employment and shuttering the homes of millions in the US and globally.<br/><br/>Many of the main characters are based on real people who worked for Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns among other firms. Christian Bale is terrific as Dr. Michael Burry, a Cassandra-like figure, an eccentric - characterized by walking around barefooted - who foresaw the mortgage collapse early on, watching banks bundle mortgages which were being given AAA ratings by Moody's and Standard and Poor's without proper examination of the underlying financial integrity of the lenders and borrowers. Burry decides to ""short"" - to bet on a future housing crisis debacle and is ultimately proved correct.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell portrays Mark Baum, an irascible individual, who was one of the few conscience stricken players in the ""money game"", trying to make participants aware of the looming future cataclysm, but also wrestling with his own hypocrisy in personally profiting from the 2008 world economic bankruptcy. He is an anguished ""truth teller"" antithetical to most characters engaging in this closed world of financial gains and losses, whose egos get propped up by the insubstantial glint of wealth.<br/><br/>The director McCay includes every type of trader - from self-centered, sophomoric ""masters of the universe"" to those with some integrity and concern for their clients. The editing is quick and incredibly entertaining for a subject that could easily put many of us to sleep. In THE BIG SHORT we are made painfully aware of the collusion of institutions and governmental agencies, all profiting from the deception that the housing market was one of the best and most secure investments to be made. We see the social and human ramifications of this delusion that brought world markets to the brink of financial collapse. <br/><br/>Unlike previous films about Wall Street, this is a true story - a tale that is still resonating in our minds and pocketbooks. Many ordinary persons were encouraged and seduced by the easy access to home ownership, low interest rates that often skyrocketed a few years later to the bewilderment of landlords and tenants who had to flee their properties. This drama showed how the Banks were ""brought down"", but today we are still wondering were they ever punished? Cynicism persists as new ploys and risky gambits continue to be placed before a gullible public by corruptible institutions functioning without legislated safeguards."

","From outsiders in the world of high-finance who predicted the credit bubble collapse of the mid-2000s decide to take on the big banks for their lack of foresight and greed.<br/><br/>Adam McKay to me was the least likely candidate in Hollywood director to make a brainy movie such as The Big Short; as the only film I've ever seen from him is Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Still this film is based on Michael Lewis' 2010 non-fiction Best-Seller. Of all the current century's most cataclysmic world- historical events: the 2007-2008 financial crisis is probably among the most poorly understood. The road taken by this film is by far the most radical approach of the story. Above all, the cast is on point, to be sure, with everyone seeming to take enthusiastic pleasure in disappearing into the roles of societal misfits of one kind or another. In fact the script focuses on the handful of men in the field - most of whom are at least half-insane. However none of them are really easy to root for. Ryan Gosling's character uses smart-ass charm, leading viewers through the ins and outs of this game. Christian Bale as a socially awkward, speed metal-loving-doctor-turned- money manager who was the first to notice that the market was built on a house of cards. Only Steve Carell's character comes out as genuine and empathetic. <br/><br/>This film reminded me a lot of The Wolf of Wall Street in its hyper-caffeinated energy. Plus director hyper real approach might be exactly what the story needed, given how far removed from the reality-based community so many of the highest paid financial gurus were at that time. I supposed you could call The Big Short a comedy as it is very, very funny. But it is also a tragedy as McKay couldn't be more serious about his film's message: which is that anyone who ever bought into the version of the American Dream, that included their own home, has been fooled by the banks, the regulators and the government; who all seemed to interpret capitalism as a license to rob people blindly. <br/><br/>Overall McKay deserves a lot of credit for making this movie and he also deserves to be taken seriously now as a filmmaker."

","The 2007-2008 financial crisis was a dark time for many people across the world. It should go without saying that economics is an extremely complex subject that no single person fully understands. It can seem kind of far away now, given recent events, but it was a huge deal at the time. And despite that, a lot of people still do not understand it because, again, economics is complicated. So how do you put a topic like into a format the average layman can understand? Why you turn it into a black comedy film of course! Enter, The Big Short.<br/><br/>A comedy movie about people in high society doing bad things for money is not exactly a new concept. Every few years we see one of these, like The Big Short or The Wolf on Wall Street. And they are as hilarious as they are terrifying. I like watching horror movies, I've seen more than 1,000 of those things, and these films are scarier than anything in the horror category.<br/><br/>Now, you always have to take these ""based on a true story"" movies with a grain of salt. But The Big Short was surprisingly good about this. Not 100% good, but better than most other films. The big thing is that the movie portrays the characters as if they were the only ones to see the financial crisis coming. But a lot of people back then knew there was a housing bubble. The thing that made these people special was figuring out it would happen soon. And the movie makes a big point of them researching the housing market and realizing how rotten the banking industry's system is. It turns out that people buying houses they couldn't afford with money they didn't have from the banks that weren't paying attention was a bad thing. Who knew?<br/><br/>And at the end of the day, you cannot really argue that the protagonists are good people. They are all banking on the economy to collapse and have set themselves up to profit from the disaster. But the flipside of that is: what else were they supposed to do? The goal of any business, banks included, is to make more money constantly. Gotta keep those shareholders happy, baby. They probably would have been laughed out of the room even if they could have gotten some banking or government bigwigs to listen to their argument. The lack of action against the bankers following the financial crisis seems to back that up.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a film everyone should watch since it is a very important piece of recent history. And it's just, you know, a good movie. Great actors, a strong script, and a portrayal of real-world events that will keep you up at night. Good times."

","The Big Short is such a frustrating story to watch, providing us with a peak behind the curtain of the collapse of the American housing market and the eventual global financial crisis of 2008. I say frustrating because the story delves even deeper into the apathy of big banks in causing this crisis. Their willingness to driving the economy off the edge of a cliff, knowing that they had a parachute with a healthy bonus to boot is maddening.<br/><br/>It's a story told from the interwoven perspectives of three different investment fund managers, with the addition of Ryan Gosling's Deutsche Bank worker in the mix. The Big Short is a little hard to follow at times, not unexpected due to it's subject matter. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on mortgage bonds, funds, credit ratings etc, although thankfully the film is pretty forgiving in assuming a lack of knowledge. In an inspired move, the film introduces several well known celebrities such as Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez in fourth wall breaking intermissions to explain terminology. That still didn't get me up to speed, but it helped. Other fourth wall breaking asides from Gosling also helped to provide context around meaty financial concepts.<br/><br/>With this in mind, The Big Short did a great job in making what could have been an incredibly dense and boring subject into a fast paced and gripping story. Unsurprisingly a lot of this is due to the star studded cast. Ryan Gosling injected the majority of the humour into the film, playing a no nonsense banker out for a profit, the Wall Street archetype. Christian Bale, as expected, gave a well measured and precise portrayal of the socially awkward and brilliant fund manager. The real standout for me was Steve Carrell, who plays yet another fund manager, but a much more cynical one, who, due to his empathy, we can relate to most as an audience. All the performances were great, but these three were the real standouts.<br/><br/>The Big Short triumphed in many other areas as well. The direction was so slick and Adam McKay really excelled. As mentioned, he managed to transform what could have been a very heavy film into something more resembling a thriller! Truly remarkable in my book. The soundtrack was perfect and used very well throughout to heighten the drama and suspense where necessary.<br/><br/>Despite the ins and outs going over my head, The Big Short manages to be really engaging, exciting, and also funny in parts! Definitely deserving of its several Oscar nods, a great film."

","The wages of avarice is death. On Wall Street, where everyone wants to go, their desires are infinitely inflated, and it seems that making money is too easy to expand to obscure the most basic moral bottom line. It doesn't matter if the banker sacrifices the basic livelihood security of thousands of ordinary mortgage lenders for his own wealth and wealth. Although the film shows some mavericks, Mark who scoffs at all immorality, Micheal, who closed the fund after the subprime mortgage crisis, has long been disappointed in the financial circle, and then the golden pot washes his hands to start rural life. After all, the race is still a minority. Financial practitioners have spent a lot of time and effort to make themselves an ""elite"". Why not invest so much in making money to make money? However, according to the values of my favorite lawyer, Gumimen, everyone is desperate to protect their own interests. Such survival of the fittest is truly unconstrained social justice.

","As a financier myself I love a good finance related movie provided the plot is accurate and sophisticated enough not to patronise the audience.
This movie unfortunately fails to a certain extent on those factors.
The key drivers of the 2008 crash are discussed but they are revealed in a somewhat flippant and over simplistic way that doesn't really properly explain real events.
We have cuts to famous celebs explaining to the dumb viewer in a ridiculously convoluted manner, the workings of CDOs or Synthetic CDOs. OK it probably decently educates many who are clueless on these systems and correctly displays how the banks and brokers and investment trusts manipulate and suck the money out of the average working person through shady deals and counter deals but this is only just the tip of the iceberg.
The daylight robbery of the American people began long before 2008 when Nixon took the US Dollar off the Gold standard and turned it into fiat. The printing began robbing Americans of their savings, their salaries and their wealth on a drip drip basis. Asset bubbles already began to build long before 2007 and the SubPrime Scandal was only one of many pins that popped the bubble.
The banks and investment managers are crooks but the biggest crook of all is Uncle Sam and the Fed.<br/><br/>The Big Short has good enough suspense with great performances by Carroll & Gosling. Bale
tries a bit too hard on a slightly autistic caricature of Burry and Pitt is largely superfluous to the dynamic.<br/><br/>Its way better than Dubuque's ""The Accountant"" in its sophistry but well short of the reaches of ""Margin Call"" , ""Inside Job"", ""Wall Street"" ""The Wolf of Wall street"" or ""Equity"".<br/><br/>Nevertheless, more of this genre please."

","Most of you reading this review remember the last time the U.S. had a downturn in it's economy - it was 2008 and the downturn was caused by a bubble that burst in the housing market. Michael Lewis' (author of MONEYBALL) book THE BIG SHORT attempted to explain what happend in lay man's terms. This books was considered ""unfilmable"" until the most unlikeliest of artists stepped in to make a wonderfully crafted and educational film that was also entertaining.<br/><br/>That person was Adam McKay - up until that time, known as the Director of such Will Ferrell films as STEP BROTHERS and ANCHORMAN.<br/><br/>Set in the timeframe right before - and during - the economic downturn (approx. 2006-2008), THE BIG SHORT follows 4 groups/individuals that begin to see that something is wrong - both with this seemingly ""bullet proof"" housing market and the institutions/regulations and governance around them.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is outstanding (and was nominated for an Oscar) for his work as Dr. Michael Burry a socially awkward genius who is the first to ferret out that something is wrong and ""bets against the market"". Bale's portrayal of a non-social (almost) recluse who speaks his mind is engaging and fascinating to watch. It was with this performance that I decided that Bale is, perhaps, the finest actor working today. Also stepping up his game - as a surprise to me - is Ryan Gosling as the narrator of this story. He has the right balance of charm and ""smarminess"" and often breaks the 4th wall to explain to us what is going on. Also on board, strongly, is Brad Pitt (one of the Producers of this film) as an ex-Wall Street maverick who is pulled back in by the opportunity this impending crash is creating.<br/><br/>But, the surprise to me in this film is the heart-breaking, gut-wrenching turn of Steve Carrell as Wall Street broker Mark Baum who's caustic personality hides some serious scars underneath and who takes the failures of ""the system"" to protect the people personally. Carrell was nominated for an Oscar the year before in his first major dramatic turn - FOXCATCHER - but I think his work here is stronger, more layered and nuanced and (if there is a hero in this story) had you rooting for this guy throughout the film.<br/><br/>But...none of this would have worked if McKay didn't figure out a way to make the boring-ness and tedium of explaining the housing financial system (tranches, CDO's, default swaps, etc) in such a way that educates and entertains the audience - and find a way he did. By pulling celebrities like Anthony Bordain, Selena Gomez and Margot Robbie in to break the 4th wall and explain extremely dry subject matter in such a way as to make it understandable and enjoyable, he makes this film succeed.<br/><br/>And, succeed it does, as it's 5 Oscar nominations (including Best Picture, Best Director and the aforementioned Best Supporting Actor nomination for Bale - a nomination that I would have been happy had Carrell gotten) would attest to - it did win the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay (for McKay and Charles Randolph).<br/><br/>This is a film that gets better for me on each rewatch, for I understand just a little more. If this is your 1st time watch - or your 10th - check out the BIG SHORT, it will be worth your time.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"spicymjp","8","0","0","18 April 2020"," The Big Short
","The Big Short<br/><br/>""The Big Short"", written and directed by Adam McKay, depicts the true story of the 2008 Great Recession, also known as the ""Subprime Mortgage Crisis"". Going into the film, I hadn't expected it to be anything intellectual. I mean, it was written by the same guy that created ""Stepbrothers"", ""Talledega Nights"", ""Anchorman"", etc. However, ""The Big Short"" is surprisingly a cohesive, informative film with tons of entertaining moments and techniques.<br/><br/>Originally, in 2006, the crisis occurred due to the mortgage rates plummeting. Many subprime homeowners with high interest rates received loans that were improperly dismissed / ignored by the banks. In turn, many of the corrupted insurance groups bought stocks / maintained CDO's assuming they'd be making great business, but instead lost revenue which essentially created the recession. Only a select few noticed this inevitable crash (Burry, Baum, Geller, Shipley, etc) and decided to short (bet against) the mortgage bonds, causing heads to turn and patronize them. The ending left me disappointed but not surprised. It was a solid message / reality check at how corrupt the system is and how there's nothing we can do about it. I'm not heavily invested into politics but the implications of greed and capitalism were clear.<br/><br/>The Big Short, in my opinion, uses unconventional, yet engaging characters and storytelling very well. Christian Bale and Steve Carrell are highly convincing ""outcasts"", as well as exceptional performances from Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, and the remaining cast. I also really enjoyed the 4th wall breaks between prominent characters, as well as guest appearances from Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain.<br/><br/>The camera techniques were probably my favorite aspect to the film. The pan shots, snap-zooms and steadicam shots are identical to shows like ""The Office"", ""Parks and Recreation"", ""Modern Family"", etc. In this sense, ""The Big Short"" manages to engage the audience in a relatively educational biopic.<br/><br/>The Big Short, to me, is another great biopic that depicts a socioeconomic / financial crash caused by the corrupted system. The film remains grounded and easy to comprehend for simpletons like me. Many will say it's too corny / unorthodox, but I believe the screenwriting benefits the atmosphere/ subject matter well.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Monty Python famously said 'no-one expects the Spanish inquistion.' And no-one expects a major recession either, or else they'd take action to avoid it. The global economic crisis that struck in 2008 came from a sudden collapse in the housing market, and from the financial products that the banks had created that were essentially a bet on this not happening. Only a few people had predicted it would all end in tears. And Michael Lewis' book, 'The Big Short', here made into a film by Adam McKay, tells the story of those few. What makes the narrative appealing (regardless of how complete a truth it is) is that the few were misfits and outsiders, people denied entry to the club of deluded money market insiders. But the film, though entertaining, is only partially succesful. The explanation of how and why things happened is superficial, while the viewer is essentially being asked to root for one group of wealthy investment managers over another. Some of them denounce the essentially fraudulent nature of the major players, but their personal goals are primarily to get rich themselves by exploiting their discovery. They're also mostly obnoxious, and I'm not so certain that being smart, and right, is enough to make you a hero. As a film, I prefered 'Margin Call', a sympathetic look at the lions of Wall Street laid low by the crash, to this more hostile treatment, even if they did all belong in jail."

","Few Americans were left exempt from the 2007-08 housing crash that would spark the largest economic recession since the 1930's Wall Street fiasco. Adam McKay's satirical comedy The Big Short highlighted the twisted realities that a detached populous inherits when Wall Street bankers are left to their own devices not through the heartbreaking imagery of a shattered middle America, but rather the antics of the very hedge fund managers that foresaw and profited from their demise. <br/><br/>These glorified Vegas gamblers were played by the film's star studded cast including Steve Carrell as the loud-mouthed watch dog Mark Baum, Ryan Gosling as the swanky mover-and-shaker Jared Venett, and Brad Pitt as the former Wall Street cutthroat turned moral-compass-wielding white knight Ben Rickert. While each of these gentlemen embraced their roles near flawlessly, the standout performance was stolen by the Nostradamus of the housing bubble, Christian Bale. In his transformational role as Dr. Michael Burry, Bale captures the eccentricity of a man dismissed as a lunatic by his peers and clients in such a way that the viewer sympathizes in the marvel of his genius.<br/><br/>The performances by the A-List ensemble were accompanied by a magnificently selected and well-timed soundtrack that was the musical embodiment of the pre-Recession arrogance that was America's financial system. While dizzying at times, the choppy scene shots, quick camera movement, and real world video insertions serve as foreshadowing of the extent of the chaos looming beneath the feet of the unsuspecting global economy while displaying McKay's distinctive style.<br/><br/>When developing the screenplay, the film's writers had to overcome the hurdle that lay at the root of the housing market crash itself, the Average Joe's lack of understanding of what the hell these Wall Street snobs were doing behind the curtain. McKay masterfully accomplishes this by incorporating on-screen vocabulary and unique video cuts featuring the likes of Selena Gomez playing blackjack and Margot Robbie in a bubble bath. These offer both explanations for the financial jargon being tossed around in layman's terms and poke at American pop culture's obsession with celebrity activity while adding a stylistic eccentricity in line with the rest of film. <br/><br/>Despite being tagged as an R-Rated comedy with an array of profane language, housing tycoon strippers, and fourth-wall breaking character monologues like those found in Carrell's hit series The Office, The Big Short transcends playful political satire. Each on-screen act of careless greed re-opens middle America's emotional scarring inflicted by the Great Recession and leaves viewers with sobering recollections of distrust and uncertainty that continue to ripple through cultural and political discussion today. While butter-doused popcorn alongside your favorite boxed candy and a monstrous fountain soda are clear necessities to properly enjoy this must-see satirical film revolving around pompous American culture, be sure to pack a toothbrush and some Altoids for the bitter taste that will be left in your mouth after watching."

The movie moves at a brisk pace, with lots of flashy cameos, sharp inter cuts and snippets of financial education delivered in memorable and clever ways.

"asifahsankhan","9","0","0","15 January 2017"," The Best Film Made On this Moment in History... Almost!
","If anyone hasn't seen ""The Big Short"" yet, it comes highly recommended. Not only just it uncover the absolutely fraudulent nature of Wall-Street, in the years prior to the Financial Crisis, but it breaks down the various financial technicalities into easily palatable and understandable metaphors.<br/><br/>Anyone else thinks this movie looks like it is set in the 80s and not 2005? I refuse to believe I dressed like that 10 years ago. The film stars a whole skew of Hollywood leading me to take on the shady men. most importantly, Ryan Gosling. Okay forget that part. <br/><br/>It really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging, but also mortifying; As Roger Ebert's website puts it: A good alternate title might be ""American Horror Story.""<br/><br/>The movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of the events surrounding the initial financial shock which culminated in the 2008/09 Financial Crisis and excels in mixing humour and serious candour to communicate its message.<br/><br/>How accurate was the subject matter of the movie? Pretty accurate really, and it is much better than reading the scathing 663 page report from the US Government on the subsequent crisis.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the screenplay is almost as well-structured, informative, and entertaining an adaptation of a complex work of non-fiction as Nicholas Pileggi's and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. McKay and Randolph focus on just the right number of characters and find inventive ways to keep the movie light, funny, and easy to understand; yet their approach almost never devolves into shtick or patronizingly juvenile spoon-feeding of information. Unlike most documentaries about the causes of the global 2008 recession, The Big Short doesn't work backwards, investigating abstract causes and effects. Instead, it gives us compelling, quirky protagonists we can identify with and intertwines the minutia of the financial system into the goals, obstacles, and story arcs of these men. Though McKay and Randolph utilize several narrative devices I don't love—multiple narrators directly addressing the camera, breaking story continuity to explain complex concepts in whimsical ways, video clip montages meant to set time and place or contextualise ideas—these are few and far between and, for the most part, they work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the same can't be said for McKay's directing style. I wish McKay, the head writer for Saturday Night Live during one of its stronger eras, had more faith in the written word, but his bloated, semi-improvised comedy features rush through as many jokes as possible, never fully allowing a whole to form from the sum of its parts. The hurried approach is even more injurious to this primarily dramatic feature. The Big Short is not a patient movie and therefore it's far less potent than J. C. Chandor's tense and secretive Margin Call (2011)—still the best film made on this moment in history. And should've won an Oscar for ""best picture"" rather than just getting a nomination. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses both cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It's strong stuff. <br/><br/>Especially, the cast was spectacular!<br/><br/>I began off feeling wary about this motion picture: the haircuts and garments of the primary characters were more '90s music-video than mid 2000s, and the occasionally shading de-saturated flashbacks to a few characters' back stories were a little on the inauspiciously typical side. Be that as it may, the story force, joined with the base mind of a significant part of the exchange, and the submitted acting going ahead underneath the hairpieces, all did their employment. What's more, they got over the irate, skeptical conviction behind the motion picture, which is that the real banks all occupied with fake, criminal action, and that the U.S. government safeguarded them out to the detriment of the little person, and that there's no sign that the banks wouldn't accomplish something like precisely the same once more. You are allowed to oppose this idea. Be that as it may, this is a motion picture that utilizes both silver screen craftsmanship and evident realities to put forth its defence. It's solid stuff. <br/><br/>The Big Short is a blended pack that I in any case prescribe seeing. Superior to anything any account or narrative film, TV show, or radio program I've yet observed or listened, it clarifies credit default swaps, subprime home loans, collateral's obligation commitments, and other money related builds in clear, intelligible terms. It abstains from damning things down to the point of haughtiness, yet by one means or another remaining parts a somewhat unblinking standard stimulation."

","Adam McKay offers a different perspective with regards to telling a true story. He provides us with frequent Fourth Wall breaks and cameo appearances to help us the audience understand very specific terminology, as well as analogies which also provides the film with an educational undertone to it. Standout performances from the main 4 ensemble cast, who all create interesting and memorable characters. After watching this picture it will leave you feeling cynical and judgemental to anyone who associates themselves with finance. Overall, The Big Short is a very specific true story that doesn't try to hide anything from you and instead gives you true emotions and attitudes towards a nationwide financial meltdown, with the only regret being the re-watch value to the film as you can't bring yourself to watch a powerful depiction of corruption and greed more than once."

","The Big Short tells about the years leading to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, which was caused by the United States housing bubble. It shows and explains how the situation came to be and how certain people managed to predict its inevitability and exploited it to get rich. It's filled with powerhouse actors, is over two hours long and contains almost nothing but talk about economics, money and similar things.<br/><br/>And yet it's a rather good film. This is thanks to a few things. First are the actors. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and most of the others are huge talents and their sheer presence manages to make most of the scenes work. The second reason is the script and the fact that it focuses more on the people behind the crisis rather than the crisis itself. It explores how our own ignorance, laziness and stupidity caused the housing bubble and how it took certain amount of outside the box thinking to realize it was happening.<br/><br/>That being said, I also admire how the film manages to make the crisis itself understandable and relatable to mass audiences. Whenever the plot brings up a hard term or an odd concept, the film takes a brief moment to stop and explain the thing in layman's terms, but in a way that in no way hinders the narrative. It's actually really clever how they pull it off, though I shall not spoil it here.<br/><br/>All in all The Big Short is a really good drama film. I know it doesn't sound that exciting, but trust me that in this case the execution is so good that it just works."

","This movie is not for everyone. Movies are meant to tell a story and the story can be about romance, fantasy or adventure. Something that transports you away from reality. But this movie is steeped neck-deep in reality that you'd be gasping for a breath of some good old rom-com. <br/><br/>But i personally loved this movie. Everyone who doesn't live under a rock knows about the Financial Crisis of the 2007-2008, which was attributed to the sub-prime mortgage loans. All very technical and wall-street-esque. But the movie simplifies every technical jargon or complex financial instruments in clever segments where they got celebrities like Margot Robbie and Anthony Bourdain to explain what each of them meant. Clever, simple and entertaining. <br/><br/>Basically the whole movie focuses on 3 groups. Each of them discovers that the housing market, which has been solid for years, will collapse. An impending doomsday. So they bet against the market for a major payday. Morally bankrupt? Questionable. But the movie does explore this as Steve Carrell's character Mark Baum hesitates to sell his position or his ""shares"" as it would make him similar to ""Them"". Them being the banks and the financial corporations who were responsible for the collapse. <br/><br/>At its heart, the Big Short touches on the morality of the banking industry and how ignorant the entire country and even the government are of the unethical practises that are happening in Wall Street. It keeps referring to Wall Street like its a place where crooks gather. And in reality, it might actually be. <br/><br/>The movie is definitely not big on dramatic performance but the character portrayals drive the movie. Each of them play their role perfectly and you are interested to see how their stories play out. I was riveted throughout the movie because i was kept intrigued. It was thrilling to see when the market would actually collapse and what would happen to all of the characters when they ultimately proved that their decision was correct. (They were laughed at by the banks)<br/><br/>Its a movie that does not take itself seriously and it has a certain Glengarry Glen Ross charm to it. Without all the vulgarity and salesman bravado inside. To me, the story drives the movie. It was adapted from a book 'The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine' by Michael Lewis and the movie definitely deserve the Academy Award it earned for best adapted screenplay. <br/><br/>There is much to say about the movie but you have to see it for yourself to appreciate it. The movie is like a documentary about the Financial Crisis but told through a story. You will see how it happened, what caused it to happened, feel the same disgust and disappointment the characters felt when they discovered the truth. <br/><br/>The main characters to me are definitely Steve Carell and Christian Bale. Bale's acting on point as always. He has a way of acting like a chameleon. A modern day Daniel Day Lewis. Its really good and i suggest you make time to watch it. If not to understand about the Financial Crisis, then to appreciate a really good story. Its really hard to add style to a movie like this but they did it well."
"nicolechan916","9","0","0","12 December 2016"," Astounding
","While the subject matter may be a bit dense and unappealing to most, this film does a magnificent job in dumbing it down for us regular folks. One of the unique ways in which they do this, is by bringing in well known stars (not only those in the film industry), to explain or demonstrate technical words and theories. Stars such as Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez, and Margot Robbie.<br/><br/>Following the theme of breaking the diagesis of the story, and bringing in people unrelated to the narrative, the film breaks the fourth wall multiple times. Normally, this is unnerving and unwanted (as seen in Experimenter). However, it was done so effortlessly, and with so much charm, that it succeeds in this movie. This may be a trend in documentaries, unless it is a tendency that has been around for awhile now, which I am just discovering. The Wolf of Wall Street also breaks the fourth wall smoothly, and perhaps it is the best - or only, way to truly explain real world applications. <br/><br/>As for the portrayals, Gosling and Carell play similar characters they have done before (with a bit more exaggeration), but are nonetheless engaging. The two most surprising performances for me, came from superstars, Bale and Pitt. They looked completely different, and encompassed their characters wholeheartedly. Perhaps it is because that they are seasoned actors, which is why they are able to come off so completely as their characters. <br/><br/>The screenplay, soundtrack and cinematography makes this a very stylish biopic. Though not as ostentatious a story as The Wolf, this brings us behind the scenes before the market crash, and depicts how fraudulent the system actually was - that it went on a further 2 years than it should have.<br/><br/>Amazing storytelling and film-making, which manages to absorb the audience while still using financing jargon. The subtle comedy is injected parallel to the serious and dramatic undertone, creating a blend which will captivate viewers."
"don2507","9","0","0","11 December 2016"," An Entertaining and Insightful Look at 2007-2008 Financial Crisis
","I enjoyed reading Michael Lewis' ""The Big Short"" several years ago, and was curious to see if Hollywood would be able to convert into a coherent and entertaining film a book about an unusual set of ""eccentric"" investors ""shorting"" (betting on a fall in price) of various arcane financial instruments connected to housing values. Well, I saw the DVD recently and the filmmakers have succeeded admirably. This might be the best film about the 2007-2008 financial crisis on Wall Street that I've seen. In fact, it might be the best film about high finance and Wall Street since Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street."" I give the director, Adam McKay, high marks for not ""dumbing down"" the material in Lewis' book, and explaining in clear and visual terms complex topics like mortgage-backed securities and tranches of securities. There's a marvelous Jenga Block demonstration of the fragile and vulnerable nature of securities piled on securities with each security's value ""derived"" from the value of a prior security (a derivative), and with all the securities' value ultimately dependent on home values; and as we know, home values always go up, and never decline! So, poor cash-strapped mortgage borrowers can always refinance when their adjustable-rate mortgages are unlocked. The lenders don't care because the collateral never declines in value, and anyway, they've sold the loan, via its placement into a pool of securities, to an unsuspecting yield-hungry investor.<br/><br/>Well of course, a ""bubble"" developed in housing values from a variety of reasons, and once mortgage delinquencies increased and the bubble was punctured, housing values commenced a precipitate decline and all these mortgage-backed securities began a free fall. Perhaps it takes the kind of ""eccentric"" investors, depicted in both the book and the film, to run against the tide of authoritative opinion of the big Wall Street banks, the rating agencies, the government, and the Federal Reserve, and challenge this complacent consensus. In fascinating scenes, the film shows their research: a stripper in a hot market area reveals she's financed five properties for flipping, a renter in a new low-end development faces eviction because his landlord / owner hasn't made a mortgage payment for over three months, and mortgage brokers laughingly tell about the mortgages they've secured for borrowers with no assets and no documented income. The film uncovers these economic clues that presage the impending crisis amid the hyperactive and profane actions of these odd-ball (but prescient) investors; as one reviewer suggested, they seem to be on a steady diet of Red Bull.<br/><br/>As we see at the end, their short positions in these mortgage-related securities have been vindicated and have earned them huge profits, but one of them sympathetically muses that sure we've made a lot of money but its essentially because home values have collapsed, banks have failed (and been merged or bailed out), the stock market and retirement values have crumpled, unemployment has risen drastically, and this economic misery for many has made us millions. There's no doubt that the incentive structure and excesses of Wall Street substantially contributed to the unsustainable housing market bubble; thus, its ironic to note that as I write this (December 2016) the news reports indicate that the new administration will soften considerably the already lobbyist-weakened Dodd-Frank financial reform law."

I think it will be a movie that will pass without pain or glory and will be forgotten soon. It does not tell anything new, just that there was a lot of state intervention, which at this point is like breathing and little else.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>The first thing I remember when finishing the film, is the drawings that appear several times on the screen. Are we supposed to be talking about serious cinema, right? These things never work, rather they get out of the movie, or at least it happens to me. <br/><br/>The second is that it's a good thing I've seen her doubled, because if I had seen her subtitled, my mother would follow her. That scrambled with words and that I know them all and I understand them.<br/><br/>I find it a bit long and boring. The actors are fine, although maybe Christian Bale is a little past. <br/><br/>I do not like photography at all, and from the direction, we do not even talk, madness, or war, they're offices.

The movie feels plausible though, and maybe that's because it is so open about what it is. It breaks the fourth wall at times, plays around with the medium, and does what it can to explain things in a straight forward way. Often what happens is silly, and in those cases where it's actually true, the movie points it out.<br/><br/>The aforementioned ""playing around"" works well, though it's easy to go too far doing it. Here it manages to keep you into the story (an impressive feat, considering you're following several stories at once, and all of them about economics and banking), despite all of its quirks.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job, both the A-listers and the rest. I wish there were more scenes with certain characters, but at the same time, the balance does work well."

","Let me begin with saying that all cultures in history has its good guys and bad guys, and they either hi-jacked each others or invaded other regions to get a hold of its assets, precious metals and trade routes (by the way so little it had to do with personal grudges and egocentrism or even giving some kings / suzerains the wall) or they built safe roads for the merchants and the camel trains and declared wars against the unjust rulers who had been crushing their rayah / subjects by taxes that no one'd be able to get through (look, for instance, at Ottoman State and its wars or Seldjukids and their Caravanserai structure.) Today none of these happens. And however these morally unstable world operates and the ""good"" guys canalize / put the clamps on it is perfectly shown by Adam McKay who is genius enough to turn the movie which should be ""boring as hell"" with economic blah blahs into a playground for a bunch of great actors some of whom has gestures and facial expressions that we all like along the road; and he made the evil seen out in the open. A special thank you, Michael Lewis. :) The art department did its job. (The shifting of the scenes one after another! That was great! Also their ""on purpose"" sloppiness!

","It's rare that a movie can confound me as much as THE BIG SHORT and still come out as one of my favorite movies of the year. This film is most likely befuddling for anyone not in the banking industry (as it was for me) but director Adam McKay gets bonus points for keeping it so consistently entertaining that I wasn't all that bothered by the onslaught of insider lingo. THE BIG SHORT is an important film. It brings to light all of the shady, underhanded dealings that led to the collapse of the American housing market in 2008 and it does so in a way that is both informative and entertaining. I mean, we all knew we'd been screwed over by the banks but I can't imagine many of us knew what exactly it was that had happened. McKay's film, based on the book of the same name from author Michael Lewis, follows a group of people that realized the housing market was heading for catastrophe and took a big chance on betting against it. It began with a man named Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who discovered the disturbing trend that would ultimately end in financial collapse and placed the first bet. Others soon caught on, including a hedge fund team run by Mark Baum (Steve Carell) who saw this as a chance to stab back at the big banks. And finally, the third team is a duo of young upstart investors who see their chance to win big.<br/><br/>I've watched THE BIG SHORT a few times now and I'll admit, while I enjoy it just as much if not more each time, my understanding of the events never gets much clearer. McKay takes a chance with this film and leaves the authenticity in the dialogue, all but ensuring I'll never convince a friend to give this movie a chance. I guarantee five minutes into this movie with rants about mortgages, CDOs, and hedge funds will send most of them running the other direction. If I can convince them to stick around long enough, Margot Robbie will explain CDOs from the cozy confines of a bubble bath and, maybe, it might arouse their interest. It's a fun little trick McKay utilizes because he realizes 99% of the audience won't be able to follow the dense lingo of the banking industry. Instead, he uses cut-away celebrity explanations and fourth-wall-breaking narration to the audience to keep us in the loop. McKay even has one of the characters explain directly to the audience how the banking industry uses these complicated terms and acronyms to confuse outsiders and keep them from understanding what exactly it is the banks are doing. So don't feel bad if you walk away from this movie and still aren't sure what happened. But really it isn't all that hard to follow. Essentially the banks were so confident of the housing market and peoples' abilities to pay their mortgages that they viewed them as a means of easy profit.<br/><br/>Obviously they were wrong. People became unable to pay their mortgages and, not only did the banks not notice where things were headed, they did little to nothing to prepare for potential catastrophe. There's a revealing moment late in the movie where Baum and his team attend an exhibition in Las Vegas and Baum, unable to believe that the banks could be so ridiculously stupid, flat out asks them about the disturbing trends. He's laughed off and we're led to understand that those in the banking industry were just that clueless. It's infuriating. And that brings me to the tone of THE BIG SHORT. McKay walks a fine line between funny and dramatic. Depressing and exciting. We're along for the ride with these outside-the-box thinkers on this gamble and, while we want them to succeed, we're also reminded of what their success will mean. Sure, they'll win big. Real big. But, as Brat Pitt's character reminds us when his investor protégées get a little too excited, this is Americans' livelihoods at stake. These men stand to win ridiculous sums of money but at a horrible cost. THE BIG SHORT ensures we remember this, and these characters aren't portrayed as heartless men (well, all right, maybe one of them). Each of them has a crisis of conscience when the big moment is looming. THE BIG SHORT is important because it takes a close look at one of the United States' biggest mistakes and McKay uses every trick in his filmmaking bag of tricks to make it a bearable experience that we can both enjoy and learn from. I mean, we wouldn't want this sort of thing to happen again. Except, as one of the closing title cards in the movie explains, it's already sort of starting down that path"
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","0","17 November 2016"," Surprisingly personal and entertaining.
","Overall, this was almost good as it could have been. Obviously, nothing ever really achieves perfection, but for what it is, The Big Short does not have much room for improvement. Since it's a movie about banking and stocks and mortgages, the terminology and concepts involved have to be explained, which is unfortunate in some ways but okay in others. Having celebrities explain the contrived concepts was inventive, and it sometimes did the job in simplifying the term being explained. The Selena Gomez poker example made perfect sense to me, but Margot Robbie in a bathtub was less than helpful for exposition.<br/><br/>The characters and actors are really what brings the movie to life, though. Often in historical movies, the characters fall kind of flat and get overshadowed by the event. But here, they get the limelight as they each find the flaws in the housing market. All are pretty easy to root for on-screen, but I don't think I would actually want to live around the actual people. They are all evidently messed up in one way or another to a considerable degree. Or at least, what most people consider messed up; at the end of it all, they are the only ones with their heads on straight. <br/><br/>Michael Lewis addressed a similar theme with Moneyball, which also showed how a few individuals destroyed the myths of conventional wisdom. He shows his readers how easily we as a culture are deceived by unsubstantiated and petty details. This is what the included Mark Twain quote seems to be getting at. Now, the characters' anger about the fraud that has corrupted the system is initially directed at the banks, but some of that frustration is eventually redirected to the common citizen. Many of the minor characters are consumers, not just those employing the fraudulent policies.<br/><br/>While there is definitely a good amount of comedy included, it is more of an added bonus. Unlike in most comedies, including Adam McKay's, the scenes are not structured to deliver a punch line or develop a comedic plot. It's still funny in it's own unique way, but with something as serious and tragic as the housing market crash, there are only so many jokes you can make while remaining tasteful. That said, much of the humor is directed at the various nameless characters that the main characters meet with. Since we, the audience, knows that all of the character's justifying their complacency on conventional wisdom are wrong, it's kind of funny. The main characters add in lots of fun lines of their own, usually involving Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) getting irritated or Jarred Vennett (Ryan Gosling) breaking the fourth wall. Probably my favorite humorous moment was when Vennett goes on a brief, racist tirade about his Asian subordinate, who then turns to the audience and says ""actually, I do speak English, but I let Jarred say this so he can convince people"" or something like that.<br/><br/>I would not, however, pick this if you are looking for a comedy. It's a lot more similar to something like Moneyball or Spotlight than other Adam McKay movies like Anchorman or the Other Guys. I can't say whether this is close to the book, but having read and seen Moneyball, I would guess that it is at least similar tonally to the book. It was such an emotional ride to watch, because I was enjoying the movie, but the whole time, I kept thinking about how awful it was that an entire nation could be deceived so easily without any kind of oppression or evident propaganda. So while it may be a rather fun film, you will likely leave feeling sobered and saddened. Overall Rating: 8.45/10."
"dennis_chiu1","9","0","0","12 November 2016"," Big Deal
","Film Review: ""The Big Short"" could cause you to take the Big Sleep, but you should still see this film because it is about a Big Deal. Based on the non-fiction book of the same name, written by Michael Lewis (author of ""Moneyball""), Paramount Pictures and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment create a film explaining the origins of the Great Recession. <br/><br/>This is not easy material to understand, so the producing team smartly hires Saturday Night Live writer/director Adam McKay (""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"", ""Ant-man"") to write the screenplay. In addition to getting the right writer, they also cast Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carrell to join Mr. Pitt to create the smartest and most charismatic cast imaginable to present the material. This is how to make a film of substance in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Now for the film, Mr. McKay uses almost every trick in the book to keep the audience interested. They break the fourth wall (have characters talk directly to the audience), use celebrities as cameos, like Selena Gomez, and he asks characters to play over-the-top eccentric financial players. Slowly, but surely, the fraud unfurls on screen. <br/><br/>Since the fraud is so complicated, I'm going to take a shot at explaining the meltdown, so you have a better chance of enjoying the film as opposed to hearing the financial mess for the first time. In the early 2000s, financial institutions and markets created special securities (CDOs) made up of mortgages from people's homes between approximately 2002 and 2008. A large part of these securities were made up of subprime mortgages (mortgages issued to borrowers with poor credit ratings or were unlikely to pay the mortgages off) and then were allegedly pooled with mortgages that were not as risky. Except, they didn't diversify the CDOs very well (i.e. they paired risky mortgages with other risky mortgage based securities). These risky CDOs were then given AAA ratings by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, because the large banks/financial institutions where creating the CDOs and paying the ratings agencies to give AAA status to these risky securities (many people think this was bribery). Then, the banks pushed these risky securities to be purchased by millions of investors, who did not know they were risky because they were well rated. When, everyday people couldn't pay their mortgages, these mortgage based securities became almost worthless. <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is a film about three groups of fund managers and investors that discovered that the CDOs were fraudulent, and took advantage of a credit default swap market (a non-publicly traded, unregulated market) that allowed investors to bet that the housing based securities would fail. Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale, was one of the first people to understand the problem and create a way to short (bet against the risky mortgage based securities). Investors Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), and Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) are investors also unraveling the truth behind the CDOs, and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) is a retired banker who helps two young investors who also discover the fraud. There's much more to the film, and more financial terms and concepts to learn from the film. (This film pretty much leaves out AIG's negligent role insuring the risky securities in the credit default swap market, but is included in Mr. Lewis' book.) <br/><br/>This is a good film. It tries to explain complicated securities that many professional investors did not understand during the housing boom, and for the most part succeeds. The best part of the film is the performances. Mr. Bale, Mr. Gosling, Mr. Carrell and Mr. Pitt are intense and excellent. There is not a chance to get to know the characters, since this is a film about characters investigating and reacting to knowledge that the U.S. and world financial markets will collapse. This film is not about the characters, but about the world they inhabit. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about what happened to the financial markets, and want it to be explained by Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Brad Pitt. Personally, I don't mind going to class with these instructors."

","I was so excited to see this movie I thought it had the potential to be this years The Wolf of Wall Street but I was slightly disappointed as this film wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be but was a good film but unfortunately not great. Yet this film still has plenty good in it with Christian Bale and Steve Carell being the standouts. I have never seen Christian Bale Iike I have in this movie he's so sympathetic and his character has a great heart to him and he was also very funny in a few scenes that I was not expecting. If you told me a few years ago that Steve Carell was capable of delivering such a good emotional performance I would have been sceptical not only is he great in his fearful and emotional scenes but he's got such a good motivation behind him I thought he was a great character to get behind and Carell is continuing to impress me. Ryan Gosling was also really good in this film he was definitely the most entertaining character he had some great one liners and delivered some of the films biggest laughs. The way the movie dumbed things down for the audience was really smart and unique it's not insulting to the audiences intelligence it's just the filmmakers being self aware. The actual real estate crash itself is very well built up and thought it was such a hard sequence to watch you get just how big the scale of this event was and cannot imagine a better way they could have handled it. Adam McKays direction in this film was a bit on and off for me sometimes he was on point with his unique approach to certain scenes especially in the dumbing down scenes but sometimes he uses intentionally crappy camera work and editing at first I thought that I could get over it but I couldn't and repeatedly got on my nerves. The sub-plot between Brad Pitts character and the two young investors just really did not need to be in this movie it didn't really provide anything extra to this film and detracted from the central story line. The story arcs of some of the supporting characters did not get a satisfying conclusion we never see anything if any wrap up with them other than I kind of dialogue towards the end of the film. <br/><br/>There are things I love about this movie and it's undeniably ambitious it's by no means a bad film is got far to much good in it from a performance and writing level to be bad it's not quite as good as I wanted it to be but is still a good movie. <br/><br/>72%/B"

","By way of movie criticism I have little to add. The film is well acted, edited and directed. The script does its best to explain complicated stock market transactions to the average intelligent viewer. I am hardly an expert in the field, but there is one item not emphasized enough in the film. I am a resident of Bronx Count, New York. My job led me to dealt with mortgage foreclosure in the Bronx. The typical victims were somewhat naive people who were first home buyers. (Not all some were just crooks). Unscrupulous mortgage brokers who talk people into over mortgaging their new homes. A strong force encouraging this was the Federal Government. With the goal of increasing ""minority"" (word ""minority"" has little meaning in the Bronx where the white population is about 10%). home ownership. FANNYMAE other federally controlled financing vehicles encouraged the banks and mortgage financiers to make very risky loans. In one case I handled a broker got a mortgage for an individual for $200,000.00, which was barely covered by the equity in the home. When the owner had trouble making payments the broker obtained a mortgage for 350.000.00. Wiping out the previous mortgage debt. When that loan was in trouble, he obtained a mortgage for $450,000.00. These loans were actually bought by two major banks and financing was assisted by the Feds. They were bundled by them into a toxic security package. Finally the bubble burst and the loan went into foreclosure, The home turned out to be worth the initial $200,000.00. The point is that the Feds weren't just asleep at the switch, as the movie shows. They actively made the problem worse through their ""good intentions""."

","As brilliant as Sicario is and holding my #1 spot for most of the year, The Big Short is better and one of the great farces of all time. A dream cast at the helm that balances four groups of people effortlessly struggling to not let the USA housing market disaster of the late 00's destroys their lives and the economy, there is little they can do to stop the coming onslaught of stock market crashes and loan underpayments. The brilliance of the move lies in its approach, which balances comedy with a documentary style seriousness and visionary cut-n-paste editing. By doing these things in a way that even everyone can understand, director Adam McKaye reinvents the landscape of how movies are made. What The Big Short does best is show off a style of invention that combines many old troupes to make something completely new, making it a milestone in movie history akin to Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, etc. The movie could have been about anything, the reason it succeeds is because every single aspect of it is top notch – acting, screenplay, cinematography, accessibility. It is simply the most profound movie of the year in story and execution and I doubt we will get something else like it for a very long time."

The film is loosely based on the infamous wall street broker, Michael Burry of Scion Capital who successfully predicted the economic crisis of 2008 years before it actually happened. He understood that the cash heavy mortgage loans of the US Banks where nothing but failed debts which can crumble upon the world economy. He decided to bet against them by insuring them.

","Based on the book by Michael Lewis, this movie is about the mortgage induced crisis of 2008. Although that doesn't seem the most interesting subject matter ever, the makers do a good job maintaining audience intrigue using diverse characters, fast pacing and often cleverly set up scenes.<br/><br/>Contrary to other non-fiction stories, the drama introduced to enhance the story for the big screen actually adds to the movie rather than detract from it. In other words, the moment when everything seems to go wrong for our 'heroes', you actually care rather than roll your eyes. As for characters, the main ones all have a unique, sufficiently fleshed-out personality. There's even a decent character arc with Steve Carell's character.<br/><br/>Some very serviceable character acting is present in this picture, most surprisingly (for me) by Ryan Gosling and Brat Pitt. Christian Bale was even nominated for best supporting actor, and I can see why. He manages to pull off a pretty difficult role, despite his mannerisms sometimes coming across a bit too acted for my taste.<br/><br/>On to the actual meat of the story! The makers understood that it's impossible to completely accurately explain the economic theory behind the crash in a 2 hour film. So instead, they very effectively use several analogies and character reactions to convey the importance of certain aspects. Now it may all be nonsense, I couldn't say, but they seemed to make sense.<br/><br/>Harsh criticism is not scared away from, causing this film to have a pretty devastating ending that will definitely spark some interest and inspire some people to research this important event.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because, like most adapted screenplays, the material could've been streamlined a bit more. The movie would have had a bigger impact with slightly fewer main character 'groups', especially since they hardly every interact anyway. There's Steve Carell's group, including Ryan Gosling, which has nothing to do with Christian Bale for the entire film. Additionally, we have the 2 young start-up guys who meet up with Brat Pitt, and very briefly with Steve Carell.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People with a general interest in world events, who enjoy drama and/or good performances.

Emotional manipulation at its rancid best. Remember that most of these guys are still making obscene profits out of people's misery. As Vennett perfectly puts out, they're not the heroes of this story. Some of them might question the morality of their own actions, but that won't stop them from doing them.</li></ul><br/><br/>Despite its visual excesses, ""The Big Short"" is worth seeing for those who want to understand, on a nutshell, the recent collapse of the world economy.

Especially Carell who plays against his usual type of the complete buffoon who is unaware that he is a buffoon. There were no major or meaty roles for women. Some of the gimmicks worked very well, such as breaking the fourth wall, or having non-financial celebrities explain financial matters. The film was more than a bit one-sided, blaming private bankers almost exclusively for the collapse, and letting government off the hook entirely. See Derek Tetlow's comment 8 or 9 down for that.

But this is not a movie about heroes or fighters for the truth. It's about a diverse group of despicable money managers and traders who decided to profit from catastrophe through an erratic financial system.<br/><br/>As terrible as it is to see how the action unfolds into disaster, it is also a useful lesson for those (like me) who don't comprehend the financial lingo and never completely understood what caused the recent stock market crash. The plot is presented in a rather simple narrative and, along the film, you are provided with a couple of humorous intermissions where some unexpected celebrities dumb down the financial terms and concepts that are being introduced in the story.<br/><br/>So, it's not just about Steve Carell showing you how good of an actor he is by making an everlasting bad hair day work or about Ryan Gosling showing you well, himself.

From embedding a myriad of familiar newsreel clips, music, and people of all shapes and sizes, I actually felt like I was living directly in the film itself. I can distinctly recall some of the music and news that was played during the years that The Big Short documents, such as the rapper Ludicrous's single, ""Money Maker"".<br/><br/>However, what stands out the most about The Big Short, is the thorough deconstruction/explanation of the 2008 global financial crisis. Even though the 2008 crisis has so many different specifics that contributed to it, director Adam McKay shows these specifics in a way that can be understood by the average moviegoer such as myself. Knowing very little about the specifics of the crisis before seeing this movie, I can undoubtedly say that I am a lot smarter about the subject matter after seeing The Big Short. Also, the characters are riveting and compelling. We follow them throughout the story as they risk hundreds of millions of dollars and their reputations to profit off something that is speculative and extremely risky in the eyes of everyone but themselves.<br/><br/>In other words, The Big Short, in my opinion, is an instant classic. I've never seen anything remotely similar to it. It is unique. Informative. Transparent. Realistic. Hyper realistic. Extremely ironic. It is a tale that directly reflects the modern day United States of America. Even if you are a big time sci-fi fan that loves explosions, action, and superhero movies, The Big Short will still blow you away by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>The Big Short is a culturally relevant film.

Although it was a bit hard to follow every term and what was happening all the time, I understood what was going on, and I was almost at the edge of my seat at times, which has NEVER happened for me before watching a movie like this. Of course it also helped that I thought it was very funny! Very entertaining movie with great performances all around.<br/><br/>Recommended. 8/10 from me."

","The Big Short is about the great collapse of the American housing market (and subsequently the world economy), and as such doesn't appear to fit the mold of a scary movie. But scary it is, particularly for those folks who lost their jobs, savings, and homes as a result. Odds are pretty good that you or someone you know was directly affected by this avoidable catastrophe.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on a few Wall Street guys who figured out years in advance that the housing bubble was going to burst. In the movie, their names are Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Charlie Geller (John Magaro), and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock). The script, by director Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, changes the names and some relatively minor details, but everything's based on fact. And since we know how it all turned out (hint: there was a collapse), there isn't much suspense left.<br/><br/>And yet the movie succeeds. The casting is great, for one thing – check out Carell as a broker with a strong moral center and some serious anger-management issues. His is a role ripe for overacting, but Carell never goes overboard, doing a perfect slow, slow, slow burn as he grills various money managers about their methods, which aren't pretty.<br/><br/>There's also humor, a flavor that's desperately needed when dealing with a real-life tale of misery, don't you think? Injecting a little humor into the situation makes the characters look, well, more like human beings than fine-suited Wall Street fellas. That's not to say that there are no poignant moments: one scene in particular involves Carell's Mark Baum and his wife, played by the always-terrific Marisa Tomei. Finally, several of the characters break the proverbial fourth wall, addressing the audience with asides – some of which involve disclaimers about what exactly in the present scene is 100% true and what's been tweaked a little bit. Believe me, it works.<br/><br/>And if that weren't enough to keep the movie wildly entertaining, the script takes time to explain certain relevant financial terms to its audience without being boring or dreary. Terms like CDO, explained by master chef Anthony Bourdain (comparing a CDO to fish that remained unsold at his restaurant at the end of the day), or derivatives, explained by pop star Selena Gomez and economist Richard Thaler. It felt weird understand what they were talking about.<br/><br/>But here's the scariest part of it all. The viewer spends a couple of hours following this sordid tale. We see the bad guys, we see the good guys, and we know that if this were fiction, the bad guys would probably get theirs in the end. But it's not, and we know they don't. We know that despite the canary-in-the-mine behavior of these guys, millions of people lost their jobs. And really, none of them were the movers and shakers on Wall Street. That's because when the big banks had bad mortgages that were in danger of defaulting, they packaged them up and sold them to someone else, who did the same thing to someone else, all the way down the line. The poor sap left holding the bag when the bubble burst lost it all, and those who instigated it lost zilch. That's the terrifying part. All of this in concert between Wall Street, its private-sector overseers, the government, and Big Business. They raked in the dough by breaking the law and, even when caught, suffered few consequences themselves. Which makes The Big Short ten times more horrifying than any gorefest movie I've seen."

","In McKay's smart, tense economic-horror film, unfathomable numbers and equations shamble toward you with blunt inexorability. The more prescient characters see this horde coming, and know that it carries some sort of systemic infection, but are either unwilling or unable to stop it. Throw in McKay's deft handling of absurdism and a terrific cast, and this movie could have been the ""Dr. Strangelove"" of the subprime era.<br/><br/>It isn't, though. McKay is clearly passionate about the material, and he brings a new maturity and restraint to his treatment of it, but...it could have benefited from a breath of lunacy to give the viewer some distance and perspective, and offer some catharsis for the mounting frustration of watching the inevitable unfold. There is some wry embedded commentary from characters who break the fourth wall and address the audience directly, and of course it isn't fair to punish the film because it isn't the ""Dr. Strangelove"" hybrid that I just now invented while writing this.<br/><br/>The film McKay DID make is terrific, and worth watching more than once. I guess what I'm getting at is this: The subprime debacle was an outrage on anyone who's bought so much as a bag of Combos in the last 8 years, and I'm still waiting for the movie that communicates that outrage. Somewhere between the shiny Bacchanalia of Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and this, its more erudite and less coke-fueled cousin, lies the festering indignation that we don't seem quite ready to embrace yet."

","In my personal opinion, the movie, analyzing it as an artistic work, is an amazing combination of unforced and intelligent humor and great amount of interesting and, in fact, terrifying facts about crash that occurred in 2007. The only thing that I find not good enough is casting. Actors were on point as well, and, even though I would prefer if they would give the roles of protagonists to other not so popular actors, I understand their choice. The good thing with popular actors is that people watch a movie because of these actors, and, considering the story that the producers have to tell to the world, it surely does help with introducing that story to a great amount of population. On the contrary, problem with popular actors is that people focus too much on them instead of focusing on the plot and story. They are a good solution if you want to make a blockbuster and earn a lot of money on a movie which is, truth be told, bullshit. In this case, in my opinion, it was unnecessary because it is not a blockbuster, it is an amazing artistic work and a good documentary. However, producers did want to bring close this story to as many people as they can, and, with putting this immensely expensive cast together, they were just making sure they will get to the audience. Analysing as a normal human being, this story should be heard all over the world and in my opinion, if we were I normal race, the movie would be a blockbuster itself. However, considering the state of mind in which our almighty population is, this movie and the story it is portraying is not recognized at all. The movie gets a 7.8 rating, which is in my opinion unacceptable. However in a world where money is controlling everything and people are becoming passive, just there to make some money, totally unaware of situation in which they are, stupid in their intelligence (and so on, and so forth), people don't really understand this movie and will rate it 7.8 because they don't understand the vocabulary or the plot is too ""messy"" for them. Truth be told, people have become too lazy, all they want is a movie like avatar which brings them excitement, they don't like the truth, because they're already sad enough, they just want a cheap, fast, happiness. Such a waste of God's will. As of a movie, would watch it several times more. I apologize for the bad English since I'm not a native English speaker."

","Putting the story to one side for a minute, this is an interesting film in terms of what it does and how it does it. On the face of it, the film could (and maybe should) be a drama that unfolds the astonishing mayhem, corruption, and negligence of an economic collapse that saw millions lose their jobs and homes. Instead it is mostly a comedic affair that cuts in a Ludicrous music video, and has economic principles explained by a cutaway to an actress in a bubble bath. Along the way it also has room for drama and a mostly factual delivery of the scale of the horror of the events that unfolded and landed us where we remain today.<br/><br/>It really shouldn't work, but it does – and really well. The cutaways, the music, and the editing all add a sense of excess and the erratic, which does suit the subject matter very well. Meanwhile the core character (Carell's) provides the reaction of the viewer – amazed but yet sickened by what he finds when he looks closer at the growth on which we all relied. The other characters are not quite as strong as his, but the film mostly spreads the material well enough so that the starry cast don't seem wasted. Having said that, Gosling is hardly doing his best work, while Bale feels like he is hanging around while his character transitions from being the predictor to being right. McKay directs with energy which does mostly work, but it is really the writers that deserve the credit for balancing the material – and editor Corwin who finds the film in all of the chaos (interestingly, he edited Natural Born Killers, which seems a good fit).<br/><br/>Interesting for the narrative, as well as how it delivers the narrative."

","The Big Short is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It's very effective in terms of capturing this amazing true story that is widely unknown, perfectly portraying the motivation and passion of these characters who were prepared for the house marketing crash in 2008 before anyone else was. I did feel the film boiled the story down for the audience, there was always a sense that there was so much more to what they were telling us because they probably felt it was too complicated. I also did not appreciate the ""celebrity explanations"" that was pure and obvious spoon feeding, although I will always appreciate Margot Robbie in a bathtub, I would have preferred finding these things out on my own by paying attention to the movie. The performances are certainly stellar, Christian Bale, despite his brief screen time, completely transforms himself in to this character, Ryan Gosling shines, continuing to prove his versatility as an actor, they are joined by Brad Pitt and a slew of smaller performers who still manage to steal scenes. However, Steve Carell was the highlight for me, he captures the damage and vulnerability of Mark Baum brilliantly, the closing image of Carell sums up his dedication to the role, he has been surprising me with his talent for drama lately and I hope to see it continue. Dramatic, while also being quite humorous, The Big Short may be dumbed down, but it's still an effective film with an amazing true story, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A group of men decide to take on the banks after predicting the house marketing collapse years prior. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Steve Carell"

With an expensive cast and a difficult project it helped us understand once more how pathetic can the banks become in order to find profit for themselves and how money, once more, make the world continue to exist. Good acting, many message and caustic humour was this movie's recipe. Although much of what the protagonists said wouldn't make any sense to the common people, they helped us understand them with quite simple examples. Although it was a bit slow at the beginning, it becomes better as the time passes. True story and sure success, nothing special to address. Directing was good and the song of Neil Young gave an honored finale! All movie's music was good and to the point. One advise, don't take this for a comedy like other such as Ted or anything like that. You have to watch it carefully because the plot is full of details. So, nice try guys!<br/><br/>6/10"

","""The Big Short"" is a fast-moving, involving and sometimes confusing adaptation of the Michael Lewis bestseller. The Housing Crisis for Dummies skits are entertaining—Margot Robbie explains mortgage (""crap"")–backed securities from her bubble bath; Selena Gomez acts out synthetic credit swaps in Vegas—but there's still lots of 'splaining to do (goofy-looking Hamish Linklater, one of the quants on Team Carell, is the default 'splainee), and the other characters themselves seem dazed and bewildered much of the time. That's kind of the point—the whole system had become so non-transparent and corrupt that by '07 nobody really knew what was going on <br/><br/>McKay's a comedy director by trade, of the David O. Russell, keep-lots-of-balls-in-the-air school, and maybe he lets things get a little more chaotic than they need to be, but the cast is outstanding—Christian Bale does another amazing character turn as a spectral fund manager; Steve Carell is perfect as a tightly wrapped Wall Street pro, as is Ryan Gosling as his handler and our cynical slickster narrator; Brad Pitt turns up from time to time as a survivalist investment guru who tried to get out but gets pulled back in again This lineup's pretty much a sausage fest, as the saying goes; nice to see Melissa Leo as a harried rating-agency exec and Marisa Tomei in the more conventional role of Carell's fretful wife. <br/><br/>I'd strongly recommend ""The Big Short"" if you have any tolerance for a complicated plot line with tons of expository dialogue and often baffling plot twists  I just read somewhere that Barack Obama really enjoyed it—though he was disappointed by the epilogue in which Ryan snarkily suggests that not all that much changed; no word yet on what Greenspan and Bernanke made of it."

","This movie is, without a doubt, the best movie I have seen in 2016; coincidentally, its the only new movie I've seen in 2016. Nevertheless, this is a great movie. Let's start off with the characters: we have 4 superstars in this movie and they all give amazing, authentic performances. Christian Bale's character can be seen as a really thought out character and a Bale-worthy portrayal. The thing is that Bale already is known as a great actor, so he didn't exceed my expectations in this movie like I wanted him too. Don't get me wrong though, I always enjoy Bale and this movie was no different. Next, we have Steve Carell. Carell is known as an actor that is usually in comedic movies but lately he has been hitting gold with dramatic movies (i.e. Foxcatcher). Steve Carell perfectly embodies his multi-layered character. Brad Pitt I cannot say much of, except that he was fine. His acting job was okay but not anything to writ home about. Last but not least, we are given Ryan Gosling. He, without a doubt, was the best character n the movie. He was sly, quick, funny, and a bright spot in the movie. He brought all of the star power I was expecting and then some. Overall, the casting was the best I have seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was fantastic. It brought me a sense of a documentary/indie film but still kept the high budget mojo that I would expect from a movie in a movie theater. My favorite addition to the movie was the way they explained concepts that some average viewers would not understand with simile explained with a celebrity like when Selena Gomez showed me how Blackjack betting is similar to bonds in banking while she was in Las Vegas and come on, who doesn't want Margot Robbie explaining you what a CDO is while in a bubble bath(to be honest, I was really paying attention to what she was saying). Anyway the movie as you view has parts that you just want to rewind over and over again. The only complaints that I have is that sometimes the pacing seems messy and the transitions between scenes can be rough sometimes but overall the plot of the movie can require some deep thinking during the movie in order to understand but once you do its a breeze and treat to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."

","We watched this on DVD from our public library. Even though my wife had a career in Finance, and had executive positions in banks and mortgage companies, even she had difficulty keeping up with the loan instruments discussed here. I would suspect most viewers would also have difficulty.<br/><br/>So let's just discuss the broad points. The players in the real estate game make an assumption that real estate values will always go higher, and keep going higher. Part of the outfall of that was to use the risky subprime instruments, which would never be a problem if everything kept going higher. But it can't, and it didn't, and part of the result we saw in 2008 when the stock market itself dropped about 50% in what now is being called ""the great recession."" <br/><br/>My wife and I are retired, we were among those who were scared as we saw our retirement investment drop and drop. But we took the position that in time things would go back up so we held all our positions, remained diversified, didn't sell any equity positions, and in a few years everything was back to normal.<br/><br/>Many, many were not so fortunate. Some made the rash decision to sell their equities when they were low, they had a hard time recovering. Many lost their pensions, or their homes, or both.<br/><br/>I would think many younger viewers would have a harder time appreciating this movie, but those of us who are older can more easily identify with the themes. There are many characters here, but I will mention only one, Christian Bale as Doctor Michael Burry. Yes, he was a medical doctor who left his residency to start a hedge fund. He is featured prominently as perhaps the first one to dig deeply into the subprime market. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly forecasted the real estate bubble would collapse as early as 2007. Though he suffered an investor revolt before his predictions came true, Burry earned a personal profit of $100 million and a profit for his remaining investors of more than $700 million.<br/><br/>The sad part of all this is the corruption that became apparent during the whole crisis, and in effect the rich got richer while the poor lost their homes and retirement savings."

","'The Big Short' seems to want to play off the same vibe as 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' with characters directly addressing the audience and even explaining which scenes are dramatized and which really happened. There is even a series of celebrity appearances inserted solely for the purpose of explaining the core financial concepts to laymen. Although trying to explain the housing market bubble of 2007/2008 using blackjack bet, Jenga tower and seafood cuisine analogies is only marginally successful, the fact that nearly every single scene in this movie involves the various characters discussing, debating, delving into or otherwise taking action related to this bubble basically gets the picture across to the audience. But that, and the fact that it's a long movie and about 95% of it is these same characters waiting for said bubble to burst, also makes it a rather one-dimensional movie, and a bit on the dull side at times. Still, it's worth it for the interesting subject matter and a particularly entertaining performance by Steve Carrell."

","The financial crisis of 2008 and the men who pulled the strings behind it is a story too crazy to make up, and that's exactly the premise of The Big Short, a lesson in the Great Recession of the United States and a black comedy about the people that caused it. The Big Short starts in 2005 with hedge fund manager Michael Burry who discovers that the U.S. housing market is extremely unstable. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in 2007. Burry realizes he can profit from the crash by betting against the housing market. His idea is laughed off by major investment and commercial banks, but they accept his proposal, believing the market is stable. From there, Burry's idea is heard by several hedge fund managers and traders, and their profits increase as the housing market crashes. The documentary-style camera-work and dark comedy make this dense subject easily accessible to almost everyone. The film's funnier moments come when some random anachronistic celebrity comes to explain financial terms to the audience, with the best being Selena Gomez. Even with all the black humor in the movie, The Big Short can't help but make you angry at the real-world villains that it's portraying, which is exactly what the movie wants. The Big Short is both hilarious and angering, and while it's obviously not a documentary, it does offer one of the best on-screen presentations of the 2008 financial crisis that is thought-provoking yet accessible."

","The Big Short is superbly-acted and well-written. Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell and their supporting cast give great performances, but the shocker for me was Christian Bale's portrayal of a brilliant fund manager with Asperger's syndrome who can ""do the math"" and read markets with unnerving clarity and correctness even when the results go completely against the grain of conventional thinking.<br/><br/>Bale inhabited this character, based on Dr. Michael Burry, with stunning effect as if he actually had this difficult to identify condition. It was a stunning transformation and masterful feat of acting. The tortured humanity of Carrell's character also came through luminously as his conscience wrestled with profiting from the economic collapse and the stupidity and dishonesty of the immediate circumstances that preceded it. But Bale's performance was by far the more subtle and awe-inspiring to me.<br/><br/>Michael Lewis' story is compelling on a human level, describing the tribulations down in the trenches as three different hedge funds bet against the housing bubble mortgage market and derivatives on it. It highlights human greed and stupidity, and the inertia of huge institutions. But it also highlights very different life experiences of three very different funds, one on Wall Street, another in Silicon Valley, and another originally from a garage in Colorado.<br/><br/>The production is very stylish and bright, presumably to dress up what might otherwise be a dull topic. The anguish at the stupidity of the situation, where banks are packaging toxic assets as if they were investment grade also creates emotional space for the actors to explore, but ultimately the story is told with an unduly heavy hand, as one might expect from Hollywood. The events are dramatic enough that a little scaling back of the acting might have served the story better. But Hollywood movies don't work that way; someone always gets to take the lead and ham it up, while others play it straight.<br/><br/>What's disappointing is that The Big Short is ultimately a highly orthodox, doctrinaire, short-sighted, lightweight and ignorant critique of capitalism. The film, and presumably Lewis (I have not read the book it's based on) completely miss the big picture context of government regulations forcing banks to make subprime loans as a form of ""social justice"" by getting otherwise unqualified buyers into home loans. This is touched on briefly in the scenes with the mortgage brokers, but the movie perhaps intentionally ignores the context of why it happened in the first place. It is blind to the underlying causes.<br/><br/>I can only suppose that this is because it goes against the orthodox leftist premise that business, markets and capitalism are bad, and that governments must act in opposition to them lest they prey upon innocent people. The reality is that government policies forcing banks to make bad loans created the situation, starting decades earlier. The culmination was collapse, but the fundamental cause was government intervention in the economy. Even Congressman Barney Frank, a staunch champion and initiator of such intervention, ultimately admitted this was a mistake after the crash.<br/><br/>Google for the Community Reinvestment Act and the role of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in underwriting bad loans and educate yourself about the facts.

He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal.

","saddest movie that I've seen in the past few years. this movie does not end in a ""superhero saves the day"" or a ""wow, we made billions on the downfall of US economy"" tonality, it is a gritty depiction of reality and at the end the salary man must pay. the movie itself is good documented (can't believe it won an Oscar for screenplay), all actors fit their roles accordingly, it was really fresh to see them play in different roles than the ones we were used them to play in. it is a documentary with a bit of artistic ""wolf of wall street"" zoom outs and freeze frames. the end of the movie left me a sad feeling, knowing that keeping people dumb via wrong education and focusing them on living a drone life, scavenging to pay for things they do not need, won't change the economics of the future, but instead will push all life into a profits war, were banks create money out of air, and mortals fight as slaves on a plantation to keep the ""economy"" going."

","""While the whole world was having a party a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could."" In the mid 2000's Michael Burry (Bale) could see there was a housing market collapse coming.

The bad news is they were right. They scary news is that this is a true story. This is a very good movie that is a little confusing to understand, for me anyway, but they did a good job of explaining it for non-wall streeters to understand. Just about everyone remembers this crisis and what happened and the fallout. What I didn't realize is how out of hand the mortgage loans became and why the collapse was so catastrophic. The more the movie went on and the more was explained the angrier and angrier I became, and by the end of it I was glad I didn't have anything to throw because I would have needed a new TV. This is the type of movie that is important and will hopefully change things, but judging by the way the actual crisis was handled I doubt it. Overall, a movie that I highly recommend and think everyone should see, but make sure you're alone after because you will be in a bad mood for hours.

"billmckim-952-996849","7","0","0","12 March 2016"," Provides an understanding of housing bubbles and corrects mistaken concepts in the movie and Lewis' book.
","The movie, like the book was a fascinating story of the lives of some of the people who made money by buying swaps on the MBS market during the housing bubble, but neither Michael Lewis, the makers of the movie, nor the people who got rich when the housing bubble burst had any clue as to why the bubble formed, or why it burst. <br/><br/>One example of the lack of comprehension was the ""explanation"" of the arcane financial instruments used in the MBS market. The lady stated that CDOs that were created by bundling other CDOs were Synthetic CDOs. They weren't; they were CDOs squared. A synthetic CDO was created by bundling Credit Default Swaps. <br/><br/>This is a significant difference because the CDSs didn't require the insured party to own the Mortgage Backed Security that was the referenced security in the swap. This meant that transactions involving Synthetic CDOs didn't cause any money to flow into the housing market. The loss of that money caused house prices to stop going up at an absurd rate, which ended the housing bubble. <br/><br/>Another significant error was the impression given that Wall Street hid bad mortgages in piles of good mortgages, and thereby sneaked them by the rating agencies. That wasn't how it worked. The very bad mortgages were singled out and combined into their own CDO. This CDO paid 14% interest because the borrowers were buying $700,000 houses when their income was $40,000 a year. <br/><br/>The rating agencies rated these mortgages as AAA because THEIR FAILURE RATE WAS ZERO FOR YEARS. The rating agencies role was not to advise investors how to invest their money, but to report accurately the likelihood that the investment would fail. <br/><br/>Those extremely bad mortgages never defaulted because the payments were being made by refinancing the house. If the VALUE of a house increased by 20% or more each year, and the cost of borrowing the money to buy the house was 6% a year, the borrower doesn't have to have any income in order to afford the house. <br/><br/>It was because of the universal belief that the price of houses was going to continue to increase by 20% or more a year that it was possible to create an investment that paid 14%, with no risk that was apparent to anyone on earth. Wall Street just did the mechanical job of creating the instrument that reflected market conditions. They didn't create the bubble, and they didn't understand the bubble any better than anyone else. If the Synthetic CDO had burst the housing bubble a year sooner, Goldman Sachs would have gone belly up because they were long in the market. <br/><br/>The housing bubble came about because, when the stock market bubble of the 1990s burst the stock market gamblers took their money out of the stock market and parked it in interest bearing accounts. This made money cheaper, and mortgage interest rates fell. <br/><br/>When that happened home buyers could pay more for a house and have the same monthly payment, so house prices shot up for a long enough period of time for everybody to believe that they would always increase at that rate. <br/><br/>That is when the segment of housing market developed in which borrowers could buy whatever house they wanted with the expectation on the part of the buyer the loan broker, the lender, the regulators, the Congress, the media, the economists, and the public, that poor people could enjoy the housing bubble benefits as well as rich people, because they could make the mortgage payments out of refinancing the house. <br/><br/>Everybody else could also continually refinance to buy anything they wanted. The economy was great! <br/><br/>The only downside was that all of that money that was being consumed was money that would have been invested in wealth creating, and job creating, enterprises if there had been no misunderstanding about why house prices had gone up for a while when the gamblers parked their money in interest bearing accounts. <br/><br/>By the time the gamblers had found another casino in which to place their bets it didn't make any difference because house prices were then rising at an unrealistic rate because people could make money by owning a house. Making money by owning a house became the dominant reason for owning a house instead of shelter, comfort, a nice view, proximity to employment, and all of the other considerations that set the price of houses in a normal market. <br/><br/>So, the reality is that Wall Street didn't behave badly, rating agencies didn't behave badly, and no one was any more responsible than anyone else for the disaster that was the housing bubble. As Pogo said, ""We have met the enemy, and it is us."" <br/><br/>Other than having perpetuated a mistaken view of economics that may yet do us in, the movie was great."
"DareDevilKid","7","0","0","13 February 2016"," Great Performances All Round in an Entertaining if Slightly Cluttered Movie
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.3/5 stars<br/><br/>Adam McKay admirably directs an all-star cast comprising Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt in this surprisingly light-hearted and entertaining take on America's housing bubble collapse of the mid- and late-2000s, which eventually led to a global financial crisis. However, if you're not well-acquainted with the world of finance and several of its nitty-gritty details, the clumpy narrative and salvo of banking gobbledygook in ""The Big Short"" might cause your attention to drift at at some points in the movie.<br/><br/>Though the film comes across as a tad bloated at 130 minutes, it still impresses quite a bit with all that it packs within its frames. It's evident McKay and his co-writer Charles Randolph try their best to make the banking jargon as easy as possible for the audience to comprehend, even going so far as using the game Jenga and on-screen graphics to describe the fragility and ultimate decimation of the economy. At key intervals, the filmmakers even employ the assistance of guest stars from Margot Robbie to Selena Gomez to 5-star chef Anthony Bourdain in their endeavor to help the common man wrap his/her head around all the complex financial terminology. Unfortunately, this also makes ""The Big Short"" feel impersonal, and you feel there's too much of emphasis on number- crunching, statistics, office meetings, boardroom talks, and predictions. You end up wishing that some of this care and effort was directed toward highlighting the well-known human suffering resulting from this economic meltdown.<br/><br/>Still, McKay does more than a decent job at offering copious food for thought on how not to live and how intricate, and, more importantly, fickle the financial system really is. Best-known for collaborating with Will Ferrell in comedies like the ""Anchorman"" films, ""Talladega Nights"", and ""Step Brothers"", McKay never forgoes an opportunity to add some much-needed wit and satirical humor to proceedings, which helps in easing out the heavy narrative to an extent.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, it's the actors' sublime performances that have helped ""The Big Short"" soar to such heights this awards-season. And, in spite of all the praise, awards, and a third Oscar nomination that's come Bale's way - and he indeed does an exemplary job as he's so often done all through his career - it's Steve Carell who shines brightest out of the extremely talented ensemble cast."

","The Big Short basically follows three sets of people as they capitalise on a fault in the banking system that no-one else can see. Dr. Michael Burry discovers it almost by accident and hatches an outlandish plan to earn his company a lot of money by betting against the housing market. The banks are more than happy to take all his money off him thinking they've made a lot of money very quickly, blind to the disaster that's about to befall them. Word spreads and a handful of entrepreneurial individuals dig a little deeper and decide to follow suit. This play makes everyone hugely unpopular amongst their peers and bosses, until the inevitable collapse of the global economy occurs in 2008.<br/><br/>Somehow Adam McKay manages to treat this subject matter with as much humour as seriousness. He pokes fun at the financial industry, while simultaneously highlighting the very serious repercussions the collapse had on every day people. The three sets of people who bet against the housing market initially do so to stick their middle fingers up at the banks and earn a lot of money in the process, but by the end they find their success bittersweet. They've all become ridiculously wealthy, and the corrupt banks have fallen hard, but all at the cost of millions of people losing their jobs and their homes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this lends to a very uneven watch that can't decide on a tonal direction. It throws around technical jargon that any other financial thriller, knowing full well the average person has no idea, so handy definitions and analogies are provided. However these definitions are full of tongue-in-cheek jabs and off-kilter presentation. The first one of note, for example, they cut to Margot Robbie, as herself, enjoying a soak in a bubble bath as she explains Sub-Prime Loans. It's obviously played for laughs and irony, but it also cuts into the momentum of the movie, and acts as a sudden injection of comedy into an otherwise serious exchange. I have to applaud it though, the comedy at play in The Big Short is a lot deeper and more meaningful than just some jokes thrown into the dialogue (although there's a handful of those as well).<br/><br/>On the flipside, it grapples with some pretty heavy character moments. Mark Baum is half- heartedly attending Anger Management classes as he tries to bottle up his emotions after the suicide of his brother. Once this Big Short idea is lain in his lap, he becomes a bit of a righteous crusader trying to open the banks' eyes, uncovering corruption and dodgy-dealing as he goes. When he ""wins"" at the end, there's no sigh of relief or victory dance, there's just the crushing realisation that he's profited off the suffering of the poor by the banks' doing, becoming as bad as they were. Steve Carrell breezes through this progression masterfully. Christian Bale may be getting all the awards attention, but for me, Carrell was the shining star.<br/><br/>That's not to understate Bale's Michael Burry though. Bale proves, again and again, that he's a heavyweight in the acting category. There doesn't seem to be anything he can't do. Here he plays Michael Burry as extremely socially awkward without hamming it up. He's a guy who prefers to be alone and shut the world out with metal music, but when he has to interact, he flubs and he stutters and is never quite sure of what to say. Also, Bale being Bale, the amount of preparation work he put into the role is admirable. He learnt drums and struggled through a knee injury just for the role.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's Jared Vennert acts as facilitator to Mark Baum's role in the story. As far as character work goes, he gets the short end of the stick. His biggest job is to narrate the whole affair, which gives him the most comedy edge than anyone else. He's absolutely successful in that regard. Finally there's John Magaro as Charlie Geller and Finn Wittrock as Jamie Shipley who are budding traders struggling to get on the ladder, and enlist the help of the highly paranoid retired Wall Street trader Ben Rickert, played by Brad Pitt. Again Pitt doesn't get a whole lot to do, and Geller and Wittrock play characters driven more by naive ambition than a sense of doing the right thing. Although of course, they're hit with the consequences of everything by the end, when they walk into their dream trading room and it's empty and dead.<br/><br/>The Big Short is a heavy watch. It's packed full of jargon and difficult and confusing concepts to get your head around (intentionally, by the banks). There's some great acting talent on display, bringing us deep and conflicted characters. It can feel a bit messy when it attempts to lighten the mood and maintain the audience's attention with humour, which doesn't particularly succeed, but the story it tells remains riveting. The whole movie acts as a satirical jab at the American finance industry and how, even after it's monumental f***-up, it's still ultimately working the same as it used to. I give The Big Short a very ambitious 8/10."

","The Big Short is well worth a watch, based on the Michael Lewis book of the same title. It tells the story of the 2007 global economy crisis, of which we follow 4 main protagonists. Financial hotshot and hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale). Bale does a brilliant job of portraying this socially awkward, math genius who spotted the crisis before anyone else did and visited all the major banks placing 1.3 billion dollars in total against mortgage backed securities. Perhaps the most interesting character of the film is Carell's (who was brilliant) Mark Baum, wracked by guilt as he realises that America's financial meltdown will leave millions without homes and jobs. Ryan Gosling puts in a stellar performance as a sleazy trader who's only interest is making money. Finally there's Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) Who plays a retired banker who hates the system. He gets enlisted by two rookies who stumble across Burry's notes but don't have the namestake to get a seat at the big banks, unlike Rickert. We follow these guys on not only a journey about them making millions and in Burry's case billions of dollars. We follow them on an educational journey of how oblivious and corrupt these organisations are.<br/><br/>This film (although not a masterpiece) could be the most important of this generation. Largely because Adam Mckay does a brilliant job of explaining it. What makes this film work is the multiple methods Mckay uses to explain the story. He assumes the audience has no knowledge of the crisis what's so ever and this works because we're not plunged into a jargon filled, hard to follow film. We're instead immersed in a film that is informative, entertaining and funny. Mckay uses lots of techniques to help explain the terminology the most effective being that he breaks the fourth wall. He features celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain using fish metaphors and Selena Gomez simplify synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDO's). These scenes really help bring all the films themes together whilst explaining any confusion around the terminology.<br/><br/>Overall the plethora of A-listers used in this film were incredible. However the real credit should go to Adam Mckay for the way he constructed this wonderful film. Not least for the way he joined it all together at the end. Each character getting their moment whilst finishing on the moral side of this drama and the fact that still today despite what happened only one person went to jail and the banking industry hasn't changed."

","I can't recall a film that has been so confusing, then fascinating and then saddening as The Big Short. It's a remarkable film based largely on exact events (based off a book with a few name changes) it charts the beginning of the 2007 world financial crash and manages to explain it in such a way that everyone can understand how it happened (ask yourself, do you REALLY know how it happened?) With a superb main cast there are some wonderful cameo's here and there, used in such a brilliantly inspired way to explain the most complicated elements of the story. The method of filming is also interesting, it's almost like a ""fly on the wall"" documentary with cameras going in and out of focus whilst trying to keep up with the action, and occasionally the actors speaking direct to camera. This really keeps your attention and makes the film very enjoyable, even with the complex nature of the storyline.<br/><br/>I thought this film would be for people of a certain age, who had an interest in the global economy as such, but there was a very diverse range of ages in the cinema which I found interesting, right down to early teens and everyone seems to enjoy this film immensely. Up for several Oscars I can see why and hope it gets the recognition it deserves for making something almost incomprehensible to the average person into something that leaves you with your jaw gaping and in shear disbelief the world could be allowed to work this way. Don't just take my word for it though, definitely check this film out for yourself and see for yourself."
"SquigglyCrunch","6","0","0","8 February 2016"," Much of the Plot was Lost in the Language it Used
","I went into this movie with some expectations. It won a bunch of awards, was highly praised, and is even a major nominee for best picture. After watching it I'd say that while it was well done, it's not deserving of the praise that it received. <br/><br/>The plot of The Big Short is showing how the economy crashed in the 2000s, taken from the perspective of four different people who all see it coming. Unfortunately, most of the specifics of the plot are lost in the banking mumbo jumbo that the film uses. While this does add a level of realism to it, it's really not convenient for people like me. Even with the asides used to explain certain things, they still weren't enough. Often they used banking mumbo jumbo to explain the other banking mumbo jumbo, and when they didn't do that they used examples that aren't exactly easy to understand. Nevertheless, I caught onto phrases like ""increased unemployment"" and such, so I still got the general idea of the story. However, the plot never felt perilous to me. I never felt like some specific bad banking thing might happen because like I said I couldn't understand a word that anyone said. So what caused the unemployment increase is completely unknown to me. Plus I already knew the end outcome, so there wasn't really any tension. Nevertheless, I thought that the plot was done well enough that people like me were still able to pick up on it, just not specific things. <br/><br/>The characters were surprisingly good. They felt like relatively real people, particularly Steve Carell's character. Most of the other characters ended up coming off as people who existed because they knew about the economic crash coming up. While they were developed reasonably well, they felt kind of pointless. Brad Pitt and the characters connected to him felt especially pointless. But maybe that was because I just couldn't understand the mumbo jumbo, so what they accomplished was unknown to me. Christian Bale's character was, although important, really not that focused on, probably because all his segments involved him sitting in an office chair blasting heavy metal music. He really didn't do much other than at the beginning of the movie. Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell's characters were really the only people who were important throughout, but they were also the primarily focused on characters. <br/><br/>Something that kind of confused and bothered me was that all the characters did for entertainment was go to strip clubs. They all acted like the only form of entertainment was that. It's not that I think that sexual stuff makes a bad movie, it's just that everyone acted like there were only two things in the world: work and strip clubs. Has anyone ever read a book? Watched a movie? No? And it wasn't that just one or two characters did this, it seemed like everyone did this. Every banker in the movie pretty much. <br/><br/>The sudden musical cues bothered me too. There would be crap music blasting for a bit, then someone would start talking and it would stop abruptly, then start again when they stopped talking. Then they'd play parts from the music video of that particular song and it was just confusing, and a little annoying too. <br/><br/>The asides in the movie were used quite well. They weren't overdone to point of annoying, but they were often enough so that it felt normal when they happened. They all happen naturally too, and they were pretty quick. Generally I'm not a fan of fourth wall breaking, but this movie did it well. <br/><br/>Overall The Big Short is, while completely overrated, a solid movie nonetheless. The plot is still understandable for people like me, the characters are good, and the asides are used well. Unfortunately the specifics of the plot were unclear, the lack of other (and more realistic) entertainment, semi-useless characters, and musical cues and choices weren't so great. In the end I'd still recommend The Big Short, but you'd probably enjoy it more if you actually work at a bank or study it more than I do (which I never do)."

"TheBarleyGuy","7","0","0","31 January 2016"," Terrifying, interesting, well acted, but a stylistic mess.
","Moving right along with these Best Picture nominees. According to IMDb, The Big Short is about:<br/><br/>""Four denizens in the world of high-finance predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight.""<br/><br/>As A horror fan I would like to say that this may be the most horrifying, frightening movie I have seen in the last few years. By the end of the film, I was considering pulling all my money out of the bank and burying it in the back yard. Only to realize I have no money, no back yard, and plenty of student debt to fuel the fear. This is the kind of movie that makes people who hide their money in their mattresses seem like they have the right idea.<br/><br/>The cast is great, everyone delivers solid performances from start to finish. Although, I have a feeling that there is something in Brad Pitt's contract that he can never play a bad guy. Even in a movie that is chiefly about terrible people being slightly less terrible than other terrible people, he manages to take a righteous stance in the movie, which felt a bit disingenuous (similar to his character in 12 Years A Slave as ""Only Non-Garbage White Guy"")<br/><br/>Solid as the story and characters are in the movie, I definitely had some issues with The Big Short. Primarily, the editing of the movie is bizarre. In what is, essentially, a drama like Spotlight but the movie is cut like a Bourne movie. Quick cuts, zooms, shaky cameras, the whole thing. It doesn't make any sense, and only served to confuse me a bit in the beginning of the movie. It also cuts away to seemingly random images from time to time, and it has something of an art-film quality about it.<br/><br/>There are some weird comedic moments in the film as well, like cutting away to different famous faces to ""dumb down"" some of the more complex things that the movie deals with, which are honestly just as foreign to me now as they were before Selena Gomez told me about them. That said, I didn't mind the comedy in the movie, as troubling as the story is, it helps to go through things like this and be able to laugh at least a little.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of unpacking horrible things through comedy, which is probably why I was such a fan of Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, or Jon Oliver's new show Last Week Tonight. Those elements here did help to lessen the blow a little bit, while still shaking me up in the process.<br/><br/>Honestly, the movie works, and is worth seeing completely. It's not impossible to get passed the stylistic choices that are a bit bizarre and take in an incredibly disturbing and frightening story. One thing I appreciated was that, at certain points, the movie would stop and remind you that this was in fact real. The level of corruption and fraud at work is definitely pretty unbelievable at times.<br/><br/>Worth the watch, and I could see it taking an Oscar or two home. The movie is nominated for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Editing (yikes), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Christian Bale). While I'm not ready to call this Best Picture by any stretch, I'm sure it will take something<br/><br/>For those keeping score in my reviews, The Big Short's total number of people who are not straight, cisgendered, heterosexual, white, males who make significant contributions to the plot progression is a whopping.... zero. Though, Christian Bale has a glass eye and ""awkward social interactions"".<br/><br/>You may argue, in this case (I suppose), that they were trying to keep it as real as possible, but at more than one point in the film the characters address the audience saying that ""this isn't EXACTLY how this part went down"", so I'm not buying that argument."

","Adam McKay may be known for nothing more than Anchorman, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys. However, he subverts his image into Oscar nominated form with a look at the Housing Bubble Crash of the mid- 2000s. With a top-down look on the crisis as opposed to 99 Homes's bottom-up look, The Big Short stars Crazy Stupid Love's co-stars Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling alongside Christian Bale (The Fighter) and producer Brad Pitt (Moneyball), with celebrity cameos aplenty.<br/><br/>This film is a must-see for everyone with even a minor interest in just what happened in 2007, along with Margin Call. Intelligently juggling laugh-out-loud wit with solid drama and a fascinating subject matter, this film's strength is surely its direction, condensing complex economic concepts such as Sub-Prime Mortgages and Synthetic CDOs into fourth-wall breaks, irreverent text on the screen, and subversive cutaways starring the likes of Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez. The story is fascinating due to its realism, which is pulled off perfectly with the camera-work, narration and use of images/other media cut alongside the film that render it very documentary-like. Not that it doesn't also inspire seething rage, at the fact that these people got away with everything they perpetrated.<br/><br/>Which is where the characters come in. Despite recognising and correctly predicting the dangers facing the American housing market, and consequently the world economy, these men are, in Gosling's character's words, not the heroes. With grey morality and questionable decisions, the characters feel human, like real people might have been during this very time. Divided into three main interweaving story lines, Carell serves as the main character, his Mark Baum a moral compass desperate to retain his virtuous integrity in an increasingly amoral world, whilst his actions themselves become increasingly reminiscent of the very bankers he hates. He and his team, including Rafe Spall, grudgingly join forces with the standout character, Ryan Gosling's fabulously despicable Jared Vennett. Playing like a toned down version of DiCaprio's Jordan Belfort, Vennett is fast- talking, charismatic, and honestly the image one would conjure up when imagining the scapegoat of the banking crisis. With cheeky, witty narration that perfectly executes the fourth wall break, he constantly steals the screen. The Oscar-nominated Bale seems somewhat surplus to requirements at time, his story taking place far from the others', yet he is astounding nonetheless. His Michael Burry, with Asperger's, struggles to maintain human relationships but has a certain talent for numbers, and drumming. The final story concerns two young businessmen (played by John Magaro and Finn Witrock) who, desperate to play in the big league, enlist the help of retired, disillusioned banker Brad Pitt to try and get in on Burry's revolutionary scheme which Baum and Vennett are profiting from. The acting is superb across the board; performances are rendered incredibly believable and human, with Carell building on 2014's Foxcatcher with another genuinely fantastic dramatic performance.<br/><br/>Good as it may be, The Big Short is not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture for 2015, though I am yet to see most of the other nominees. Albeit witty and mostly well-judged, the script often falls flat. Economic concepts will be handled and explained perfectly in one scene before the next scene features repetitive jargon that fails to hold much interest. This becomes a little frustrating, with the script's infrequent but irritating lapses into boredom hold the film back from its full potential - case in point, a scene with Melissa Leo falls almost completely flat. However, the ending makes up for the inconsistencies, a final piece of voice-over delivering a crushing blow of depression to the audience and some final biographic wrap-up text that finishes things well. All in all, a film with a lot that is really good about it, including acting and direction, whilst the utterly un-formulaic style is an endless joy to watch. Despite the bad in it, The Big Short remains a thoroughly important and generally very entertaining watch. 81/100."

Then, there was this quite complex film editing style, which I came to appreciate much later in the second portion of the movie, when the characters have become more developed. The pacing is actually quite fast in the first part, wherein they introduced one character, develop it a little, introduce another one, develop it, and then go back to the previously introduced character, develop it further, and so on. It didn't work quite well for me at first, wherein there were some jokes that doesn't seem to have a good timing, e.g. they turn out to be tepid and dry, but then when they do hit the timing, they can give you some really good laugh. <br/><br/>What was consistent however was the strong performances of the cast. These became more compelling in the second portion of the movie since they were augmented by more developed characters and better pacing and editing style. We get to see more scenes that give room for contemplation as well, and we get to see some outrageous sides of the unique characters who have foreseen the disastrous results of the business craziness that was going on. Now, you get to feel really sad about the consequences of the fraudulent actions of the people in Wall Street, but then you really get to laugh as well with the unexpected twists in the situation and conversation such as the sudden appearance of Selena Gomez. For me, the unique mix of order and chaos in this film is an extraordinary feat for the film's director, Adam McKay.<br/><br/>The subject matter is both relevant and important, given the current situation in the U.S., and despite being a little bit self-righteous for me, I think the movie was able to handle it very well. As a person not so familiar with a lot of business terms, I have become more familiar with mortgage bonds, and was able to use ""CDO"" and ""synthetic CDO"" in a sentence. At least, as an ordinary person, I might not be easily intimidated by these words anymore. Perhaps a second viewing will do the trick of appreciating the first portion more, but then all throughout you can say that its strongest side was the writing, and I think it is one of the best written movies of the year."

They added a little comedy with all the celebrities explaining to us whats what, instead of having the characters do all the explaining in random conversations. Amazing performances by Christian Bale and Steve Carell, especially the ending scenes where they in financial numbers kinda won, but in the real battle against the big banks they didn't stand a chance. The big guys on the top of the chain won and let the workers take the fall, which is a disgrace and the government did almost nothing after the biggest fraud of financial history took place. I feel like this review is more about the story than the movie, but it's such an incredible story and they did manage to get a great movie out of it. The movie includes a lot of talking, so you have to pay attention and subtitles are recommended to keep track.

","There is so much politically economic -- basically everything -- from foreign policy to economic banking and trade policy that has raped the little guy and this film addresses one of the greatest economic frauds in the nation's history that is at the heart of much of the nation's woes. The Great Recession of 2007 had the potential to revisit the Great Depression on steroids. The film explained some of the complex minutiae of it defining the mortgage backed securities fraud that was at the epicenter of it and explaining some things like CDS (Credit Default Swaps), CDOs (Colateralized Debt Obligations), sub-prime loans and worthless mortgage backed securities through persons who knew the collapse would happen years before it actually did.<br/><br/>This gargantuan complex fraud had the attendant potential to collapse not only the US economy but the world economy and even end the capitalist system as we know it. Yes, we were that close until the US government, funded by you and me, bailed out the too-big-to-fail banks that created the fraud and allowed their CEO's to collect bonuses to boot. They put the 99% in a sink hole leaving us to drown in the muck they created as they sped away in their yachts toting their money bags in hand. Their profits tricked down to nowhere but themselves.<br/><br/>The film was not boring, it was precise and tried to explain the complexity of what happened and how trillions of bucks were lost, millions of jobs were lost and millions more homes were lost relegating many to live on the street at the mercy of what the immoral predatory banksters had perpetrated.<br/><br/>It was and still, in part, is an unhappy time, a catastrophic time and no one from the Wall Street that perpetrated the greatest fraud has been jailed ... yet. Instead they were rewarded, collected their bonuses and knew that if the system collapsed again the government would come to their rescue and bail them out saving their banks moral hazard be damned.<br/><br/>Every sector of our nation, I believe, bears the DNA of this gargantuan fraud. Wall Street knew Congress, which most understand is bought by Wall Street, would never let it fail and so it continues albeit with some changes dressed somewhat differently but still keeps the 1% fat cats happy knowing that Congress will be there to provide the safety net should the nation stand on the catastrophic precipice they create again. The Glass-Stegall Act of 1933 having been repealed in 1999 makes unregulated Wall Street economic anarchy a recipe for disaster yet again.<br/><br/>The film is blood pressure raising but understanding what occurred is a must if we are to fix that which is so broken in our nation and by doing so never allow this to happen again. It can, I believe, be done but will NOT be done by electing the very same persons of the same political stripes that perpetrated the greatest fraud ever told."

","Adam McKay's adaptation of Michael Lewis' very readable recounting of the financial meltdown in 2007-8 hews closely enough to Lewis' book, but the spirit here is more manic and hysterical and the dour worldview that Lewis infuses in his work is amplified, focusing on the dire effects the meltdown had on the average citizen--there's a despair here that makes this an archetypal black comedy. McKay and his co-scenarist Charles Randolph change the names of some of Lewis' oddball personalities and some of their motivations, the most notable being Ryan Gosling's jaded, arrogant Jared Vennett, based on the book's bond salesman Greg Lippmann, a minor but important character, who here serves as the narrator best suited to the cynicism the film stews in. McKay serves up his story with all the cinematic tricks he can find, with lots of freeze frames, blackouts, whizzing cameras, newsreel footage (the frenetically entertaining editing by Hank Corwin helps tremendously), characters breaking down the fourth wall to address the audience and real-life celebrities brought in to explain some of the more complicated points of the sordid financial products being marketed. But he hits his comedic marks most of the time and when the film needs to emphasize the tragic nature of the crisis, the shift is effectively jarring. The powerhouse cast (in addition to Gosling, there's Christian Bale, Steve Carrell and Brad Pitt) is uniformly excellent--Pitt, as a reluctant colleague to two young bumbling novice investors, is often hilarious--but it's Carrell's troubled investor, here known as Mark Baum, who really shines: with a delicate commitment in his eyes, Baum sees beyond the immediacy of the debacle into the soul-sucking Wall Street machine and agonizes over its effect on modern society. Thanks to McKay's pointed anger you feel Carrell's realizations and sense of resignation on a more cerebral level uncommon in most modern performances and it helps the film achieve an unusual power. Recommended."

","The 2008 Financial Crisis is, without reservation, one of the defining moments of American history and a seminal life event for those alive at the time. As such, it was just a matter of time before someone made a movie about it. That time has now come, and I must say the film is quite a fascinating piece.<br/><br/>This movie sets out to explain the complicated web of corruption and greed that led to the Crisis. It does this about as well as a movie possibly could--perhaps the one thing that doesn't get as much explanation as it could have was the term ""short"", which could be a bit of wonkish jargon for some viewers. To ""short"" a stock is of course to bet against it--this was explained, but with it being in the title and so much a part of the story, it could have been highlighted a bit more.<br/><br/>Still, that one qualm aside, the movie proceeds to tell its tale with with dramatic poise. The acting is superb, with Steve Carrell turning out the performance of his career. Christian Bale also shines, along with the rest of the cast in a tale that is extremely well crafted and a movie that is well produced and directed.<br/><br/>All in all I'm going to give ""The Big Short"" 9 out of 10 stars. It does what it sets out to do with great success. It is not necessarily the most enjoyable of this year's Best Picture nominees, and that teensy bit of accent on drama at the expense of joy leads me to detract one star. But despite that, this film is a masterpiece, and one that every American should watch at some point."
"kieranbattams","8","0","0","26 January 2016"," Interesting look at how the rich get richer..
","Adam McKay making a black comedy about the Wall Street crash? Im already sold. Throw in Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt.. how could you go wrong? The film was a very interesting look into the corruption of the government and how the rich take from the poor in order to get richer, it is something we have seen before but with it's own style and the subject matter interests me greatly, so naturally i found a lot to like and enjoy about this film.<br/><br/>First off, i swear marketing wanted us to believe this was going to be the Christian Bale show.. i mean don't get me wrong he did a good job in this film and as always is a joy to watch, but the film wasn't focused around him as i expected. We follow each of these characters in different ways. Ryan Gosling adds the energy in the vein of a Jordan Belfort type character (i will touch on that later), Steve Carrell doesn't provide as much of the comic relief as i thought, he adds more of an emotional core to the story which i was surprised to see from a character played by an actor of his calibur. Don't get me wrong the dude is funny, but he is someone who has suffered a great loss and who is an angry guy but you can see why. In my opinion he gets my pick for best performance in this film. Brad Pitt's character was necessary but with him he just sort of felt like halfway through the movie he randomly joined in, disappeared for a bit and then came back for the finale. But i like seeing him in these Brad Pitt type roles where he is so cool and suave about everything and always so damn likable!<br/><br/>Now, the film does feel like at times it copies a fair bit from The Wolf of Wall Street. The fast-paced opening where Ryan Gosling introduces what is going on to the audience is exactly like how it happened with that film which is the main comparison to Jordan Belfort. That being said McKay employs his own style and we see the fast paced editing take effect where we see certain images pop up and clips etc. But some of it is very random and feels kind of out of place. For example, random celebrities are brought in at random times to explain certain plot points and whilst humorous, it probably would have just made more sense to have one of the existing characters explain it to us. But then again, it would just draw more WoWS comparisons i guess. But the insight into this corrupt world was as interesting as ever and it is sort of set out as a heist movie of sorts with a knockout soundtrack. It establishes the subject matter in it's own right and i liked that, so i will give it props.<br/><br/>In the end, the film entertains a lot more than something like Ride Along 2 and is worth checking out on a Sunday afternoon when you want to relax and chill out. I will say see it for sure. The acting is great, it's captivating and it is a film that keeps your mind working afterwards and that is exactly what i wanted from it, so it didn't disappoint."
"nclka1990","9","0","0","26 January 2016"," Absurd, Crazy and Frigthening!
","(Review of The Big Short, seen 23.01.2016 in Pathé, Arnhem (NL))<br/><br/>Who would have thought that Adam McKay, the crazy mind that has given us Anchorman and Step Brothers, would end up being an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and director celebrated for his work on a relevant and essential film about one of the worst financial crises? I certainly had not seen this coming even though I am a big fan of the Anchorman series. Nonetheless, that is the case and let me start off by stating that all nominations and awards McKay and his team will win will be thoroughly deserved!<br/><br/>The collapse of the American housing and the subsequent worldwide financial crisis doesn't really seem like the obvious topic for a crazy comedy. McKay doesn't care one single second! The Big Short is absurd with the absurdity and uncontrolled flair for storytelling that we have come to know from the Anchorman films and that setting is a surprisingly good fit for the otherwise very serious (and rather boring) topic. In McKay's hands the financial crisis has never been funnier, better explained or more frightening. Humour is a great tool to process matters beyond our limit of understanding and McKay proofs to be fully aware of this in one of the best films I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Having praised McKay for his writing and directing, the entire cast is equally as good. Steve Carell is in my eyes the main character here and he builds upon his performance in Foxcatcher last year and Little Miss Sunshine earlier to show that he is indeed so much than his iconic Anchorman character Brick! Carell succeeds in portraying a man whose personal issues are both affected by and affecting his actions in the increasingly bizarre reality of what's happening in Wall Street. His few scenes with Marisa Tomei are brilliant and are examples of the film's powerful dramatic assets.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, who earned an Oscar nomination for his role, is balancing the fine line described in Tropic Thunder as going ""fully retarded"". While I think Carell's performance is more deserving of nod, Bale's performance is probably a better fit for the supporting role category and his nod is well deserved too. A modern version of Rain Man he is the man who foresees the disaster years in advance but constantly fail to make his ideas acknowledged. Bale perfectly captures the character's descent into an increasing anger that makes his glass eye more active, his drumming more hectic and the volume level on his speakers sky high. Where Carell's Mark Baum represents our nervous discomfort regarding the turn of events, Bale's Dr. Michael Burry is our anger towards the constant ignorance towards the few people who sees what is happening.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is the most comedic asset as the Wolf of Wall Street like Deutsche Bank salesman functioning as the narrator of the story as well constantly breaking the fourth wall (along with a lot of the other actors as well btw). The last man on the poster is Brad Pitt, but his main contribution is as a producer as his role barely have any screen time. <br/><br/>The story is difficult to understand in the sense that the events are so ridiculous and inconceivable, so it is only natural that the storytelling shares this level of craziness. McKay utilises a wide range of cinematic tools; apart from breaking the fourth wall on several occasions these include an extremely diverse soundtrack (from hip hop to Phantom of the Opera), rapidly edited montages of photos and clips from popular culture and three amazing explanation scenes, which I am not going to spoil here. It's such a clever choice by McKay though as the explanations are very clear and simultaneously function as sarcastic comments on the world of today.<br/><br/>Whether or not The Big Short can follow up on its recent PGA Award for Best Motion Picture only time will tell, but for now it remains my favourite for now (having only watched that and The Martian of this year's big films to be fair)."

","Foreseeing the burst of the housing bubble that triggered the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, three sets of players in the high finance world elect to ""bet against the American economy"" and reap the benefits in this offbeat mix of comedy and drama, based on a book by 'Moneyball' author Michael Lewis. There are some truly zany touches as characters break the fourth wall and announce that certain events ""didn't really happen that way"" and there are interesting interludes in which celebrities such as Selena Gomez explain some of the finer technical terms required to understand the story. The film also has a complex editing design with montages of pop culture, scenes noticeably cut short and certain images paused for extended periods, all of which works to make the film anything but the didactic take on the situation that it so easily could have been; by contrast, it is more engaging than 'Inside Job' and it does a better job elucidating what exactly occurred. The crux of the film though are the characters who experience inner conflict over whether or not they are really 'good guys' by profiteering from the GFC. The characters are not explored in extreme depth (give or take Steve Carell as the closest the film has to a protagonist), however, they work well within their function in the plot, provoking us to evaluate whether there are really any heroes in the film's real life inspired story. The most remarkable aspect of the film though is how frequently funny it is. It is quite rare for a comedy (which 'The Big Short' primarily is) to spin such a passionate indictment of injustice."

","There are many ways that movies can tell the story of financial markets - but they are all complicated and they are all scary. While ""Margin Call"" (2011) was very tight and very serious, ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" (2013) was a sprawling comedy. ""The Big Short"" - which examines how the sub-prime mortgage scandal brought about the financial collapse of 2007-2008 - is somewhere in between. <br/><br/>It tells a particular story, based on the Michael Lewis book ""The Big Short: Inside The Doomsday Machine"", but it uses a whole variety of techniques to make the complex terminology understandable and entertaining: a documentary style, flashy camera-work, text on screen, straight-to-camera dialogue, and bizarre cameos set in a bath tub, a kitchen, and a casino.<br/><br/>It works thanks to the skill of co-writer and director Adam McKay and a good deal of fine acting with the best-known faces being Steve Carell and Christian Bale, who are both terrific, and Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt, who are both excellent. But it is a terribly male film with all the female characters being small parts as wives, regulators or strippers. The talented Marisa Tomei is wholly underused. A leading female personage from the book, Meredith Whitney, is not even mentioned. <br/><br/>Also it is an odd movie because the viewer kind of wants the the three groups of lead characters - the ones attempting to 'short' the market - to be proved right, but that means that Wall Street is corrupt, the regulators are asleep, and millions of citizens are going to suffer.<br/><br/>This is powerful and compelling cinema and the bits of text that conclude the film are utterly chilling. They include the observation:<br/><br/>""Five trillion dollars in pensions, real estate, savings and bonds disappeared. Eight million people lost their jobs and six million their homes. And that was just the USA. Banks took the money the American people gave them, used it to pay themselves huge bonuses, lobbied Congress to kill big reform, then blamed immigrants and poor people. And only one single banker went to jail. Some poor schmuck from Credit Suisse."""

","""The Big Short"" takes a fascinating subject (the collapse of the real estate market that instigated the global economic collapse and recession in 2008) and then spends its entire running time apologizing for boring its audience. It tells the viewer early on that ordinary folk like us (the audience) and the bros who made the movie don't understand any of that stuff anyway, so they're going to make it interesting. Interesting means we get shots of Margot Robbie sipping champagne in a hot tub while she explains some economic term to us. Despite the filmmakers' attempts to make themselves one with the audience, the tone of the movie is ingratiating and condescending, and the whole thing is annoying to the extreme.<br/><br/>It's not like this subject matter hasn't been addressed before. The film ""Margin Call"" was about something very similar, but it managed to present the material straight and as if it really mattered without making its audience feel like dunces. ""The Big Short"" tells us here and there that the economic collapse was devastating to average people around the world, but it treats it mostly like a joke. It's like ""Wolf of Wall Street"" lite. And it commits what for me is the ultimate movie sin -- it telegraphs to us in flashing neon every emotion we're supposed to be filling at any given moment, never once giving us the opportunity to react ourselves.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good, but they're asked to do things like pause and speak directly into the camera, the effectiveness of their performances hampered by poor directorial choices. Steve Carrell and Christian Bale are the standouts. Ryan Gosling suffers the most from the film's jokey tone. And Brad Pitt once again uses his producer credentials to insert himself into a film as the character who gets to lecture someone in the movie (and by extension the audience) about the moral ramifications of whatever the film's topic happens to be.<br/><br/>I would rather have just watched a documentary about the housing collapse.

","""Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.""<br/><br/>The Big Short is such a refreshing and surprising film because it manages to perfectly balance a difficult subject matter and make it entertaining. It is perhaps one of the most important films made this year reminding us of the worldwide economic breakdown that began in 2007 and left millions of people without their life savings. Many of us don't understand much about economics or how it works, and that is why we have been so eager to forget what happened and continue moving on as if nothing ever happened. This film refreshes our memory and reminds us of what a terrible crime was committed during the housing bubble collapse. The film centers on the few men who recognized the problem early on and took advantage of the situation. The Big Short is a dramatic movie, there is no doubt about it, but it also manages to include some comedic moments by breaking the fourth wall and including pop culture figures to explain some of the more complicated financial terms. It does it in a brilliant way and it's been a while since I've seen a film break the fourth wall as well as this one did. I've seen many documentaries on this subject, but this film manages to explain things better and open our eyes to the dangers we might face again in the future because we've ignored the real problem and seem to be repeating the same mistakes once again. Mckay manages to infuriate and open our eyes while entertaining us at the same time with an engaging film thanks to a witty adapted script which he helped co-write with Charles Randolph.<br/><br/>It's not the first time that a film based on a Micheal Lewis novel manages to draw in an audience that doesn't necessarily need to comprehend the subject matter. You could be clueless about baseball, but in Moneyball the story still managed to engage a worldwide audience. The same can be said about this film because the economic terms are explained in a simple way. That is why I believe this is one of the most important films of the year because it allows even those that never seemed interested in economics to understand how it still affects them. It is an eye opening film for those that felt uninterested in trying to understand what happened in 2007. If there is one film that audiences should see this year then this might just be the one (not for its technical or artistic value, but for the importance of its subject matter). <br/><br/>The Big Short is Adam McKay's dramatic directorial debut and his background in comedy is what probably helped this film become more accessible. The man who brought us Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys, now brings us a thought provoking film. He's received two Oscar nominations (directing and writing) for his work here and what an impressive film he has crafted. The film is heavy on dialogue, but the script is so perfectly written that each character in this film becomes memorable. The performances are outstanding which simply proves what a key element writing is for an actor. It was refreshing to see Ryan Gosling back again after his retirement from the big screen for two years. He plays the charismatic character he could easily play in his sleep, but he is still a delight to watch. He delivers a solid role, but out of the four big names it was Steve Carell who stood out. He gets the best dramatic moments and lights up each scene he enters in. Brad Pitt has a smaller role but he makes perfect use of his screen time with an understated performance. Christian Bale is the only actor who received a nomination for his performance in this film and it is well deserved. He plays a socially awkward character and totally sells it. There are films where there are so many big names that no one really gets to shine, but this film manages to make every character memorable thanks to the wonderful script."

That's the reality and sadness of the whole situation.<br/><br/>It is horrendous that very few people were brought to answer for their actions – there was definite criminal activity. There were many people who weren't doing their jobs correctly in order to have prevented this debacle. Sadly, white collar crime isn't treated quite as seriously as all other crimes of theft and fraud by poorer people. But we all have some blame to bear. If we didn't give all our money to the Investment bankers looking for the best return on our dollar, then these situations wouldn't be as dramatic as they were. Society as a whole has to bear some blame too.<br/><br/>I did struggle a bit towards the end with exactly what was happening with these Investors and their funds, but just about hung on. Not enough emphasis was put on the real sufferers – the lower class poor public. People who lost their jobs because the banks collapsed and loans and investments to small businesses dried up. That's the REAL story. Even today people are still suffering from the after effects. It's a dog eat dog world – make no mistake.<br/><br/>I did like the fact that a lot of the events were based on actual events. Superbly acted and well directed. A very good effort. I was somewhat surprised that others in the theater laughed out loud when some of the characters used profanities in the workplace while at tense meetings....c'mon, grow up people - it's not funny to hear people use the F-word. It was used in context of a serious situation and because of the urgency of what was happening in the financial world. The people laughing were adults - not just College kids! Grow up. The words were there as a part of the reality - not for laughs!"

","The very idea of Adam McKay, director of Anchorman and Step Brothers, making a film about the financial crisis in the mid-2000s brought on by the uncontrolled build-up of the housing market, is one that left me scratching my head. Centred around such a serious subject, I just couldn't see what McKay would bring to the table.<br/><br/>Well, I was totally wrong to judge McKay before seeing The Big Short because he does one hell of a job with this film. Feeling almost like a docu-drama at times, The Big Short is informative while packing a small yet effective emotional punch thanks to a few great performances. I left the cinema feeling both anger at how greed and ignorance let the collapse happen, and fear at how easily it seemed that it could happen again.<br/><br/>After discovering that the housing market was extremely unstable in 2005, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) found a way to bet against it so that profits could be made from its inevitable collapse. The trouble was that none of the banks that Burry took his proposal to believed him and, thinking the market was safe, happily accepted his money.<br/><br/>Burry's actions attract the attention of trader, Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), who soon realises that Burry was right and decides to make some money out of it too. Bennett's dealings lead to other interested parties, including Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a hedge fund manager, and retired banker, Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who helps two inexperienced investors make a profit from the situation.<br/><br/>Now, I'm no expert in economics or the housing market and even after seeing The Big Short, I still can't claim to be. This film uses a lot of terminology that could lead to the audience getting lost but Adam McKay addresses this issue rather brilliantly with some cutaway sequences that take us away from proceedings to explain a word or phrase that people may not understand.<br/><br/>It would be easy to have one of the main cast do this however, McKay was thinking a little bit more outside the box. There are three scenes, each containing a celebrity cameo; Margot Robbie in a bubble bath, Anthony Bourdain in his kitchen and finally, Richard Thaler and Selena Gomez playing a spot of Blackjack. I didn't think these would work at all but they genuinely did, though Margot Robbie in a bubble bath was the one where I was listening least.<br/><br/>What impressed me most about The Big Short was just how entertaining it was. McKay, who co- wrote the film with Charles Randolph, brings his comedic elements to proceedings yet it's the surprisingly good drama, including a pretty hard-hitting finale that made me really appreciate just how good McKay's work is here. It's totally out of his comfort zone and he knocks it out of the park.<br/><br/>The Big Short also boasts a cast that contains four top leading men who all bring their respective qualities to the film. Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt are all very good in the film but for me, Bale and Carell are the stand-outs. Bale really sells the eccentricity of Burry and Carell, who impressed me massively in Foxcatcher, captures the humanity of Baum well, a rare quality for a banker.<br/><br/>The Big Short is a bit of a dark horse going into the awards season and, while I don't see it winning any of the big awards, it sure is a film that deserves your attention. Both the energy of McKay's filmmaking and the performances keep the film ticking over at the perfect pace."
"jtindahouse","7","0","0","21 January 2016"," McKay experiencing life after Ferrell
","I read that this is the first film Adam McKay has done without Will Ferrell as the star. That's an interesting piece of trivia if you think about it. No one could deny he's had a golden run thus far but he's also had one of the funniest men ever to exist in the entertainment industry to write characters for. Until 'The Big Short' that is. Now suddenly he's writing something unlike anything he's done before, a film dealing with the financial crisis of 2008. Try making a comedy out of that they would have said. Well he took on the challenge. Is it a flawless film? Absolutely not. But is it one hell of an effort? Yes, that I'd have to agree with.<br/><br/>The biggest problem McKay must have faced in writing and directing this was the need to get a lot of very technical and very, to put it frankly, boring information across without alienating the audience and making them feel stupid or having them lose interest. He tries some neat little tricks like having celebrities play themselves in cameos that give a metaphorical example for the topic at hand, or even going as far as saying that we as an audience are supposed to feel stupid listening to the Wall Street lingo, because that's the way they want it to be. Does it work? It does, but it only really covers up a small portion of the film. I'd imagine a lot of viewers would have been left very confused as to what was going on at certain points in the film. An unavoidable aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The film relies heavily on its characters to push through a lot of the jargon and create comedic relief so that the whole thing doesn't feel too heavy. While these characters were based on real people, they certainly wouldn't have written themselves in a story like this. Four Hollywood heavyweights Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Christian Bale and Brad Pitt were brought in to bring these characters to life. Bale has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards. He was good but I feel he lacked a lot screen time and his performance might be a touch overrated due to a glass eye. The real stand-out of the bunch for me was Carell. He gets far and away the most screen time of the four and uses it exquisitely. He was nominated last year for 'Foxcatcher' in which I didn't think he was overly impressive. I think this year he deserved a nomination more than he did for that. Sadly he missed out, perhaps not enough make-up? Sometime I wonder if that's all the Oscars care about in the acting categories.<br/><br/>In total the film was nominated for five Academy Awards. Bale's one, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing. Of the five I'd say the only one it has a real shot at (and probably will indeed win) is Best Adapted Screenplay. Every other aspect was very fine, but it feels like one of those cases where the film should just be happy to be nominated for certain things - perhaps Best Director in particular.<br/><br/>All in all though, if you've got the patience and the brain switched on and you're in a bit of a learning mood, it's a film you'll enjoy. If you're just after some lighthearted fun to unwind at the end of the day however, I'd suggest staying away from this one, it's a full on film. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but if it is you'll likely love it."
"mrblacktip","9","0","0","20 January 2016"," A Beautiful Depiction of a Horrendous Disaster
","Adam McKay's drama directorial debut and it is one not to be forgotten. It is amazing how source material as mundane as bank fraud, defaulting loans, and other boring financial elements can be transformed into something that is gripping, comedic, and morally horrifying all at the same time. My hat is off to you Mr. McKay. How in the world did the same guy that directed every Will Ferrell film from Talladega Nights to Anchorman 2 bring us this riveting and palpable (that word was used in the film) historical film? <br/><br/>The housing market crash occurred when I was in 8th grade and I did not fully understand the severity of what was happening around me at the time. All I caught onto was the economy was in shambles and people could no longer pay for their mortgages. The Big Short shined a whole new light on the economy crash of '07 for me and opened my eyes to the evil that was behind it all. The whole idea of how something like that had never happened before, how it was fueled by fraud and greed, and how it affected the entire world economy was almost too much to handle for me while I was viewing it. The movie tore me into two pieces: 1) I am laughing at the wit and bluntness of the actors interactions with one another (Steve Carell was impeccable) 2) I am disgusted by the greed of people. I was utterly astounded at how a movie was able to evoke such different feelings out of me. <br/><br/>The Big Short's style was one that I compare to The Wolf of Wall Street and The Office (and yes, I do mean the t.v. show starring Steve Carell). Between the blatant continuity errors, voice over narration, forth wall breaks, and depiction of real life crime I felt like I was in a Scorsese film. However, with the shaky camera, business setting, and ""documentary"" vibe I felt like it was The Office. The overall style of the movie was something that I found very creative and entertaining. With the quick edits and cuts, sound mixing, and chaotic camera work it created a sense of urgency and stress which I assume was their aim so the viewers could experience what life on wall street and in the big corporate world is like. <br/><br/>Many of the performances were stellar and absolutely made the movie. Steve Carell's portrayal of the morally conflicted and brash banker was the best performance of the film and I am surprised he did not get an Oscar nomination; I liked him better than Bale. Even in the midst of all the numbers and talk of money the film managed to give the characters depth and background and not just use them as ventriloquist dummies to convey information to the viewers. Christian Bale's performance of the socially awkward genius was pretty good too. Given it is based on true events and people made it a little awkward to watch Bale's character because the majority of his performance is just him: he has minimal interaction with other actors and absolutely no interaction with any of the other leading cast. Not to say that his performance was not terrific, it was just awkward to watch at times. <br/><br/>Given as amazing as I think this film is, it did have some short-comings like all things. Primarily it dealt with convoluted source material. Trying to put something as complex as banking and financial agreements into understandable dialogue is near impossible and as good of a job as this film did at that, it still, for me, was not enough for me to understand what was happening all the time. So much information was presented to the audience that sometimes it made my head spin; but it was a necessity for the film to progress with any sense. The film makers know this so they tried to do comical and creative ways to teach the audience about such topics ( I wont go in depth so I don't ruin the surprise) and did a decent job at it too. All in all it was a terrific film that I will watch more in the future and recommend to anyone with half a brain and an interest in recent American history."

","I know what I was watching was an original, cynical look at America's financial institutions criminally fraudulent rip off of the public but I was still left a little perplexed at the films end. Outstandingly directed, authentically written and superbly acted, there is no doubt that 'The Big Short' is worthy of the high praise that it has been receiving from the voices that matter. Perhaps I went into the cinema with my mind already made up that I was going to find it difficult to enjoy this film so I have made the mistake of not fully engaging properly with the narrative. As good as the movie is, it is a lot to take in when your only knowledge of the banking system is casually walking up to the ATM and expecting it to spew out its precious contents. It does though, highlight the unbelievable turn of events that brought down the American economy that resulted in the Global Financial Crisis in the first decade of this century.<br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of a selection of financial 'experts' and how at different times, predicted the credit crisis and the downfall of the American economy. It's another who's who of Hollywood that sensationally entertain us with outstanding performances from each of the big name cast members. Steve Carrell is the standout as a man on the edge. His character, Mark Baum, is genuinely disgusted by what is unraveling before his eyes and cannot fathom that such banking fraud could actually happen. Christian Bale puts in another thoroughly professional performance as the eccentric Michael Burry who seems to of been the first person to indicate that a catastrophic financial fall is imminent. This all leads to the systematic betting against the banks. Throw in Ryan Gosling's zealous appearance and Brad Pitt's subdued role and it becomes a highly watchable film. Each character takes advantage of their foresight and goes about exploiting the banking institutions overconfidence. It's just great to see somebody take on the greed that motivates the system.<br/><br/>Well known comedy film Director, Adam McKay (Anchorman 2), has lent his expertise to a script that amusingly and sarcastically points the finger at everything that was wrong with America and perhaps the world at the time of the financial meltdown. It's the perfect ploy for such a production that's main content is still very raw in the minds of all those that have been affected; turn something that has been described as ""the crime of the century"" and retell the story to the masses but with a resounding cynical twist. Highlight what went wrong, who was to blame and then show the audience just how amusingly criminal it all was. McKay with the help of Charles Randolph have uniquely devised a narrative, chock full of linguistic dialogue that will most scratching their heads at what is being said but knowing that this could bore the average viewer, both writers have originated a simple way to breakdown the Wall Street 'lingo'.<br/><br/>Somebody like me may need to see 'The Big Short' a second time to get the full value of this uniquely told film. It does't take a genius to know you are witnessing a good bit of cinema. It is craftily written and fabulously directed, allowing us all to take a look back at our recent past, learn from the mistakes and come to terms with what really happened in the build up to the GFC."

","The Big Short - as I see it Dr Manju Gupta<br/><br/>The Big Short is a film about human greed and degradation. It's a film about an eccentric, one eyed hedge fund manager, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who sees the housing loan bubble burst before anyone else and decides to profit from it by shorting or betting against it. Its about a slickster, Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who hears about these default swaps at a sleazy party and hard sells them for a hefty commission. It's about a seething but righteous Mark Baum (Steve Carell), and his team, who get wind about it through a misplaced phone call, and join in, driven by revenge against the banks. Its about two young and naive fund managers Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Witrock) who stumble into the information and enter the rat race under the tutelage of a very 'organic' Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who has retired from the game in disgust but knows how it's played.<br/><br/>What makes this Wall Street film about the 2008 financial meltdown different from others is its unconventional presentation. The director adds color to the monotony of men in suits by daring to use unconventional ways to explain financial jargon. The narrative is broken by hilarious cameos in which celebrities, playing themselves, define some of the complicated terms like sub prime mortgages and collateralised debt obligations. Does all this make you feel bored or stupid? No, I am not asking you, Ryan Gosling posed this question to me as I was watching the film and proceeded to introduce the sultry Margot Robbie who explained the terms while taking a bubble bath. Cheeky yes, but also rare ingenuity!<br/><br/>The high profile stars live up to expectations and give excellent performances. Bale's eccentricity seems as real as Carell's smoldering contempt. Gosling's smarmy portrayal of the conscience dead Wall Street shyster is matched with Brad Pitt's brilliantly underplayed avatar as the disillusioned retiree. The naivety of his protégé is endearingly genuine too. But its the actors in small roles who shine and make the film what it is. The supercilious banker with his condescending smirk as he puts down the two neophytes, the over helpful assistant who smilingly tolerates Gosling's ill treatment, Carell's well etched team mates, the lady entrusted with credit-rating who has a vision problem, the sleazy home loan mortgage agents, an especially ruthless and repulsive bond trader, the 'law - abiding' tattooed tenant all excel in their craft. There are no small actors here, just small roles.<br/><br/>McKay, best known for directing subversive comedies accomplishes a great feat as he pulls out all his tricks, from dizzying hand-held camera moves, peppy dance numbers, quick shots of random people to pole dancers making the movie an exhilarating joy ride. Humour lightens up a dark tale of deceit by having characters break the fourth wall and talk directly to the viewer either to confirm what is happening in the film or to contradict it. <br/><br/>But the moral tide running beneath all the laughs is palpable. Five trillion dollars in savings and real-estate value is vaporised as the banks continue to act in an astonishingly ignorant or criminally abusive fashion, leaving millions of Americans jobless and homeless with global repercussions. As the protagonists stifle their disdain for the bond-market creeps, the moral ambiguities cannot be ignored, for they have invested in default swaps, which would pay off only if the market collapses.That it would lead to destruction of such mammoth proportion was probably not foreseeable but the human wreckage is their doing too.<br/><br/>A strong contender at the Oscars this year, this film based on a book by the same name can simultaneously outrage and amuse, entertain and educate, infuriate and fascinate and keep the viewer engrossed in a story filled with bond-trade babble. The Big Short, based on true events of an economic catastrophe is devastatingly funny. It will appeal to the average viewer because human greed is not limited to Wall Street and sometimes it's better to laugh than cry."

However, their profits come at a very high price to the American public.<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" has three separate story lines, as three different groups of people bet against the banks. I find that slightly confusing at first, and that is not helped by the complicated financial jargon. Fortunately, they do explain the jargon well, using entertaining dialogs by cameo actresses. The three separate story lines make the film very realistic, but I find it less engaging and captivating than other financial crisis films. However, it is one of the few financial crisis films that touch on the disastrous impact on the public, which is a nice touch."
"classicalsteve","7","0","0","6 January 2016"," Interesting Narrative Film with Documentary Elements About the Housing/Credit Crisis of 2008
","Part of the challenge of presenting this kind of material which is quite complex at its core is that the audience needs to understand certain elements to fully grasp the story. The core of the narrative of ""The Big Short"" is how a few people in finance ""bet"" against the conventional wisdom that property values would never fall and as a result made $100 million's during the Financial Crisis of 2008. The film attempts to accomplish four things.<br/><br/>1. Define the terminology used by Wall Street and Finance regarding the buying and selling of mortgages, such as ""sub-prime mortgage"", ""CDO"", and ""tranches"". 2. Explain the housing situation prior to Fall of 2008, in particular how sub-prime mortgages became, for a brief time, a means for Wall Street banks and investors to make huge profits. 3. Introduce us to some unlikely Wall Street insiders who saw the flaw in the conventional logic and a means to make a financial killing at the expense of the market. 4. How they were able to convince Wall Street to take their bets against the housing market. Even after having read and seen documentaries about the crisis, I do believe this is still not easy stuff fully understand.<br/><br/>The solution in ""The Big Short"" was largely solved by narrator Ryan Gosling as Jared Vennett who chronicles the history of the mortgage-finance sub-prime mortgage world while introducing us to the different characters involved who ""bet"" against the housing market. However, several times the story stops, and interspersed animation or a celebrity detail certain points. For example, Margot Robbie explains what sub-prime mortgages are in a bubble bath, and Anthony Bourdain describes ""CDO's"" using bad fish as an analogy. Also, they give some of the history of the characters involved, which for some reason I felt was less interesting. This occurs for about the first third of the film, which I found a bit irritating. I think I would have preferred the characters of the story explain these terms, such as Gosling does, as part of the narrative rather than stopping the show and bringing the focus on someone else. And I would have largely left out the histories of the characters, except as it relates to their interests in finance. Also, just about every time Michael Burry (Christian Bale) enters a scene, we hear endless heavy metal music. <br/><br/>After the terminology is defined and the characters' histories are out of the way, the story starts to finally move along. Michael Burry (Bale) was one of the earliest financial wizards to realize the housing market was essentially a lie. Billions of dollars were being invested into sub-prime mortgages, housing loans given to people who more often than not, could never pay them back. Mortgage agencies were able to sign sub-prime housing loans and re-sell them to Wall Street who would in turn sell them as tranches to investors. <br/><br/>Burry decides to bet against the housing bubble using the capital in his hedge-fund. He convinces banks to take his ""negative"" investment, and they agree to take millions of dollars, believing they've made easy money. They invest in so-called ""credit default swaps"", a kind of loan insurance. If a loan defaults, the holder of the swap makes the equivalent of the loan in return as long he paid a premium beforehand. So if Burry invests say $50 million in default swaps, he could potentially make $100 millions if the loans ever default, which they did. Part of the story is how Burry's investment strategy in the default swaps proliferates to other Wall Street insiders. The major characters portrayed follow Burry's suit lead, including Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Jared Vennet (Gosling), and eventually Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt).<br/><br/>Overall enjoyable, probably a ""one-watch"" (my term for a single viewing). Once the story kicks in, the film gets better and more compelling as it goes along. For its intentions, it does a reasonably good job of explaining the complexity of the Housing Market Crisis. By mid-way, a lot of the emotion becomes part of the story, and I found those aspects more compelling than Robbie in her bubble bath. Don't misunderstand me, I like Robbie in the bubble bath, but maybe that scene is for an entirely different film."

","Comedic director Adam McKay (best known for his collaborations with Will Ferrell, like Anchorman, Talladega Nights and Step Brothers) makes a foray into drama (though with plenty of comedic touches) with this film about the American housing collapse of the mid-2000s. The story has a great structure, with three different sets of people who were at the forefront of predicting the crisis and hope to make money off of it. Christian Bale is the first to see it. Later, banker Ryan Gosling catches wind of Bale's odd investments and figures it out. He accidentally alerts Steve Carell, and then has to team up with Carell and his crew. Third, a couple of young hedge fund managers (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) hear about it and team up with former neighbor Brad Pitt to get in on the action. The problem with me here is that this is a subject I have a hard time grasping. McKay, however, is great at making it all understandable, or at least halfway so, and he's definitely great at making it all involving and entertaining. The entire ensemble is great. I'd name Bale the best in show, and I'm not usually a big Bale fan. Personally, I'd hold this up against Spotlight, which is similar in a lot of ways (you might think of the characters here as journalists trying to figure this all out), and say this is the way to make a film like this well. McKay's direction isn't overly showy, either, but he makes this exciting and interesting. Much of this is through the editing, which is some of the best of the year. I left Spotlight thinking, ""Eh, that's too bad."" I left The Big Short feeling angry."

Focusing on the very different, often attempting to be gravely humorous, The Big Short, I did get the ""Don't Pass Bar"" theorywhich is funny I use that analogy, since I understand Craps as much as I do these subprime falsehoods. <br/><br/>Basically, a few weird, albeit geniuses, saw what was coming in 2008 – the rug being pulled out from under America and the mortgage crisis. To stay afloat, they bet against the market and all the idiots, fools and incredibly bad humans in the mortgage industry laughed at them and took their bets and money.<br/><br/>Sadly, as comically as they tried to dumb down everything for the average schmo, I still didn't get all the terminology and pretty much gave up half way through. I'm guessing the leads of the story were supposed to be our heroes, and since they were scrambling to buy ""shorts"" – not the kinds you wear – and since I knew what was coming in 2008 with the housing crash, I just wanted them to get more ""shorts.""<br/><br/>The movie was very well made with a great cast you wouldn't see coming if you hadn't seen the poster first.<br/><br/>Now, after watching both Margin Call and this back-to-back, I take back that statement: ""the newer one reminded me of the older film,"" as they couldn't be further apart aside from the end date. I gave both 4/5 stars and both are very good in their own ways. Personally, I would recommend (and wanna see again) Margin Call over The Big Shortbut just by a margin and it'd be your call.<br/><br/>That was bad. My apologizes. Still, see this movie.

","The first thing that struck Me about this Movie: No-one ever does any work! The characters kibbutz, play office sports, do a great deal of gossipping, but not a one earns his pay! For the 90% of Americans who do earn a paycheck, by ""actually working"" this is an enlightening film.. Hedge Fund Managers do SQUAT! They try to figure out the best way to make the most money by outsmarting some other weasel. Tough Work.<br/><br/>The movie plays this as ""comedy"", but most of America who got royally fleeced in 2008 don't find it that humorous! Adam McKay seems to think these men who don't work, and make money by ""fleecing some poor schmuck"" is incredibly funny. These are the same fund managers who during the Enron debacle, clapped and cheered and said: ""Let Gram-ma freeze, as We jack up the energy price"" If watching incredibly lazy men, take money from honest Americans is funny - then this is Your Movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't really that funny when Hank Paulson went before congress and threatened them - that if the Banks weren't bailed out .. there would be ""Martial Law""! It amazes Me that this sad, sad time in American History - when a Nation was blackmailed can spawn a ""comedy""!"

","I worked as a loss mitigation negotiator in real estate during the mortgage crisis. I worked on behalf of borrowers who could not make their house payments. I eventually talked various banks into writing off mortgage debt. I helped a lot of people but couldn't make any money at it.<br/><br/>So I saw the movie knowing quite a bit about the mess of 2007-13. At the end of '13, the law allowing for the tax-free forgiveness of mortgage debt expired. Also, the market had recovered. The short sale market came to a whimpering stop.<br/><br/>Two elements of the crisis were left out of the movie.<br/><br/>First, the Clinton Administration made huge changes in the CRA that forced banks into essentially loaning money to anyone with a pulse. It was either lend money to people who couldn't pay it back or get federally screwed. Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac would buy just about anything.<br/><br/>Second, the biggest recipients of campaign contributions from Wall Street go to Democrats by a huge margin. This is true. The logic is simple. The GOP didn't want to give bail outs. But the Dems can always be counted on to give bailouts. It has been the case twice prior to the latest bail out.<br/><br/>No one was innocent except for the taxpayers who ended up paying for the bailouts. The bankers were greedy, the borrowers were dishonest, and the politicians were calculating.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie. Just make sure you realize that much of the collapse is the fault of people like Clinton and Barney Frank.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the acting is good. <br/><br/>BTW, I hated dealing with BoA. Impossible to work with. They took so long with one sale that both of the borrowers died of old age. Wells Fargo not so bad. Neither was Chase."
"nclibertarian","5","3","8","25 January 2020"," What the movie left out
","I kept waiting for the film to point out the main culprit behind the financial crisis, which was not Wall Street ""greed"" but bad monetary and credit policies from the Federal Reserve and the federal government. The Community Reinvestment Act forced banks to make loans to people who couldn't afford it...but you never hear this, and you're certainly not going to hear it from the famously anti-business. Hollywood."

Yes, it is well made; yes, it was well acted (Carrel was particularly good, Bale played his usual twisted character); but I was bored, even dozed off somewhere through the first half so I had to rewind and start again. The events in question are recent and are still fresh in our memories, we know how it all ends. More than once I was ready to wrap it up, but it kept twisting and stretching. It had its funny moments. I might see it again in the hope I can find those treasurable moments other reviews talk about but I'm not holding my breath.

"PWNYCNY","5","3","8","19 January 2016"," Absurd movie, political polemic masquerading as drama.
","It's easy to target banks and financial institutions as the bad guys whose only goal is to sell overvalued junk to an unsuspecting public. That is the theme of the movie. The political message of this movie is so transparently obvious that it calls into question the movie maker's motivation for making the movie. Obviously, the maker of this movie does not like banks or bankers. The movie goes so far as to assert that financial institutions deliberately defrauded the American public. That makes for a convenient story because it sets up the banks as the bad guys, which is a conventional and time tested plot device for making movies. Yet the movie also disclaims that it is a work of fiction, which is the only factual part of this otherwise turgid and heavy handed attack on the financial system that drives the economy. The fact is that in the world of financial investing, it is impossible to predict outcome. With every investment instrument comes risks. Every mortgage is potentially a financial time bomb that can lose or gain value. What is considered a solid investment can immediately become garbage. To think that the banks know in advance that their holdings are worthless, and that it's time to sell short, means that they are able to predict the future. Besides, what vested interest do banks have to ruin the entire economy? When people were sold homes which were financed through mortgages, everyone, banks and home owners alike, believed that these mortgages were secure. They believed it because the price of homes was going up. Then the bubble burst and the economy took a heavy hit. To suggest, however, that the banks knew IN ADVANCE that this would happen is stretching literary license to the bounds of ridiculousness. It would be like betting on a ""sure bet"" at the track and then blaming the track after the sure bet loses on the spurious claim that the track knew in advance that the horse would not win. That's the nature of gambling, which is what speculation is about. The good guys in this movie are four stock brokers. They are the good guys because they have a conscience and know that what they are trading is junk. Yet they still trade, which shows that they are just as greedy as the rest. The premise of this movie is absurd. However, the premise of the story notwithstanding, the movie contains several string performances. Steve Carell dominates this movie. In a performance that goes against his typical kind of role, he plays a stock broker who has to make decisions that put his sense of morality to the test. To learn what he does, watch the movie."

","OK, first off, there ain't near enough humor in it for it to be labeled a comedy by the awards shows. And yeah, it's an incomplete picture, but only because it pulls up short at every opportunity it had to present the whole story.<br/><br/>The scene with the model in the bubble-bath sipping champagne while mulling over the implications of all those sub-prime mortgages came as close as it got to spilling the beans. Then there was the ditsy former government regulator who was now on the payroll of the people she used to regulate (or vice versa). And amidst all the international chaos, it never mentions Canada which never succumbed to the politically correct pursuit of ""affordable housing"" which mandated that lending institutions ignore minimal prudent background qualifications for a mortgage--and thus avoided the crisis as much as it could in such close proximity to the US.<br/><br/>Yeah, the banks ran with it when the saw Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac buying up all that bad debt. But who started the whole thing and who enabled/forced it on the banks? With all the technical talk they get into in the banking end of the mortgage industry, it never mentions the Community Reinvestment Act (which goes back to Carter), or Dodd/Frank. <br/><br/>The production quality and cast of the movie is way above a 7/10, but this one-sided aspect to the story drags it down to the category of propaganda. It more than just ignores the cause of the problem."

"TheMovieDiorama","5","2","5","2 October 2019"," The Big Short triggers a crisis of its own by treating its audience like children.
","Ladies and gentlemen, I bestow upon you the most frustrating film to ever exist in our plane of reality. You ready for more controversy? I don't like The Big Short. It is a purposefully unconventional exercise in butchering a perfectly solid film through self-obsessed patronisation. A felicitous topic that ages more flavorous than a cheap bottle of Chambord with every passing year, yet presented in the most condescending manner available. Honestly, I'm feeling my veins on my forehead right now. Adam McKay, man. Not impressed. Depicting the financial crisis of '08, three concurrent narratives demonstrate the fraudulent behaviour of banking corporations and mortgage brokers that forced the inception of the ""housing bubble"".<br/><br/>But don't let me bore you with this drivel, here's grime legend Skepta to offer an explanation. Forget about that though. The real issue here is the packaging of subprime loans into collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) which are being rated at AAA level, guaranteeing the eventual collapse of Wall Street. Mean nothing to you? Don't worry, here's adult entertainer Farah Abraham to illustrate these technical terms as she's getting ploughed by a man twice her age. How about the frightening issue of the Securities and Exchange Commission upholding no regulations for monitoring mortgage-backed security activity. Scary, but went straight over your head right? Say no more, here's a frolicking emu to peck at the topic.<br/><br/>Do you see the problem here? The financial crisis, and what banks are still selling today, is terrifying. Absolutely petrifying. Witnessing unemployment rates rocket whilst homes, families and actual lives are lost, disintegrating into an ever-increasing total fuelled by greed and sickening motives. It's obscene. The system is broken, and the events that preceded the tipping point are the most important years of modern history. No exaggeration. I cannot begin to overstate how deftly consequential, and omnipotent, the financial industry is. However my problem, my absolute colossal issue, is that you rarely witness the horror in The Big Short. Rarely do you experience the abhorrent fraudulent cynicism of capitalism. Why? Well, because some tool named Adam McKay would rather subject the viewers to unconventional comedy in order to make light of the impending doom.<br/><br/>No. I'm sorry, but no. Breaking the fourth wall to explain financial concepts in the most patronising lines of dialogue possible is literal butchery. Acquiring celebrity cameos to lavishly detail, and derail, terms by utilising analogies that a primary school teacher would fully lay out to the class is insulting. Etching diagrams onto the screen, in this case a testicle because apparently we have no idea what one looks like, to evoke a needless sense of comedy is futile. These are just deterrent distractions. Obstructing the harrowing events at the centre of McKay's charades.<br/><br/>The worst part, is that he actually does utilise the characters to explain financial jargon to each other. The Jenga construction of bond credit ratings, for example. Vennett describes the eventual collapse perfectly to the FrontPoint partners. Character to character. But of course, McKay treats us like babies and has Gosling break character only to stare into the camera and narrate our, no sorry, his thoughts and further clarify terms in case they weren't simple enough. This is even without mentioning Corwin's frenetic editing that never lets the situational horror simmer. Just constantly keeps ticking over every important emotional detail, retaining a distance from these characters. I yearn to feel Michael Burry's anguish and pressure. I wish to become enveloped in Mark Baum's disgust with American bureaucracy. The rare occasion, mostly Ben Rickert outlining the effects of the impending collapse and how innocent civilians will perish, upholds the true terror of the crisis. But it's not enough to truly denote its greater impact on America.<br/><br/>McKay focussed too much on the excessive meta-references, naturally considering his terrible filmography of comedies, that he diverted from the heart of the ""Doomsday machine"". Glossy for the sake of being unconventional. It doesn't sit right with me. At all. What's more infuriating, is that the performances were all excellent. Bale, Carell, Gosling and even Pitt. Yet they were diluted by a purposefully satirical tone that danced around the crisis. Unforgivable. I understand why McKay took this approach. I acknowledge how many viewers can get onboard with the comedy. I get it. I just don't agree with McKay's execution in the slightest. And it's only because I'm so passionate about the subject, that The Big Short really did fall short."
"jackgdemoss","7","2","5","25 June 2019"," A dramatic documentery, or a documentory-like drama?
","The Big Short is carried almost exclusively by its massive star power. When stripped down to just the story, cinematography, and artistic style of the film, it sinks quickly. Fortunately, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and a cast of supporting actors drenched in star power are able to make this Wall Street story an interesting one. The 4th-wall breaks also help to keep it fresh."
"proud_luddite","6","2","5","1 July 2018"," Rather over-rated
","Mixing fact with fiction, the months that precede the financial disaster of 2008 is chronicled in a satirical way. Various financial players who are able to foresee the outcome end up betting against the U.S. economy for their personal gain. Some of them include an eccentric (Christian Bale), a bully (Ryan Gosling), and two others who have not fully lost their sense of morality (Steve Carell and Brad Pitt).<br/><br/>While this event affected (and continues to affect) many lives quite deeply, there remains a challenge in explaining the beastly details to average moviegoers with a minimal knowledge of economics. For the most part, it helped to have players occasionally speaking to the camera to explain in laymen's terms regarding what is happening. This helps a great deal but the movie's length does not. There are many scenes of economic types in deep conversation. Some of these scenes are great while others create and compound confusion. This is unfortunate as the subject matter is important and worthy of being filmed.<br/><br/>There is also the challenge of dealing with an ending which the audience already knows is coming. The movie does end well with a good commentary. With fine acting and success at finding humour in tragedy (without being condescending), the film might have have had more impact with a shorter length. It was still a worthy attempt."
"jramza-1","5","2","5","6 October 2016"," See ""inside job"" instead
","I really wanted (even expected) to love this movie. I'm a big Steve Carrel fan (and I did live his performance in particular, in this movie). But while it had a serious task to tell the story of the subprime mortgage scandal and the complicit involvement of the banksters , and to tell the story in a manner intelligible to the average person, it told the story strangely. The intense performance of Christian Bale seemed oddly misplaced in a story where characters frequently stop and talk candidly with the viewer. The storyline constantly juxtaposes the seriousness of the repercussions, with offhandedly placed humor. It juxtaposes the greed of the banksters with that of the protagonists who are somehow excused for the profit they gleaned as wealth was redistributed to them, while others lost homes and jobs. And, indeed, as one reviewer noted here, many lost homes because they bought their homes unwisely, and the taxpayers were left to bail out everyone. <br/><br/>In short, for what I think this film is trying to accomplish, I much more recommend seeing ""inside job."" It's just a far better, straightforward film."
"xatian11968","2","2","5","17 April 2016"," Just boring.
","Some 52 minutes into the film, an actor in one of the many buddy buddy scenes breaks the fourth wall and takes a two second gaze directly into the camera. I shut if off at that point, and thanked my lucky stars I didn't contribute to the cinema studio's take at the movie theater. <br/><br/>This film really felt like just another 'popular boys theater club' spending money on a poor script just because everyone was ""hot"" and popular, and ""ballin like wall street"". It played like a poor person's film: flashy, big chested, long di¢ked, frat house rude. There was no sophistication in it. It felt like the outcast step brother to Leo DeCaprio's Wall Street junk stock mayhem. Sure, Steve Carroll has his moments, but this certainly was not one of them. And Christian Bale, he could have done a better job if he just grunted through the entire film like he did in ""Batman"".<br/><br/>...tis a shame that the 2012 film ""Capital"" was received less than this new rendition of ""why I got rich."" The Big Short felt like a home brew from the local men's club after hours.... I didn't stay tuned to see if the breasts from Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill's version made a cameo."
"mollybergamo","3","2","5","2 April 2016"," Boring and misleading
","This movie was incredibly boring. It also left out some rather important details regarding what fueled the housing crisis, including government backed loans, low interest rates and WHY there was a lack of financial oversight. The scene with the SEC character is misleading because the SEC doesn't regulate mortgage underwriting of commercial banks. It doesn't now and it never has. While the SEC regulated mortgage backed securities, it was primarily from a consumer protection standpoint. <br/><br/>The most misleading part was when the movie claimed that little has changed since the financial crisis in terms of regulatory oversight. Financial regulation has since changed significantly. Banks have to hold much more capital and are prohibited from many activities that were allowed during the financial crisis. I could spend an hour writing about what has changed since the financial crisis. <br/><br/>Also the banks didn't receive blank checks like many Americans tend to believe and this movie insinuates something similar. The bailout was in the forms of collateralized loans. As in the government took ownership of something the bank previously owned and gave the bank cash. Why? The assets that banks previously used for liquidity were tied up in a market that stopped functioning practically overnight. Over time the market started functioning again, banks repaid their loans and banks received their collateral back from the government. <br/><br/>That being said the movie was boring, especially from someone familiar with the products and industry."
"fullheadofsteam","6","2","5","3 March 2016"," You'd better keep up, but even then it's incomplete
","Wow -- you had better either keep up non-stop, or have the remote handy for re-wind, because the story line and editing leave much to be desired in what could have been a better film if not so egotistically shot stylistically, rather than in a more linear fashion. To say that there is a terrific ensemble cast is understatement, but some of them underutilized, and some over-utilized (Steve), with some consequence in Steve's case with what is most certainly unarguably the worst hairpiece in recent cinema. That it distracts is also an understatement. The last bemoaning factoid of this otherwise purportedly true story is that it blames only Wall Street, which in doing so rather conveniently or ignorantly skips federal government fault, which at the time had Democrats in charge of both Senate and House of Representatives financial/banking oversight."
"Chance_Boudreaux19","4","2","5","27 February 2016"," More like a documentary
","In Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort tries to explain what he is doing and then he says that we are probably not going to get it anyway and all that matters is that he is making a lot of money. Well this movie tries to explain everything and some things it does and others it doesn't but the whole point of the movie is explaining how the crisis happened and why, it is more of a documentary than a drama. It tries to be a bit like Wolf of Wall Street with the breaking of the fourth wall which I am OK with. What I am not fine with is the direction which was a bit sloppy on purpose to give it more of a documentary feel which I didn't like. Also it is very informative but it doesn't have much entertainment value, I love dialogue in film but in this one I just didn't understand what they were talking about in some instances. The story could have been presented in a better way but it is still worth seeing just to see how we are being used by the banks. Just for the message and what it exposes I give it a higher grade than I would have which would probably have been a 5."

The fast cutting, mixed news and archive footage flash-backs simply won't replace the story(telling). I had to fight throughout the entire film with the impression that the director is trying too hard to find a better and more shiny way to tell his story, probably because he felt it was too complicated, too snobby for a wide audience.

","Four denizens in the world of high-finance predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the late-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight.<br/><br/>As the Oscar ceremony approaches (slowly but surely), the front-runner for best picture is said to be ""Spotlight"", with ""The Big Short"" named as a possible usurper. But right up front, let it be made clear: that possibility is slim. Although this is certainly an important film, it is not necessarily a great film.<br/><br/>The film is nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and on that front, it has a real chance. The writers took what should be a dry, boring subject and made it somewhat interesting by adding humor and some unexpected cameos. A serious attempt was made to explain Wall Street in terms that everyone can understand. But one of the reasons it will not win Best Picture is because it never quite succeeds in explaining certain things. Comparing CDOs to soup makes sense, and using blackjack to explain why ""hot hand"" statistics and odds are false is wonderful. But even the very core concept of the film -- betting against something -- is never as clear as it should be. (And it does not help that Margot Robbie mumbles through her lines.) The script, which again is very good, should perhaps have been streamlined before filming. Most of the time we are in a sort of fast-paced world, a place Rosalind Russell of ""His Girl Friday"" would have appreciated. But we get bogged down with subplots that do not matter. The montages showing time passing added nothing, and the whole bit about Steve Carell's character dealing with a suicide did not matter. Yes, they flesh out his character, but in a story with so many protagonists, it makes no difference.<br/><br/>Speaking of Carell, some say he got snubbed for an acting nomination. That is a fair complaint. In recent years, he has shown himself to be much more than the guy from ""The Office"" or ""Evan Almighty"". He stood out in ""Foxcatcher"" (for which he was nominated), and he goes above and beyond that here. Playing Mark Baum may be his best role to date.<br/><br/>The Academy did decide to nominate Christian Bale. There is no argument that Bale is not one of the finest actors in the business, from ""The Machinist"" and ""American Psycho"" up through his recent work. He successfully portrays a man with Asperger's (without going over the top) and a glass eye. It is a great role. Will he win? Probably not, but only because Supporting Actor is shaping up to be one of the toughest categories this year. Both Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance are strong, so it seems likely one Mark or the other is getting the award.<br/><br/>Again, Best Picture seems woefully out of reach, which leaves the other big category: Best Director. This is a huge feather in the cap of Adam McKay, because he is not typically associated with Oscar-worthy film. This is the guy who brought us the Funny or Die website, as well as ""Anchorman"" and ""Step Brothers"". He makes great movies, but movies of an altogether different type. Up against heavyweights like Inarritu and Tom McCarthy, this win seems far-fetched.<br/><br/>Judging based on the Golden Globes (which is no sure indicator), ""The Big Short"" is the sort of film that gets several nominations, but few wins. At the Globes, it took home zero. With the Oscars, it might have a shot at Adapted Screenplay (as noted above), but will likely go home empty-handed. By no means is this a bad movie (it clearly is among 2015's best), but unfortunately for those involved, it will be edged out by different movies in each category and may be the film with the most unfulfilled nominations."

I've watched documentaries about the mortgage collapse, which were more superior to this. The events in question are still quite recent and fresh in our heads. I think for someone without knowledge in finance or the collapse of the mid-2000s would find this film exhausting.<br/><br/>The attempts at comedy fail and are distracting.

Most notable was Christain Bale, who played this genius yet socially awkward guy, and Steve Carrel, who yet again proved that he can do more than just comedy roles. <br/><br/>Now the subject which was being covered isn't something that an average person will find interesting. Economics, banking and related stuff with tons of terminologies and jargons and numbers. It could get pretty boring fast. So the movie incorporated various ways to make it all interesting like a fun script that kept things light and quirky, various 4th wall breaking moments, celebrity cameos explaining important terms etc. It all combined together to form an uneven but ultimately an enjoyable experience. <br/><br/>The pacing was often uneven. I was bored in some parts of the film. And the hand holding got a bit too in-your-face at times. I get that they were trying to make things easier for mass audiences but some of the ways incorporated distracted rather than being fun. Also, the movie tried to make this feel more documentary-ish and it ended up being annoying at times, especially the shaky camera work. <br/><br/>The recession of 2008 was a BIG EVENT that effected the whole world and knowing more about it is always something I found interesting.

"oOoBarracuda","6","2","5","19 January 2016"," The Big Short, comes up short
","The Big Short tells the tale of the only people who saw the financial disaster of 2008 coming, fringe Wall Street-ers and bankers who were just outside the fray enough to truly see what was going on. We learn about the disaster that took place within the housing market through four parallel story lines, all of which taking place in 2005. The first involves Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an eccentric former physician who has gained almost complete autonomy in his work due to his incredible financial savviness. He explains to his investors that the housing market has been propped up upon an unsustainable bubble and is on the brink of bursting within a couple years. He wants the support of his investors in his aim to bet against the housing market, because he is so sure the bubble is to burst. Burry fights an uphill battle, as nothing was seen more stable than the housing market before the crash, as it had never in history sustained an economic blow. The bank is fully willing to take Burry's money as he proceeds to bet against the housing market, completely confident they are in for a big pay day. We also meet Mark Baum (Steve Carell), the finance worker completely fed up with the fraud and greed of corporations and Wall Street. Baum is outspoken and unapologetic; a crusader who realizes the depth of corporate corruption, but it still surprised and sickened by its gravity. ""these are real people, people who will lose their homes and their jobs"" Baum states disgustedly when he starts to see how deep the corruption has come in the housing market. Troubled by his own family tragedy, Baum fought against the banks, making the same sort of bets against them that Burry was making. Then there is Jared Vannett (Ryan Gosling), a Deutsche Bank trader who exudes over confidence, and embodies the personality of someone who is never told ""no"". His sole interest is to maximize capital for his investors, and sees his way of betting against the housing market as a sure payoff. Finally, there is Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), a retired super-investor who moved to Colorado and lives as off the grid as he can to escape the atrocities he was a part of in the financial sector. He acts as a mentor to two young men with a startup desperate to get more money, and a seat at Big Bank's table. A mix of motivations and interests guide the audience through the worst financial disaster of our lifetimes.<br/><br/>Of all the things I thought could go wrong with The Big Short, pacing is not one I expected. I never thought getting the four story lines out there and fleshing out the difficult to understand bank lingo would be something told on-screen too slow, but it was. With so much to uncover and reveal about each individual, character development was only close to explored with Steve Carell's Mark Baum. The audience learns little about the other three story lines involved and is left with no real hero to side with. Granted, there is little to like, I suppose, about investors betting against the housing market and only getting their big pay day in the event of a global financial crash; further character development, however, would have went a long way in engaging the audience in the film. Unless of course you were engaged by the needless pop culture heavy devices to explain banking terms; i.e. a cameo by Selena Gomez, and Margot Robbie in a bubble bath. These injections of comedy and pop culture were immensely distracting and brought the viewer too far out of the world of the film. Overall, The Big Short was a disappointment considering the cast and storyline it had to work with. Questionable film styles also did little to endear this film to my heart.<br/><br/>The cinematography was horrendous in this film. What I can only assume was an attempt at the look of a docu-drama; a hand-held camera was used for much of the shooting of this film. The problem with the docu- drama realism is that it didn't mesh with the big budget look of the film, and just turned out to be migraine inducing shakiness. Everything was too slow, and by the time it was finished we only got a short introduction to the main players within but outside of the game. The only bright spot to this film was the acting, with one big exception; Christian Bale. Bale is the type of actor that only touches what turns to gold, and I understand he learned enough drums for his role in the film to fit his portrayal which shows his commitment as an actor. Bale nailed the zaniness of Dr. Burry, but forgot to expose the intelligence. A man that is supposed to come off as a socially awkward genius came off heavy on the socially awkward and light on the genius. Steve Carell played his tormented idealist fantastically, and it is truly a miss for the Academy that he wasn't recognized for this role.<br/><br/>If only the director, Adam McKay had more trust in the intelligence of his audience. Trust that he didn't have to embed pop culture reference at every turn and use beautiful big name actresses to interrupt the story. Had this film been done with a more serious tone, I believe it would have been deserving of all the attention it garnered from the Academy. But alas, we are left with another film propelled by a big name cast that could have been greatif only."
"phd_travel","5","2","5","17 January 2016"," Some parts are okay but a lot was confusing and boring
","I didn't enjoy this movie that much even though I was interested in the subject matter. I think it was just that how these people shorted the market isn't that interesting an aspect of the crisis. It's technical and boring. There were some good points here and there.<br/><br/>The good points first: The little explanations of the toxic products were illuminating. The way the main protagonists found out about the depth of the crisis was also entertaining. There are some interesting moments like how S&P gave out their AAA rankings.<br/><br/>The bad points: The main characters are just not very interesting to make a movie about and you don't feel for any of them or understand what they are talking about for a lot of the movie. Christian Bale's character was kind of uninteresting. The wake you up strippers and music were kind of daft and spoiled the tone. The conflict that Steve Carrell's character or Brad Pitt's character felt about making money from the crisis wasn't very genuine. <br/><br/>There are 2 movies about the financial crisis that are much better about the crisis itself: the HBO movie ""Too Big to Fail"" and the excellent ""Margin Call"". I understand that ""The Big Short"" wasn't trying to tell the same story and it was showing things from the POV of these people who shorted. It may have the nominations and the A list movie stars but it ranks below both of the above in terms of clarity and entertainment value."
"gnix1979","7","2","5","12 January 2016"," Well acted, but added nothing new
","There should have been a good story here but the main problem is that it offered nothing new that the audience didn't already know. I wasn't personally directly effected by the crash, as I don't own a mortgage, that being said it effected everything else such as the economy after the bailouts so effected me in that way. In some way it was interesting to see a different perspective on the causes of the crash and see it all play out.<br/><br/>Another issues is that this movie is too complicated to understand for a layman, and the movie admits this itself by having those 2-3 minute moments when they get celebs like Margot Robbie trying to explain something while taking a bath, I mean come on that was just stupid. If a movie is that complicated, don't make it as the audience will become disinterested and less enjoyable.<br/><br/>Hollywood should never really complicate a story as it will capture a larger audience. One of the reasons I love the Other Guys with Will Farrell and Mark Walberg is that they covered the Wall Street Crash but made it simple to understand.<br/><br/>Yet I will say that some of the actors were excellent and I am starting to see the next Tom Hanks in Steve Carell, moving from comedy to drama. I was surprised with Christian Bale as he looked disinterested and not convincing is his role. But I think Carell deserves a shout at the Oscars even though he won't win, he deserves a nomination at least."

It's more economics lecture than a movie. Transformation of Lewis' not-so-cinematic book into an engaging big screen narrative isn't a complete success.

"trublu215","7","2","6","4 January 2016"," The acting is brilliant, the dialog is snappy, and the characters are rich but the story is far too intricate for a film.
","The Big Short is comedic director's Adam McKay's attempt at drama and it is somewhat bittersweet to see. On one hand, the performances that McKay is able to obtain from his actors is that of an optimum level however, despite the performances and how excellent they all are, the story is far too involved and convoluted to fit a feature length narrative. This would have been a much better television mini-series, and may benefit from a less surreal approach to the source material. The film starts by showing us Ryan Gosling donning an expensive black suit along with equally black hair and dark brown eyes, a strikingly different look than the blue eyed heartthrob we're all used to seeing. He introduces himself as Jared Vennett, an eccentric businessman that discovers from a long line of real estate geniuses and brokers (Steve Carrell, Brad Pitt and Christian Bale, among others) that the infrastructure of the entire US economy is bound to collapse. And unfortunately, any American knows what came after that. A total economic disaster of epic proportions that crippled a nation and forced mortgage foreclosure signs on the front lawns of millions of homes and countless ruined lives. The film handles this subject matter quite gracefully but moves way too briskly through the material for anyone to get an understanding of how it all works but, then again, there are college courses on this exact type of economy and there are many that still don't have an understanding of it all and they work in the field. The issues that The Big Short suffer from is a less interesting script that sacrifices what could be some really riveting documentary work for some mock-Wolf of Wall Street moments and Gosling waiting for his Jordan Belfort or Gordon Gekko moment, one that never comes close to even arising. Steve Carrell and Christian Bale give exceptionally strong performances in the film. Carrell plays a broker who struggles with the loss of someone close to him while discovering the financial fallout of America while Bale plays Micharl Burry, the man who discovered the fatal flaw in America's system. Overall, Thr Big Short tries to pack in too much information into a feature film narrative and is weighed down by some truly slow moving and confusing back and forths that essentially amount to the characters playfully hurling insults at one another. While these scenes are well acted and very engrossing, it leaves much to be wanted. The actors are excellent and Adam McKay has done a wonderful job at directing them to some career best performances. McKay's mistake lies in a jammed pack script that is in dire need of some breathing room."

","It's the Financial Crisis of 2008, for dummies. Well, you can still call me a dummy. As the film rambles on using investment banker jargon, and shortly stopping to explain to you what all of it means using a whole host of celebrity cameos, my mind was still a jumble.You better believe that this film is one hell of a ride. It's one of the best directed films of the year. Adam McKay, who an absolute comedic genius by reputation, comes out of nowhere with this slam-dunk of a drama. Even when you're lost in it's web of politics, you are still ridiculously entertained by it's style.<br/><br/>McKay, whether or not he is fully successful at it, has made a film that attempts to put one of the most complicated events in American history into terms accessible to the layman. He uses a lot fourth wall breaking, pop culture, and quite an abundance of floating texts to make it so. Scorsese seems to be the biggest influence, and The Wolf of Wall Street, seems to be the template to which this film tells us a side story about this most greediest of streets. Among a colorful cast is some of the best performances of the year by Steve Carell as a feisty, Bernie Sanders-esque ex-banker, and Christian Bale as Michael Burry.. a man worth devoting an entire movie on himself. It looks like a 5-star movie, and yet, something about The Big Short, slightly, falls short.<br/><br/>A lot of people have said that McKay may have been way over his head when it comes to achieving his political message, and yes, I can see that. McKay is a seasoned comic, but he badly wants to be the next Michael Moore. That's kind of a dangerous road to go down, in his case. Because, let's face it, you can't get onto a soapbox, and invite your white, rich, elitist, Hollywood friends to get on with you. Nobody wants to listen to it anymore. Hollywood is not in touch with the rest of the world, and neither are politicians. I don't think I would've been left with this impression had the movie not ended on a self-righteous note. If McKay and the entire cast feel the way they feel about the inequities of the system, maybe they need to put their money where their mouths are, and skip out on the limousine ride to the premiere. Maybe they ought to walk down a lonely LA street and greet a bunch of adoring fans, whom could really be down on their luck.<br/><br/>Does this limit my absolute praise of the picture? Sure. But on all other accounts, The Big Short is an absolutely stunning thing to behold. In many sections, it had me laughing out loud, and clinging to the edge of my seat. I love this style of filmmaking, without a doubt. When any film begins to recognize it's audience, and throws a wink their way, I just love it. McKay has studied well from the Godard handbook he's also studied the ever-living hell out of investment banking. My God, his mind is like a steel trap of banking."

","""Synthetic collateralized debt obligation . . .""<br/><br/>A docudrama about the bank-mortgage failures of 2008 has the potential for being BORING. Not so with Margin Call, which dealt with discovering the bank failures in a pleasingly clear exposition that kept the drama high and the technical explanations simple. With the same writer along for the ride, The Big Short is not quite as digestible about sub-prime mortgage shorting (see above phrase) but clear enough to see some very smart people betting against the mortgages, profiting if they fail.<br/><br/>But that means hoping our fellow Americans will bail out the banks, which they did through massive government infusion of money. Mark Baum (Steve Carrel) is the conscience in a film full of amoral opportunists, most of whom were just living the American dream by siphoning fees from outrageously easy loans. Yet even Mark is not perfect.<br/><br/>Christian Bale as Mike once again shows he is in the top tier of film actors along with Daniel Day Lewis and Tom Hardy. Mike is the one who first spies the sub-prime pattern of weak loans to workers who can't eventually keep up with payments or whose houses have put them ""underwater."" His sleuthing and profiting represent the ethical dilemma the film so well and regularly showcases: Does anyone care for the little guy while you are cashing in.<br/><br/>What The Big Short has in spades, however, is humor, e.g., ""Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal and I'll have my wife's brother arrested."" Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) The technical terms mixing with street language are frequently parsed by characters or text that makes sense. Many clear lessons are delivered by pop-cult notables like Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdon, whose command of the spoken word helps relax the film's more arcane moments. <br/><br/>Super cast, even producer Brad Pitt has a pivotal role as a retired trader. The smart dialogue, effective close ups, and made-to-order topicality offer The Big Short as a movie to see while we move into Oscar's season."

The movie inserts a blatant leftist take on a hot button issue which has little to do with the topic of this movie, and many Americans like me will strongly disagree with. <br/><br/>Made me sort of regret I'd given Hollywood twenty bucks to see it.

There were also two men from Boulder who had figured things out separately but needed the help of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) to pull it off.<br/><br/>The first hurdle was that there was no mechanism to buy a short or swap against the real estate market. Michael Burry had to negotiate them and the investment companies were happy to take his money and party with it as bonds are never down graded.<br/><br/>The film had a number of asides and documentary style interjections. It took the complex task of explaining market terms by using stars and metaphors. For instance Selena Gomez explains synthetic CDOs at a blackjack table, something that even investors didn't know existed, or at least the film portrayed it that way.<br/><br/>Now the folks who made millions on the collapse of the world economy didn't celebrate on screen.

"gavinp9","8","1","2","2 January 2018"," Great film - energetic and interesting
","Based on the true story of how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) came about from 2005-2008, 'The Big Short' tells the story really well by mixing humour, facts (delivered in an unconventional way by celebrities) and following four tenuously-linked groups who have skin in the game. Vennett (Gosling) introduces us at the start of 2005, via a unique fourth-wall-breaking monologue, placing the players on the field - I'm using this terminology, as most of the film (and Wall Street in general) can be likened to gambling. It may sound boring on the surface - a film about banking and finance - but it does a great job of explaining the terminology in simple terms, whilst not being condescending about it.<br/><br/>The groups involved are Burry (Bale), a fund manager and prodigy of sorts, who first sees the housing bubble and notices that the big banks have been over-valuing mortgages (sub-prime). Baum (Carell) and his small company are offered the opportunity to ""short"" the banks' mortgages by Vennett. Geller (Magaro) & Shipley (Wittrock), two young entrepreneurs, who seek help from their mentor, retired Wall St mogul Rickert (Pitt) also pick up on what' happening and get in on the action. It's great to see the banks gleefully taking their money, being so cocky and greedy, only to have it all blow up in their faces two years later.<br/><br/>I think Carell, not Bale, should have been Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor! Baum serves as the film's moral centre and calls everyone on their fraudulent behaviour. The film almost acts as a documentary when it delves down to the individual family level and makes you truly realise how little these large corporations care for other humans. The most bittersweet part is the ending - ""and then the crooks went to jail, Congress brought in reform and the fraudulent system was overhauled - just joking! They didn't go to jail, Congress was lobbied so no reform was passed and the big banks were bailed out by the taxpayers"" - funny, sad, and true. Really makes you think, but is also a well-made film with excellent acting."

","The Big Short could've been a great movie, had it taken its subject in a serious and mature way. For its subject, a pretty serious one (--the financial collapse of the economy in 2008--), is the kind of thing you need time to digest; the kind of thing you need time to actually understand, and of which plenty of real, relevant, true data will be needed if this is to be achieved. Half-truths, therefore, as the ones provided in this film, as well as the unequivocally politically biased depiction of things the authors attempt to convey to the audiences under the guise of ""objectivity"", are not very useful.<br/><br/>The whole plot of The Big Short is, indeed, nothing but a masqueraded, dishonest attempt to discredit capitalism; the audience is led to believe that those who believe in capitalist systems are nothing but immature, greedy, evil men, unlike those who don't believe in it, and which we are consequently supposed to see as ""the good"" (--the ""good"", that is, millennials, the 20 something generation, or more generally, and interchangeably with the previously mentioned, the 'intelligent', the 'brave', the 'adult', etc, etc. Sometimes, though, the ""good"" can also be interpreted as 'the innocent' or any other harmless and/or suffering individual. The ""good"", in other words, this is the whole point, is to be associated with... --yes, you guessed it right-- ... socialists and the Left in general--).<br/><br/>It is useful to mention, also, that although the movie's subject isn't really structured to be presented as funny (i.e., it is evident that the movie wasn't designed to make you laugh), we can still see it classified as 'a comedy' anyway. That might be, ironically, the only funny thing you'll remember about it, for The Big Short is no comedy at all. The Big Short is, rather, a biased attempt to misinform and misguide people regarding the actual causes of the financial collapse of 2008, in order to discredit a capitalist system that, on the other hand, and putting all things together, has made of this country the most successful, prosperous nation in the history of human being.<br/><br/>I'd say that the single, most valuable thing to keep to ourselves from this movie is that wise piece of advise that we are rightly led to infer throughout,and which touches upon our relationship to the media and the information we are fed by them, and which we might formulate as: ""You shouldn't believe everything you read in the papers."" (or the Internet, for what it's worth). That is, exercise some critical thinking. For, as the great man once said, ""The price of liberty is eternal vigilance""...<br/><br/>."
"davidcar50","4","1","2","29 March 2016"," Noble effort comes up a bit, well, short
","The Big Short (TBS) is a moderately below-average film that stumbles in a couple basic areas. I found myself in the metaphorical shoes of stock analyst Michael Baum (Steve Carrell) who cannot believe he is watching a slow-motion train wreck no one else either understands or cares a whit about.<br/><br/>I'm unsure many early glowing reviewers actually watched the film. One giveaway: TBS is saturated with irony mustier than an underground cavern, yet few deemed it worthy of comment. From the one-eyed hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who sees what others cannot, to the compromised ratings agency woman whose vision is (literally) impaired, it's nearly endless. The alligator lurking in the backyard pool at the abandoned Florida development? Wait, is that a metaphor?<br/><br/>There's meta-irony mixed in with their praise: TBS is largely about people who willfully overrated mortgage bonds and thereby misled others for personal gain. I wonder if some purposely overrated TBS for analogous reasons.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I've worked on Wall Street for 25 years, both as a humble accountant and an opinionated research analyst. I've seen virtually all major Wall-Street-related films of the past 25-30 years, most more than once. Like the old joke about ""Caddyshack"" and its sequel, ""Wall Street"" far and away is the best of the genre, and ""Wall Street II"" the worst. I admire Michael Lewis, and I read TBS at least twice.<br/><br/>The director's main conceit, that people can't enjoy a movie about a financial scandal without regular distractions including naked lovelies taking bubble baths, celebrity chefs, and comely actresses playing themselves in cameos, was a BIG disappointment. Underestimating the audience downgraded the similarly stylish and well-cast ""Margin Call,"" in my view, terminally afraid to explain exactly why the fictional bank was going belly-up.<br/><br/>Examples abound where a film both informs about the world of finance and entertains without annoying asides and sophomoric time-outs: ""Wall Street"" let us in on the world of mergers and acquisitions, risk arbitrage, and insider trading, ""Boiler Room"" limned the high-pressure sales tactics of unscrupulous brokers who operate in, well, boiler rooms. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" channeled ""Boiler Room"", ""Goodfellas"", and a sand grain of ""Wall Street"" to illuminate the dangers of charismatic pied pipers pitching penny stocks to suckers. Plus it made much better use of Margot Robbie (Margot Robbie).<br/><br/>Instead of drowning the audience in complex terminology like Credit Derivative Obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs), why not just stick with ""mortgage bonds"" (MBs) and ""put options?"" TBS cries out for the technique Rob Lowe suggests in ""Thank you for Smoking"": just add a line of dialogue to quickly explain what a soon-to-be-forgotten financial product is used for. Then move on.<br/><br/>Movies like ""Wall Street"" and books like ""The Great Crash 1929"" place financial bubbles squarely in the context of human nature: People will rampantly speculate on the value of stocks and/or real estate, their values will eventually inflate, and then ultimately the bubble will pop. Stocks. Real estate. Inflate. Pop. Rinse and repeat. I suppose TBS is about bonds and real estate. Whatever, it's not that new.<br/><br/>Roughly 90% of every financial crisis boils down to one thing: Money is borrowed that won't be repaid. 1929 crash. 1980s S&L crisis. 2007 sub-prime mortgages. Follow the borrower. The other 10% is the colorful detail movies are made of. In 2016, it'll be shale petroleum-based loans and junk bonds that blow up. Yawn.<br/><br/>The cast is first-rate and production values uniformly high. Ryan Gosling was very good as Jared Vennett, the unicorn who both works for an I-bank yet comprehends the inherently unsustainable underpinnings of the MBs they create. His Jenga scene explaining how MBs are constructed was my favorite.<br/><br/>Some scenes utterly lack accuracy. Burry visits Goldman Sachs to ask them to craft a brand-new, never-before-devised contract to make a huge bet against the US housing market. Two spiffy junior bankers across the table (whom I'll nickname Muffy and Sanjay) quickly agree to write the unique contract then and there.<br/><br/>Umm, no way, Sanjay. Brand new derivatives with novel risks that require bank capital to be set aside might take several weeks to put together. Muffy and Sanjay need to successfully navigate at least a couple of Risk Committee approval processes, plus invest serious time with internal lawyers and an external regulatory agency for good measure. Ouch.<br/><br/>Other times I confess no clue what the film wants to convey. The scene with two young Coloradans (TYCs) in the lobby of JP Morgan Chase is one example. If I understand, the TYCs first get summarily rejected, then stumble upon a pitch book left on a lobby bench (?) that outlines the entire short-the-sub-prime-market thesis. Then one TYC looks directly into the camera and informs us this scene never actually happened; they simply cadged the impending sub-prime crisis idea from a friend. Huh? I'm confused. You either take artistic license or you don't, but not both. There went the ""Best Editing"" Oscar.<br/><br/>Most financial flicks are chock-full of memorable quotes. ""Wall Street"" alone could fill a small Kindle (""Greed is good"", ""Lock and load,"" ""Blue Horseshoe loves Annacott Steel,"" ""So the falcon has heard the falconer?"" ""American Express has got a hit-man looking for me,"" ""The illusion has become real,"" ""Because it's wreckable""). ""Boiler Room"" actually includes a worshipful paean to ""Wall Street""'s quotability. There's nothing similarly memorable in TBS. In a screenplay cut from prime Michael Lewis-woven cloth, this in itself constitutes a financial-bubble-sized scandal.<br/><br/>Final irony: By placing full blame upon the banks, the filmmakers actually may delude viewers about the risks of history repeating itself and the public's ultimate responsibility for their financial matters. They thereby render a recurrence of this sad chapter in our recent economic history more likely. A second bubble bath scene, with Barney Frank explaining his indispensable role in this whole mess, would be a teaching moment like none other."
"tomgillespie2002","9","1","2","24 March 2016"," The film of 2015
","With a career built around Will Ferrell vehicles such as Anchorman (2004), Step Brothers (2008) and The Other Guys (2010), writer/director Adam McKay has made an astonishing leap into the big-leagues with The Big Short, clearly a passion project that discusses the inner workings of the housing market and subprime loans and manages to make it entertaining, funny and infuriating all at the same time. It tells the story of the financial crisis that hit the U.S. and eventually the rest of the world in 2007, and the men who foresaw it and profited hugely from the disaster while nobody paid attention.<br/><br/>Adapted from Michael Lewis's novel of the same name, The Big Short tells three non-intertwining stories. One-eyed hedge-fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) suffers from Asperger's, but what he lacks in social skills he makes up for in sheer ability to read numbers. He is the only person to take a look at the housing market in detail and sees its collapse as a certainty. Visiting several banks, he bets against the market while the staff laugh behind his back. Spray-tanned trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), who also serves as our fourth-wall-breaking narrator, catches wind of this and, realising that Burry's predictions are likely correct, decides to bring his credit-swap dealings to the attention of other potential investors.<br/><br/>One person who is convinced by Vennett's proposal is Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a hedge fund manager with anger issues and a hatred of The Man, who, along with his team, starts to investigate these distressing claims for himself and learns that the banks have been selling collateralised debt obligations - loans made up of worthless bonds given fraudulent AAA ratings. Small-time investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) also want their piece of the action but are below the capital threshold to make a worthwhile profit and so employ Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), a former Wall Street trader turned reclusive organic-obsessive, to assist them with their trades.<br/><br/>If it all sounds a touch confusing, it's because it is. The entire housing market was wrapped up in so many layers of bull-s**t that it took a weird genius such as Burry to actually see it for what it was. McKay is aware of this too, and to ensure that attention doesn't wander during those important moments of exposition, he employs celebrities such as Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez to explain it to the audience in simple terms. The film doesn't think that the audience is stupid, but simply acknowledges just how dull the subject matter is. The fact that the banks ultimately escaped punishment and were bailed out by the government reinforces the importance of the general public's understanding of how they operated to ensure it doesn't happen again (although the sobering revelations at the climax reveal that they're at it again already).<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly flawless. Carell is the stand-out. with his Baum serves as the film's simmering champion of the little people. While he works in stocks, he holds nothing but disdain for the way his country operates. Bale is terrific too, careful not to paint Burry as a cartoon character as he slumps around his office in shorts and bare feet and pounds air-drums to heavy metal (Bale also has the uncanny ability to move each of his eyes independently, removing the need for a fake glass eye). While Gosling's Vennett is your typical grease-ball suit, he revels in the characters arrogance and projects enough charisma to even convince Baum to trust him. Despite the ensemble, the real hero is McKay who resists laying on the style too thickly and delivers a film bursting with energy, maturity and humour. Of the Academy's 2015 Best Picture line-up, The Big Short is my pick for film of the year."
"DavidLindahl","5","1","2","23 March 2016"," Should have been made as a mockumentary
","The Big Short is based on a true story of how investors predicted the financial crisis of 2007, and earned money on betting that it would actually happen. The film is based on a fact book with the same name. The film includes big names such as Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. It was nominated for several Oscars including best picture, and it did win for best adapted screenplay. Director Adam McKay has prior to The Big Short, mostly done comedies with Will Ferrell so the step in this direction and the Oscar nominations was definitely unexpected.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, I didn't care that much for the film. The financial crisis is fascinating and I understood that the film was to be about advanced house mortgages. Also, to make it easier for us the audience, they made Ryan Gosling into some sort of narrator who from time to time face the camera and explains to us what different things means. The biggest problem I had with The Big Short is that after you understood what it's all about, the financial crisis and how they made money on it, there's nothing left to rely on. The characters and their personal development is minimal, except for a couple of clichés by Carrell and Pitt, where they begin to moralize so that we the audience don't feel like everyone in the film is a greedy moron who makes money on other people's suffering. A boring mistake. Look at one of the most famous characters of all time, Michael Douglas' investor in the film Wall Street. He is a greedy moron but he is also a great character.<br/><br/>I personally would rather have seen this film as a sort of mockumentary, a documentary with a touch of parody. The Big Short wants to be comical but at the same time to be taken seriously and I don't think this really works. A shorter documentary about the crisis with a comical approach would have been more interesting. We would have gotten rid of all the over the top moral cliché scenes. Strange is also that at some point in the film the characters travel to a private owned house and question the tenants about their house mortgage, and later come to the conclusion that they should bet against the entire USA economy. The scene only exist to make the situation more understandable to us but at the same time it just makes the characters look dumb and not believable investors. The Big Short was a good idea and it was interesting until I understood what it was all about. After that it just became predictable and boring. Practically no new information is revealed after about half of the film, and the entire film is over two hours. I grade it a 5.<br/><br/>David - Filmografen"

The acting is maybe the best thing about this movie and while Christian Bale got nominated, I think Steve Carrel's performance was the best. Gosling was great too but Bale and Carrel were batter. I had no idea Carrel is such a good actor and I was really surprised about him. And the movie is also very well written. It dumbs everything down which really helps if you don't understand what are the characters talking about. Ot doesn't hurt the story at all because it's done in such a clever way to explain to the audience and I really liked that.

","I enjoyed every minute of this great movie. It tells the story of those who predicted the 2008 mortgage crisis and the financial disaster that would come afterward.<br/><br/>Of course, no one believed them. Through their eyes, we see the system and the people that were responsible for the house of cards that would come tumbling down. It's a dark, bitter movie that attacks American capitalism in the solar plexus. However, there are light moments, and even some humour. <br/><br/>It's always interesting to see the workings of capitalist America. Such huge amounts of money! It starts to lose all meaning.<br/><br/>Everyone plays their roles well in this movie, but the one who stood out for me is Steve Carell. His character was very believable. The movie goer identifies with his sense of dread and nausea as he realizes what he's stumbled upon. Christian Bale's portrayal of the eccentric Michael Burry was also really interesting. A truly great actor.<br/><br/>I wouldn't miss this movie if you enjoy learning something while getting entertained."
"scottshak_111","8","1","2","17 February 2016"," Sheer brilliance!
","Can we ever forget the big bad ugly ""Great Recession""? Just when you were trying real hard to forget, BAM! comes The Big Short, forcing you to relive the pain again. But wait! Don't be fooled just yet. It isn't like any other mainstream movie, or a drama to focus on the severity the great fall brought along, or the lives it uprooted, or the devastating aftermath it brought along with the punishing tide, rather a prequel to how some geniuses had envisaged the collapse way before, and decided to swim across.<br/><br/>Adam McKay packs in an excellent exposition to depict the players of The Big Short, with Ryan Gosling as Jared Venett, the guy with exceptional presentation skills (yes watch out for that bit!), Christian Bale as Michael Burry, the autistic polymath who was the first one to figure it all out, Steve Carell as Mark Baum, the lunatic front-runner to milk out the mortgage shortcomings, Brad Pitt as Ben Rickert, the laconic beast-banker who mentored Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley played by John Magaro and Finn Wittrock to bet against the dwindling housing market. McKay's direction is one of a kind, as he slams frames mid-way to not focus on apparent conversations. He steers in its comic factor by asking characters to look at the camera mid-way for emphasis. Occasionally playing recorded video frames to make it all look more appealing. You can almost perceive the effort he has put in to break down the gorgeous Michael Lewis book.<br/><br/>Screenplay of the movie is extraordinary. There are so many words selected from profound areas that fill in the voids of sentience. Dramatic bits in the movie are just so right, that you always feel connected with the adrenaline vibe. There are so many banking terms incorporated in the flick expounded in laymen terms by renowned personalities like Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez and Richard Thaler that make things easy to gobble.<br/><br/>The moment the flick reaches its climax, you know what's coming, but you still end up with a feeling of satisfaction for those who managed to milk the Great depressing cow with a smug face that barely read ""We told you so!"" The fact that it isn't confined to just one perspective drives home its enthralling factor. The story of the people, who saw the monster coming from a distance, makes you want to plunge in the bandwagon too, but alas the procession is long gone and recession pervades. It gives you a sense of contentment to see the hefty checks protagonists managed to weave out of a disaster. It is inspirational in a way and makes you want to get instant rich too. Well, you can do that! Just be a genius and watch out for such loopholes in the system."

","The Big Short is the riveting true story of the financial crises of 2008, with Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, and Brad Pitt. I will be honesty, the film is very economically wordy and hard to understand, even if the film itself tries to make it simpler. But that could be my age. Even though you may not get everything going on, you can get the rough gist, but you will not find yourself bored during the film.<br/><br/>As well as the story the film is uniquely structured with breaking of the fourth wall, effective editing, and cinematography that gives the film a documentary feel, to make the story more real. So the film is really enjoyable to watch even if it is very talky. It even contains fun cameos of popular celebs to make a social atmosphere of the film. It also features great performances by Bale and Carell, who really demonstrate a clear believable characters.<br/><br/>Even if your aware or not of the event, you will really be stunned by the story, from how it started to how it develops and how it ends, and the film really suggests this through the soundtrack, and mood.<br/><br/>Although I wouldn't say that it is a must see, but definitely deserves praise, and will be enjoyed by people who are fond of biographical films, business related.<br/><br/>The Big Short is a strong 8/10 and a very remarkable film to watch."
"DoubleOscar","10","1","2","12 February 2016"," Nothing Short of Fantastic
","Directed by Adam McKay, whose past movies have been straight up comedies, albeit good comedies, I didn't know what to expect when going into this film. I have a good general knowledge of financial terminology and of the housing crisis in general, but after watching this movie, I realize that there was so much I actually didn't know about, or knew but was wrong about. I can see how to many people, much of the information presented in the film is going to fly over their heads because it is a bunch of jargon about numbers and financial situations, but to me it was fascinating. <br/><br/>Adam McKay does a fantastic job adapting Michael Lewis' book to what I believe to be the simplest way to put the information given. Furthermore, he manages to blend a sense of outrage and sorrow for what happened to people with his signature clever and straightforward humor. Furthermore, the sense of outrage is carried on throughout the movie almost as an undercurrent to every joke, like there is some twisted double meaning behind every man and his decisions. This rage is best expressed in Steve Carrel's character who, ironically, needs to go to anger management courses to deal with those feelings. Along with Steve Carrel's character (who in my opinion is the best performance), there are fantastic performances from Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and even more unknowns like Hamish Linklater.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is its very quick-footed pace. It's as though the movie is racing to find out as much as it can before the inevitable crash happens. While other may find this pace annoying and hard to keep up, to me I was so tuned in to everything said that the pace just escalated my enjoyment. The film loses a little steam at the end, but that's only because the tone turns darker and much more serious. <br/><br/>Overall, The Big Short is a very important film, a scathingly funny film that raises awareness about a crisis that most people might only have known at the surface level. It's one of the most enthralling films of the year as well as one of the most entertaining. Expect some awards come Oscar season."
"lisacarlson","10","1","2","30 January 2016"," A Must See
","Based on the serious book by author Michael Lewis; director, screenwriter Adam McKay turns a complicated subject on it's head creating a visual stunner of humor and knowledge. The housing collapse in 2008 was foreseen by a few very smart people who were completely ignored by all the other greedy people working in the financial world. For anyone effected by what happened you should be outraged by what was done. It's Steve Carrell who steals the show from the other talented actors in this movie. It's one of his best performances. It's easy to see why this movie has been winning awards as its relevance for future markets and generations to come can't be denied. It's the subject matter few people really want to discuss especially those who cheated the system and got away with it."
"christopher-underwood","6","1","2","30 January 2016"," fictionalised documentary that trivialises
","I'm not quite sure what I expected from this film or why I was vaguely drawn towards it but I think I expected something like Get Shorty, with a great and wildly funny script and at the same time an insight into an industry i probably knew less than i though about. Instead this is very much a fictionalised documentary that trivialises a massive moment in our recent past. This is only eight years ago for goodness sake, most of us surely remember the horrors. People queuing to take their money out of Northern Rock before it collapsed, my own RBS pension with doubts hanging over it as my bank hovered on the brink. It is interesting to note that though most of the US comments are most favourable a rather large number of foreign language reviews are not. The US came out of this rather well (I know a lot of people lost their homes though this is barely mentioned in the film) - they got their housing market correction and passed all the crap securities to Europe. Instead of looking objectively at this, the film centres on a few privileged oafs and asks us to feel sorry because they might not make the money they wee hoping to out of the mess they were contributing to. The dialogue is fine, the performances are fine but the direction is slack and the editor must have fallen asleep, I know I nearly did!"
"billygoat1071","Null","1","2","25 January 2016"," Enlightening the Issue
","The Big Short tells the story behind the economy collapse in 2008, turning this serious financial tragedy into a rather zippy entertainment that breaks the fourth wall and explaining the audience about how the system works less boring as possible. And fortunately, it indeed works. There is a sense of profoundness in tackling this issue and the movie wholeheartedly puts those details into a fascinating piece of entertainment. Though one might point out that the movie isn't quite subtle at its hate towards the banking system, but the movie acknowledges what really went wrong and that insight is what made it undeniably engrossing.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on five different people; trying to prevent the predicted collapse and prove the fraudulence of the banks. The film is aware that not many are familiar with this financial environment and their jargon, and it would be complicated for them to comprehend. So the movie manages to keep putting up celebrity cameos summing up the details, out of their own metaphor. There's also breaking the fourth wall moments to take things clearer. But what the movie is trying to represent is how the banks have gone greedy and they are responsible on keeping the economy from being stable. Although this is a one sided perspective, it also acknowledges the trouble that the main characters might cause if they sue, expose and just find investors in their endeavor.<br/><br/>In these accounts, the movie portrays them well, especially when their prediction is finally at place. You can really feel everything has fallen apart. The direction is palpably stylish, it cuts to montages of stock photos, footage, etc. that represents what is happening, almost like The Tree of Life or Lucy or something. But you get the picture. The performances are downright entertaining, with Ryan Gosling just does his cool thing. Christian Bale gets a little strange, but he does the work right. Though it's Steve Carell who brought the more compelling arc to the picture.<br/><br/>The Big Short really exceeds expectations, yeah the style gets too gimmicky, but it understands its big picture and delivers it as the audience can follow through. It's something that the film wants to reach this story out on a wider audience, in spite of the overwhelmingly complex language that the market speaks. The direction manages to make it all gripping, while the acting is energetic enough to keep it compelling. The Big Short just lets it all entertaining until things really get devastating."

"Ben_Cap","8","1","2","18 January 2016"," The Big Short comes up big.
","There is no other movie in recent memory that is quite the same as The Big Short. Adam McKay has crafted a well oiled machine of financial lessons and meta comedy, an unlikely duo at that. The Big Short is about the recent financial crisis and more specifically the crash of the housing market and the people that benefited from it. This description makes the lead characters seem like the bad guys, but they were just taking advantage of the misconduct of the banks and the general system of mortgage companies. The way that McKay lays out all of the complicated banker mumbo jumbo into terms that a normal viewer can understand is stunning. I was interested in a topic that had never even crossed my mind before, and by the end credits my head was just buzzing with financial terms that I still had little to no idea about, but was interested to learn more.<br/><br/>The cast is the definition of an ensemble. The true stars of this movie are Steve Carell as Mark Baum, Christian Bale as Michael Burry and Ryan Gosling as Jarred Vennett. Out of these only Bale's character is real but the other are based on real people. Carell is the real standout performance here. He has the perfect blend of comedic and dramatic acting for this role and I think this is where he is at his best. He was a joy to watch and is the moral barometer for the viewer. He is trying to do what we the viewer would hope to do in his position, make the corrupt banks pay for their crimes and making a load of money for the trouble. Bale and Gosling hold their own bolstered by a few more performances that round out one of the best casts of the year including John Magaro as Charlie Geller, Finn Wittrock as Jamie Shipley and Brad Pitt as Ben Rickert. The strength of the ensemble cast reminded me of another cast this year, Spotlight, and that is pretty good company to be in.<br/><br/>Adam McKay has always been a good directer who knows comedy and how to get great performances out of large casts of actors. This is without a doubt his best effort so far. The pacing of the movie was outstanding, an area of some of McKay's movies that I have thought lacked. It moves fast and jumps long stretches of time with short pop culture montages of the time that has passed. The actors will frequently turn right to the camera and talk directly to the audience, which some may find frustrating but as someone who continued to get lost in the stock trader lingo, it felt nice to fell like the characters were there to hit pause and help explain some of the more complicated portions. McKay brought over some comedy tricks with the camera to help the movie out. At times the direction seemed scattered and even poorly done, but this does two things. One it inherently makes things funnier when the camera randomly zooms in or starts filming something seemingly unimportant. It also makes the viewer feel like the characters in the movie. They don't know what exactly is going on, it makes the viewer feel like they are right there in the board room hearing all this crazy stuff first hand.<br/><br/>The writing is a great blend of Michael Lewis style number crunching and information gathering, and a comedic twist as to avoid extreme boredom for the normal viewer. The writing is witty and fast paced and perfectly book ended by a nice financial lesson. It was an incredibly smart choice to add the comedy element to the movie and McKay and Charles Randolph have made a script that is not just compelling and interesting, but also one of the funniest movie of the year.<br/><br/>The Big Short addresses an issue that just about every American dealt with. It was one of the most important events in American history and still very few people know what happened. This movie is the perfect way to learn exactly why the economy of this country failed and how people will do anything they can to make money even if it may be disruptive in the future. It is a movie that does not hold back and tells the story it believes is the one that needs to be told, not necessarily the best story. There are twists and turns that you will not expect, but it does not need to surprise you or have some sort of twist ending, it lets the incompetence of the banks do that. If you are in any way interested in this movie it is a must see and for any movie fan is it certainly worth the watch."

At first, as you begin to sink into the movie, you as a viewer, are not fully convinced that this mash up works or will work. Alas, as you go further, you realize that it is practically flawless. Why did Adam McKay use this genre in my opinion? Because with the story and script of the movie, it fits perfectly. The proof is that for such a seemingly boring calamity to be portrayed in such fluidity and class and entertainment, it requires the work of a master. And not only is Adam McKay the master here, but also the script writers and the actors. Watch it, enjoy it and learn in many ways."

","The man behind ""Anchorman"" and ""Step Brothers"" brings you  one of the best films of the year ? Seems ridiculous, but you could make a case for it to be true. Adam McKay's ""The Big Short,"" based on the book by Michael Lewis (also of ""The Blinds Side"" and ""Moneyball""), is a comical tragedy about the men who saw our economy propped up on bad mortgage loans and bet against the banks, thereby cashing in on the economic crisis of 2008.<br/><br/>It's easy enough to make a slick business film full of powerhouse performances from great actors playing charismatic slime ball characters — take ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" for example — and in many ways McKay tries to make that flashy sort of drama, but on the other hand, ""The Big Short"" isn't about crime and corruption (of the main characters, at least), it's about discovering just how deep a bad system goes and what's at stake for not just the characters, but the country.<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" follows three different story lines of individuals who discovered the truth and bought credit default swaps from the banks, giving them millions, knowing that if the loans defaulted, they'd make a killing: Dr. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), the oddball hedge fund manager who wears shorts and no shoes to work that made the discovery; Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), a trader who learns what Burry's doing and engages hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his team, who are known for their distrust of the system; and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Witrock), two young and inexperienced investors who discover what Vennett is doing and enlist the help of retired banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) so they can trade at such a high level.<br/><br/>The characters aren't anywhere near as complicated as the financial concepts driving the plot. What McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph do best with this script is make it user-friendly. There's no possible way for someone not in this business to understand every financial concept at work, but McKay and Randolph utilize various methods to help communicate that information, including celebrity cameos explaining the most difficult concepts and a character-narrator in Gosling's Jared Vennett who breaks the fourth wall to help clue the audience in at different points throughout the film.<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" plays out like a procedural or a mystery, particularly when Baum's team goes out looking for proof to back up the numbers and theories. They dig deeper and we discover alongside them just what lengths the banks have gone to to sweep this problem under the rug and just how hard the economy could fall. This journey is full of humor, especially generated by the demeanors of Bale, Gosling and especially Carell's characters.<br/><br/>McKay also supplements the story with all manner of techniques, from the more overt and flashy to the subtle and dramatic. Most of what he goes for sticks, but a lot of it falls flat, or feels forced or purposeless. There's some unnecessary use of montage and forced B-roll to go with Gosling's narration. ""The Big Short"" is really at its best when McKay steps back and lets the actors take over.<br/><br/>These are total characters — as in full of comical neuroses. What do you expect to happen when you give the likes of Christian Bale a character description that includes being anti-social, into heavy metal drumming and a glass eye? It's like watching an eccentric artist given free reign to do anything he or she wants. Bale doesn't go off the deep end — his character actually has some of the quieter and better dramatic moments of the film, but it's hard to call what he or any of the actors do in this film inspired or surprising.<br/><br/>Carell is the true standout as Baum, a character whose natural inclinations are to speak out inappropriately and go against the grain, who is happiest when he's miserable and yet whose moral convictions are sound and resolute. Quirky, loud characters are in Carell's wheelhouse, yet he gives Baum a complexity and nuance that makes the role rather transformative. More importantly, Carell swings from comedy to drama effortlessly in this film with a truly committed performance.<br/><br/>The entire film swings from comedy to drama, which is really what makes ""The Big Short"" succeed. We spend so much time waiting for the payoff — literally in terms of when the characters' investments pay off and figuratively in terms of the narrative — yet there really is none. We get so wound up in the story and McKay catches us; when the scope of the film widens again, reminding us that the success of the main characters equates to the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the film becomes a meaningfully sobering experience. It's anti-climactic, but in the right way. It would be wrong to give us the Hollywood ending to the glossy business comedy and McKay nails that reversal of tone.<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is bit of a messy collage of storytelling tactics and tones, but it is imminently watchable thanks to its sensitivity to the subject and the caliber of big- time performances that the movies are all about. It's a film that will surely hold up well with repeated viewings and perhaps even get better.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

"imdmt","9","1","2","6 January 2016"," A little short of perfection
","If you knew how to tie your shoes during the 2008 recession, you need to eventually see The Big Short. Adam McKay shows a whole new set of skills in this film, while also remaining true to his forever-to-be-remembered comedic genius. Mckay is able to squeeze a load of humor into a subject that is so serious (and tragic) without coming across as offensive. He surprises me most by simultaneously being able to convey said seriousness and tragedy, as well as explain all the details of the highly confusing subject matter at a level of which someone without any finance background can understand.<br/><br/>Surely the general audience of this film is more of the older adult population (whether intended or not). Yet, Mckay's decision of fast paced quick-cut editing and addition of young pop-culture references opens this film up to nearly anyone (with the exception of the R rating, of course). I will also add that the (VERY) fast-paced editing helps distract the audience from its slower story. <br/><br/>I have a love/hate relationship with the ending of the film, in which Mckay does an amazing job exemplifying the emotion and hypocrisy of those BEHIND the collapse. However, it was the depiction of those truly affected, those mostly watching this film, that I found a bit corny and underwhelming. Then again, if he were able to capture the emotion of hundreds of millions of people into one film, he would be the God of filmmaking. <br/><br/>Coming from one of the millions of families that were heavily affected by the 2008 recession, The Big Short helps put to rest my anxieties and questions about what had happened to us. On the same note, it also brings upon more (healthy) anxieties of the future, reminding us all to stay aware and ready for the ever-changing economy we live under. All in all, it left me feeling simply and insignificantly human. Depending on your self-perception before going into this film, that may or may not be a good thing. Powerful, nonetheless."
"asfand000","9","1","2","4 January 2016"," Brilliantly complicated and definitive in its financial assessment of the 2008 crisis
","This is a story about the greed centered financial system of the world, with the U.S.A. being at the center. It tells how this greed machine worked itself into the depths of a global recession. But unlike other movies that have come out on the 2008 mortgage crisis, this one does not focus on the after effects and the human suffering but rather gives a very erudite and somewhat esoteric view of the crisis; highlighting the causes, decisions, events that led to the crisis--the absolutely shocking, disgusting and lamentable deliberateness of the stake holders and apathy of the regulators.<br/><br/>The cast (Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt among others) is top notch and the movie is interesting and well edited albeit a little complicated if you want to hang on to every word and understand it. But this comes off as a thoroughly researched and responsible film, which voices its displeasure at the atrocious behavior that caused so much global suffering.<br/><br/>This is a must watch and surely one of the best movies of the year."

The short takes, constantly moving camera, and rapid motion that are fashionable in the industry today are just unnecessary.

"Quinoa1984","8","2","8","24 December 2015"," who knew Adam McKay wanted to be... Oliver Stone(!) a fiery polemic
","Yep, this really happened - or at least some of it, some of the time, with celebrities breaking the fourth wall (one of them in a bathtub!) not included - the banks, wall street, mortgage casino-rollers f***ed this country out of lots and lots of money. Trillions of dollars lost, in fact, gone in the air like some fart in the wind. The Big Short could easily have been a documentary, and some of the editing reflect that; this is often cut together in staccato, rapid-fire, sort of floating-over-a-place-and-mind style that one can see in many Oliver Stone movies from the 90's. It's hard not to see it, and one may think it borderlines homage and just ripping-off for the sake of this narrative. But then again this shouldn't necessarily be a story told with subtlety - or, rather, there is already a film that has some fire in its belly but is more subdued, 2011's Margin Call, which is about much of the same material as here but contained in one 24 hour period. The Big Short is an epic story of how a group of people saw that our country was going in a bad, bad direction... and saw to profit from it.<br/><br/>Are guys like Jared Vennett and Michael Burry, MD (can't forget the MD), and Mark Baum guys to root for? That's sort of the provocative point of the movie, and I'm sure was a cornerstone of the book (also from the author of Moneyball, which was also about rigging the system for the favor of the main subjects). The movie goes into further depth about it, but in short: the economy collapsed in 2008 (no s***), but there were signs that there was a housing bubble, in spite of what many economists and the press saw. It was all build on the ""sub-prime"" mortgages - this is where the joke explanation via bathtub comes in, but one should be able to get the gist without it - basically they were crap mortgages given to people who couldn't afford to pay per month. And it wasn't just one or two or ten, it was thousands bundled together, all these homes put together. So what did people like Burry and Baum, who had investors for their company, decide to do after some investigating into the numbers? Bet against the system - put up 'shorts' so that, if/when the sub-primes went bad, they'd reap the benefits in millions - billions, really.<br/><br/>In a sense it's like watching the lessor of the evils of the finance world. These guys work in high finance and the world of stocks, but they aren't exactly stockbrokers (Brad Pitt's character, who advises two young hedge-fund wannabe-richers, is out of the stock game and more into fresh seeds, a slightly underwritten character but Pitt's presence makes up for it somewhat). They were on the outside and maybe, kind of, sort of, had a conscience about it near the end. While watching the trailer one may think Christian Bale is the main character - certainly the qurkiest with his ""Super-Cuts haircut and no shoes"" as one of his colleagues observes, it's really an ensemble, with Baum given, to me, the most depth of anyone.<br/><br/>To be sure, Carell is acting his head off here, but he's given a juicy part to play; it's the opposite of the inert, super-weird DuPont from Foxcatcher, as he is fiery, mouthy, ready to complain and speak without any filter. He's also racked by grief from a dead brother who he feels guilt about not saving, and keeps going with his plot to make these credit-default swaps (basically a gamble on the mortgages not working out), and the s*** gets deeper once it gets into those dreaded things called CDO's. It helps that we get to see a character like Baum, and to an extent Berry (though he sort of fades as a smaller presence in the second half of the story), because McKay's style as a director is super kinetic and rapid-fire charged. Almost, one could say, too much.<br/><br/>This is editing that is hyper and bouncing off into different cross-sections; a character may talk about something in the world and McKay and his editors show it, briefly, or maybe more, or we see other things going on in a room in flashes. Like Stone, he's going full-hog into showing the way a mind may bounce around and sort of stream-of-conscious about a place or theme. Other times he can calm down enough to just keep it on the actors, but there's still a nervous energy to how he's keeping the shots, things moving about from one angle to another, the hand-held and the zooms moving about to such a rhythm that is not sloppy (I should hope anyway after so many films under his belt, albeit comedies up till now). It kept me on edge, but that's the right choice for this material; it's angering and heart-breaking and, unless you've lived under a rock for the past ten years, know that things went seriously, seriously wrong just across the board from banks to Lehman and Goldman and (come on!) rating agencies and the government.<br/><br/>It may be looked at as manipulative just by how it frames its messages. I don't even know if it'll be a film I'll revisit more than once or twice because of the intense emotions and thoughts it brought back to me. But it's an important film all the same, and that it contains some excellent work from Carell and Bale, and some serviceable stuff from Gosling and Pitt and a few others, makes it worth seeing. Just decide over the Christmas holiday if getting riled up about the financial crash and lots and lots and LOTS of unadalterated greed and presented like a buckshot blast to the solar plexus is your cup of tea."

","Everyone remembers the housing bubble and financial collapse of the mid 2000's certainly 2007 and 2008 as the news made shock waves. Yet most revealing was how the government and the finance world of corporate insider trading became the norm with a scheme to get rich with greed as collections were made when the housing market would crumble. ""The Big Short"" is a film that is a showcase of this and true it might have fun showing greed still it's a film that stings with guilt and conscious as you see many hard working people lose it all from money to homes all the big corporate people and inside investors profit from their losses. As the insider traders have a world of finance credit and housing bubble greed that's all tied to the big banks. The film seems real like and made to be believed with the work from actors Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, and Ryan Gosling. ""The Big Short"" is one showcase that even though is a tease it proves that it's good not to put trust in government, banks, or finance companies as the little guys get crushed showing the world as one big corrupt mess."

","This was worth watching, but at points is rather painful to get through. I thought the actors and actresses chosen, and their portrayals, are the let down. In the style of Family Guy, there are many sub-scenes within a scene giving context. However, the scene with Margo Robbie in a hot tub explaining things seemed exploitative and forced rather than trendy, which is what they were aiming for. Of course, this is Hollywood, so they try to give you only half the explanation for what happened. I mean, as a biopic, it does OK, but not every minor detail is 100%. But in Hollywood, they try the little guy vs evil, greedy businessman routine, which got old. Steve Carell falls flat, as does Ryan Gosling. They're all kind of robotic. Brad Pitt's brief role is always welcome. The problem is, you will compare this in your mind to much better movies of a similar style. It has the feel of a grade-school video lecture. I don't understand why I'm always at odds with the critics, but that's my take. I can't quite call it a full-blown schmooze-fest movie."

This isn't cute or funny the way it sounds, it's satirical and sad because of how absurd the whole thing was. Combined with wonderful performances, by Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, the story becomes enjoyable and not as boring as the film admits the story to be in the beginning. On the other hand, I couldn't help but feel that the film was emotionally inconsistent. I am not suggesting that films of this nature should be balanced. Sure, there's always drama in satire but the dramatic scenes of the film were not enough to warrant themselves in respect with the whole. There should have been better management of these scenes so that either they are balanced, or they are so imbalanced that they become more than they seem. I haven't read the book, but the film is well-made and worth a watch."

","The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay and stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>A noticeable 'bubble' underneath the US housing market has been realised by Michael Burry. He believes that in the next few years this bubble will burst. The Big Short tells the story of the guys that decide to take on the banks for their greed and lack of foresight.<br/><br/>Most people hate these types of movies. They say they're all a bunch of gibberish and that they're boring. Adam McKay has done something great here, he's done something like Scorsese did with The Wolf Of Wall Street. He made it tragically funny. It's obvious that he was going to bring some comedic value to the table after his previous work with Will Ferrell. I only ever found Step Brothers funny, though. I felt with the others he tried too hard. That's probably due to my distaste in Ferrell's work, however. So I'm happy to finally say that there's another Adam McKay film that I actually like. This is brilliant.<br/><br/>The screenplay is written with seriousness in mind, yet playful when the mood gets too heavy. The casting is perfect. Christian Bale acts as a strange and confusing businessman who has trouble communicating face-to-face. Ryan Gosling breaks the 4th wall to keep the audience engaged and up to speed. In fact, many of the characters do from time to time. McKay decided to bring in actors such as Margot Robbie to explain what is happening, as a means to prove that these businessmen just use technical terms to seem like they are the only ones who can do their job. Selena Gomez appeared as one of the many cameos in this film, and she was surprisingly good. Brad Pitt was great as Ben Rickert, who lives away from it all and grows his own vegetables. He likes to talk about it a lot. These main characters are all brilliant, but there's some charm in the supporting cast, too. John Magaro brings an undeniably strong performance to the film and shines whenever he appears on screen. Finn Wittrock, too. They both share some notable chemistry. <br/><br/>Music by Nicholas Britell is pretty good. I felt it only really aided the film in the final act, nothing stood out to me before that point. There were some nice piano melodies, however. <br/><br/>I'd like to comment on the editing of this film. I thought it was handled really well. It felt loose and choppy, but not in a bad way. I actually found it entertaining to watch, along with the sounds that were used, especially in scenes with Bale as Burry. Very quick and disjointed but not distracting or jolting. Barry Ackroyd shot a lot of the scenes of dialogue with close, intimate angles. Very personal and unique. The whole film is shot like a documentary, with the sharp zooming and characters talking to the audience. I love this kind of filmmaking. It feels like you're in the room and part of the conversation. Engaging work.<br/><br/>My verdict; The Big Short is one of those films that just work. The last time I enjoyed a film in this genre was back in 2013, with The Wolf Of Wall Street. So far I'm very happy with how the year has started. Many great films are being made and fortunately being recognised by critics and award organisations alike. Let's hope The Big Short continues with its spree of wins. <br/><br/>The Big Short, 9/10."

With the exception of Brad Pitt, whose character is not very well written, I saw only the characters being portrayed, not the actors portraying them.<br/><br/>The only problem, for me - and this might be condescending on my part - is that I don't believe this movie will make much of any sense to those who have not read up on all the complicated and, frankly, dishonest financial tricks that led to the Recession. The explanations provided, though very clever, all go past so fast that I don't know who could make sense of them if they did not already understand the situation.<br/><br/>This is not a warm, fuzzy movie. The characters are either pompous or very self-centered. There isn't really a likable one in the crowd. but then, these were the men who played with the nation's finances, not just with other peoples' money but with other peoples' lives, as if they were just pieces on a game board.<br/><br/>As the movie points out at the end, only one person went to jail for all this inhuman activity.

","Boasting a star cast of Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt & others, all put together in an interesting story about the financial crisis of 2007-2010 that nearly crippled the world economy, plus regularly allowing its characters to break the fourth wall in order to explain the complexities of financial market to the audience, The Big Short is insightful but also messy at times.<br/><br/>Based on the book of the same name, the film intercuts multiple story lines and concerns the people who predicted the credit & housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s but, after witnessing the corruption within banks plus its lack of foresight, decided to bet against the market and profited enormously when it all went down while majority of population lost its lifetime's worth of savings.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Adam McKay, The Big Short features a highly fascinating subject matter for there are still many around who were affected by the crisis that triggered the great recession yet aren't entirely aware of what exactly caused it & how. While McKay keeps his characters ready to simplify the complex terms of economy, the characters inhabiting this story themselves lack an interesting dimension.<br/><br/>The script attempts to juggle multiple subplots but hits a few barricades in the process for it lacks a smooth flow due to muddled editing. Camera-work is a bit chaotic and although the pace at which it all unfolds is consistent, the transition from one subplot to another isn't. As far as performances go, only Carell leaves a lasting impression while Bale, Gosling & Pitt are unexpectedly underwhelming in their given roles and just play along.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Big Short is an in-depth examination of the global financial crisis which is driven by McKay's kinetic direction, deftly written screenplay & fancy performances from its entire cast. Informative, investigative & entertaining yet requiring some effort from its viewers who need to keep up with its swiftly-paced, dialogue-driven narrative, the film tries to bring its complex tale to a more accessible level yet required a bit more transparency.

","This film tells a 2008's real story of how banks and governments make people indebted while promising them fair revenues over their investments before the global financial crisis. Everything starts at the bottom of American society where richness means just hard work used to build a house brick by brick paid with daily salaries. Those houses became the sole basis of the financial system when mortgages were bought in exchange for a substantial payback. When people start not paying those mortgages the entire people's savings system collapsed. In the end, the financial system has kept quite the same feeding its mechanism with new fuel: land and water.

","Yes, it this movie is fast paced, fascinating characters well acted and it made a difficult subject understandable.
However the overwhelming point of view of the film makers permeated the movie. Bankers, Mortgage lenders, investment firms, and all of Wall Street are not only greedy, avaricious but really stupid to boot!
There was no balance in the film outlining other causes such as the government's role in this debacle. Starting with Bill Clinton, his administration pushed for more minority home ownership by encouraging not enforcing usual lending practices such as down payments and income to debt ratios. Next, through congressional legislation, banking businesses were encouraged to weaken or toss out normal lending practice standards and norms. In addition, most of the loans were made by private businesses and they were not subject to government regulation. Since normal practices were not used, indeed it was a bomb waiting to go off.
A statement repeated several times at the last 10 minutes of the movie that was that in the aftermath, now the usual suspects--"" the poor and the immigrants"" were going to be and were blamed.""
I really think that is a complete overstatement. There are many causes of this devastating event and many people had a part in it spanning a long period of time. This film doesn't deal with the complexity of causes at all, just states some cliche bromides and leaves it at that.
It was enthralling, moved at a good pace, had interesting characters but overall I am disappointed in the simplistic approach."

","The Big Short attempts to turn the story of global economic collapse into light-hearted fare, with the occasional pain and insight that people have lives and feelings that get hurt. Intelligent investors hypocritically profiteer at what they see as the end of capitalism, blaming greedy bankers. But there's no analysis of the total entrenchment of capitalism in the global economy, and how centuries of greed, corruption, and profiteering brought us to the brink.<br/><br/>Inside Job was a much more meaningful warning about rampant capitalism and government complicity, without the need to sugarcoat any details. The Big Short's lighthearted tone seems to defeat its purpose. And being told that credit default swaps are not that complicated, because even B-list celebrities can explain them, is trite.<br/><br/>The movie's shaky cam, overuse of stills, and incessant breaking of the fourth wall destroy the pace and make you think it would be better enjoyed as part of a live Twitter feed. And whatever moral dilemmas the characters face, it's easy to see nothing compares to the undeniable truth of capitalism: people prefer two dollars over one.<br/><br/>Maybe the reason there are no African-American Oscar nominations for acting is because the movies of 2015 (consider also Spotlight and Mad Max: Fury Road) show that the world is being screwed over royally by white people.<br/><br/>When the aliens land and discover our societal ruins, they will at least have access to our movie archives, and they will say, ""At least they had fun destroying themselves."""

The big name actors in this could have done better. That doesn't mean they were bad. They were good, just I expected better. The entire movie I kept thinking of them as themselves playing characters instead of forgetting they were actors and thinking the movie was a real portrayal. Also, during the movie they would have random images pop up that did not stream well or fluently together. It was like they went through a stock photography website or a google images search page and downloaded a bunch of random images and put them in the movie to fill up time and to save money. Also, I did not like the camera work. It was very distracting to the story line. The entire movie was very flashy and spastic. It was the movie version of someone with ADD or ADHD. The flashing images and jumping from scene to scene, not to mention the camera work, started giving me a headache. Not to mention, the movie was very condescending and patronizing a lot of the time to the point of obnoxiousness. So I did not like this movie for a multitude of reasons, however, I did sit through the whole thing, which says a lot, because I am pretty hyperactive myself.

"souplipton","7","1","4","25 December 2015"," A Good Script, but Beyond the Capabilities of McKay
","The Big Short is a comedy film about financial outsiders who foresaw the economic collapse of 2007/2008, and bet on the downfall of the banks. A true-life story, the film outlines three different groups that predicted the collapse, and uses their story to guide the audience through the causes of the recession. This lesson about how the American public was, for lack of a better (or appropriate) word, screwed by the system on Wall St. is the film's real purpose.<br/><br/>The films strengths are in its cast, story, humour, and cameos (used to ease the difficult explanations). The cast is very strong, especially Bale and Carrell. Pitt, who produced the film, does a good job, but doesn't feature heavily in the film. Gosling also does an excellent job in his role, but not quite on Bale's level. Gosling's talent is wasted on this role, and the film may have benefited by giving Bale a larger part. The story is a strength, mostly because it's relevant, as the impact of the recession is still felt today. Though the subject matter is serious, the film is still a comedy, and so laughs are important. The film is very funny, so it's a success on those grounds, but it's not drop dead hilarious, so don't expect a comedy masterpiece. The film's final strength, and perhaps it's most impressive accomplishment, is in its ability to explain the necessary financial concepts without losing the audience. This is achieved by breaks in the action during which the concepts are explain by celebrities in fun, unrelated, cameos. Keeping the audience involved while explaining mortgage-backed securities is difficult, and making these moments entertaining is a true feat.<br/><br/>However, the film's biggest flaw is in parts of Adam McKay's direction. The montage sequences and some of the instances of quick-cutting really annoyed me, taking me out of the film, and I can't think of anything that these would have added. The quotes at key points in the film broke up the flow, and though I enjoyed one of the quotes, they didn't fit with the film. Parts of Baum's back story also felt shoehorned in, and the interaction with the tenant in Florida (though a necessary scene) felt very hammy in its execution. McKay shows some potential working with the film's more substantial subject matter, but his lack of experience in this area shows at time.<br/><br/>Overall, the film does a good job of entertaining, and of educating, it's audience. Fun, informative, and pretty accessible given the complex concepts, The Big Short delivers on most of its promise, but could have improved had McKay had slightly more seasoning before taking on the project."
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","4","24 December 2015"," An Era of Fraud
","In what is probably 2015 best ensemble piece alongside Spotlight, The Big Short also turns out to be one of the best films of the year. Focusing on the 2008 financial crisis, The Big Short takes a different approach to the crisis than the 2011 film, Margin Call, in that this deals with 4 very different people in their route to take down the banks when they predicted the downfall a few years prior.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the cast is phenomenal. Sure, you have Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt, Christian Bale being unrecognizably good, Ryan Gosling bringing humor and charm, and Steve Carell nearly stealing the entire film, but the supporting cast also deliver formidable performances all around. Everyone from Melissa Leo, Karen Gillian, and Max Greenfield, all the way to the great cameos that help serve the story, do a phenomenal job. <br/><br/>They aren't just throwaway cameos either, Adam McKay uses them is a uniquely comedic way. Being that this story involves big financial terms and phrases that may be confusing and boring to some (the film acknowledges that), the film takes a break and explains to us what's happening using a celebrity in dummy form.<br/><br/>This film is a drama by definition, but there's a large comedic presence to the film that balances it out really well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering McKay's previous directorial efforts, but it was still refreshing to see, especially in an Oscar bait type of film.<br/><br/>If nothing else, these types of films are a wake up call to ensure this doesn't happen again. I knew a little bit about the crisis beforehand, and while this film didn't make my jaw drop in terms of new information, I did leave the theater knowing a lot more than I did prior. I'm sure it will get plenty of Oscar attention with hopeful nominations to Bale, Carell, and McKay. Definitely check out The Big Short<br/><br/>+Tremendous cast<br/><br/>+McKay's writing and directing drove the film<br/><br/>+Self aware<br/><br/>+Balance of comedy and drama<br/><br/>9.2/10"

In fact, govt. intervention is what helped get us in the position to begin. And allowed the banks to be bailed out by tax dollars later. Liberal politicians created an environment of lending that made it possible to have such risky loans because of anti- discrimination rules. Basically forcing lenders to loan to poor and bad credit customers. <br/><br/>There was also the much under-associated effect that the spike in gas prices had. Remember the price of everything from milk to pizza delivery increased because of additional fuel surcharges?<br/><br/>Anyway, this was just not a very good film but was an interesting subject and, although limited in its exploration of the root causes of the ""great recession"", pretty accurate on the narrow reasoning it presented. <br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=14158447"

Perhaps this is out of ignorance of not knowing, but The Big Short does a superb job at giving us the back story of the 2008 collapse. I am very impressed with Adam McKay's approach to this movie (an example of how directors can change for the better). The editing is frenetic, going beyond viewer expectations and making you feel annoyed by the numerous freeze frames, the sudden faults with the sound, and so on. The acting is impeccable (particularly from Steve Carrel and Christian Bale). The script is intelligent, riotous, slick, and brutally honest. There are creative ways to explain how this industry works to people like me who do not know a lot about banking and Wall Street. People are going to try to compare this to Wolf of Wall Street, but it's very different. To be 100% honest, though, this is going to be a half and half for people.

","""The Big Short"" has an unsexy plot, the banking crisis of 2008. Directed by Adam McKay and based on the book of the same name plus the subtitle ""Inside the Doomsday Machine"", we follow different people in the business with one very particular thing in common: they foresee the coming crisis. Christian Bale as the Asperger-like heavy metal fan of a hedge fund operator Michael Burry, and Steve Carrell as the fumingly unstable and neurotic Mark Baum are arguably the main stars of this financial drama. They do get some very nice support from others such as Brad Pitt disguised in a beard, a black haired Ryan Gosling, and a soft-spoken Marisa Tomei. The whole cast does a great job, and each character is distinguishable from the others, making no one in the ensemble feel excessive. ""The Big Short"" moves fast and if you stop paying attention for a short moment, it'll be hard keeping up with the rest of the plot. Using business terms, it's crucial to always stay focused, meaning it's not one of those lay back and enjoy kind of movies. Overall, it is a well-written movie, but the New Yorker top of the chain business men cliches are somewhat tiresome. The way the characters talk have been seen numerous times on film before and ""The Bit Short"" could benefit from using another type of language or attitude at times. Finally, a shout out should be made to John Magaro and Finn Wittrock playing the aspiring duo behind the Brownfield Fund who teams up with Brad Pitt's character. These three should definitely have had more screen time as their storyline is the most enjoyable in this big banking thriller."

","The Big Short is a film everyone should watch at least once in their life due to the film's attempt of tackling and watering down the rocket science of America's housing and stock market. The whole film shows the slow but lethal rise in housing mortgages which began in the 1970s and was the most dangerous during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis.<br/><br/>To put it simply, this film is confusing, a little too confusing, but nonetheless, still very enjoyable because of the acting and storytelling. The star of the film for me is Steve Carrell, his best acting in my opinion is put on display in this film. The Big Short was able to make the transition of Steve, the goofy man-child in The Office and The 40-year old Virgin, to his stern gritty self in Foxcatcher and The Big Short. Alongside Carrell, Bale, Gosling and Pitt deliver very good performances of their real-life counterparts..<br/><br/>Even when the film employed star cameos such as Selena Gomez playing poker to Margot Robbie in a bathtub sipping champagne simplifying Triple-A stocks in the hopes to somehow grab our attention, we still watch the scenes with a big 'wtf' in the back of our head. Some people will not like this film for the reason that it is too much work and effort to understand on the go. I even had trouble myself understanding the context fully while watching but because of outstanding dialogue and great acting, I kept on going for the 2hr 10mim. That is the real magic of this film, showcasing an actor's ability in delivering stellar performances with a subject not familiar very well with the general consensus.

","In short, the truth is difficult to watch. As the film aptly puts: ""Truth is like poetry. And most people f...ing hate poetry"". This film is, more or less, the truth.<br/><br/>What 'The Big Short' does well, among many things including casting, pacing, and humour, is reveal a version of the truth to the wider public. It penetrates the psyche of viewers in a way which conventional media cannot. It tells you that the world economy was built on an irrational lie. It prompts you to consider what you believe. It asks you to consider whether you know the truth, or simply a version of it. The Big Short does all these things, and yet its not perfect.<br/><br/>You may be incensed that this event occurred, however this film does not provide the full impact of the Global Financial Crisis. It misses a beat in displaying the human cost. With the exception of Mark Baum (Steve Carrell), its difficult to relate to any of the leading roles. Maybe this is the point; to isolate and scapegoat the world of Wall Street. Or maybe its not. Either way, its difficult to relate with many of the stories the film represents.<br/><br/>The Big Short undoubtedly brings the events of 2007-9 into sharp focus, and reminds audiences to consider the shady world of global finance. However, like the film clearly identifies, its not always the easiest film to watch. Does it create an effective feature? Yes. Does it do this perfectly? No. However, it remains a relevant film in the age of the global economy.<br/><br/>And that's the truth."

","The Big Short is simply an outstanding film. I wanted to go to the top of a cliff and shout that good intelligent films were still being made. The trouble is it is a long drive for me before I can get to a nice cliff.<br/><br/>I remember talking to my business bank manager in 2004 and telling him that there were people who were buying houses that had risen in value by over 300% in the last few years. These people were getting mortgages to buy these houses and their wages had not gone up by anything like 300%. The multiples for the wages/mortgage ratio did not add up.<br/><br/>The bank manager who worked for his bank for decades since he left college told me not to worry. There would be no housing crash as they had learned the lesson of the early 1990s when the housing market last overheated. He was right, this time it was different, his bank went bust and had to bailed out. He still would not admit to his bank's stupidity or negligence.<br/><br/>What should be a snoozefest about the financial meltdown of 2007/08 due to bad mortgage lending is made exhilarating and informative because the filmmakers use celebrities to coherently explain the financial concepts at the centre of this film.<br/><br/>The star studded cast includes three Oscar winners. Dr Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedge fund manager at Scion Capital. A qualified doctor who likes to drum to loud music, he doesn't like wearing shoes, is socially awkward and he has a glass eye. Burry discovers that the housing mortgage market is riddled with bad loans and bets against it. His action scares his own investors.<br/><br/>Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) is the narrator of this film. He admits he is not altruistic, he did it for the money. He is an investment banker who learned of Burry's bet against the housing market. Vennett also thinks that the subprime mortgage market is vulnerable.<br/><br/>Vennett also wants to bet against the market and persuades Mark Baum (Steve Carell) another socially awkward investor with a strong moral ethic. Baum and his team travel around to see if there is any truth that the subprime mortgage market could fail. They talk to mortgage brokers, people who have taken out loans, people who work in the ratings agencies, dealers that slice and dice the risky bonds full of bad debt. Baum is appalled with what he finds out.<br/><br/>Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley are two small time investors trying to break into the big time who stumble on Vennett's proposals. They too think that Vennett's ideas have substance. However as they are small league they need the help of their neighbour Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired investment bankers for the big banks. Rickert felt the whole financial system was wrong and heading for a fall.<br/><br/>You can view these guys as mavericks, weirdos or even losers. Once they bet against the mortgage market they have a vested interest. They need the banks to fail or else they will lose money.<br/><br/>What they find is that whole system was run by people who had no clue what they were doing, the market was rigged, worse corrupt and they would likely to be bailed out at the end. While the going was good they earned money in commissions and there was plenty of that flowing.<br/><br/>The Big Short was directed and co-written by Adam McKay who is better known comedies. McKay won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He just about contains his anger as to what happened and the price ordinary people paid after the collapse. He lets his film do the talking and there is no need for him to do a polemic. McKay adds comedy to an already intelligent film."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","0","1","22 March 2018"," Occasionally panders but makes its subject matter interesting and even, to an extent, engaging.
","'The Big Short (2015)' takes a unique approach when trying to communicate its complex jargon and ideas - that being that it slots in celebrity cameos wherein the star straight-up tells you the definition of a specific term in the simplest way possible - and what that does is dilute the density of the piece without necessarily dumbing it down. This can occasionally seem like pandering, though, despite that it fits into the flick's overall fast-paced, free-flowing and fourth-wall nudging aesthetic. The picture commendably manages to make the somewhat dry source-material, or rather subject-matter, interesting and even, to an extent, engaging. It focuses on a set of characters that seem realistic and rounded enough to warrant our empathy when they're given the screen time to earn it. The film does become a little too unfocused and slightly cold in the long run, which prevents it from being any more investing than it is. 7/10"

","I do have concerns about this genre of film; portraying real events in film is always a difficult proposition, when the makers want to try to make it entertaining this is where the conflicts between truth and fact become at odds with the entertainment (film) industry. The subject matter is far too complex to cram one story in 2 hours, it would just do the facts no justice at all. To try to run three concurrent stories makes for short on fact and big on spin. With this in mind the film seems to have no identity; It isn't a fact based drama, the actors' quips to camera make it appear like a light hearted thriller – which it is neither. What it is is an interesting watch to wile away 2 hours, but that is it. The performance of Christian Bale was awful, not for one moment did I ever feel that the character was real, his mannerisms in trying to portray Dr. Burry's afflictions were amateur at best and way over the top as to be irritating, every time he stuttered, stammered or pulled a strange face the irritation clicked up another notch. This was one of Christian Bale's worst performances on screen. Steve Carrel should stick to what he does best; comic acting where an OTT performance can add to the film not detract from it; his fixed chaotic hair style just about as irritating as Christian Bales acting, just about...Brad Pitt's performance was also pretty dire, caught between (and failing on both counts) trying to be a Robert Redford look-a-like and neo hippy off grid ex-banker was wasteful of his talents, he should be doing better than a poor cameo role."

","THE BIG SHORT IS BIG ON STORY, BIG ON MONEY, BIG ON PERFORMANCES, and BIG ENTERTAINMENT! (From what I can understand about it)<br/><br/>The Big Short is the dramatic true story of the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis revealing the global market collapse through the eyes of those who saw it coming and figured out ways to profit from it. We also get an inside look into the world of money, greed, Wall Street, business, chaos, corruption and outcast. The films main cast includes, Christian Bale (The Dark Knight Trilogy, American Psycho), Ryan Gosling (Drive, The Nice Guys), Steve Carell (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Seeking a Friend For the End of the World), and Brad Pitt (Fight Club, 12 Years a Slave). The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Step Brothers). Adam McKay may not be the first guy you think of to direct a project like The Big Short. On the other hand, McKay directs a good flick, and brings a nice financial comedy crisis film (is that a thing?) to the public. BATMAN AND BRICK TAMLAND Talking' MONEY?!<br/><br/>For starters, the cast is amazing! Everyone truly does give it their all. Especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell. It was nice to see Steve Carell play a character that isn't similar to Brick Tamland. Between this and Fox catcher, Steve Carell is really becoming one of my favorite serious toned actors, who can really transform themselves in a way we haven't seen. There's something about a angry Steve Carell that makes great entertainment. (Brick Tamland – ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!"")<br/><br/>Now for me, this film was a little confusing at time. However, Adam McKay does a good job of simplifying it for the general audience, and makes us care about something most people find confusing or have little interest in. It's not that I don't care for banking, and how this seriously affected people. It's just the movie is a little lengthy, and it's a ton of numbers, credits, smart people talking, and words that made me pause the movie to look up the definition (man I must sound like an idiot). They even have celebrity cameos to help people like me to understand. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but a popular Australian beauty shows up drinking champagne while sitting in bubble bath, to explain what is going on at that moment. (I hardly understood, but man I wanted to get in on that bubble bath and champagne!)<br/><br/>One thing I really enjoyed were when the characters break the fourth wall to address the viewer(s). It was funny, well written, and once again, made the plot of the movie easier to follow. In my opinion, the direction, writing, characters, and style really work. <br/><br/>So these are my final *Bleeping* Buddha thoughts on The Big Short. It's a good movie, it's educational, with exceptional performances, techniques, and something worth seeing. This film may not be for everyone, but the performances, writing, and drama are the real show stealers. Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling's characters are there really to explain things. I would have liked to see more depth to their characters. As Brick Tamland said, ""I like lamp."", and I like this movie. I believe The Big Short earns a<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

","My mother is a loan officer and last night we were flipping through Netflix for a movie to watch. I was happy to see this film there (Netflix takes forever with some films) and was glad to see it with my mom because for once, if i didn't understand a film, she could explain it to me instead of vice versa. Thankfully it was a simple enough narrative i didn't need to ask too many questions. She felt the film was mostly accurate but a bit one sided. too much emphasis is put on the 'big bad banks' and not enough on the irresponsibility of the average joe in that time. two scenes in particular explain this: (SPOILERS) the scene with the stripper where she explains she has about eight houses, all bought with loans, and the scene in Florida where they to go to collect from that guy, only to find out it's his landlord in trouble who has fled. those are probably two of the biggest reasons we got in such deep crap. People buying things with the money they do not have. It is not the greed of banks, it is the greed and manipulation of the system BY THE PEOPLE. My mother is Mexican, and speaks fluent Spanish, so she would get all the 'problematic loans'. what does that mean? she'd get the loans from immigrant people who claimed to have no money. Only, once she started to investigate, she'd find they were paid in cash, under the table, sent that money home, claimed they were poor and qualified for everything social under the son. even the wife of OUR GARDENER said she was single so her kids would qualify for wellbabies and whatever else insurance and perks her kids got at school. so while I applaud the filmmakers for taking such a serious subject and turning it into something more people wanna watch (because this film SHOULD be watched) I wish they hadn't taken such a left approach and been more neutral. a lot to ask from Hollywood, i guess. other than that, fun fantastic cast that gave the film a great energy, the element of breaking the 4th wall always brings in the laughs among the other black comedy in the film. a generally enjoyable film, even if i eventually felt it ran too long."

The three cameo expositions are the only weak spots. I'm sure others love them. They remind me of the cartoon DNA demonstration in 'Jurassic Park' except that one fits into the premise. These ones exist outside the story, talks down to the audience, and doesn't necessarily explain the ideas any better than other ways. Vennett's Jenga demonstration works fine.

","Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, mainly because of the brilliant cast but I didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time and the Wall Street jargon, became way too technical for me. There was too many characters that were doing different things and I personally think that it became a bit messy after a while. I deliberately didn't want to know anything about the plot before I watched it but if I knew that it was based around the property crash during 2008, I definitely would have watched it with someone else so they could explain to me what was going on. Out of all of the top stars in this film, Steve Carell and the brash Ryan Gosling, were brilliant but it would have helped if I knew what the hell they were talking about. Don't get me wrong, I get the main concept of the movie and I knew who was good and who was bad but if your not from that world, I really don't know how your supposed to understand there various phrases and different methods of tricking the market to make billions of dollars. Brad Pitt and Christian Bale also put in good performances and they played there roles convincingly but I still was confused most of the time. Basically, it's worth a watch, just for the performances but from an entertainment point of view, it really didn't do it for me. Disappointing but watchable.<br/><br/>Round-Up: With such an enormous cast, the box office takings were pretty disappointing, and I'm sure that a lot of the money was made after getting nominated for a few Oscars. It did win in the Best Writing category, even though I found it quite confusing but it lost out to Spotlight in the Best Movie category. I can understand why this movie is so appealing, because it explains how the stock market crashed and how so many people lost there homes and jobs, so it is a significant movie for this time and age but they will have to release The Big Short for dummies for me to get it. It was written and directed by Adam McKay, 48, who also brought you Anchorman 1 & 2, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers and The Other Guys, so this film was definitely a change of genre for a director who had primarily made movies for the comedy market. The script was slightly witty and I liked the way that Ryan Gosling was narrating through the film, which gave it a lighter feel, even though it was dealing with a delicate moment in time. I still would have to watch it again to fully understand it and I'm sure that I'm not alone when it came to the confusing technical jargon. <br/><br/>Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $133.3million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/drama/comedies starring Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, Marisa Tomei, Hunter Burke, Rudy Eisenzopf, Casey Groves, Charlie Talbert, Shauna Rappold, Brandon Stacy, Peter Epstein, Melissa Leo and Anthony Marble. 4/10"

","""The Big Short"" is a film with Steve Carell and some other folks about things in the banking industry that lead to the 2008 recession. Various banking guys discover issues in the industry that could lead to a potential market collapse. At the least, they uncover fraudulent and deceptive practices. A lot of the movie seems to be scenes in which hotshots from Bank A with knowledge about problematic mortgages visit bigwigs from Bank B hoping to cash in or learn more about the problem by shielding themselves from sharing the ultimate issue at hand. ""You mean you don't do income verification when giving people mortgages?"" ""No, we don't."" And more questions from the Bank A people follow. Never a desire to set such people straight and tell them that their jobs and lives are at stake, never a desire to wonder if their participation in the banking industry itself should be questioned. Steve Carell's character, always looking to point out and draw out the problem and bringing attention to it without providing a path forward to how to tighten up this practice and prevent it from happening in the future. Sorry, can't identify. Part of the film seems to be a crusade against ""big banking capitalists"" by noting that the poor and working class will be affected by these sketchy mortgage deals, but then by the end of the movie the main characters appear to cash in themselves on such an industry. You uncovered the problem, brilliant, but then don't have either the moral fortitude or wherewithal about how to lead things forward to a stronger future. I guess, that is, because you are simply bankers. Features a rather strange performance by Christian Bale."
"dromasca","9","0","1","4 June 2016"," the end of capitalism?
","Was Karl Marx right with his critics and analysis about the capitalist system, its crisis, and inequalities? The question must have crossed the minds of many people faced with the periodic failures of the world economy and financial systems in the last couple of decades, which seem to have made the poor poorer, ruined into poverty millions of people who were part of the middle class, while making many of the rich richer. The question is asked indirectly also by the makers of 'The Big Short' directed by Adam McKay, probably the best film made until now about the crush of the real-estate market followed by the financial system which started in 2007, and to some extent continues until today.<br/><br/>The housing market in the United States was expanding and seemed to be rocky solid in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It was supported by a banking system which did not only provided the credits that allowed all the strata of the population reach the house of their dreams, but also created new money from money and profits from profits for the investors. This kind of bubble BTW persists until today and endangers all the capitalist economy. The film describes how a few people involved with the investment funds and banking systems had foreseen the fall ('The Big Short') and made a profit out of it investing in credit default swaps, kind of insurance policies against the deficit of a system which was supposed never to fail. If you want this was like buying insurance policies against earthquakes with the confidence that an earthquake will happen in the next two years in one of the most stable areas in the world.<br/><br/>Director McKay took a documentary book (Michael Lewis' ""The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,"") and turned it into docu-fiction of the best quality. In order to explain how the system worked he used the narrator who is also one of the heroes (played by Ryan Gosling) and a few real life celebrities to explain the dry financial terms. I certainly did not become an expert in economics after seeing this film, but I can understand what chef Antoine Bourdelle means with taking lower quality ('B rated') sea-food and putting it in his bouillabaisse, package with his 'AAA rated' prestige. The smart heroes take life each on screen thanks to well written dialogues and fine performances of such actors as Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, or Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>'The Big Short' proves that the financial and banking system that is supposed to support the capitalist economy is ill. It also proves that Hollywood at its best can make relevant movies that touch real life, while being good entertainment for smart viewers. In what concerns the question 'was Karl Marx right?' the answer is in my opinion that he was right in part of the analysis of the capitalist system, but was completely wrong in what concerns the cure. If a cure exists for the capitalist system, its name is certainly not communism."

What happened in America (and what is surely still happening to at least a degree) caused an earthquake which rippled all over the world.<br/><br/>Financial crisis still roaming in some countries. Not that those countries didn't ""help"" by making bad choices themselves too. But it's amazing what banks are still allowed to do and how they won't ever will be made responsible for their mistakes (unless a politician finally steps up and makes them - of course that man or woman would have to be elected president first).<br/><br/>But back to this movie, with its weird mix of comedy and cold hard facts. It's tough to laugh at times and it's tough to understand the whole picture too. Which is why we get interludes with famous people playing themselves, explaining important plot points (or rather real life incidents/information) for the viewer to be able to actually get behind it all.<br/><br/>The fourth wall is broken a lot, the movie tells us the whole time what is up. It's also telling is from time to time, that events didn't exactly occurred as presented, making fun of the process itself. It might be too clever for its own good, or at least in the perception of some viewing, who might have preferred a more straight/head-on approach. But if you dig what they did here, you'll get an excellent movie nonetheless"
"kconerly","10","0","1","30 May 2016"," ""The system is ran by stupidity..."" The truest truth I've heard in a movie.
","Presented to the audience with a mixture of award winning performances, fourth-wall breaking narration, and snippets of documentary type photos, this true story breaks down the limits Hollywood seems to usually put on itself and lets the truth ring like the Stock Market's closing bell. <br/><br/>Summary: Because I'm one of the simple folk that this movie talks down to in a playful, I can't accurately summarize the movie except to say that some people see the housing market bubble before anyone else, and decided to gamble against the housing market to make money. I've enjoyed this movie so much, I'm writing the review before I even finish it, so you don't have to worry about spoilers. <br/><br/>As a simple folk myself, who happens to work in an organization in which I can truly see stupidity marching in front of the pack in the most self-assured way as it leads its way right on into proverbial hell, I can honestly say that this movie makes an artful and accurate representation of what happens when greed is allowed to breed within society, and within those who hold the 1% of the nation's wealth. But the movie is not a statement on which political party should accept fault for the housing market bubble bursting. Instead it simply looks at the big name banks that were either too shady or too stupid to see the bubble themselves and do something to prevent millions of Americans from being forced from their homes and fired from jobs.<br/><br/>This isn't the kind of drama that has weepy tears and over the top scenes of intense passion... although you might be able to count the snippets of cynicism and anger, or maybe the confusion and excitement. I don't count it, because the information and dialogue thrown at you at a pace that makes random numbers and technical jargon sound so cool and exciting that the emotions and feelings come second to the full force of how so many people could be blinded to one simple truth. That is, until the very end, when the ""heroes"" of the film realize that even if they get a 20 to 1 or 200 to 1 return on their investments, they're winning at the expense of those millions of Americans. That weight is palpable as it comes crashing through each scene, ""the housing market is built on lies and deceit."" <br/><br/>The movie should be watched by every young adult to explain how a mindless, self-absorbed approach to life can lead to far-reaching, terrible, consequences. It's theme that I find most appealing, and the is that apathy that comes as a consequence of self preservation may usually seem like a low risk decision, but it is in fact an investment into a hollow way of life that will simply collapse under the weight of its massive fallibility."
"sukanya-samy","Null","0","1","4 April 2016"," A movie about how it all went down - mortgages, banks, investors and people.
","The thing about most scams is that the schemers usually get away with it (well some might land up in jail after making tonnes of money). Its the people they have conned that suffer - and these people are everyday people like you and me. This is exactly what happen during the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Banks, investors, funds managers, and people remotely connected to the financial world - all made money. Except the people on whose name the mortgages were on.<br/><br/>What is it about<br/><br/>The Big Short based on a book by Michael Lewis (The blind side, Moneyball fame), is a good movie - its not great and I will tell you why in a bit. But lets start with the good stuff. It has big names who acted pretty well - Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt and Christian Bale. The characters they portrayed are all real people and that's what made it interesting. Christian Bale is Dr. Michael Burry, the man who predicted it all. As early as 2005, he knew the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), the instruments with which bankers were making loads of money already, were made even more lucrative with sub-prime mortgages filled in them. His prediction and solution to make money for his investors is one story.<br/><br/>The other parallel story is of Steve Carell - again a fund manager working for Morgon Stanley. He is angry and by moving back and forth during the movie they tell you why. His story is about his dilemma - of looking for a loophole in the system but hoping against hope that there is no fraud.<br/><br/>The third parallel story is about 2 new fund managers, kids in the big bad world of finance, who have made good money already by picking the right stocks for their investors but chance upon the sub-prime crisis pretty early on and take the help of Brad Pitt to short the MBS.<br/><br/>The street-smart, suave Ryan Gosling is the one who kind of stitches all three parallel stories together in his own cool ways. He is in it to make money as well but not at the forefront.<br/><br/>Why it didn't work (for me)<br/><br/>It's a complex plot, people with no understanding of the sub-prime crisis will find it really difficult to follow this movie and that is why Adam McKay, the director has tried to provide bite sized finance lessons with the help of famous people like Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez etc. But I don't think it will help people who just want easy movies where you don't have to follow each and every dialogue.<br/><br/>That's where the movie lost out for me. The big short is convoluted, its difficult to follow because it keeps zipping through multiple stories and characters (I personally like this style but for such an intricate movie, this didn't work). Though all the actors have done their bits well, it feels almost clinical - it didn't bring out the emotions that it should have - the grossness of it all, the pathetic situation of people like you and me or anger that not many people who were responsible for the crisis went to prison.<br/><br/>Maybe that's what the movie is about, the smugness of all the people who did what they did by cheating normal people and didn't give a dime about people who lost their houses and jobs.<br/><br/>Why you should still watch it<br/><br/>Watch it to understand a bit about the crisis - after all its part of history, something that happened and affected millions of people around the world. Also watch it for Steve Carell. I usually don't like his antiques and comic sense, but he has done a brilliant job in this one - his shock of finding it all out, perplexity of what one should do in position of power and his really emotional outburst is a joy to watch. I forgive him for all the crappy movies he ever did. :)<br/><br/>I give The Big Short a C+. Did you think it was better than what I thought of it?"
"mark-durfor","4","0","1","31 March 2016"," A Different Look at the Housing Crisis of 2008
","Based on the same housing economic meltdown in 2008, The Big Short covers the story from the different viewpoint of a few who saw it coming. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), was a physician and hedge fund manager, creator of Scion Capital LLC. He was the first to recognize the impending doom of the careless practices by financial institutions and bet heavy on the housing market bubble to burst in a big way. He was so confident in his analysis that he used $1 Billion of his investors money. Some of his investors were more than displeased and pulled out in 2006 and 2007. When the market crashed in 2008, Burry profited $100 million for himself and another $700 for his remaining investors. He was quoted as saying, ""I don't go out looking for good shorts. I'm spending my time looking for good longs.""<br/><br/>Banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gossling) and another hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) caught wind of what Burry was up to and jumped in as well. Some young investors accidentally discovered what Vennett was up to and talked Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), an ex stocks trader, into taking part. <br/><br/>The Big Short was nominated for Best Picture of the Year and Bale was nominated for his supporting role. It won for Best Adapted Screenplay. The preview looks to be a stinging look at the corporate greed that rocked the world with a bit of humor as a small group forms a bit of a financial coup. However, the humor is either going to be one of those ""it's funnier because it's true"" situations, or it will illicit a sort of ""ha-ha-ouch"" at just how crippling their ignorance and greed was, and still remains today.<br/><br/>I anticipated rating this 3.5 stars. Throughout the movie, I dropped down to 2.5, but raised it up to a final verdict of 3.0 stars. It's entertaining, well-acted, but sometimes hard to follow. What helped me raise it up was that the movie self-admits that it's own subject matter is boring and confusing. It takes breaks from the film in unique ways to help those of us not in the know what exactly is going on. I was still confused at parts during the film, but those moments of ""banking for dummies"" definitely helped. These breaks are done through an artistic method called ""breaking the fourth wall"". In theatre and in film, when you as an audience member are looking at a scene with 3 walls in a room, the fourth wall is assumed to be where the camera is positioned. You take it for granted that there is a fourth wall and don't think about the cameras and cables and directors and monitors, etc that are actually there. When an actor on stage acknowledges the audience by speaking directly to them, or in a movie when you are addressed by the actor breaking away from the movie, they are ultimately admitting that there is no fourth wall, that this is just a play or a movie and that there are people watching in one way or another. Gossling's character helps to drive the story much like a narrator in a Shakespearean play who introduces the plot with a prologue, has a couple recapping monologues and then sums it up with a prologue. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for The Big Short, if you watched any television at all or were on the internet or picked up a paper in late 2008, most of the things covered in the movie, we already knew. The banks started making more money off of mortgages by clumping them into bundles. They were secure with the best ratings meaning that there was almost no chance the mortgages wouldn't be paid back. The banks made a ton of money. Eventually, housing for the qualified homeowners started to dry up and the bonuses started to shrink. That's when they started lumping in some riskier mortgages in to the bundle. No one did background checks and the mortgages written were only for a short introductory period that would then balloon into 200 to 300 per cent of the original payback rate. When the introductory period ended and millions found they couldn't afford their payments, millions lost their homes and even more lost their jobs and the banks covered it all up. When the truth was finally discovered, it was too late and the US Government saw no other way to limit and reverse the damages than to shell out billions in taxpayer money to the banks. This money was used to then pay out big bonuses and only one person ever went to jail. And the banks are still doing it today, just with different names. <br/><br/>The Big Short was very well-acted, entertaining, confusing, upsetting, but seeing it once was enough for me. I might catch it on TV someday, but it won't be making it to my home collected, hence the 3.0 star rating."

","OK, this bored me to tears. Did folks not know the crash was due to companies 'propping' the market? Anybody buy a house and offered twice as much as they wanted? I was.

How did they do this? I read the news and know how they did this, the mortgage folks that is. A lot of over characterizations based on one person representation such as the scenes about the rating agency. This is a film for those not clueful about this and those who are woefully uninformed.

","""When the bubble bursts...""<br/><br/>What just happened to Hollywood? They finally got their strength to shout out the bitter truth about our society. Stories that were condemned as anti-capitalistic are now the new hot stuff. I was disappointed with last year's output of Hollywood. After Fury Road and Star Wars, there wasn't much for cheer, until the Oscar season came. Trumbo, Bridge of Spies and The Big Short are three movies that ventured to explore the ideas beyond blind loyalty to conventional political scenario. While Trumbo and Bridge of spies dealt with the past, The Big Short was a depressing analysis of 2008's financial meltdown of the united states construction industry. The funny part is, even with a steaming subject and a detailed, disturbing analysis, this movie is credited as a comedy! Ah, the way world works...<br/><br/>While most of the terms discussed in this movie are strictly technical, like CDO, sub-prime, etc., I succeeded to grasp what was going on and it was a head-twister. Basically, it was the shortcut plan of the wall- street money makers to keep the capitalistic wheel running. When there wasn't enough oil to turn the wheel, it crashed. That is, people failed to pay their mortgages back and as they accumulated beyond the limit, the stocks got low and the wall-street crashed. Four individuals came to know about this years before it happened and The Big Short follows through their and their attempts to capitalize the fall. There are no good guys in this stories. Likewise, we can't blame them for doing so, because the fall was inevitable. This haplessness makes this movie quite realistic and relatable. It's a big surprise that Adam Macky directed this film. It was quite a translation from Anchormen to The Big Short.<br/><br/>The cast was so alive. Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling and many other relatively unknown yet brilliant actors make this movie a delightful yet insightful watch. After all said and done, The Big Short brings out many questions that will elude sleep for many. Still, I have no idea how could they label this movie as a comedy. Seriously..."

As a result, I would lose some interest in the movie and would carry on my marathon with the rest of the nominations.

Kudos to the director for making the movie more interesting for non-financial background people. If you are to blame for the financial jargon blame the Wall Street guys for inception of some terms for their daily life anecdotes. Coming to the story, it is good drama storyline. The performances by Christian Bale and Steve Carell make it a great drama.We see Steve Carell in a non-comical role after Foxcatcher. He is a great actor.

"ArchonCinemaReviews","7","0","1","3 March 2016"," The Big Short crafts a thrilling and infuriating tale of complicit capitalistic deception all with a Hollywood flair
","Based on the true story of the '08 mortgage crisis that eventually led to the downturn of the global economy, The Big Short crafts a thrilling and infuriating tale of complicit capitalistic deception.<br/><br/>By the time the whole housing bubble popped, leaving devastation in its path, I was a college junior studying economics. Under the guidance of a passionate and dedicated professor aware of the historical importance of those events, I learned the ins and outs that led to the financial crisis – so going into the film I understood better than most. Despite this, even I was drawn into and maddened by the chain of events laid out by The Big Short.<br/><br/>We all remember the largest financial collapse in modern times erupting in mid 2008 thanks to sub-prime mortgage crisis, but few recognized the grander impact it would have on the economy with even fewer understanding what happened. Years in advance, four players in the world of finance predict the 2008 financial crisis, revealing an intricate web of duplicity on the part of big banks, whose only focus is greed induced monetary gain regardless of the long term consequences. The Big Short not only attempts to explain what caused the crash but with the approach-ability that could only be crafted from Hollywood flair.<br/><br/>After watching the film, you may still not truly understand what caused the housing crisis and how its reach reverberated tenfold in the form of a global recession. I spoke with several people who were still puzzled even after watching the film. In a way that is a flaw that speaks of the film in due to its levity regarding the technicalities of the events leading up to the recession, but it isn't lack of trying on behalf of Adam McKay.<br/><br/>The fact that McKay and Charles Randolph even take on this material and yielded this result is a testament to their creativity. McKay utilizes all the stops to make the material entertaining without dumbing it down completely in both his direction and writing. There are metaphors, allegories and even tangible symbolism in the form of Jenga and Vegas blackjack to try and help you comprehend. Not to mention the celebrity cameos to keep your attention during the technical explanations of jargon that would otherwise lead your brain to wander. It is that same stylization that may not be suitable for some people, especially those that loathe when a story is bastardized beyond recognition by the Hollywood machine.<br/><br/>In other hands, Michael Lewis's novel could have been a dreary and dense drama that no one would have seen. Instead The Big Short is lively and easily digestible for the masses. Its characters are each simplified to be voices the film needed represented: Brad Pitt is the moral conscience, Steve Carell is the retributive rage, Christian Bale is the informative foundation, and Ryan Gosling is the narrator. There isn't a doubt in my mind that the characters in the film have real life individuals from which they are based, but are assuredly so far removed they no longer resemble their counterparts. The film even openly admits of the liberties it takes in changing the facts to make the story more streamlined for adaptation. While watchable, it does detract from the sobering reality of the financial industry.<br/><br/>Another gripe with the film is the hair and make-up, and I'm looking at you Adruitha Lee. While this may sound superficial it has a huge impact on the movie viewing experience. We go to the theater to get away, to be drawn into entertainment and away from the burdens of our lives. This is impossible with the blaringly cheap and cheesy fake hair pieces the actors are forced to wear. This minor detail leads you to never forget you are watching a recreation, that the actors are basically playing 'dress up,' and personally I find it to be inexcusable.<br/><br/>A good film will make you feel something while you watch it, a great film will make you feel something after it is over. The Big Short is a great film, making you feel tense and frustrated by your impotency as you watch and furiously dejected once it is over by the impunity of Big Banks. Watching, knowing there was knowledge and hindsight, you will be incensed and that is what the filmmakers behind The Big Short were hoping.<br/><br/>Please check out Archon Cinema Reviews site for full reviews of all the Oscar nominated films and recent releases."
"Semisonic","8","0","1","2 March 2016"," Vigorous as The Wolf of Wall Street, depressing as Margin Call
","Like i said in my review of Spotlight, there are two kinds of movies that are inherently American: courthouse drama and journalism one. I guess i have missed the third kind: a Wall Street money porn. Yeah, it's not just drama, because in each of these films someone gets screwed so hard it's sometimes scary.<br/><br/>Since Wall Street (1987), we're being told the stories about greed, ambition and moral flexibility that have a permanent residence at that part of NYC. Some stories are more light-hearted, some are of a gloomy kind. But all of them are quite exciting to watch if made right. And since The Wolf of Wall Street was such a big hit, i guess someone has decided that maybe the darkest page in the history of US economy of at least the last 50 years could be given a similar presentation. In fact, The Big Short's intro and Ryan Gosling's opening monologue were such a direct reference to the Scorsese film that it almost felt like a blatant rip-off. So when Margot Robbie made her cameo as a stunning blonde drinking champagne while taking a bath with a seaside view, i was hardly surprised at all.<br/><br/>Still, The Big Short is not just a dark comedy about the '08 economic crisis. In fact, it's hardly a comedy at all. It tries to lighten the moods with some witty gags or episodic hilariousness, but it doesn't really conceal how depressing, sad and wrong the main topic of the film is. Steve Carell's character is the best reflection of we are left to experience: if at first he's just angry and fuming and yelling at people, then at the end all he can do is sit all bent and silent. And that's a guy who got $200 million out of this big scam, now imagine how a regular homeowner who's been thrown out on the street for being late on his insanely overpriced mortgage must have felt.<br/><br/>Despite being a truly dramatic and emotional movie about a very important moment in our history, The Big Short is not without a flaw. I guess some stories are just too overwhelming to take them on from all the angles at the same time. Not only did The Big Short try to recreate the timeline of that crisis and show us the stories of several people, each with their own hard life paths that had much more tragedy than Wall Street could be responsible for, but it also tried its best to educate people and give them the basics of the financial competence. A noble endeavor, but the gap between an encyclopedic and a fictionalized approach is too big for a film to be comfortable trying to embrace them both at the same time. Which, despite all the film's efforts to be as simple and clear as possible, leaves the audience kinda numb and dumbfounded, with the only thought left being ""thank god it's over"". Both the crisis and the story. Since most of the real-life prototypes of the main movie characters quit the financial industry, they probably felt the same way too: it was good while it lasted, but now let's move on to something more pleasant."
"SmartMaxim","8","0","1","2 March 2016"," Exciting and pretty accurate
","I was very eager to see The Big Short not only because of good cast, but also because I do have financial education and know the situation from different perspectives (no, I'm not a banker and wasn't involved in this crap anyhow, but MBS, CDO, ABS and stuff don't sound foreign to me). Even though most characters are speculators - who basically want to profit from the market inefficiency though have the courage to go against everyone else - the film tries to deliver the experience from the point of view of ordinary people, and does it well. Wall Street world looks very confusing, overpaid and corrupt. That is true. But don't be fooled by thinking that's the only point of view: there were also mistakes of the scientific society, government and even society itself. People accepted the positive side of capitalism for decades and asked no questions. That's the negative side. What you really want to take away from this movie is that relying on politicians or economists or media is not an option. There are people, me included, who think the crisis isn't over at all and the worst part, much worse than 2008, is coming. If you don't understand what's going on chances are you are going to have to pay. As for the cinematic part, the acting is very solid, especially by Christian Bale and Steve Carell, and the directing delivers the feel of the coming storm, very well supported by references to the actual events. That's the first movie that makes finance look exciting without trying to oversimplify things and glorify complete criminals."
"Jerghal","9","0","1","28 February 2016"," Those 130 mins will fly by in no time
","Movies about the financial world are not easy to make. You have to ensure that they are entertaining but still contain enough 'techno financial babble' to make it believable and still be understandable enough for the general public. For these reasons I feared 'The Big Short' might have been a bore but I was actually surprised how good it was. The movie contains a lot of humor and has a high 'fun factor' while the characters still use plenty of sector specific terms to make them believable as financial experts. 'Margin Call' avoided this mostly and had one of those exposition scenes where they explain to the monkeys in plain English and with daft metaphors what they are talking about. In this film they explain some of the more specific terms with a funny clip (here is Margot Robby in bathtub explaining C.D.O.'s) and that works incredibly well. The acting is top notch (I loved Christian Bale's eccentric Metalhead hedge fund manager character). Steve Carell again proves he can do more than comedic characters while the unknown supporting cast is also superb. The Big Short's 130 minutes ran by in no time as it has no problems whatsoever keeping you interested. This is one of my Oscar favorites for this year and I hope it rakes up some golden statues for the well deserved 5 nominations."

Steve Carell and Brad Pitt are solid as ever, Ryan Gosling is hilarious and the rest of the cast is great as well.<br/><br/>All in all outstanding direction from Adam Mcay on all fronts in delivering us a story that we probably barely knew anything about and yet impacted us the most in recent years.

","During the early 2000's i saw several documentaries explaining deep dark secrets about the world economy. I started to get curious so i read a lot of articles about it too. Then i started to ask friends of mine, that works in banking, some simple, but deep questions that actually are pretty straight forward.<br/><br/>Guess what, they could not answer how these simple things i asked about, worked.<br/><br/>It was clear that the world economy was so complex at this point, few people knew how it was molded together. It was a web of transactions and deals and papers and percentages in such great numbers, it seemed almost everyone just hoped it would stay together forever, and not collapse on their watch.<br/><br/>Well, it did.<br/><br/>But were so many people really this blind?. As we know after the collapse of 2008 the top bankers all were saved from prosecution. What they got instead, was a huge money bailout, payed by ordinary tax payers. For these bankers to go free, people in the millions lost their homes, their pensions, all their savings, their jobs.<br/><br/>And on top of that, smaller banks went bankrupt in large numbers, only to be bought by larger banks like Morgan Chase.<br/><br/>It's called: Too big to fail.<br/><br/>This is corruption at the top level, and nothing has changed. The rich just got richer and the poor got poorer. And this is how it's going to continue to be, nothing will stop it. As long as governments has to loan money from the banks, the banks got the governments by their nuts.<br/><br/>This film shows the story of a few people that saw this crisis coming, and bet on it. Which would give them enormous profits if they were right. Which they were. Are these people to blame for what happened? Not really no. If they had gone to the media and told everyone about this, no one had believed them anyways. The corruption runs so deep, and people are so afraid to lose their money, that they would not believe anyone who speaks against a huge majority, that are telling them, their money is safe.<br/><br/>So who is to blame?. Ourselves. We that elect our leaders, we sit by and watch corruption right in front of our eyes, but feel good when we make a vote. But did we do any research before we made our vote? What exactly is the reasons we vote? What is our motives?<br/><br/>I highly recommend the documentary called ""inside Job"" from 2010. A documentary about this crisis, narrated by Matt Damon. It is a brilliant documentary you all should see, and it is a good time to look at that now if you missed it.<br/><br/>So in 2006, after i had seen all these documentaries, i concluded for myself that a major economic crash was imminent. I did not know anything about Cdo's and such, but i knew that this world is filled with corrupt people who want to make more money, and the earth resources are only going down. There is at some point only one way the bankers can get richer, and that is if a lot of others have to become poorer.<br/><br/>This is the only way, whatever the leading banks and bankers of the world want to call it.<br/><br/>This film tells the story smart, fast and funny. Filled to the brink with clever dialogue, with top acting from everyone. And a razor sharp script and solid direction.<br/><br/>A movie everyone should see.<br/><br/>9/10 - Very Good"
"Genti22","9","0","1","24 February 2016"," Very well directed
","The Big Short is an amazing and very well done movie directed by Adam McKay.The film also includes many stars such as Christian Bale,Steve Carell,Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. The movie is based on a book by Michael Lewis and it's the true story of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005.Through their own research,some investors find out that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst.Then they decide to take on the big banks,and rightfully so,but what they didn't know is the impact on the average person that this is going to have. I really enjoyed this movie,it has great acting and the stand out to me is certainly Christian Bale who once again gives a very good performance.Though that's nothing new really,he has been amazing since he started in this business.Steve Carell is also brilliant here,and maybe just as good as he was in Foxcatcher. The director does a very good job at portraying these events on the big screen and most importantly making them simple enough for the average person to understand,since there are a lot of numbers.The editing by Hank Corwin is amazing too and so is the score.I guess the only issues that I had are the way that some elements were explained (by cameos),and that fourth-wall breaking thing got boring and weird at some point. Overall,this is a very well made and interesting movie that's amazingly directed and edited.The acting is top notch by pretty much everyone,and despite a few flaws I totally enjoyed this movie"
"mcshanebill","8","0","1","20 February 2016"," Amazing how true and entertaining the story is
","This movie was surprisingly good with great acting and an interesting depiction of what really happened to help cause the great depression. Much of the story I knew before from reading about the root causes but the movie tied it all together and added nice twists and additional details. It totally made it understandable to most although some of the parts do get financially geeky. The movie touched a nerve with me because I live near wall street, have friends that work there, have friends that entered the mortgage business at that time, and bought and sole a few homes myself at that time. This is how I know the story told in the movie to be very accurate. Accurate and true down to the scene with the strippers buying multiple homes and abandoned streets to prove it all was going to collapse. I felt the conflicting emotions of the characters who bet against the system. That is hard to do. I would not call them heroes just keen to another way to make money. The financial institutions and the government institutions that let this happen deserve all of the blame."

","In 1929, critics said of ""Man With a Movie Camera"" that the pictures cut away too fast and the mind doesn't have time to focus on any one particular thing. The film was revolutionary, as only spending two or three seconds on a shot is commonplace now, and has been for some time. However, with ""The Big Short,"" I found myself in the mindset of those whom time passed up.<br/><br/>""The Big Short""--the latest film to be green-lit after the success of ""The Wolf of Wall Street""--stars a gaggle of big names playing small names. These ""small names"" foresaw an incoming financial apocalypse and--some of them, at least--decided to profit from it, as one does. It's like if instead of building an ark, Noah had opened an umbrella shop.<br/><br/>This film has many quirks, and after a while--just like with a person--quirks become agitations and agitations become sources of deep, abiding hatred. For instance, the constantly speaking to the camera, which, I'm sure, seemed like a cute idea, comes off as unnecessary, as it's usually used for swing-and-a-miss humor. There's also a series of relentless cutaways to the pop culture events of the time that don't add a single thing. If they were meant to further establish a specific era, it's not needed; it's only been ten years, we remember! If the manic energy present in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" was a lightning bolt, the same energy here is like a shoe bomb--aimless and messy.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, there is certain energy present in the film, and while not all of the comedy hits, enough does to make the film a modestly enjoyable romp. Christian Bale--while maybe not the best actor working today--is easily the most consistently entertaining, and I could watch him awkwardly maneuver the subtleties of conversation all day.<br/><br/>Adam McKay, known for making dumb movies for smart people and dumb movies for dumb people, has now make a smart movie for dumb people. That's worth something."
"classicsoncall","9","0","1","12 February 2016"," ""It's possible that we are in a completely fraudulent system"".
","The film's best strength is probably also it's greatest weakness. Though it quite accurately and at times humorously portrays the prior decade's mortgage meltdown and financial crisis, for those uninterested in the financial jargon of mortgage backed securities, credit default swaps, and collateralized debt obligations, the story can quickly turn into a bore fest. A lot of the negative reviews of the picture on this board speak to that issue and I guess you can't blame folks who don't want to get into the weeds with all the investment lingo when all they're looking for is movie entertainment.<br/><br/>For my part, I thought the picture did deliver entertainingly well; the three celebrity spots breaking the fourth wall were cleverly done and presented the brewing financial crisis in plain English as opposed to Wall Street Journal jargon. After viewing the picture it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that the language used by the financial world is intentionally used to confuse, obfuscate and intimidate would-be intruders into the world of investing. Taken as a cautionary tale, the film's message ought to be readily apparent, look before you leap and only after doing your own due diligence.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot in common with 2011's ""Margin Call"" and demonstrates how even the guys with the noblest of intentions like Mark Baum (Steve Carell) can get involved in a situation that leaves them feeling disillusioned and powerless. What's more problematic however, even with the benefit of hindsight as to how the mortgage scandal was engineered and carried out, is that it's about to happen all over again. As I write this, the next looming credit crisis we'll be hearing more about will have to do with corporate junk bond debt, defaults on student loans and where did we hear this word before - sub-prime auto loans. Watch for the movie in 2025."
"LivBrumei","8","0","1","11 February 2016"," Big short and a big movie
","Putting it straight: is it best movie of the year? Depends if you prefer dramas, comedies, romances or horror, because The Big Short is a bit of everything. Who knows exactly what happened with the economic crisis that got us all a couple of years ago and insists on staying? I don't and my guess is most people doesn't. We heard some names that were involved, a couple of reasons, but if we don't know much about economy we hardly understand how on earth something can tear up an entire economic system. This is where the movie enters and try to explain us in a funny, but still intelligent way. It's also refreshing in the way how it tells the story. Not for a second we are led to forget we are watching a movie and get inside the story. No, first there's no need in that because everyone knows it really happened and secondly the great dynamic of it, its actually that it's like a documentary, that used famous actors and a bit of fiction when needed to better tell it and to keep our attention. It's a real story and it's great to make us understand something that affected our society so much and may be imminent to happen again. The movie it's quite pleasant to watch because of it's good dynamic and interpretations which are quite good, specially Christian Bale and Steve Carrell. So it's definitely a must see, because this doesn't fit in just one category of cinema, it's a real story, it's funny and it's sad. It has a bit of several ingredients and it's certainly easy to watch."

","I saw the trailer for this film at least six times in the cinema, I knew it was going to be something about financial business, it was rated well and I wasn't going to miss it when it became popular during awards season, from Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Step Brothers, The Other Guys). Based on a true story, in 2005, the U.S. housing market is highly unstable, from high risk subprime loans and fewer and fewer returns provided, this is discovered by eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Christian Bale). Burry predicts the market to collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007, he creates a credit default swap market and bet against the housing market in order to profit from this situation, he visits numerous banks with the idea, they all believe the housing market is secure and accept his proposal. Burry's clients believe he is wasting their money and are displeased, they demand him to stop what he is doing, the predicted time approaches, his investors consider pulling their money when they lose their confidence, but they are angered when Burry puts a moratorium (legal delay) on withdrawals. However, the market collapses just as Burry predicted and profits go up to 489% from the plan, trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) hears of Burry's actions and realises his predictions were true, he puts on his own credit default swap market stake, hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Golden Globe nominated Steve Carell) is also alerted and is convinced to join Vennett. Vennett and Baum discover that collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), poor loans packaged together and incorrectly given prime ratings due to conflicting interests and dishonesty of rating agencies, are being sold which is further perpetuating the impending collapse. Baum interviews a businesswoman at the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas who has created synthetic CDOs, a chain of increasingly large bets on faulty loans is made, Baum is horrified to discover that the scale of the fraud will cause the economy to completely collapse, Baum's business partners convince him to go ahead with the credit default swaps, profiting the banks from the situation. A paper by Vennett is accidentally discovered by eager young Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock), and also become involved with the credit default swaps, they enlist aid from retired banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt, also producing) to help pull off the trades necessary to profit, due to their being under the required capital for an ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) needed. Geller, Shipley and Rickert make the successful deals visiting the mortgage securities forum in Las Vegas, but Rickert is disgusted with Geller and Shipley being ecstatic and celebrating an impending economic collapse and lives that will be lost, the two are horrified and try to tip off the press and their families about the upcoming disaster, taking a more emotional stake, they profit, but their faith in the system is broken. In the end Baum semi-retires, investing only in water, continuing his career and refusing to say to the world ""I told you so"", Rickert returns to retirement, and Shipley and Geller unsuccessfully attempt to sue the ratings companies, almost none of those involved in the CDO bubble are arrested, Bespoke CDOs are soon sold again. Also starring Melissa Leo as Georgia Hale, Rafe Spall as Danny Moses, Marisa Tomei as Cynthia Baum, Doctor Who's Karen Gillan as Evie, Tracy Letts as Lawrence Fields, Selena Gomez, The Wolf of Wall Street's Margot Robbie, Max Greenfield as Mortgage Broker #1, Billy Magnussen as Mortgage Broker #2 and Jeremy Strong as Vinnie Daniel. Gosling does steal the show being the ruthless cool one, Carell is equally good as the anxious fund manager, Bale is likable spending most of his time behind a desk or a drum kit, and Pitt is softly profound as the ex-banker brought back into action. I knew about the Credit Crunch in Britain 2007-2008, then of course it turned into the Financial Crisis around the world, the idea of this film was to help those who do not understand a lot about financial business get the gist of the catastrophe, I will admit I had to concentrate hard with all the technical wording, but you get the whole concept of the men who saw disaster on the horizon, and there is worthwhile humour and satirical material to keep it going, overall it is an entertaining biographical comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Charles Randolph and Adam McKay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Good!"
"rubenm","7","0","1","2 February 2016"," Best movie about the financial crisis so far
","When writing a screenplay about the build-up to the financial crisis, the first thing most people would do is simplify. The financial crisis is such a complex phenomenon, that showing all its labyrinthine aspects would surely produce a box office failure. After all, the audience pays money to be entertained, not to be lectured about collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps and securitisation of sub-prime mortgage debt.<br/><br/>Luckily, the screenplay writers of 'The Big Short' decided to do it the hard way. They didn't shy away from the technical financial stuff, or the complicated way financial deals are structured. They included it all, but decided to make the best of it and explain everything. A stroke of genius, because the way these explanations are done makes the film much more funny and entertaining than would be the case without all the difficult stuff.<br/><br/>The makers of the film decided to break the fourth wall in a spectacular way. Not only do the lead characters sometimes speak directly into the camera, there are also small scenes in which technical stuff is explained by characters who have nothing to do with the rest of the story. The way Selena Gomez explains how a synthetic CDO exactly works, is not only funny, but also very clear. The film makers didn't have to include this part, because synthetic CDO's are not essential to the story, but it's to their credit that they wanted to explain even this very technical part of the debt bubble that led to the financial crisis.<br/><br/>Of course, the basis for the film is Michael Lewis's book, which in itself contains more suspense than an average crime novel. It's about a bunch of financial outcasts who decide to bet against the housing market, because they have done their homework, made their calculations, and conclude that a lot of the financial constructions are built on very shaky ground. As the introduction to the film explains: 'They looked'.<br/><br/>That is a great dramatic story, with a big 'David vs Goliath'-appeal. Against all odds, the protagonists of the story have to convince various adversaries, including banks, colleagues and clients, that they're right and everybody else is wrong. Most of the leads are colourful characters: the slightly autistic, barefooted, death metal playing, one-eyed investor Dr. Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale, is a prime example. Brad Pitt has a similar, but less offbeat role as the bearded, disillusioned investor who has left Wall Street behind to grow vegetables in his garden. There's a great scene where he tries to offload millions of credit contracts by calling his Wall Street network from a pub in the British countryside.<br/><br/>A lot of viewers will at one point or another get lost in the financial intricacies of the story. But that's not a big problem: it proves how complicated it all was, and how hard for even bankers to understand. That's the main message of the film: that Wall Street was going over the top in a big way."

","I completely understood everything that was being done with the editing throughout this film. It didn't feel at all like I expected it to. I walked into the theater expecting a cross between Spotlight and Wolf of Wall Street -which to a point is a fair starting place - but The Big Short became much more for me. The way this film tackled an issue that so deeply affected the entire country was cleansing in relation to the style of modern Hollywood. Everything felt real. I felt as if I was actually watching real life human people, not big name, a list actors playing the roles of people. Every cut reminded me that this was real, it happened, and it wasn't that long ago. The message at the end, and the taste it left in my mouth as I left the theater were refreshing while still reminding me that ""hey, this is real"". Every single actor's performance was great. I would have liked to have been able to understand some of the wall street jargon better, but that's a personal qualm for me. However, it did take away from the detail of the movie.

","The collapse of the US housing market (and Lehmans) in 2008, which precipitated the global financial crisis, doesn't sound like a recipe for fun and entertainment, does it? Neither did Zuckerman and Steve Jobs, but once again the secret is in the script and the acting. The writers have created a pacey run of short scenes with humour as well as tension, charting the escalating stupidity of the banks and finance companies who gave mortgages to people with zero credit rating and then wrapped these 'toxic' debts into packages for selling on to investors around the globe (including pension funds, city councils and national banks). One scene shows us a stripper with double mortgages on five properties: how could she not fail?<br/><br/>My usual cavil: the f-words come at you like a hail of bullets. But all the actors - not just the four leads - give finely overwrought performances as the crisis builds to a peak and then unravels. A nice touch is to have cast members occasionally turn to address the camera in the new 'tradition' of HOUSE OF CARDS, making this a kind of satirical docudrama. But THE BIG SHORT is based on real people and painfully real events. Millions of people lost homes, jobs and even their lives when the mighty boom turned to an almighty bust."

I'm being facetious, of course. The Big Short takes an event of global economic significance, which is built on financial shenanigans of horrendous complexity, and it presents it in a way which audiences can understand. This is absolutely brilliant. It is also frequently very funny – I found myself laughing at the same time as being completely outraged by what was going on.<br/><br/>There is a high level ensemble cast here and all are very good, although my money is on Steve Carell, proving that he is one of his generation's great actors.

The premise of this film is set before the economical collapse as a bunch of misfits manage to predict this collapse. Steve carrell is the main guy in this film and and he has developed into a really good dramatic actor. His character is flawed but you are behind him and understand him as he tries to get his point across. Christian bale is amazing in this film he absolutely owns the screen. His character is really interesting and unique which for me made him the best character in this film. Ryan gosling is probably the most charismatic character in this film and also the funniest. Brad pitt easily has the most emotional scene in the whole film and when he is on screen he does a great job. The story has a good emotional core to it, especially towards the end of the film. However, I felt a bit robbed because of the fact that most of the characters don't even interact with each other. The script has some good humour and drama in it but it does have allot of exposition that just goes too far in trying to explain the terminology being used.

"guchrisc","Null","0","1","25 January 2016"," A derivative film about breaking the bank, also breaks the fourth wall too!
","This Paramount film tells the story of how the sub-prime crisis lead to a banking crisis and collapse in 2008, followed by a world-wide recession. As the trailers show, the tale is told by following a few odd-ball characters connected to the financial markets, who do not accept the orthodox perceived wisdom.<br/><br/>The story starts with Michael Burry a physically and socially handicapped fund manager who obsessively investigates the figures and numbers in the property market. We viewers are given explanations, via the fourth wall, that help us to understand the subject, whilst also being entertaining. We discover bankers have bundled up mortgages, called securitization, and then sold them, the derivatives, as assets. However these are bundled, and re-bundled, and include mortgages known as sub-prime. These assets were sold as AAA (triple A) but in reality were not. The sub-prime tranches (parts) diluted the AAA tranches. Michael Burry realizes this and invests (basically by betting against this) to earn money if there is a default. Others also discover this and also invest likewise.<br/><br/>Michael Burry, the odd-ball financial-whiz is played by Christian Bale. His character is not a normal Wall Street guy, physical deformity has made him socially awkward, so he spends all of his time in his office, crunching numbers, as he listens to loud rock music. <br/><br/>Sadly, the loud music, we also get some unnecessary rap music later too, detracts from the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Another flaw of this film, and it is a massive one, is the appalling camera work. The use of the fourth wall, so characters can give viewers explanations, is essential for this film, and was done very well. No criticism of that. Or for some real-life stock-footage. It is everything else that is dire. The camera swoops and swings wildly and out of focus. The filming is at times very poor, often fairly poor, and thus this also makes for some very uncomfortable viewing. This film is interesting because of it's subject matter, but not for film quality. To see great filming, go and see 'The Revenant', also out in 2016. the comparison between the two films is night and day. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is very good in his role, losing himself in it, as he did in 'The Prestige' (2006), and also in 'American Hustle' (2013) in which he was unrecognizable. In the recent 'Black Mass' (2015) gangster film, Johnny Depp used fake contact lenses to portray Whitey Bulger's piercing light blue eyes. Christian Bale is not made up to show his physical handicap, which is a shame, as it thus makes less of it to us viewers. Certainly a rich fund manager could pay for top quality, and no doubt he did, but for us to see, and feel, his pain, a more physically obvious handicap would have been better. This is not to slight Christian Bale who acts well to show his physical handicap, and his resultant Dr Sheldon Cooper-like social awkwardness.<br/><br/>Steve Carell, who was excellent in 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World' (2012), here plays another uptight banking figure who also becomes aware of the financial situation. In this film, Steve Carell actually has a much bigger role than Christian Bale. It is Mark Baum, played by Steve Carell, and his firm, who take us on the field-trips to Florida and Las Vegas, standout scenes btw, where we see the reality of the situation. Marisa Tomei, in a small role, plays well the part of the wife Cynthia Baum. Miss Tomei, so very recently in 'Christmas with the Coopers' (2015), here in a very different role, does some very moving scenes with Mr Carell.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling, previously in 'The Place Beyond the Pines' (2012), plays Jared Vennett, who is also in banking. Although not the biggest of parts, his character is also one of the main players in the story, and it is through him that we are also told the story.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt too, has a small, but decent role, in this film. He is also a Producer too through his Plan B Entertainment. John Magaro and Finn Wittrock, in minor roles, play small-time fund-managers also involved in the story. Byron Mann shines in his one scene, as do Max Greenfield from 'New Girl' and Al Sapienza (Mikey Palmice from The Sopranos) in theirs.<br/><br/>This film tells a true and sorry story. Banks over-lent and over- borrowed, then they churned their assets. When the sub-prime market collapsed because of fraudulent over-lending, the contagion spread around the world. Sadly, there is no mention of the contribution President Bill Clinton and President George Bush made towards this.<br/><br/>Viewers should not be deterred from viewing by lack of financial knowledge. The film does it's best to explain matters in as simple a way as possible. This it does well, sometimes with some very visual examples. Thus we can grasp the general ideas fairly well and so understand the financial crash of 2008, the effects of which we are still feeling today. So this educational film is well worth seeing. It does have some humour too. Those who like comedy, and also desire a primer on the capitalist system, should dig out an old DVD of the classic 'Trading Places' (1983) which gives some explanation as to how markets trade in concentrated orange juice and pork bellies. Others may also enjoy the more recent 'Margin Call' (2011), which is a serious film that also deals with the same 2008 bank crash. 8/10."

I think invoking the ""jenga tower"" when explaining the mortgage backed securities or CDO's was a simple and effective analogy for the audience assumed to have no understanding of bank trading or bonds. Even the explanation of the ""hot hand fallacy"" - propensity to attribute likelihood of future events based on the current using the setting of a blackjack table was interesting. I have to give the film credit in its presentation and various techniques it employed to illuminate a complex subject matter. <br/><br/>However, I must agree with a minority of reviewers in saying I felt some uneasiness about the film's persistent push for comedic affect. I didn't have a problem with the narration or breaking the 4th wall and engaging the audience directly, as no doubt the director felt they might be become disengaged if not. But I found Ryan Gosling's character odious - which is to say he plays the exact same character he did in that horrendous rom-com a few years back with Steve Carell (who I will come to shortly) - a brash, contemptuous know-it-all. I also didn't love the Margot Robbie cameo (or Selena Gomez for that matter). We're talking about the worst global financial crisis since the 1930's and you've got some multi-million dollar pop star very condescendingly explaining the nature of mortgage backed securities from her jacuzzi on a beach-side mansion before telling the audience to ""fuck off"". Was this just a cynical attempt to appeal the fans of that reprehensible Wolf of Wall Street? <br/><br/>Then quickly Steve Carell, once again I realise I'm in the minority but I can't warm to him at all. With him and Gosling cast as two of the primary characters I knew I would struggle to love this film. However, Christian Bale was a stand-out and his scenes were often much more humorous and poignant than Gosling/Carell's without going for broke. Brad Pitt was scarce in this.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy The Big Short and would recommend to to all. It was well edited, paced and relatively faithful to the Lewis' narrative. However, it debased itself somewhat by appealing to the very pop- obsessed consumer culture it was trying to denounce. Perhaps the intention here was denounce this section of viewers.<br/><br/>The film does (importantly) recognise and place in to some context the actions of the protagonists in betting against the housing market i.e their huge gain would be contrasted with global economic pain. The Big Short isn't judgmental of the characters - more so tempering any adulation a younger audience perhaps might feel towards them. I also enjoyed how McKay addressed the issue of what it is to devote one's life to the creation (or usurpation) of private wealth. What is capitalism? The ability to capitalise on an opportunity and externalise all else. That apt Twain quote at the beginning ""Its what we know that just ain't so"" - and we continue to ""know"" that capitalism and free markets in the best economic system despite all its exploitation and continually more adverse side-effects. <br/><br/>An important and watchable film, but not quite the masterpiece it could have been."

","One has to hand it to ""The Big Short"" that it tries to package the financial crisis in terms that most people can understand. It successfully re-creates a variety of real-life characters who saw the sub-prime crisis coming, profited from it - and felt bad about profiting from it. Its strength is that it is very driven about its subject matter. Its weakness is that it takes an ethical stance that doesn't allow viewers to truly reflect on what they're seeing. The brilliant ""Margin Call"" was all about the atmosphere of the crash. It didn't try to explain it all, it dwelt in the moment, and is therefore still the defining film on the subject. This film is about putting the blame solidly on the side of the banks. And it does so in sometimes annoyingly over-acting their ignorance and greed.<br/><br/>However, everyone was and is greedy. The characters shorting the markets didn't do so just because they wanted to teach the banks a lesson. They did so primarily because it was an opportunity. A stripper who obtains five homes and a condo through sub-prime mortgages on speculation to resell them at a higher price is just a source of information here. But in fact, characters like hers were just as responsible for the crisis as the banks who were selling those loans. That aspect is completely lost in this film. If you take a 5% interest loan to buy stocks, can you really blame the bank if you don't make 5% returns? I'd love to see a film that calls for people to act responsibly in what they're doing financially. Without greedy borrowers, there could be no greedy lenders.<br/><br/>From an investors' perspective, neither the book nor the film tell anything that was not previously known. One would presume that a crisis which cost virtually everyone money would be familiar to the general public to such an extent as to render lengthy explanations about what CDOs are obsolete. My biggest take-away from ""The Big Short"" is that, apparently, it strikes a lot of people as ingenious when synthetic CDOs are explained by Selena Gomez at a black jack table. Most Americans are involved in the financial markets through their pensions, loans, insurances, properties and stocks, so this ""making it easy"" should feel somewhat insulting to them. But it seems the author and film maker were right on the mark with that approach, and THAT is the worrying message to me - everyone is STILL in the haze and needs that kind of schooling.<br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is not a masterpiece, but the effectiveness of its storytelling makes it probably the most important film among this year's Oscar contenders."
"ellscashncarry","7","0","1","15 January 2016"," Entertaining but I'd expected more!
","Firstly, I loved the quirky way it was filmed, with characters speaking to the camera and little cutaways to celebs (Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez etc) explaining some of the 'technical jargon' batted about in the film. Also it does a sound job of introducing and characterising some of the the key figures in predicting the financial meltdown.<br/><br/>That being said, I do feel it was a little bit of a let down. As entertaining (and at times funny) as it was, that is all it was. I certainly don't think it blows viewers away or does anything special and even viewers like myself, who know somewhat about the financial collapse, will find themselves getting a little lost at times, despite the film's efforts to explain what's going on. Additionally I'm not really sure it's the best written screenplay or film editing (depending on where the blame lies) as you're left wondering what the point of the story and its characters were and what message the film was trying to get across to its viewers. Are the lead characters heroes or hypocrites? I really don't know what it wants us to believe.<br/><br/>I had expected this to take the best bits from both Inside Job and Margin Call and turn them into an Oscar-worthy film. If anything I'd say it falls short of both, which is a shame. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film and is thoroughly entertaining, but if I was to advise someone, I'd say if you want to know about the financial crisis and how it was caused, watch the excellent Inside Job. If you want to watch a drama set around the financial collapse which accurately captures the extreme gravity of its repercussions, watch Margin Call.<br/><br/>Also on a side note, Carrell's performance trumps Bale's here and I'm a little unsure as to why Bale has received an Oscar nomination. I mean he's OK and don't get me wrong I love Christian Bale. But he's delivered much stronger performances in the past and I think Carrell gives us more from his character.<br/><br/>All in all a solid 7/10 film but not Oscar-worthy and won't be remembered in years to come I don't believe, which is a shame given the calibre of the cast and the story it was telling."
"Rendanlovell","6","0","3","6 January 2016"," A decent, albeit flawed true story film.
","'The Big Short' stars Christian Bale, Steve Carrel, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and a whole lot of others. It is directed by veteran comedy director Adam McKay (Anchorman). This is his first foray into directing a complex story and, for the most part, it works. The is about the market crash that occurred in 2007. How the worlds economy was propped up on loans that people either hadn't paid off or were behind on. Now, this is normally not a film that would intrigue any one. It revolves around banking and boring adult stuff that even adults don't seem to care about. But that is why 'The Big Short' succeeds. It takes this kind of boring concept and makes it interesting. Surprisingly enough this film handles its source material with relative grace. Of course the film is irreverent and in your face but it doesn't treat this material as a ""they cheated the system"" type of movie. No, the movie blatantly shows these people trying, to no avail, to warn anyone who would listen about what was about to happen.<br/><br/>It shows that, although these people became millionaires, they didn't want to see this happen. For whatever reason they saw what no one else could see and acted on it. This is what the film does best. It treats the material with respect (more or less). It is able to show that not one person even cared about how corrupt the system was. And that this wasn't something easily missed.<br/><br/>It made this fact abundantly clear. In doing this it was able to show how scummy these big banks were. And it was also able to show that these characters weren't happy that they were the ones to find this. They knew how many people would lose their homes and lively hood if they were right.<br/><br/>However this would not have had near as much impact if the actors playing these characters did a poor job. And each actor involved in the film was great. Each one was able to show their disgust with what they were finding and their longing to tell people before it was too late. It was hard to watch them go through this without losing yourself into this world that they were in.<br/><br/>While the film does handle things fairly well, it can't escape the incredibly pretentious aura that emanates from it. Why it feels the need to stop and explain random things using uncomfortable celebrity cameos I will never know. The one thing I do know is that when the film announces them as a sports commentator announces a player it comes off incredibly out of place and pretentious.<br/><br/>As I sat watching the film I couldn't understand why this decision was made. Or why the film felt like it should break the 4th wall for no real reason. Yes, it stays in line with the awkward, distracting documentary style of cinematography but other than that, there seems to be no explanation for this. So when the film decides to talk directly to the audience it makes the film become exactly that, awkward and distracting.<br/><br/>Now, this doesn't make the film bad. I very much enjoyed 'The Big Short'. It was just the right amount of irreverent and dramatic to be both educational and entertaining. But why the film decides to present itself in an over the top unconventional style I will never know. It wants to be different so badly that it opts for uncomfortable scenes to be carried out in order to achieve this. When it does this I can't help but be slightly repulsed by how much the film feels like it needs to pat itself on the back."
"jmviani","7","0","1","3 January 2016"," Christian Bale may deserve an award for his act
","There is no best lead actor in this film. They all supported each other. Bale, however, in a supporting role of acting, well, he was quite superb. <br/><br/>This film, in my opinion, was not the top of filming nor story but it was very well done, ...its execution was accomplished. <br/><br/>Bales' acting performance was, well again, I am not certain to how I could describe it. I have not the words nor the intellect proper. I can only allude to how I enjoyed it. I, in a word, believed him. I believed his character and how he acted it. I bought the act as a portrayal of an actual human being."
"jkhavermann","7","0","5","23 December 2015"," Engaging despite flaws
","""The Big Short"" tells an engaging story with an excellent cast. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, there are times that the film feels like a docudrama directed by Michael Moore; as a person who sometimes enjoys Moore's work, I say that more as an observation than a strict criticism. But like Moore's work, the film is sometimes preachy in an overbearing way, and like Moore himself, writer/director Adam McKay doesn't trust the audience with serious material: the film assumes that the audience must always be entertained. I don't think I'm spoiling anything of substance when I mention that the film literally takes breaks from the story in order to have celebrity guests like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez, and Anthony Bourdain explain complex financial instruments directly to the camera. The scenes are presented in a way that's meant to come across as fun and irreverent. As somebody who followed the financial crisis as it unfolded, and read about it afterwards, I found the whole tack to be vaguely insulting. Still, McKay probably recognized that he had a fascinating and important story, and realized that he needed a way to convey this information to members of the audience without boring or confusing them; he can't be faulted for operating from accurate assumptions.<br/><br/>The film follows the interesting characters who took the daring position of 'betting' against the housing market in the mid-2000s (through short selling). It should be noted that these weren't the first people to notice the housing bubble -- just the ones who profited from it. (Dean Baker, who also accurately predicted the tech bubble burst, wrote about this as early as 2002; see 'The Run-Up in Home Prices: Is it Real or Is it Another Bubble?,' Aug 2002.) Pointing this out doesn't make their stories any less engrossing. I found Christian Bale's performance in the role of Michael Burry particularly noteworthy; Carrel and Gosling are also terrific. <br/><br/>""The Big Short"" is not the best of the year, and I don't think it deserves the Oscar nomination it will surely receive. But it's good. And it is fundamentally accurate in its depiction of the financial industry as driven by fraud and fueled by greedy incompetence."
"jandegroot","7","0","6","16 December 2015"," Interesting and well done
","There is a lot of technical information that the audience needs know to appreciate the story and the movie uses many different devices to get us up to speed, from ordinary graphics, to the characters directly addressing the audience, to elaborate skits explaining some of the more obscure financial terms. It is inventive, funny and works well.<br/><br/>There are two very eccentric characters and Christian Bale and Steve Carell do an amazing job portraying them. In fact, all the acting is realistic and intense.<br/><br/>The only problem was, even though I enjoyed how stylish and well made the movie is, I was never sure what it was about. It was not about the financial meltdown and yet it was also not really about the characters that went up against wall Street and won. You saw them in action and it was fun watching them do their thing but you never got to know them. You never get emotionally involved.<br/><br/>They should have ditched the Brown- Hedge Fund story and devoted that time to the other side, showing what was happening at the investment banks and how that culture was driving the process, like in ""Liar's Poker"". That way you could see the battle from both sides and appreciate what they achieved a little more.<br/><br/>An interesting and entertaining movie done in an ultra modern style and I enjoyed it, but as a story it isn't all there."
