"misiribrahim10","10","338","501","5 November 2016"," Best Turkish Movie Has Ever Made !
","I've seen the movie just a bit earlier and although my expectations were very high, this movie satisfied me very well. As we already know Turkish movie sector has lack of visual effects. That is actually the reason behind why we usually don't enjoy Turkish Action kind of films. But in this movie we see lots of great examples of best visual effects. And also it has its own realistic scenes as well. The connection between soldiers were so great, enthusiastic and natural. Also the connection between the first movie with this one was great so this movie actually deserves its rate. Besides from good visual and sound effects the movie has also its own story-line which was perfect. As I mentioned before even though my expectations were really high this movie is even beyond my expectations. Thanks for letting us joy this kind of masterpiece Mr. Alper Caglar."
"agirmete","10","247","404","6 November 2016"," Just amazing!
","The Turkish producers and directors are doing their job well at the moment! Look at this movie! It is just terrific! I liked the first part of this movie, but the second part is much more better than the first one. They used real artillery, helicopters and real machine guns and rifles in this movie! The MPT76 is the first national Turkish assault rifle and they used it in cooperation with the gun factory MKE. The actors got real military training for a few months before shooting this film in order to increase the realness and always used real military gear and equipment during the shootings! Just go and watch it, you won't regret it!"
"Beyyle","7","152","251","15 November 2016"," It was much better than I expected
","I will be honest, 9.9 points too high. There is the influence of nationalism. If you have big expectations, you will be disappointed. If we vote worldwide, this movie 7,5/10 (Ok, OK... Still a little bit of nationalism ^^), but if we vote for Turkish cinema, this movie 9/10. This is a great, and different job for Turkish cinema. Apart from that, it's a classic war movie with some stereotypes, that's all. Don't expect anything different.<br/><br/>Yes, Dag II(Mountain II) a nice war movie. But, don't compare with American war movies that cost 100 million dollar. That would be unfair. Because, Dag II's budget 2.000.000 Turkish Lira, it means ~550.000 dollar. But, Dag II is the best job that can be done with this budget. <br/><br/>Explosion effects can be better but passable(budget). Uniforms, weapons, equipment are real, taken from Turkish Armed Forces. <br/><br/>The movie is starting perfectly. The action is perfect in the second half. The conflict scenes were pretty good.<br/><br/>Dag II isn't like the first movie. The Dag was a struggle for survival. But Dag II a heroic story. Dag II is a different and much bigger movie. These guys are specially trained to kill but they aren't emotionless machines. Dag II shows this very well. They stay in dilemma, do the right thing, or just do your task. It's a tough decision and it can change a lot of things.<br/><br/>I can not wait for Dag III. With a much larger budget, as a bigger movie. <br/><br/>Also, if you want to watch another military movie from Turkish cinema, you should watch ""Nefes: Vatan Sagolsun"". There is a different, emotional and very impressive theme."
"matty-j-b","Null","34","51","17 September 2018"," - Expectations were high -
","I enjoyed the movie..... but there is NO WAY it should have a rating that high... which calls into question the validity of the reviews. Obvious Turkish propoganda but the final battle scene was well done. Acting was very good but the tone was a bit too dramatic for me. Mediocre film with the rating of a mecca film... Personally I think there are only a select-few movies that warrant a rating above a 9:
Pulp Fiction
GoodFellas
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
The Dark Knight
Godfathers Part 1 & 2
Shawshank Redmption
Psycho
Rear Window
Inception
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.....
No way The Mountain II ranks amongst those titans..... Can't score lower though because in all honesty the production was very well done and was a very believable setpiece."

","I was the one who was thinking about this movie as predictable and cliché besides I have never seen a good military movie from Turkey except one or two films (e.g. Nefes). However I must say , this movie is quite successful with respect to other Turkish or high budget Hollywood films. Furthermore , visual effects are pretty good at overall. <br/><br/>Scenario includes not only war or strategic stuff but also amusement and drama.Beside It has actual topics like conflict between religions or beliefs of native people or minorities all over the middle east. Moreover it touches on ISIS factor properly and objectively."
"healthyschool","10","105","218","5 December 2016"," MOUNTAIN II , don't miss
","This movie is far beyond my expectation.The casting is amazing. This time Turkish actors have done great job! Amost all the things are true on the movie Turkey is like a gate for Europe and Turkish people are saving us from terrorists. In Turkey there is a special forces( bordo bereliler), almost every competition among army forces from different countries they are coming first. Check and see the truth. I give this movie my highest recommendation. MOUNTAIN II is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in battle, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in.<br/><br/>If you have the chance to see this masterpiece, do so. If you start watching it is very hard to stop. Definitely one of the best battle movies out there. Hope we can see Mountain III following year."

","this film is very realistic that is why I scored 10 of 10. I have found something in this film from my military service memories.May be some people who are from Europe or US can not predict that many of Turkish Young People have experience same as dag II film. There is no inappropriate scene or unusual something, almost it is completely real. I suggest to watch this film to all IMDb members.As known ,sometimes our country is under pressure about political issues but this film can prove what Turkish Soldiers do in the Middle East.All the world can understand our purpose by even watching this film. This is who we are and what we want to do.Thank to all staff of dag II film.Congratulations !"
"Fella_shibby","10","55","111","10 August 2018"," The action is impressive, the acting is solid, the direction is first class, the special effects are brilliant and the cinematography awesome.
","I saw this without seeing the first part but still i thoroughly enjoyed this film. At times the flashbacks were a bit confusing but as the film progressed, i understood everything.
The action is impressive, the acting is solid, the direction is first class, the special effects are brilliant and the cinematography awesome. I dont kno the names of the actors but all of em did a terrific job.
The film is very realistic n u feel the tension once the enemy surrounds the elite commandos. In fact the acting of the entire commando team was so good n convincing that i felt sad for each one of em after they get surrounded.
Basically the plot is a bit similar to Saving private Ryan but this film is more about patriotism n protecting homeland rather than invading another country.
This film is more about risking lives for a principle, more about protecting one's countrymen even if those countrymen are against u.
The explanation by the team leader to his fellow commando on saving the journalist was top notch. Even the contents of the letter which the team leader gives to the journalist was very well done."
"balahan","4","115","250","22 March 2017"," Don't waste time
","When someone sees 9.9 score on IMDb of course the person wants to watch that movie. But i say don't waste your time for this one. The screenplay and the dialogues are really awful. I wonder how it's got this score. There can be two options Turkish patriots can be voted 10 without thinking. And the other one is they opened account just to vote this movie. They couldn't create a deepness in character's psychology and because of that when they shows us the situation it doesn't very important for us.Also unlike most of the action films it doesn't aiming something important in the movie time. But cinematography is nice. It must be, because it has a very high budget for a Turkish movie."
"claudio_carvalho","8","43","86","4 November 2017"," The Mission
","A Turkish elite military squad commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Veysel Gökmusa (Murat Serezli) is assigned to rescue the Turkish journalist Ceyda Balaban (Ahu Türkpençe) that was kidnapped by rebels in Iraq. They succeed in their assignment but along their return journey they stumble upon a Turkish village that will be invaded soon. Veysel and his team live a dilemma: to accomplish their rescue mission or to defend the defenseless Turkish villagers. <br/><br/>""Dag II"", a.k.a. ""Mountain II"", is an excellent Turkish film with the storyline of a secret military squad in a mission called ""Storm Bringer"" with the objective to rescue a Turkish journalist from Iraq. The soldiers are submitted to a tough training program but they become like a brotherhood. The non-chronological screenplay entwines past and present but for people like me that have not seen the first film, have difficulties to understand parts of the flashbacks. In addition, the lack of knowledge of the Turkish culture and the ethnic conflicts in that area makes difficulty for the viewer to understand the big picture. But ""Dag II"" is a great action film with feelings and should be nominated to the Oscar. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): Not Available"

I know I'm not an expert in movies plays or acting, but after watching the movie to its end I ended up with confusion. It seems to me there is no point in the whole story but to tell incidents about supposed heroes, helping other supposed heroes, to be announced as heroes. I just hated it."

If you expect it will have some American or European cultural ideas, there is not even a mention and it will disappoint you at the end of the film. There is no intention to make a Turkish Army propaganda in the plot and I must say some of critics are stereotypically underestimating the Turkish Army which is not the one as same as in the film's so these all the comments are wrong (perhaps this is another disappointment for some people). They have only created a story about military soldiers and the messes they deal with and it is only a cinema film."

Sure, this might be some Turkish propaganda, but for instance....the various ethnicities involved and their involvement in Iraq, with ISIS, etc...cool to see.<br/><br/>2) The good guys get major props for authenticity.....mostly. The SF guys' gear is impeccable. I do question, however, some of their tactics. Stick your sniper in the most exposed position ever?? Spray n' pray when you are down to your last mag?

Not sure where this was shot, but it sure is pretty country.<br/><br/>Loses points for the bad guys getting shabby gear. I mean I can understand not getting a REAL Abrams for the ISIS goons, but those fake machine guns on the tank and the technicals?? Ugh, awful. It's also pretty long for what it is. Part of that is seeing Berik and the other dude (Oguz?) try out for the Maroon Berets. There are also a few snippets hinting at the first ""The Mountain"" movie. But it does seem to take awhile to get through. <br/><br/>One last thing.....I have never met a Turk, but those actors really came across as nice guys.

","It is a poor imitation of Hollywood war movies. Visual effects are good but there is nothing unique about this movie. The characters are flat, the plot is ideological, which tries to legitimize Turkish intervention in Iraq and Syria. Through poor dialogues and conflicts between the reporter and soldiers the message is that Turkish army must save those poor people. The story is very weak. Firstly, a special squad aims to saves a Turkish news-reporter, but later they decide to save a village in which there are a bunch of people. Instead of risking everybody, why do not they take the villagers with them or hide in some place?"

"loickgnl","6","11","22","26 August 2018"," Overrated? YES, Bad movie? NO
","Soooooooooo let's talk about this movie... I think like many of viewers I got catfished by the 9/10 rating. Let's be clear on that, it does not deserve it. <br/><br/>SCENARIO : 5/10 - Zero risks.<br/><br/>First of all, the scenario. Dag 2 applies the same rhythm than most of the war movies. It starts with a simple mission justifying the presence of the characters in the area (first part of the movie), then an event occurs that will make us wonder how the characters are going to react (second part of the movie), finally the characters made a decision and there comes the big battle we have been waiting for (last part of the movie) where we wonder if the characters will survive. This is the common ""clichÃ©"" on how to build a war movie but that does not imply that every movie following this structure will be a bad movie. For instance, ""Black Hawk down"" follows the exact same structure and still have been rated 7,7/10. <br/><br/>MESSAGES: 6/10 - Not original but at least it isn't just a ""Boom, Boom"" movie.<br/><br/>We have been talking about the 3 parts of the movie in the scenario but there is actually a fourth part. Indeed, scattered across the whole movie, this part deals with the story of the three main characters (the commander and two soldiers). What is their shared history? Why did they join the special forces? How did they join those special forces? We also have the usual thoughts of every war movies (sacrifice, fallen comrades, follow the mission or follow your heart?). Again, those subjects are pretty common in a war movie. 
However, a good point about this movie is that it doesn't make the mistake of forgetting about the main characters suffering in a war: the civilians. The issue in my opinion is that bringing the civilian issue into a ""one sided"" movie automatically brings a kind of propaganda feeling simplifying a war conflict into a fight between good and evil. It might be naÃ¯ve from me to think that it is possible to avoid that however I always keep in mind the example of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" which is as far as I know the movie proving that it is possible in a way. <br/><br/>ESTHETIC (camera and soundtrack): 7/10<br/><br/>Not gonna fully develop this part. Let's just say it is simple and effective even if you see that the flash of the rifles has been added post filming. For the soundtrack, it is the usual orchestral ones coupled with more recent ones. <br/><br/>GENERAL OPINION: 6/10<br/><br/>""Dag 2"" is not a great movie. Everything is pretty common in that movie which did not manage to surprise me. Also, and that is purely subjective, this movie does not give any explanations on the conflict which is bothering me a lot. Indeed, this movie could have been a great opportunity to explain to the world the Turkish view on that war. After the movie, I had the feeling you could just replace the Turkish insignias by American insignias, it would not impact the movie at all. Also, by applying the usual ""clichÃ©"" to the characters, it is difficult to really care about them since you saw a lot of those personalities die in other movies. <br/><br/>Therefore, does that mean ""Dag 2"" is a bad movie? NO! I have seen a lot of comments giving a 1/10 rate for that movie just because it was overrated (and it was). In my opinion, those comments are mistaking. If you look just at the movie, you will see a pretty decent war movie following the common standards. Therefore when you rate that movie you are rating the whole war movie genre. ""Dag 2"" is a decent movie, do not reschedule anything in your agenda to watch it because it will not surprise you however, if you just want to spend some time in front of your TV, watch it.<br/><br/>
Finally, I must conclude on two positive points about that movie. The first one was the ability of the movie to manage the silence. This is in my opinion the most difficult challenge. Without silence, you just have a succession of actions, you don't have time to really develop the characters' personality (even if ""Dag 2"" took the time for that, it still failed me on that part XD) and at the end you just have a ""Boom, boom"" movie. The second good point is that, to be completely honest, I never saw a Turkish movie it its entirety. ""Dag 2"" was the first one and I think that is a good achievement that will make me keep an eye on future productions. <br/><br/>There we go guys, I hope this review has been usefull!"

","After seeing the high score and the abundance of people who scored the film, I curiously downloaded and watched the film. However, I didn't get touched after that. In my own perspective, this film is totally overestimated. It was just like the Turkish ""Saving Private Ryan"", except for its mediocre story. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, the details are great: the time between pulling the trigger and the head shot; killing the moving targets; the individual weapons; the scenes of explodes. However, at the ending, it became careless. The model tank and the shifts of scenes form explosions, which made me consider whether the film crew was that poor. The last battle seemed to be unrealistic, which was a dozen of soldiers fighting against hundreds of terrorists, but since it was a movie which expressed the patriotic theme and self- sacrifice of soldiers, I could accept it.<br/><br/>The thing is that the development of the story is so confusing. This film uses two story lines, one is the rescue task, the other is the training process. This method can be interesting, but every time when I wanted to continue watching the story, it was always unexpectedly interrupted by another story line, which made me lose the focus. The story was still an old class: soldiers were ordered to save a reporter who was going to be persecuted by terrorists. When they were going to return to their base, a village consisted with elders, children and women was threatened by the terrorists. After some conflicts, the soldiers decided to save them. The other line of training showcased the toughness of those trained soldiers, the scars in their minds and the real life they need to deal with, which should be touching, but it made audience(or at least me) feel nothing(maybe because I didn't watch the ""Dag Ⅰ""). <br/><br/>The characters are also, well, not annoying, but someone I didn't like. The reporter, who was rescued but blamed those soldiers all the time, really made me wordless. She didn't even realize the life of others and always wanted to be the one who would save the world. At some moments, I really hoped that she was killed by the terrorists. The soldiers, however, were much better. Though it still followed the traditional story that someone had to die to save others, due to the link with their relatives and life, it did moved me somehow. But it still couldn't make up the weak story.<br/><br/>Except for the partially brilliant details, provoking musics and the eligible battle scenes, this overestimated-patriotic military film is totally not worth watching."

"nicholsj-81-845263","Null","7","15","22 March 2019"," Laughably Unrealistic Propaganda and Fake War
","If only the Turkish military had shown the same balls when innocents were being slaughtered in Kobani that are exhibited by the heroic special force unit in this exercise in nationalist propaganda disguised as cinema! Maybe then Alper Caglar's phony plot might have some credibility. But the fact remains that Turkey stood behind its border while ISIS committed atrocity after atrocity. But that was okay since the victims were mostly Kurds and Shia Arabs. What is perhaps most disturbing about this film is its message that Turkish soldiers are willing to disobey orders, sacrifice their lives and plant the Turkish flag in the Syrian territory of their fellow Turks (Turkmen) and Kurds. This is precisely what Turkey's military did, but only after the Kurds and Americans had defeated ISIS for the most part there. So this movie would have been more realistic if the enemy the special forces was killing--in one of the most astonishing displays of shooting accuracy and dodging enemy bullets I have ever witnessed on film--was the Kurds who had done the real fighting against ISIS.<br/><br/>This film may sooth the guilty or even cowardly conscience of Turks who stood by while Kurds and others did the fighting and defeating of ISIS, but it is nothing more than the equivalent of fake news. It is fake war. It might make the wannabe neo-Ottoman sultan Erdogan and his sycophants happy, but it and dishonest history, a problem that has plagued Turkey since its founding. The film probably also warmed the heart of a majority of Turks, whose nationalist brainwashing is reflected throughout Caglar's script in the plot-line and repeated references to the love of the ""homeland"" the ""Turkish people"" and their ""flag"". But Alper Caglar will never be recognized as anything more than a schlock filmmaker if he can get beyond the excessively patriotic nonsense of this film.<br/><br/>Alper Caglar showed momentary flashes of a deeper, less parochial mindset in a couple of scenes, but his characters were for the most part simply too cartoonish to be taken seriously. When he makes a film that takes a genuinely hard, critical look at his country's excessive nationalism, and mistreatment of Kurds, journalists and government dissenters, viewer outside Turkey will begin to give him serious interest, as he clearly knows something about the mechanics of filmmaking--but little if any of its art. If he really wants to show he has some cojones as a filmmaker, all he need do is make one about the Armenian Genocide deniers. Now that would truly be historic--if he could even do so within his great homeland of which he is so proud."

","I watched this movie expecting great, if not necessarily sublime, things from it, and got a very pedestrian product, neither truly awful nor particularly good. My problem is that, to avoid spoilers, I hadn't read the reviews beforehand and therefore didn't note the obvious ballot-stuffing that IMDb's algorithms were apparently too unsophisticated to catch. The upshot is that I got a movie that was nowhere near meeting any expectations of quality. As nationalist/propaganda pieces go, it's average. It's no worse about that than many other movies. However, the ridiculous overrating has, at least for me, the opposite effect than the voters intended -- rather than elevating Turkish cinema, they've effectively left me suspicious of any ostensibly high-rated Turkish movie. If this particular movie is the apex of Turkish cinema, I have no particular drive to see any others. Indeed, thanks to the bad taste left in my mouth over the difference between expectations and reality, I'm likely to literally pick any other country's movies over Turkish ones right now.<br/><br/>The movie itself was fairly standard. Lots of jingoism, the near-deification of the military in question, and some decent cinematography.

There are some great locations and beautiful landscapes.. It is overly sentimental and Turkish nationalism lies prominent but the combat scenes are very convincing. The ending is similar to Saving Private Ryan but it's thrilling enough for the viewer to not care. It's an interesting edition to the genre of war action given the tendency of American war cinema to portray U.S. special forces as the most elite, along with some others portraying British SAS and Israeli IDF too. Also interesting is the tone, whilst being nationalistic it has a message about justification for a Greater Turkey and a sense for the need to defend Turkish people living across arbitrarily drawn borders.

In terms of the plot, the movie has everything that viewers would want from a movie of its genre. The director weaves the touching personal stories of the soldiers with the harsh realities of performing military work. The outstanding combination of action and emotion in this movie will be interesting for everyone (not only for viewers from Turkey.)"
"nevzattarantula","10","9","38","8 April 2017"," You'll Feel all the emotions that Hollywood does not have.
","Don't forget all the weapons in the movie are made in Türkiye. and its all real guns used in the movie. and one of the difference between Mountain 2 and the other Hollywood made action movies is , mountain 2 is not supernatural. there is no fantastic rescues. its all real. teeth to teeth blood to blood. <br/><br/>and my favourite line in the movie is "" this is not a American movie, there will be no one to save us at the end of movie... "" ( Thanks to TSK for support this movie..... )"

","Special Forces - Full Action - Excellent<br/><br/>The battle scenes, the use of weapons, conflicts, all very real and within your life. It conveys it to you as if it is feeling. Especially the human emotions are very beautiful. It is a film that shows the emotions that people inside the stage are capable of and under what conditions they are trained. It tells us that there are people who have emotions in them and that they are not machines. Train as much as you want, enter as many battles as you want, fear is never missing.<br/><br/>This film may be a stepping stone for Turkish cinema. Because if such productions are made and are in demand, directors can also lead such quality works.<br/><br/>In general thoughts it can be ranked as one of the greatest Turkish Movies."

","As I mentioned in the title, the film is simply wonderful.I do not know where to start, but I need to start somewhere, do not I? My first eye pain in this movie. Because for the first time I watched a Turkish movie in the movie theater. I also got the opportunity to watch this movie in the movie theater. The film was superb with one word.The message that this filmin has given is a very deep link. There are soldiers who have opened their lives for the people you've never met and these soldiers are Turkish soldiers.<br/><br/>Brotherhood, friendship, love, oath, history, war, enmity words could not be explained so beautifully.I loved the land I lived after this film more. If you need to talk briefly about your movie;DAG II; tells the story of a clandestine special forces squad; call sign 'Storm Bringer'. Following of the first film, Bekir and Oğuz, best friends, have in the world famous, perpetually grueling Turkish special forces training. Their first mission begins to infiltrate the most barbarous area of modern day Iraq for a rescue mission. The film briefly describes the hostage-taking hostage operation on the country border. This operation is so ingeniously processed that it is not surprising to get it.The film has transitions between past and future. So that the questions in your mind are wiped out in a flurry.I did not get rid of it for a while after watching this movie. I would always be a soldier at home. A lot of laughs, plenty of cry and a lot of swearing films are waiting for you Let me know how to prepare chips and watch the movie right away. Because you miss a lot. Finally this movie is real!"
"tahaetem","10","10","45","5 December 2016"," Unexpectedly Beautiful Turkish Movie
","This one is absolutely one of the best Turkish films. Turkish film industry handled really good genre of drama films many times. But Dag II is the first action-war movie they made really good.<br/><br/>Weapons are real, some of the actors are real soldier, visual effects and screenplay are not worse than Hollywood. Additionally, this film shows important role of Turkish army in middle east and how the people in middle east see Turkish army.<br/><br/>P.S. This is one of the must-watch films. I wont suggest this movie for being a Turkish. Cinematography of the movie is far better than other Turkish films."

","Have watched ninety percent of the best war movies ever made by any genre on this planet by the best directors. This movie touched my soul. Although I retired from the Armed Forces in India..I never got an opportunity to take part in live combat. Had to suck in this movie with English subtitles but it kept me on the hook. Do not worry about scumbags who have rated this movie as a matter of propaganda....Just watch it for the raw feeling about what life is all about being in the war front. From the beginning to the end....It gives us an insight into the atrocities of war and how lives are changed not only for those who are thrust into it by sheer love for their country but also for those lives falling in between enemy lines. Never seen the first part of this edition ....Well I don't have to!!!! Just watch it not for the love of cinema...but for it's raw form and never forget to give a rating."

","The mountain II is a military and nationalistic portrayal of a group of soldiers on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Turkish journalist in Iraq. At first scene, she's rescued from ISIS and all her kidnappers are terminated. The operation is successful and they should return back home. But, they receive the news that conflicts between terrorist and other groups is blocking their way. They are determined to defend the last Yazidi village against the terrorists and that's where the climax of the movie comes. At one point, the captain announces an Iraqi village as Turkish homeland and raises their flag there, while waiting for the last standing, ""the storm"", against the terrorist ISIS group who are about to attack the village at the afternoon. The movie is full of proud patriotic lessons. This is the main reason why this movie is rated so highly. It would give a Turk, chills alongside the good film score it has. The movie has some cons to it. It is very slow for a military mission and action movie, and too violent for a drama movie. The movie goes back to the past of the soldiers a lot. In conclusion, a well-directed and well-made Turkish movie. The acting is very good. It's worth to watch, even only with subtitles. 6.5/10"
"ChaudhryBilalSahi","1","3","9","4 July 2019"," What a Crap - eagerly suggested by friend whose good-movie-sense is doubted now.
","I dozed off several times while watching it on laptop, because the movie is way too slow and that without any tension-creation and suspense. Nothing happens especially when you expect something tense is going to make movie more interesting. I was constantly kept on waiting to be glued into the plot of the movie, but all in vain. Its plot is weak. It could have become more interesting and attention- grabbing with more details and twists in the story. Speaking of acting, it is not at all to the nearer of what we witness in the Hollywood movie with 7+ rating. Characters were written fairly, but they lack in developing connection with audience with their roles and acting. Cinematography is good. My only best scene in the movie when soldiers had been trained. The scene came in flashbacks, poorly organized, making other movie more boring. If you are fan of Hollywood survival movies and is not Turkish, don't take a chance to waste your 2 precious hours of your life on it."

","The high ratings must be coming from Turks only, because for other nationalities the nationalism is irritating.

"hakantahacetin","8","10","48","24 November 2016"," Nice try, but it can be advanced more.
","In general thoughts it can be ranked as one of the greatest Turkish Movies. However, I'm here to talk about things which I found awkward. <br/><br/>Given message in the movie; In the letter which Lieutenant Colonel Veysel gives Ceyda, he mentioned about the criticism and the love of nation, which is misunderstood by many Turkist. Many of them think that criticizing the army, policy and the government is hate against Turkey, so putting that message in the movie is a great idea.<br/><br/>About the scenario; Ending of the ammunition is exaggerated i guess. They killed many Isis terrorist and do not take any of their guns. In first armed conflict it can be seen normal, but not taking guns in the second one may be a mistake because they were considerate about ammunition and mention about consuming 1/3 of it before that. Also, villager guy who is protecting the entrance of mosque/minaret appeared with Kalashnikov. The source of that gun was not seen in the movie and it brings many questions and creates hole within the scenario.<br/><br/>About the director; I do not like the style which is used in dialogues. Passing over of the camera between people talking is just mind- blowing. It is nice to try to show every expression and mimics, but i think that it can be addressed via different ways."

It shows also why journalist do what they do show the cruelty that is in the world and why they criticize violence against violence and human rights. It shows also the civilians who fall in between as victims and the conflict of standing by to do your duty or doing what you know is right.

","I cried while watching the movie, I would like to admit that. The way that the movie flashbacks to the lives of the soldiers and their inner selves was fascinating. Especially the quality of the side stories were impressive. They were so realistic. However the part where the special forces soldiers decided to sacrifice themselves for the village raised some questions. It sounded a bit like cliché hero movie. Other than that the director has no problems with killing heroes, which defeated the cliché a little bit. The CGI was relatively weak, and also the camera angles and shot transitions felt a little weird. I believe the strongest part of the movie was the side stories also the conversations between the soldiers. I heard some music from Kaan Tangoze (the vocalist of Duman) in the movie. I listened to his songs through all my high school years. There were also some political messages inside the movie. It was mainly about freedom of speech and press. I felt so much connection with the movie."

It has a linear, classical movie line so simply put boring. But it's very similar to black hawk down or the siege of jadotville or fury... Nothing more than that, just like every war movie this is about nationalist feelings and patriotism...

","Dag 2 (The Mountain 2) is an accurate portrayal of the Turkish Special Forces.<br/><br/>There is a glitch of what we learned to do, as when we are running low on ammunition, we start collecting AK47s, SVDs, RPG7s, Hand grenades any ammunition they are carrying from those we killed.<br/><br/>Reason why during training we train a lot with those Enemy weapons. Even if we are not running low on ammunition we collect those weapons, ammunition, to later distribute to the Afghan Civilians so that they can defend themselves against raids by the Taliban. At Northern Iraq we did the same thing. Dag 2 depicts Northern Iraq, Southern Turkey during the Summer time, conditions there are much worse during the Winter, as depicted by The Breath 2009 and Dag 2012. At Afghanistan in the Winter time the conditions at the Pamir (Roof of the World) and Hindu Kush (Killer of Hindus) are Near Arctic.<br/><br/>The Reality that spoiled Dag 2 (The Mountain 2) 2016, is we had refresher training with the German (Bundeswehr) Commandos at the German Alps as Mountain Warfare (including Technical Mountain Climbing) followed by more Mountain Warfare Refresher Training with the Turkish Special Forces at Southern Turkey, our ""Training"" was actually hunting Kurdistanis of the PKK, HPG, KGK, Ansar Al Islam at Southern Turkey under conditions identical to Afghanistan's 2/3rds Mountains before being deployed again to Afghanistan. Previously, we had graduated from the U.S. Army's Mountain Warfare School, and Arctic/Winter Warfare School. From our Training with the Turkish Special Forces we KNOW that they (Turkish Special Forces) have almost ZERO latitude or discretion, so they could not have evacuated the children nor defended the village, the Turkish Military Command and Turkish Politicians would have basically ""disowned"", ""disavowed"" their existence and not send anyone nor anymore assets.<br/><br/>To be 100 percent fair about the Turkish Military another Movie Must be made, in 2009 the Turkish Military at Southern Turkey went after the Millions of Kurdistanis of PKK, HPG, KGK, Ansar Al Islam at Southern Turkey and Northern Iraq. The big mistake was not using the Turkish Special Forces to do Special Reconnaissance and Special Surveillance to determine the size of Kurdistanis Forces. After chasing the Millions (Majority of the Kurdistanis Population) into Northern Iraq, the Turkish Military encountered the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam that had been Trained, Armed and were being Funded by the Muslim Nation of Iran's Quds (Qods), funds of $Trillions (numbers from U.S. Department of State) from the Muslim's Mandatory Islamic Tithes from over 1.8 Billion Muslims Worldwide.<br/><br/>The Majority of Kurdistanis belong to Ansar Al Islam as Allied to Osama Bin Laden, Al Quada, Millions of Afghan Taliban (numbers from after CIA Operation Cyclone), Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam (numbers from 2001 U.S. Military Operation Viking Hammer). The Majority of Kurdistanis provided Osama Bin Laden, Al Quada, Millions of Afghan Taliban, and Holy Warriors of Islam ""Islamic Sanctuary"" after being chased out of Afghanistan into Northern Iraq after the 2001 U.S. Overthrow of the Afghan Taliban Government. In 2007 President G.W. Bush had ordered the U.S. Special Operations Forces to shutdown the original Osama Bin Laden Muslim Terrorist Training Camps at Northern Yemen, this was accomplished 2008, with the Muslim Terrorist Training Camps then moved to the Kurdistanis Region of Northern Iraq.<br/><br/>The Millions of Kurdistanis defeated the Turkish Military, while the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam, then fled back to their Nations of Origin to Overthrow U.S. Allies ""Established Governments"" as the Democrat President Obama Approved ""Islamic Democracy Movement"", starting with U.S. Ally President Mubarak of Egypt a U.S. Ally since 1973, then attacking from Egypt U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi a U.S. Ally since 2006, as Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah and the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam needed the Decades of Weapons, Ammunition, Military Equipment, Anti Aircraft Missiles, Landmines, Explosives that were being used against the Holy Warriors of Islam by U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi's Libyan Military. After Democrat President Obama's Overthrows of U.S. Ally President Mubarak of Egypt, and U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi, Democrat President Obama's Supported Islamic Democracy Movement Egypt became Islamic State Egypt and Islamic State Sinai, at Libya Democrat President Obama's Non Libyan ""Libyan Rebels"" of Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah became Islamic State Libya, and then attacked U.S. Ally Tunisia."

","I liked it just as well as the first one but this one had more action, however, the first one had an original storyline and this one didn't, if you analyze the storyline after the middle of the movie it's just the same as Saving Private Ryan, a mission or objective is to save 1 person, then when you finally get to her you end up staying to protect instead of a bridge, a village full of people, stole the idea of the Bell tower with a sniper being shot with a tank, stole the idea of creating a bottle neck with explosives to block the street, stole the idea of the last stand structure, even stole the character of the rookie worthless soldier running through the streets with ammo aka Upham but instead a girl. I felt like I was watching low budget Saving Private Ryan, even the commander said a few words to Oguz as in the ""Earn this Ryan"" before dying.
In one scene they stole a popular and final quote from Band of Brothers where a son asks his father if he was a hero back in the war, but instead of replying that he served in a company of heroes, he says that he served one.<br/><br/>I agree with other low rating reviews, the movie is not thrash for a low budget but stealing a lot of scenes and quotes from other movies is just not right, the high rating should be because the sense of nationalists that just vote high because it's Turkish, I mean it has better effects that my country movies but I would still vote low if the movie sucks even if it's my country.<br/><br/>For the rating you come with super high expectations and came out pretty disappointed.<br/><br/>Watch the first one then forget about the second, it's not worth the disappointment. If you want to watch low budget Saving Private Ryan then go for it."

","In some reviews there is no propaganda film like scattering or something like the band of brothers or the saving private ryan blowing or not like the film, but if you look at this movie with neutral eyes very good quality according to my works if you behave neutral imdb just takes the place it deserves but they always the films that praise the Jews for being biased will always be up and such quality films will not be able to enter the list."

","An excellent film, just sit back and enjoy. It's not incredibly complex not as if it's going to win best foreign film at the Oscars. It's just an enjoyable action film. Basically modern Turkish version of ""Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven"" with ""Behind Enemy Lines"" thrown in, no worse a movie for it. Great camaradarie between the characters, good story, good movie. 7/10"

","The movie has all qualities of a good war movie. Good action, humanity, compassion and dirty side of war. The action scenes are well executed. It's like you are watching a fighting scene from an actual footage.<br/><br/>It's the stories of heroes who don't give up for their country or for humanity. One of the good war movies in recent times."

","The detailing, the editing is superb, it keeps you wait till the end, the storytelling is very interesting, the slowness which some people will find boring is the charm of the movie for who really like to watch a good film, all the actors have given great performance,a must watch movie for all"

","Not a very great movie. The sniper shooting sequence(s) are good. But too much flash back stuffs, sometimes it's hard to follow the play. The actors are not well experienced in acting and especially reactions. I don't still understand the purpose of Nabat's character played by Açelya Özcan. I think she is just an eye candy for the viewers..."
