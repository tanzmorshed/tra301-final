","8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the ""Free World,"" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing."

","I was afraid of this movie. For a long time I feared that one day, Eminem WOULD make a movie - and that movie would suck!!!!<br/><br/>Along it came, and you know what? It didn't suck. Man, was I relieved. <br/><br/>I have never been able to put a finger on Mr. Mathers' rapping skills, I think his technique is amazing. His rhymes are sharp and intelligent and he always performs them with pure justification. But could he take this to the big screen? He succeeded. In his debut movie he managed to play it real and natural. He had good on screen chemistry with pretty much all the characters, but especially with Brittany Murphy (Uh, gotta love that sex scene... That was hot.)<br/><br/>The final battles in the movie, are the absolute climax. If you ever had any doubts about Eminmems talents - one way or the other - you definitely know his worth now!<br/><br/><ul><li>Some might say that it must be easy to play yourself, and it's not a secret that this movie is somewhat autobiographic. But it sure takes guts to put yourself out there like that, well done.</li></ul><br/><br/>So 8/10"

","This movie was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised! I wasn't an Eminem fan going into the movie but I'm certainly one now. Seeing how different things are on the 'other side of the tracks' was a big eye opener for me.  I loved the script, the actors, the music - basically I loved everything all the way down to the lighting.  It's got everything for everyone in it! Comedy, drama, action, fighting, guns, drugs, sex, and of course - Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16-year-old friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway - go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!"

"Chris Knipp","Null","121","145","11 November 2002"," Powerful silences
","Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop.  But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.<br/><br/>It's surprising - admirable, really - how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit's problems with his mother, Stephanie Smith -- Kim Basinger.  Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can't help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy, a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor.  Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive, just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in `L.A. Confidential' six years ago.  Rabbit's problems with girlfriends aren't significant, though he has two of them, an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection.  Rabbit's closest relationships are with his emcee pal `Future' (played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer) and his slightly retarded token white homie, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones).<br/><br/>But his closest relationship of all is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do:  get on friendly working terms with who he is.  The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene.  The comparison with Shakespeare's Henry IV isn't out of place.  The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves' character in `My Own Private Idaho' but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn't a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant's movie. He is close to his mates and they're always touching hands and gently hugging each other.  The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing `8 Mile.'<br/><br/>Eminem as shown in `8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained.  He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it --  to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend.  It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.<br/><br/>Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.  Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.  His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.<br/><br/>`8 Mile' isn't just a vehicle for Eminem.  It's too well made a movie to be that.  But without Eminem `8 Mile' wouldn't exist.  The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them.  You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.<br/><br/>`8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic.  There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star.  The whole focus is on his personality, and in particular his stillness.  The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike.  Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power.  In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.<br/><br/>This rapper is good just standing there."
"Chuckles11","Null","71","88","8 November 2002"," Dark but interesting
","I enjoyed this movie immensely. I thought it was a departure from the typical movies that star Hip-hop artists nowadays, which typically glorify the hip-hop lifestyle. Which is a very material lifestyle. This movie was pretty dark.<br/><br/>I thought Eminem did a good job acting. I mean he's not going to win any Oscars for this role, but he does a very good job acting. If not for who he is, then you wouldn't pay too much attention to his acting because that's how competent he does.<br/><br/>As most of you already have heard, this movie was based on Eminem's life, but none of the events are actually factual. His relationship with his mother (Basinger) is much more amiable than it is in real life, or at least how it comes across in his music.<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy acts as his love interest, but most importantly his muse.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that leave you scratching your head. One of which is the Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant. It seems out of place and bad for the pacing of the film. Also Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The presence of her character is a key plot element that sets up the film, but the appearance of her character in the film by its end seems unnecessary due to the fact that it is underdeveloped. I wonder if there were more scenes involving Manning that were ultimately deleted via editing.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie. Some may not enjoy it as much, but that's probably because they go into the movie with different expectations. If you're expecting something other than a hip-hop based film that subtly comments on social/economic/racial issues, and is a pseudo-rags to riches story, then you  might be sorely disappointed."
"dee.reid","10","198","258","9 November 2002"," A warm reception for Eminem fans everywhere
","""8 Mile"" is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. ""Rabbit"", a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through ""battles"", which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new.<br/><br/>""8 Mile"" certainly is a moving and very touching drama.  Eminem proves here that he really can act and in fact may have a future in motion pictures. This does not mean we will be hearing him thanking his producer Paul Rosenberg next year at the Oscars, but we can expect to him to receive a lot of praise for future movie roles.  It's quite obvious that some people will not like ""8 Mile"", just because of Eminem's controversial history.  The film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Eminem's hit single ""Lose Yourself"" really does have a lot emotion put into it.   <br/><br/>
Eminem, since he burst onto the music scene in 1999 with his critically-acclaimed/lambasted album ""The Slim Shady LP"", he has been met with a lot of controversy, as well as praise.  Despite the often humorous content of his songs, there are many dark under tones in them as well.  In my opinion, too much has been made about his lyrics, most of which revolve around topics like homophobia, murder, and his failed relationship with his on/off wife, Kim.  Despite all of this, I think that people have overlooked the fact that he said the only thing that truly matters to him is his daughter, Hailie Jade.  Also, if people believed Eminem really was a homophobic, do you still think he would have agreed to perform ""Stan"" with Elton John?  <br/><br/>As a longtime fan of Eminem and his music, I try not to let such criticisms get to me, but sometimes you just have to say ""What the hell?  Are they really necessary?""  I don't think so.  The problem is that people today are just too biased when it comes to people like Eminem.  He's not another Vanilla Ice and ""8 Mile"" is not an attempt to cash in on his success like ""Cool As Ice"" was.  <br/><br/>I have a list of grievances that people need to realize about Eminem:<br/><br/><ul><li>First of all, do not disrespect this man.  I feel that many of the people who hate Eminem have never actually listened to one of his songs.  In my opinion, they have only listened to small clips that have been played on some discussion about his controversial lyrics.  If you actually listened to some of his songs, you'll realize that he is a very distraught young person with a lot to say.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Don't watch ""8 Mile"" with a predetermined mindset.  People who have already made up their minds about Eminem's talents are less likely to enjoy themselves much more than people who believe in him.  </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>To non-believers, if Eminem really did not have any talent, like so many people seem to think now, how is it that all of his records: ""The Slim Shady LP"", ""The Marshall Mathers LP"", ""Devils Night"" (with group D-12) and ""The Eminem Show"" together have grossed more than $12 million?  I think that it is a clear sign of TRUE TALENT.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Also do you believe had Eminem been black and rapping about such ""controversial"" subject matter, that he would be famous like he is now?  No, because most likely no one would dare even produce him.  That said, I'm African-American and I don't care that Eminem is white and is rapping about such things.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I think that too many people have made his race too big of an issue. Eminem knows that he is white and will be nothing else.  He does not display to us a ""thuggish"" image that some people think that any rapper should have. Also, he does not rap about the things that some people seem to think is destroying rap music.</li></ul><br/><br/>Eminem does have quite a future in store for him.  I'm sure that we can expect to be seeing a lot more of him later on."

","8 mile is the best movie i have ever seen.
the story of this movie is about Eminem life and what he had done for become what he is now. from when everyone bully him to when everyone respected him and his music 
if you count Eminem is not an actor he done very well as a protagonist.
I recommend this movie because Eminem is one of the best artist in the work and who follow him have to see it for understand what he went through when he was younger."
"poetic_tyrant","Null","41","53","1 December 2003"," Ok, I need to say something.
","I was moving around IMDB just now trying to sort of fill in the blanks of some random credits that I'd missed in my movie catalog, and I ran across this review of 8 Mile from this college student in NYC. Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the ""magic"" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as ""if you liked this film, you know nothing about film"" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.<br/><br/>First off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the ""culture"" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or ""hard"", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>For those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.<br/><br/>Now, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.<br/><br/>To close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.<br/><br/>See this movie."

","8 Mile is a 2002 hip hop drama film starring Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy and Michael Shannon. The movie is directed by Curtis Hanson. <br/><br/>The Plot: The year is 1995 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith,
 Jr. (Eminem), a worker and a poor man, struggles with life. He has moved back north of 8 Mile Road to a run-down trailer home in Warren, Michigan. There he lives with his alcoholic mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger), his little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), and Stephanie's abusive boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon). Jimmy is a rapper who his friends think that he is very talented. However, Jimmy has a lack of confidence about his ability. This anxiety causes him to choke and lose his rap battle at the hip-hop venue, ""The Shelter"", leaving the stage utterly humiliated.<br/><br/>Jimmy works at New Detroit Stamping (a car factory). When he asks for extra shifts, his supervisor laughs in his face and rejects his request due to Jimmy's lateness to work. Jimmy becomes friends with Alex (Brittany Murphy). Over time, Jimmy becomes a lot more responsible for his actions and behaviors in the directions of his life. After he gains much improvement in his work ethic and behavior, his supervisor grants his request for extra shifts that he gave earlier.<br/><br/>Stephanie receives a notice declaring that, because she and her family can not afford to pay the rent on her trailer, she and her family must vacate the premises immediately. Stephanie tries to keep it a secret, but Greg eventually finds out about it. Greg and Jimmy have a long and brutal fight, and when it's over, Greg leaves Stephanie for good. Jimmy has friend named Wink (Eugene Byrd), a radio DJ with links to a famous record label. Their friendship becomes torn after Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, ""The Leaders of the Free World"", a hip-hop group. Jimmy and his friends get into a brawl with the Free World and Jimmy's friend Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones) takes out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg. He survives but is crippled and has to wear crutches.<br/><br/>On lunch break at work one day, Mike (Xzibit), a lunch truck rapper insults a gay co-worker Paul (Craig Chandler). Jimmy joins the battle, roasting Mike and defending Paul. Alex is impressed by his actions and they go out on a date. Wink arranges for Jimmy to have a recording of a rap demo done at JLB, but when Jimmy gets there, he sees Wink doing it with Alex. Enraged, Jimmy beats up Wink. Alex yells at him to stop and eventually he does. In revengeful style or retaliation, the Free World assaults Jimmy and Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the gang, nearly kills Jimmy before being persuaded not to by Wink.<br/><br/>Jimmy's beast friend and rap-host David ""Future"" Porter (Mekhi Phifer) encourages him to get revenge by competing against the Free World at the next rap battler at The Shelter. Jimmy's work conflicts with this, but Paul covers for him as a thank you for what Jimmy did earlier. Jimmy goes to the battle.<br/><br/>Jimmy competes against the members of the Free World in every battle. 1st Round 1 - Lickety Split - wins. Round 2 - Lotto - wins. After winning the first two rounds he has to face Poppa Doc, the gang leader and the defending Rap Battle Champion. Jimmy raps first and exposes both his and Poppa Doc's weaknesses. Embarrassed with nothing to say back at Jimmy, Poppa Doc gives the mic back to Future. Jimmy wins the battle and is declared the NEW RAP BATTLE CHAMPION!<br/><br/>After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Future offers him a position as rap-battle host, alongside himself. Jimmy declines the offer stating he has to get back to work and make success on his own. He walks back to work with confidence and hope for the future. <br/><br/>A rap masterpiece. 10/10."
"Showtime840","9","88","122","11 November 2002"," Excellent Drama
","I don't care for too many dramas, but ""8 mile"" was an excellent movie. Eminem was a better actor than I could have dreamed for him to be. He put on a great show, and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job, but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was ""Bless the Child"" and that was a major let down.<br/><br/>
As for the plot, don't go into the movie thinking that you're going to see the life of Eminem. This is not about Eminem's life. Eminem said it himself in an interview. Mekhi Phifer even said that he didn't want to do the movie because he thought it was about Eminem's life and that Hollywood was just trying to take advantage of a rising star, but this isn't the case. This is just as any other movie, but this is Eminem's acting debut. Even though there are certain things in the movie that relate to Eminem's life (ex. 8 Mile Road,) this is certainly NOT an autobiography. <br/><br/>If you go into ""8 mile"" expecting to see an action film with explosions and such then you're in for a let down. ""8 Mile"" is an amazing story about a white wannabe rapper trying to make it in the underground world of rapping. There isn't much action in this at all because it is a DRAMA, not an action. I hope you go see this movie if your in for a good story with some great characters!"
"malikona","8","64","88","10 November 2002"," 8 Mile will have potent impact on America's youth.
","It is rare that an established filmmaker and production company create something that young people are able to grasp the complete meaning of. Intellectual jargon or unnecessary vagueness of plot often take precedence over lucidity and appeal.<br/><br/>Eminem's ""8 Mile"" has managed to break this cycle, presenting in poignant audio/video style the nature of the life so many of our nation's youth live, and how despite it all there always remains the possibility to break through.<br/><br/>The film's meaning is largely overt, not subtle, and makes itself available to a much wider variety of viewers than most films with any sort of dramatic moral.  Just look at the box office reports for ""8 Mile""s opening weekend.<br/><br/>I won't attempt to speculate on the effect the film will have among our youth, but I personally believe it will be positive in nature.  It will be impossible for this film to become as transient as an action blockbuster or as esoteric as a cult classic.  It's depth and range of appeal are simply unparalleled in our time."

"RedOnTyson","7","87","142","26 November 2002"," Good, but nowhere near perfect
","8 Mile tells the story of a white kid on the wrong side of the tracks living in Detroit with a dead end job and a trailer park mom.  Deep inside, he aspires to break free from the chains of the reality of his life through the poetry and passion and rawness of rap; the one place he can possibly gain a feeling of purpose and hear his own voice.  Obviously, it's no big secret that this storyline runs very parallel to that of of Eminem's own roots and his own aspirations.  Where fiction and reality collide is blurred and that works for the picture.  First off, I think Curtis Hanson did a great job rebuilding that world and protecting his novice lead.  He understood the material and I was drawn in to the world that he recreated.  Also, the cinematography widely lends itself towards upping the ante of the picture and making you feel the authenticity of a world and a place where many of us have never traveled nor never will.  As for Eminem himself, at first I found him a little stoic, but given the fact that this guy has never acted before, regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, I thought he did a decent job in front of the camera.  Hanson was wise to protect his lead with awesome supporting work from Mekhi Phifer and pretty much everyone else that portrays his friends and peers in the film.  Eminem obviously was a little green and surrounding him with these actors gave the movie and Eminem's journey more credence.  Brittany Murphy was also very good, but I found her character to be a bit expedient.  She definitely was not used to her full potential and I felt that if they had used her relationship with Rabbit to a larger or deeper extent, it only would have lent more to the film. One of the scenes I was most impressed with was the sex scene between Murphy and Eminem.  Gone were the Hollywood antics of glossing it up or ghetto fabulous and I felt that Hanson captured something that was fascinating, uncomfortable and realistic that I haven't seen in a Hollywood film before.<br/><br/> Now for what I feel made this movie not rise to the top...  First off, when Kim Basinger first came on the screen and opened her mouth, I thought the rest of the film was going to be destined for failure.  Not only was she weak in the role, she was grossly miscast.  There are so many actresses in that age range that I find it mind boggling that Basinger was used for something in which she stood out like a fish out of water.  The film also almost lost me in the beginning due to the length of the first scene in the bathroom when Eminem is psyching himself up.  The placement of the scene wasn't a problem but it went on way too long - I would have prepared an edited down version.  If you're watching Robert DeNiro for that long looking in a mirror, yes, it'll probably work, but to put that type of pressure on a first timer with no training, especially since it's shortly followed by Basinger's first scene was a risky move and one that I think they could have found a better choice for.  The other thing that kept this film from being a totally strong film for me was the screenplay itself.  I kept finding myself asking why the hell Scott Silver had some of these extraneous scenes in the story.  There was a good story to be told here and a whole world to be explored by the general public that doesn't know that much of it, and the script and film could have and should have been a good 25 minutes shorter and tighter.<br/><br/> Anyway, still an intriguing film.  And interesting insight into a different side of life and I commend Eminem for taking the risk.  It's a lot to bite off and half the country is just dying for a chance to decimate him.  If for nothing else, this film is worth the last 5 minutes.  When he was up there battling, I actually started clapping and cheering out loud in the theater - no matter where he stands as an actor, when he's in his domain, he is fantastic, whether you like what he's saying or not.<br/><br/> A 7 out of 10 for a movie that was actually worth spending a budget on. Not perfect, but definitely it's own thing with some good moments.  And when they're good, they're really good."

","Jimmy Rabbit is a white kid on the poor (black) side of town.  Growing up with this influence he has developed rapping skills but is too intimidated to showcase in the cruel `Shelter' battles.  Split from his girlfriend, Jimmy returns to his Mum's trailer park home and her young boyfriend.  He keeps his job in a pressing shop while working on his rhymes and trying to work out who, out of all the hopes and promises, will be able to help him work his way out of Detroit.<br/><br/>After missing preview screenings and not being able to go when friends went, I eventually saw this a few nights ago.  I was maybe better prepared by this point because the hype had been watered down by a few bad or balanced reviews of the film in the media.  This helped me lower my expectations so that I wasn't let down.  The plot is, well, difficult to describe because there isn't really one narrative to speak of, rather it is Rabbit's story. As a result it is a little rambling with things just drifting through the film.  However that it still works is to it's credit.  The film holds the attention and the story still has enough in it to follow it.<br/><br/>The telling is what does it the best I think.  The direction is good, with washed out cameras not willing to glamorise anything.  The biggest smart move was the liberal use of hip-hop through the film.  Occasionally we get a beat of a song but it isn't wall to wall music like many rapper's films. Even where a Eminem track is played, Em's voice is limited to a few broken up words  saving his skills for the climax.  Some of the film doesn't work  I got tired of several rap scenes in everyday situations and it didn't grasp me as reality (although in fairness I don't know if this is the norm in some lives).  Also there are a few too many scenes of meaningless violence that didn't come across as normal life for Rabbit but instead felt like the film trying to show Rabbit to be tough and ready for action.<br/><br/>It is difficult to write a fair review after seeing the climax  which his why I left it a few days before writing this.  The climax is a series of short battles in the Shelter that are pumping and exciting.  Not to spoil it but some of the rapper's lines are cool  until Em takes his turns and rips the place down.  It was so funny and funky that I wished that he had made some of his own joints that sharp in his recent Benzino disses.  This is where he shines in the role but he also does well generally  maybe not worthy of an Oscar nomination but certainly very good.  He makes his character likeable but not easily, and he avoids being a sympathy figure.<br/><br/>Phieffer is not as good and didn't convince me as well as I've seen him do. He can act but here he is not really a good character.  The support cast are all pretty good and are believable and only a few are clear stereotypical groups.  Happily the usual rapper cameos are minimal and not in your face too much.  There may be more but I only spotted Xhibit and Obi Trise and neither of them took anything away by their presence.  Murphy is pretty good  sexy yet trashy  but her character and her sub-plot didn't really have anywhere to go and just became another part of the wandering story. Basinger is OK but she isn't as bad as I expected her to be (or felt she needed to be).  She didn't need to be like his Mum in the songs, but a little less `victim of circumstance' would have helped buy into it.<br/><br/>The message is worthy but heavily made and the story part of the film just didn't totally come off for me  instead it was a bit ordinary and not well written.  However the telling makes it worth seeing  the direction is pretty good and the liberal use of music is one of the many good touches, meanwhile Eminem ensures that it is always worth watching  whether doing witty disses in a car park, ripping the opposition in a battle or just being understated in a good role.  Understated!  Now there's a thing I thought I'd never say again about a rapper in a lead role of a film since Pac died!<br/><br/>Like him or loathe him, Eminem prevents an average (at best) story being unwatchable by the sheer strength of his presence.  However those who aren't fans of hip-hop or Eminem may wish to avoid this, as there ain't too much else on offer."
"markbigtimber","8","6","7","16 January 2019"," Eminem raps his Way into the Hollywood Spotlight
","It doesn't matter whether you listen to rap a lot and are an Eminem fan or heard of his music occasionally on the radio, ""8 mile"" does an exceptional job at captivating the audience to the point that by the end of the movie, you are rooting for ""Rabbit"" - the nickname for eminem used in the film - to win and succeed. ""8 mile"" is about the backstory of a famous rapper at the time of its release in 2002, Eminem starring as himself in the movie. The story takes place in 1995 in Eminem's hometown of Detroit, which adds credibility and a realisticness to the story line.<br/><br/>He grows up in a poor neighborhood ""across 8 mile road"", a road which is mentioned many times throughout the film and very strategically. 8 mile road is used as a symbol in the film of the barrier the poor ""white trash"" lifestyle ""Bunny Rabbit"" is living in during most of the film to the rich and famous lifestyle full of power and clout that ""Eminem"" reaches after the film, and aspires to reach during the movie.<br/><br/>The filmmakers did an excellent job making this story line based off the life of Eminem seem to be real. Even though it is not 100% an accurate documentary like some of the rapper themed movies that were coming out at the time, ""Biggie and Tupac""(2002) or ""Rhyme and Reason""(1997), it still displays similar emotional aspects to what you would think he may have gone through. Convincing the viewer of this realistic storyline creates some extra emotional attachment to Eminem (Rabbit) making it all the more intriguing even for those not interested in rap or not familiar with Eminem and his backstory.<br/><br/>This rebelliousness you see in ""8 mile"" is a common theme in many films especially those coming out around this time. The style of the movie was also somewhat basic. The classic underdog movie where in this case a poor person grows up under harsh conditions and finds a way to get success and achieve his dreams is not as creative as it could be and is very common historically in films such as the ""Rocky"" series or ""Karate Kid"". This lack of creativity makes the film very predictable as you are never during the film left wondering whether or not Eminem will win the final rap battle or get the respect he aspires because it is blatantly obvious he will. Besides the basic aspects of the film it still does a great job portraying the life of a unique and obscure character in Eminem.<br/><br/>Another thing that the movie does well is its use of subtle yet specific camera angles. Towards the beginning of the movie, Eminem's first rap battle is displayed with a close up of his face for an extended period of time looking very nervous and still, while towards the final scene of him rapping in front of the crowd they specifically chose a low angle shot of Eminem looking down on the crowd and at his opponent as well conveying his power and confidence in that scene. This does a good job of showing how Eminem's character has grown from his mistakes and gained more confidence. *Once again a common theme but still a strong one*.<br/><br/>The editing in the film is minimal and not noticeable. The soundtrack is great and is well placed in scenes creating an uplifting and badass emotion while watching Eminem embark his journey into the spotlight."

","I am probably one of the biggest Eminem fans walking this earth, so automatically I'm going to love this movie. But in reality, I do really love this movie, even if Eminem wasn't the main actor. It really is able to portray the life of those less fortunate than most, looking to get to their dream.<br/><br/>Of course right away most think this movie is about Eminem's life but it truly isn't. There are tiny little facts that can relate to him (having 4 guys that are always there for him, and one main one...which would be D12 and Proof being his best friend) but the movie isn't about his life. If it were, then he definitely wouldn't be on good terms with his mother in the movie and the little girl would be his actual daughter.<br/><br/>Eminem does an excellent acting job, along with Mekhi. The story is really moving and shows a great development in Eminem's character, Rabbit. I really loved this movie and although Eminem had a lot to do with it, it'd still be incredible without him playing that character."

","The end credits rolled, and I made my mind up that the movie had dissapointed me, but 8 Mile is for the intelligent. Upon introspection, I realised that the very essence of 8 Mile was its non-flashy, keeping it real kind of setting. Honestly I expected a rags to riches story, but I got the exact opposite. The movie is the story about one and a half months in a young white man's life, where his mindset undergoes major change. When you realise that the movie is trying to show this, it starts to shine, when you realise the 'realness' of the movie it shines even more, and finally when you watch Bunny Rabbit walk of the screen with a peace sign in the air, no better than he was in the start, with 'Lose Yourself' jiving in the background, you know the movie is worth it. Watch the movie, enjoy the battle scenes, decide its nothing great, but then give it some thought, you'll see what I see. 8/10."
"sickar","9","5","6","13 March 2019"," Amazing movie
","Everyone somewhat has an hip-hop culture is like: drugs, money, and rapping. However, 8 mile goes way more in depth than that. It shows the real struggles that the main character, Jimmy goes through not only to be respected as a white rapper but just to support himself. It shows not only the physical but mental barriers that he has to go through to achieve his goals. It doesn't only focus on the struggles he faces while rapping but the struggles he faces daily at work and at home.
This movie focuses on Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) as he struggles to try and achieve his dream while dealing with problems at home and work. He had to move back home with his alcoholic mom, her new boyfriend, and his little sister, Lily, he doesn't have a car because he gave it to his ex girlfriend, and he has a bad job at a stamping plant. To make matters worse, his dream, to become a rapper, seems nearly impossible. He has skills but nobody will even listen to him because he's white and nobody around him thinks he can rap except for his friends. Throughout the movie, Jimmy has to take care of problems at home and work while trying to gain respect in the hip-hop community in Detroit.
8 mile is something different. Unlike most movies about celebrities' lives, (even though this movie is loosely based on Eminem's life) this movie doesn't focus on the person becoming famous, it focuses on the struggles it takes to be recognized even on a very small scale. Given the cast and premise, you'd probably expect 8 Mile to be an over-exaggerated version of hip-hop culture or a movie just showing how great Eminem is. However, this movie is neither of those things. It's not even about Eminem, although it does loosely follow his life. There's also the fact that this movie does a great job of realistically portraying hip-hop culture. The cinematography is perfect, it's mainly shot in Detroit and has lots of nitty gritty shots that fit the whole, almost gray tone of the majority of the movie, going well with the natural, realistic feeling the movie has.
Of course, like every movie, it has its flaws, but 8 Mile definitely doesn't have many. The grayness and bleakness can be a little overshadowing and the ""villians"" in the movie, the ""Free World"" are perhaps a little over exaggerated but the solid acting makes up for it.
Not to mention, probably my favorite part, 8 Mile has rapping, lots of it. Obviously, this is a main plot of the film but it's integrated in a way that it fits in with the rest of the film. The rapping is so amazingly done, the way the actors deliver their lines makes it feel like it's not scripted and they are real people actually trying to win the rap battles. The best part is with Eminem's character and how they integrated just the character, not him into the it, the rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper. Also, it's always great to watch someone just get totally roasted which happens constantly throughout the movie, not just to other character's but to Jimmy (Eminem) as well. It's also a plus that Eminem does a great job portraying Jimmy Smith throughout the film. In no doubt because he resembles that character.
All in all, 8 Mile is a great movie. Sure, sometimes it's a little bleak but the great acting and real- life feeling of the film more than make up for it. I'd recommend this movie if you like the Rocky movies, or if you've watched and enjoyed movies like Straight Outta Compton, Notorious, All Eyez on Me and if you're a fan of hip-hop. Although, I would really recommend this movie for anyone who wants to watch just a good movie, I think anyone would enjoy this movie, it's that great."

But the movie does not tell the full life story of Eminem in particular, instead it's more about the life of Jimmy Smith or as they call him 'B-Rabbit'.. Eminem and Rabbit have similar life styles, both had a tough upbringing, not a very sweet mother, trouble with money, trouble with life and trouble with making it BIG as an rapper.

","Curtis Hanson is turning out to be one of our great directors.  LA CONFIDENTIAL was a look at LA during the 1950's that was near perfection as far as films are concerned.  WONDER BOYS was a highly entertaining look at characters who live in PITTSBURGH, again the city was as much a character as any of the actors.<br/><br/> Now Curtis brings us a look at DETROIT in 8 MILE and I was so impressed. Yes I am a fan of Eminem and yes I think he's cute (that combination of bad boy and lost little boy is just irresistible) but the movie is a quality drama which I think all audiences will appreciate if only they'd open their minds a little and go see it.<br/><br/> I was so happy to be in a theater with a mostly under 25 crowd (at 31 I was the oldest person in the place!) and we were there to watch a quality film about a kind of life that most of us can only imagine.  The audience of young people were silent at first - the anticipation of Eminem's entrance was almost palpable.  And throughout the film the audience continued to be engrossed by the realistic characters and the story.  A whole audience entertained by drama and acting and not one special effect!  Not one!<br/><br/> We weren't there to watch a stupid brainless action film or a gross-out comedy.  8 MILE is one of those classic films that most A-list actors can only hope to appear in maybe once or twice during a long career and it's the kind Eminem makes on his first time out?  The boy has brains for sure and talent.  I don't think the John Garfield, James Dean comparisons are too far off - Eminem  has charisma to spare.  I don't think I want to see him continue to do more acting because 98% of the films he could do are such crap.  How do you follow up a truly great film like this?<br/><br/> I'm so impressed.  I just hope that older people and hip-hop haters will get out and see this film too, it'll open their minds."

","""8 Mile"" forcefully brings rock' n' roll movies into the 21st century.<br/><br/>While it has striking similarities to Elvis Presley and Beatles movies in how it uses autobiographical elements to make its similarly charismatic lead star comfortable in a new medium to sort of present his own story, Curtis Hanson's direction and the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto (of ""Amores Perros"") create a thrilling environment for him to explode.<br/><br/>Like ""L.A. Confidential,"" Hanson is terrific at getting up close in macho environments and bringing us right into their verbal and actual violence. While I'm quite sure my ignorance of hip hop slang and culture led me to miss references and the point of much conversation, it did seem to me that Hanson captured the why and how behind Eminem's rage.<br/><br/>The movie's climax is the epiphany when his constructive genius takes over as he learns to channel his anger into his lyrics, and to even take it a level beyond the insulting toasting of the local Detroit battle-of-the-rappers to forge a new persona (what will eventually become Slim Shady among other images) and a new kind of rap that will sweep the nation.<br/><br/>It is ironic that here in Detroit (or as the dialog and the credits call it - the 313) how few of the young adults have cars (even though Eminem's character is working in an auto parts plant), and are constantly cadging rides from each other to avoid the humiliation of taking the bus. <br/><br/>Of course the women in this desolate Motor City, that is an urban recall of the ""Mad Max"" movies, are either beloved innocents or are traitorously duplicitous; I was taken aback how much of a calculating groupie Brittany Murphy's character is, unlike the usual devoted, loyal girlfriend in such movies.<br/><br/>If the closing song is originally written for the movie (and I don't know if the sing-along audience had seen the movie before or knew the soundtrack), it should be considered for Academy Award ""Best Song"" as it brilliantly describes the movie and the character's post-life. <br/><br/>It was not appropriate, however, for a parent in the row behind me to bring a small child to this film (and not just because the kid talked through the whole movie); even if they expose them to profanity-laded rap music at home, this is a mature movie with mature scenes that would be quite disturbing to young children.<br/><br/>(originally written 12/15/2002)"

I did howewer like the unique way he put words together and the peculiar rhythm which somehow seemed to flow more naturally than Shakespeare.

","Even people who are not familiar with Eminem and his music (and, quite possibly, people who can't stand either of them) can enjoy 8 Mile because even though it is obviously a film based closely on his own life, it does not require any previous knowledge about him or his life or his music in order to understand and enjoy the film.<br/><br/>
Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., a young white kid living in a trailer park in Detroit with his trashy mother and who aspires to succeed in the rap music industry. The thing to consider here is that it's already known that Smith is going to succeed, which is the only theory that I can come up with as to why they left out that last act, where he actually does succeed.<br/><br/>
Rap music is unfortunately associated almost entirely with people who are p**sed off at the world, hence the fact that every rap star in the world is frowning with all his might on the cover of every CD. Given that, it may not have been a good idea to see Smith succeed and get a reason to smile at the end of the film, because a happy ending would cancel out the need for angry rap music. On the other hand, it is more than a little disappointing to see the movie build up for the whole time to the scene where Smith is finally successful in the underground battle, only to skulk out of there with the same mopy attitude that he had throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>
Eminem is very successful in his role, even generating some early Oscar buzz (I was pretty impressed, but I'm not sure I'd go THAT far.) because he understands the material so well. He is basically playing himself, telling his own story, so he's had his whole life to think about this and he knows exactly what he wants his audience to see. He also avoids the fate of being yet another musician who turns to acting, only to release a film that often is catastrophic to the rest of their career. Britney Spears has recently made this mistake by performing in the hideous crapfest Crossroads. I think that the reason Eminem succeeds so well in his role is because he is not pretending to be someone else which, given the content of his music, is not something that he would probably be good at. Instead of a flailing musician trying out acting, 8 Mile instead comes across sort of like a film version of an autobiography.<br/><br/>
Kim Basinger adds wonderfully to the film as Smith's mother, who's dating a guy the same age as her son and who reveals shocking sexual details to him, somehow hoping that he can give her advice. I loved Roger Ebert's counterargument to people who say that she's just too beautiful to play such a poor woman, saying in his review of 8 Mile that, given the amount of ugly people who live in huge houses, there should be no reason that a poor woman couldn't be beautiful. Brittany Murphy provides an interesting romantic interest, perfectly capturing the skanky nature that you would expect from the kind of person that her character is, but she is the second biggest loose end in the film, right after the fate of the main character. It is clear that she was sleeping with whoever she met that she felt would be the most successful, so obviously she and Jimmy can't make up and get back together at the end, although they exchange a look just after his victory at the battle that suggests that he either forgives her for what she did, or she has just changed her mind about who has the brightest future and is ready to come back and start having sex with him again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regardless, however, of these weaknesses, 8 Mile is an inspiring film that comes along at a time when an inspiring film is very much needed, among all the goofy action and cheesy junior high school crap that's pumped out in record quantities these days. It doesn't show how Eminem came to be the phenomenally successful rapper that he is today, but instead portrays a young kid from a poor neighborhood who focuses on a goal and achieves it, even in an area in which he is clearly an outsider.<br/><br/>

I've seen it time and time again, and I'm going to keep seeing it until the end of time. Yes, it is that good! So believe me when I say, watch it dog, watch it today.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with both action and comedy, brilliant music and awesome beats. It has got hot chicks, drunken bastards, gang wars and stupid dicks. The start, ending and the rest of the movie was simply brilliant. So I won't get started and describing or saying anything else about any of that. It started at the bottom and it worked its way up, until it hit the top. It has got a lot of different characters. Characters that's played by great actors. There was no bad acting in this movie, not one bit! The script is brilliant, because it is simply brilliant and great in every way, and the fact that it's based on a story from the real world doesn't hurt either. This movie is just 2 hours of brilliancy! That is all there is to say about that.<br/><br/>So, it is filled with loads of great scenes and awesomeness. The best part though I must admit was the lyrics they came up with. When you see this movie, and you really should, pay attention and listen to what they rap, the wordplays, the rhymes, the insults and the funny words that come out of their mouths. And if you have already seen it, watch it again, you know you won't be sorry.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on about how great this movie was and the fact that I couldn't find a single bad thing to say about it even though I have probable seen it 30 times or so (I am not kidding. That Is not a lye or overstatement, that is the truth.) but there is no point in going on saying that the rapping and all the other music was great and that I know the lyrics to all the rap-offs in this movie, word by word, or that it is so great that it is a sin to go your entire life without watching it. There is no point to it because you already know all this. I have already said it was perfect, give or take and that nothing is negative about it so going on and on about how unbelievably awesome it is, it's just a waste of time. So I am going to end this right here and right now. I am giving 8 mile 10/10 stars and with a perfect score I highly recommend it and expect that you see it as soon as you can get your lazy ass out of that chair and away from your computer screen and move it over into the couch in front of the TV.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 Goodnight, bonsoir, guten nacht, god natt and Buenos noches.<br/><br/>Peace & love God Bless <br/><br/><ul><li>J.J.Shevy</li></ul>"

","8 miles for me is probably the best film in the film industry. The film perfectly illustrates the life of a poor white guy who pushes his way to fame. This path was very difficult for Marshall. The film clearly shows how Eminem was not respected because of his skin color. As on rap battles shouted to him: ""Fuh, white."" But this did not stop him, and he sold it further on rap. Besides this problem, he had problems with housing, with my mother's ear, and with the mother who was very fond of playing, and lost all the money in bingo. The main character has very remarkable friends who, despite his skin color, supported him and helped him. This film is semi-author biography, the famous rapper Eminem, that is part of the film is fiction. I thought for a long time how Marshall acted as an actor, it turned out that he plays as well as he reads rap. And the soundtrack of the film deserves special attention."

","Eminem is a `wonder-boy' product of the whitebread underclass of outraged, disenfranchised youths  from a bleak Detroit in ` 8 Mile.' Curtis Hanson directed `Wonder Boys' with the same sense of caring about youths emerging for better or worse into their adulthood. But the star of this film is Eminem, and although it is a fictional story about Jimmy Smith, Jr. (called `Rabbit'), it is a loose adaptation of Eminem's rise from the ghetto of Detroit, on the dividing line of the 8-mile strip separating blacks from whites.<br/><br/>The comparison with `Rocky' is inevitable and not wholly inappropriate. In sports and rap, blacks have proven formidable.  When a white like Rocky or Eminem can emerge as a powerful force in either field, the world has to notice, and films have to record and adapt.  Eminem's astounding ability to rhyme and chant obliterates all color barriers.<br/><br/>For a white guy like myself, the joy of `8 Mile' has nothing to do with turning up my nose at the brothers with my own white hope; rather it is the exhilaration of seeing and hearing young people fight with `vocabulary' rather than guns.  Rhyme and reason rule. The art form is important as it comments both on culture and creativity. <br/><br/>Director Hanson said, ""I saw here an opportunity to make a serious movie about the emotional struggles of contemporary adolescents in this country. This captures the angst, insecurity, frustration and anger, search for direction and identity.""  That statement emphasizes the teenage universal search rather than the obvious power of hip-hop, to Hanson's credit. The producer, Brian Grazer, also made  `A Beautiful Mind,' another exploration of genius that transcended math in favor of the search by a gifted human being for a place to be himself.<br/><br/>This fictional biography doesn't claim to be a definitive revelation of the difficult rise of Eminem.  It does show the inner struggle of Rabbit to break from the comfort of having a job in an auto factory, similar to Bjork's bleak plant in `Dancer in the Dark,' or striking out into creative territory dominated by blacks but promising release from the trailer park where his mother (Kim Basinger) is imprisoned. Lost in this somewhat sanitized adaptation is the angry homophobia and misogyny so characteristic of Eminem in real life.  But gained is the sense that hip-hop is an important cultural contribution even white boys can offer."

"ironhorse_iv","7","4","6","22 June 2014"," You can lose yourself in 8-Mile. It's a pretty good movie.
","It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson, the movie is a semi-autobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit, struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy ""B-Rabbit' Smith, whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way, he could show the world, he meets business, is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit, Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie borderlines Eminem real life. Instead of the crazy Eminem Slim Shady that spit out hateful, violent, and somewhat silly lyrics, ranging from killing his wife, homophobia to making jokes about celebs. You really get a motivational type of a film about going after your dreams. You really see, Eminem as Jimmy grow into a positive responsibility for the direction of his life. It was very mature. Honestly, I don't think this movie would had work, if it's was all about moaning and groaning Slim Shady. I glad, Eminem took this seriously. After all, after this movie, his music had gotten more serious, and less Slim Shady like. Eminem even took an Oscar for Best Song that year for ""Lose Yourself"". It was the first time a rap/hip-hop song win an Academy Award reward. That's a big deal! Is Eminem, the best rapper? It's up in the air, depending what you think is music. After all, 2005's Encore & 2009's Relapse were some of his worst albums ever. Thank God for 2010's Recovery. But, it's still hard not to find yourself, jamming to ""Lose Yourself"" when you need a boost in your life. You can't help seeing how great, the raps were written in the film. My favorite one had to be the courtyard battle with the Xhibit cameo. Yeah, most of the raps were pretty funny and clever, both from Eminem and the lyrics from his real life friends, playing opponents like Proof who play Lil' Tic in the film. The acting is pretty good, all around. Eminem has never acted before this, but regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, he did a great job. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Mad props go to Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's mentor, Future. Brittany Murphy as Alex, Jimmy's love-interest is mostly a miss than a hit for me. I don't find her attractive. Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant was bit out of place. Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The only female character that really matter in this film, is the alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) as she play a great dealt in Eminem's life. I did find the whole sub-plot of her losing her home, a bit underdeveloped, as surprising near the climax, she miraculous won the bingo in a deus ex machina like fashion. I did love the symbolism of the burning house in the state of present day Detroit. Indeed the movie demonstrates processes of race, class, and segregation in the urban lower socio-economic environment. Indeed, it's hard to be proud of your neighborhood, when there are streets upon streets of abandoned building where people do drugs, murder, and loot. You really see how economic devastation and de-industrialization can hurt a city. Most of the movie is how much living in Detroit sucks type patting, until the predictable Rocky style final battle. It should had been shorter than its 110 minute run time. Honestly, another thing that bug me is that the movie is place in 1995's Detroit, but there is little to no mention of the time period. They should just save money and claim it was present day, because when I first saw it, I thought it was year 2002 in the settling. For an Eminem movie, it's pretty tame in the language and the violence. Don't get me wrong, it's R Rating for a reason, but I really think the producers were going for a PG-13 rating here. Yes, there's a lot of harsh language, but it didn't seem oddly place. Overall: If you're looking for a good urban underdog movie. You found one."

","I will say this, despite my reputation for hating popular movies (look at my other reviews!) I have to say that 8 Mile ranks right up there as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Certainly it's one of my favorite musicals, even though it REALLY doesn't count as a musical per se. Eminem stars as a rapper trying to Make It Big while facing, oh you know, the White Trash Blues, eg, living in a trailer park, a next to nothing job, Kim Basinger etc etc. The only thing the of course keeps his motivated is his music, and trying to make it big in Detroit. Although he is quite talented, a lot of red tape stands in his way, eg, power hungry producers, gang members, Gillian Murphy, etc etc. What an amazing debut Eminem gives here. I guess since this is partly geographical, Mathers was able to put some of his own life into the character, but, with the glut of rap stars now appearing on the silver screen, Mathers is one definite standout. It will be interesting to see how he takes on a completely different character role (like he is rumoured for in the 'Have Gun Will Travel' movie)."

It sucks being poor, having no education, worrying about what you're gonna eat, or if you can get a minimum wage job, it sucks when you can't rely on family and friends, and when you get assaulted and the cops can't do anything. It shows so many struggles, and the main character just struggles with them and tries to cope... he's not some super badass macho alpha hero, he's just a regular guy who tries to live, just like many other people living in poor areas.<br/><br/>I think it needed a little bit more depth, or subliminal messages about staying strong and positive.

It just goes to show he can both sing and act and IS truly talented."
"kaspen12","7","2","3","10 February 2006"," Better than it needed to be.
","Eminem's ""semi-autobiographical"" rap movie. Do I even need to summarize? If you've ever listened to the radio, you probably know the story: Em hails from Detroit, hates his mom and is on and off, but mostly off, with the #1 woman in his life. 8 Mile follows that basic pattern, but with a few humanizing differences.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith (Eminem) stands nervously in the bathroom of The Shelter, a local rap club. Set to battle, he steps to the mic, and the whole crowd goes so loud, he opens his mouth and the words don't come out. He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now; the clock's run out, time's up, over, BLAOW!<br/><br/>Snap back to reality, where Rabbit's just split with long-time girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning, in the Kim Mathers role), leaving her with his car and their apartment. With no place else to go, he crosses 8 Mile Rd., the line dividing the Detroit's lower classes from its lowest, to return to the confines of his drunk and jobless mother (Kim Basinger)'s trailer. Spending his days working in a steel plant, pressing bumpers in the deepest depths of the Motor City, Rabbit dreams of hip-hop grandeur, and his best friend Future (Mekhi Phifer) wants to help him get there. The film tracks his troubles and aspirations over the course of a week, from one battle to another, watching Rabbit move from choke artist to champion. Along the way, Brittany Murphy shows up as Alex, another down-and-outer with big dreams and eyes for Rabbit.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things I could say to knock this film. I could call it 'The Wizard' of hip-hop, with ""Lose Yourself"" filling in for Super Mario Bros 3. I could knock the obligatory scenes showing Em, an accused homophobe, making good with the steel plant's requisite gay guy. I could say it has pacing issues, or call it predictable and unnecessary. I won't. This is just a likable movie, through and through. Is it great? No. But its battles are hypnotic, its leading man captivating. This is a better movie than it needed to be.<br/><br/>FINAL SCORE: 7.6/10 = B<br/><br/>Director Curtis Hanson ventures far from the realm of 'Wonder Boys' or 'L.A. Confidential', but makes a movie that works on its own terms. First-time actor Eminem is given a relatively light load -- Rabbit is coming up from rock-bottom, his emotional outlook is the bleakest of bleaks. Still, his eyes flash a mature intensity that sucks you in and makes you care. Watch him in the battle sequences and he's explosive -- incredibly watchable, and it would be a shame if he never acts again. While as a coming-of-age hip-hop story, it would later be eclipsed by Hustle & Flow, 8 Mile is still a fine film that's worth a look."

","Warning! Content of this commentary is absolutely weak in its grammatical aspect, because it's author is Russian, lives in Russia and is just a 16-year old boy. <br/><br/>If you look through this new 50 Cent's piece of… let's say hip-hop movie (be accurate - watching it may cause some mental disease), you can remind 8 Mile and say to yourself, that Hanson's film could be much worse. Of course you can also say that this project would never happen if Eminem hasn't been so popular. But he has, so this movie inevitably happened (just like Get Rich or Die Trying'). And first of all it's a film about rap and it's an Em's biography. But Curtis Hanson is the man. He didn't try to catch the whole rap history, not even tried to shoot the part of it. He only made very good Hollywood drama about… maybe we can say lose cannons - white people (B-Rabbit, Cheddar Bob) of hip-hop, and about modern (still, though 10 years had passed) juveniles. And he completed this mission. He worked like a good spy - for two different sides, categories of people. I mean this movie is interesting to both hardcore rap fans and 'normal' people (sorry for such classification, I pretend to be a rap fan myself). It works because we have, the first, a strong dramatic line (our hero 'lost himself') and love story (despite it's rapper style), the second, a good atmosphere of the hood (but there's nothing good in it really). And what (who) makes this film great is Em. There were so much pros and cons, arguments and battles (even in Russia) about his acting ability (or maybe possibility), but he had done the job as good as he could and even better, especially during his rap episodes. Having no problems with acting, he also perfectly shows emotions through his texts. But even if he had some, actors around him were ready to help the star with their considered performance. The only thing that decreases my final mark is, as I was saying, Hollywood production. Curtis Hanson is still the man, but I don't understand why he decided to restrict his actions by creating the proper atmosphere and chemistry. 8 Mile is too standard with such photography and edit. There is also nothing to read between the lines, Eminem has his music deeper. Though we have to think about his future destiny, about possible career of Murphy's character, there's nothing beside that. Other characters are as simple as spoon witch Neo tries to bend. I think it's 8. P.S. Once again I say sorry for my language."

The remaining cast members were also very good.<br/><br/>The story is very powerful and above all- enthralling. I was generally absorbed by every second of 8 MILE. After hearing numerous terrible reviews from several of my friends, I was expecting a crap film. But, no. This is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>What I think let a lot of people down is that rap music is not really the entire plot of the story, but it is more of a sub-plot used to show the life of a young man trying to deal with the problems of life. The film is not only about rap and really isn't what all the little blurbs lead you to think. 8 MILE is really a moving tale of trying to survive in the world.<br/><br/>I recommend that you see SAVE THE LAST DANCE if you like this film.

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>8 Mile is controversial Detroit rapper Eminem's eagerly anticipated acting debut.It was probably a good idea for his first time in front of the camera to stick to material relatively close to home and appear in a movie that is more-or-less semi-autobiographical.Does he pull it off?Yes,he more than passes muster.Being his first time,he hasn't quite mastered a naturalness that he would need to develop in order to be considered a truly amazing acting force,but he certainly tries very hard and carries himself very powerfully.The rest of the main cast,Kim Basinger,Mekki Phyiffer and Brittany Murphy,however,turn in merely adequate,passable performances which are less acceptable for more experienced actors.It doesn't help much that they are given such contrieved,unoriginal dialogue to work with,though.The film's other real fault is that the story has no real sense of structure or coherence.Although the central character and the situations and people he becomes involved with are very engaging,there's no real actual plot to follow and this ends up becoming quite a distracting hinderance.A good recommendation about the film however,is that it really comes alive towards the end,making you just able to care about the end outcome.The rapping sequences are great fun to watch too,watching the characters spurt out catchy,bouncing tunes that get lodged in your head,especially during the 'choking' scenes.Although this doesn't quite match up to director Curtis Hanson's original movie L.A. Confidential,it is easily on a par with his last film,Wonder Boys.***"

","...though sticking to a certain music-movie formula, and not sticking to the total truth of Eminem- the atmosphere that he must of felt in those days in Detroit's slums is excellently captured by director Curtis Hanson, and the rap scenes are finite, but non-fans of Eminem who see this movie may get the wrong impression about him, and fans and observers of his last three albums (like I) will see that he skewers much of his material.  For instance, the relationships between his mother (Kim Basinger) and pregnant girlfriend are not what Marshall dealt furiously about on his 2nd and 3rd albums.<br/><br/>Having said that, I enjoyed 8 Mile, as that it doesn't go for cheap emotions, and Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith's misery and frustrations are projected splendidly by Eminem, since this is basically a version of how he made it- he starts off in a trailer, clothes in a garbage bag and a car that breaks down constantly, but has a gift to come at people at the right times with rhymes.  I even thought (in a sense) that Basinger did a decent job with Rabbit's mother, and she doesn't seem too much like a Hollywood starlet here.<br/><br/>Bottom line, fans of Eminem and those who identify with the underground Detroit lifestyle will have a captivating couple of hours with Mr. Shady on screen, and maybe others will too.  However, fans of Hanson should know this isn't his best picture.  Grade: B+"
"Cardinalnem","1","10","28","5 January 2003"," The Grass Is Greener At The Trailer Park
","There's no denying that Eminem has an intensity that's initially charismatic along with a definite rhythmic and verbal flair sufficient these days to enrapture large portions of the suburban young.  What isn't adequately observed, though, is the extreme narrowness of his art as revealed in this film.  Essentially, he's engaging here in merely occasional poetry, extended rhymed insults which don't merit hearing - in my view - apart from the circumstances which give rise to them. Nevertheless he has been hailed for these in some quarters as a genius, whereas he reveals at most a modest talent.  His acting, too - if indeed he is an actor - has been overrated, given the limited requirements both the story and the semi-biographical role in ""8 Mile"" place upon him. Largely, he moves through the film in a single mood, one in which a charismatic intensity is joined to a pretty consistent, if cryptic, self-fascination. His role is actually the sentimental one of noble savage, but freed of lumpenproletariat trappings, so we find him here - oddly enough - both defending gays and sporting not a single tattoo.  A low view of women, however, remains essentially intact. The film in itself is a contemporary variant of that genre which has been called the ""slum pastoral."" Virtue, authenticity and even real creative spark are to be found apparently only where both philosophy and experience would lead us least to expect them - among certain  insulted and injured trailer park types. Presumably, a middle-class or even more privileged upbringing by itself would disequip one for real achievement in the field of rap music. In short, this film reeks of what the satirist Tom Wolfe in a different context identified as a mind-numbing ""nostalgia for the mud."""

","There is a close-up two-shot near the end of Eight Mile where Jimmy Smith (Eminem) is facing Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie). Both characters are in profile in a shot very reminiscent of Sly Stallone facing off with Mr. T in Rocky II. This is as it should be. When we look at the structure and theme of the film, Eight Mile could easily be described as Rocky does rap.<br/><br/>In the Rocky movies (and for that matter in Flashdance), working-class nobodies in dead-end jobs are given a shot at the big time-a title match and admission to an elite ballet school respectively. While the formula is similar in all three films there are marked differences that make Eight Mile more than just another formula film.<br/><br/>In this film, the American dream mythology is pushed to the background, and the lives of the inhabitants of the neighborhood are moved to the foreground. This movie also ends differently than the others, and the difference is important, but giving movie endings away is a major violation of the film critic's creed.<br/><br/>I like movies where the setting becomes a character in its own right. Here the setting is just south of Eight Mile Rd. in Detroit. Eight Mile Rd. separates the poorer black community from the wealthy white suburban community, and Eminem plays a white rapper on the wrong side of the tracks. <br/><br/>As the movie begins, we see him nervously preparing for a ""rap"" battle in which contestants go onstage and disparage each other in their rapping. Jimmy chokes and is forced to leave the stage in disgrace. Among his interracial group of supporters, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the one who sees real talent in Jimmy's rap and continues to push him.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger plays Jimmy's mom, a woman who attaches her dreams to empty promises, alcohol, and bingo games. When Jimmy's fortunes take a downturn he is forced to return to the trailer where his mother lives with her live-in boyfriend and Jimmy's younger sister.<br/><br/>If the movie were primarily about rap music, I probably would not have seen it. When I do listen to rap it is usually in my role as sociologist (as opposed to my role of music lover). I am not a fan of rap, particularly the misogynistic, homophobic form that Eminem is noted for. But the film is primarily about social conditions in America's abandoned cities and the inhabitants who are trapped and disenfranchised. <br/><br/>While I am not a fan of Eminem the rapper (or for that matter, Eminem the person) I am now a fan of Eminem the actor. His performance is solid and has a stamp of authenticity that serves the film well. His work is enhanced by solid supporting performances from Phifer, Basinger, and Brittany Murphy. If you are interested in an engaging, slice-of-life film depicting the part of American society that most citizens ignore or avoid this is worth a look.<br/><br/>If, however, your primary moral/aesthetic criteria for art involve the presence or absence of the big three (the big three being language, sex, and violence) be forewarned. Because the film depicts rap artists the coarse language is a given and it is pretty raw. The violence is minor compared to other similar films, but there are several scenes depicting sexual promiscuity here. The sexual promiscuity is used to reveal character (or lack thereof) and while graphic it is thematically redemptive in that it does show the negative consequences and shallowness of these fallen encounters. While the sexual encounters depicted are more graphic than viewers will see in the upcoming James Bond film, they are more positive precisely because they don't glorify the promiscuity as the Bond films do. In the end, this is a powerful film that goes beyond the cliches to give us an interesting depiction of urban America, but it is a rough ride. If you are easily offended by depictions of fallen humans in all of their brokenness, this film may just leave you shaken, not stirred."
"lesleyharris30","8","1","1","17 June 2016"," Worthy Performances, Thin Plot,
","8 Mile is a great film with a reasonable plot and a terrific cast. Eminem certainly does an effective job in a movie that is essentially his baby, his performance is very deep and personal, he certainly does not hold back, bringing his story to life through a fictional character. However, the plot was missing something, every scene is somewhat formulaic and predictable, you know how each each will end as soon as it begins, it is short on surprises. The highlight of the movie is certainly the rap battles, I am a fan of Eminem's music, but I feel people who are unfamiliar with his art can still appreciate the drama and intensity of these scenes, the raw emotion of the cast is overwhelming at times. While it has its flaws, 8 Mile is well acted, with a superb soundtrack, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A young blue collar worker attempts to escape from his dead end life by competing in rap competitions. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Eminem"

","In another era of American film, James Stewart might have been cast to star in this film. Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. (played by rapper, Eminem) is cast as a classic under-dog who overcomes incredible odds to achieve his dream. In one of James Stewart's most memorable roles, he portrayed a character who faced up to impossible odds, and vindicated himself from a political corruption debacle on the floor of the United States Senate. In 8 MILE, down-and-out White rapper, ""Rabbit"" Smith, in a stunning upset, wins over a skeptical audience, and triumphs as a major player on the city's musical scene. And, in an ironic use of Race, the fact that he is a White Man, in nearly all-Black Detroit, Michigan, only plays as one more strike against him. 8 MILE also boasts a great supporting cast, and Marshall Mathers (Eminem) has a very engaging Screen Presence."

Just like Purple Rain, Flashdance and Saturday Night Fever, only with Eminem in it. It shows his past life and is very similar to it. It's about B-Rabbit (Eminem in his debut film) who must live through poverty with his mom, Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and his half-sister Lily (Chloe Green, if I'm not mistaken). His slutty ex, Janeane lies to him that she's pregnant when she really cheated on him. But he has ""Future"" (Mekhi Phifer) his best friend and his new girlfriend, Alex (Brittany Murphy).

","Eminem plays a young rap artist called Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith Jr. who lives in Detroit and works for a metal-stamping factory, dreaming of signing a contract with a record company. The main plot is how he comes to overcome fear inside him, trust own potential, and go beyond the boundary on his own. <br/><br/>The setting of this film is Detroit in 1995. Detroit once thrived on the auto industry but when reasonable and safe Japanese cars flew into the market in 1970s, Detroit was hit by a depression and a number of workers got dismissed, and companies went bankrupt one after another. The downtown was full of homeless people and public order was completely destroyed. The rich moved out to the suburbs, and the poor were left in the downtown. Detroit marked the highest crime rate in the U.S., and had turned into a declining city where racism, drugs, riots, and poverty prevailed. The title of this movie comes from the name of an existing road called 8 Mile. Detroit is located to the south of 8 Mile Road, and most of the citizens there are black, and a quarter of them live in poverty. To the north is a town of white people called Warren. These two towns are divided by 8 Mile Road and therefore it is known as a boundary which separates those two races and economy. <br/><br/>8 Mile is a realist film in that it is filmed with a low degree of manipulation, focusing on content rather than form or technique. It satisfies the three elements of realist films; simplicity, spontaneity, and directness. Hanson tries to mirror the actual Detroit as much as possible and we can also see a remarkable similarity between Jimmy and Eminem. <br/><br/>The movie is lit in low key in most scenes to connote fear, confusion, anger, irritation, agony inside Jimmy and the atmosphere of the declined, disordered downtown of Detroit. <br/><br/>The editing style Hanson has employed in 8 Mile is a mix-up of realism and classicism; cutting to continuity and classical cutting are both seen in the film. Since the focus of this film is on the change inside Jimmy, we need to look at his facial expressions closely. Classical cutting lets us approach him close enough examine the look on his face. <br/><br/>The plot is loose with no clearly defined beginning, middle, or end. A neatly structured tale with glib happy endings and miracles is not Silver wanted for 8 Mile, he wanted a ""like life,"" ""manipulated"" touch. The story ends when Jimmy promises himself that he will go beyond 8 Mile someday, and does not proceed to the point where he achieves his goal.<br/><br/>The themes - The most highlighted message is that it is important to trust own potential and transcend the limits you have set. First Jimmy does not have full confident in his talent and he runs off the club before the rap battle. He does not know whether he should keep pursuing his dream or give it up and live a life without risks working at a factory, rapping in a local club with his friends. There are two scenes in which he asks his friend, ""Do you ever wonder at what point you got to stop living up here and start living down here?"" As the story approaches its end, he comes to realize that he should not wait for things to happen and that he himself need to take action now on his own. <br/><br/>The story also teaches us that it is important to control own fear in order to succeed. Jimmy has a lot of fear inside him at first, but learns to put it aside and do what is needed. The film also shows that fear can be both harmful and productive. When we know there is a possibility of failing, most people feel frightened. If the fear takes control over you, the fear only becomes an obstacle. However, if you can control your fear, it can work as a motivation to make efforts. Considering a case of failing is frightening, so it drives you to make every endeavor to stay away from it. The men in the Free World has no fear and do not make efforts to improve their rap skills believing nobody in the club can beat them. On the other hand, Jimmy struggles in fear of failing and make careful preparation writing down lyrics. His efforts eventually bring him a victory. Watching this film, we also realize the importance of people who support us as we face a challenge. It is not always easy to cope with own fear, and sometimes we need someone who will push our back to move forward. When Alex looked him in the eye and told him that she truly thinks he will succeed, it gave him courage; that was exactly what he needed to hear. <br/><br/>The film also depicts social problems such as widening gap between rich and poor, crimes and racial conflicts. In collapsed society, crimes are nothing rare and people are used to hearing about it. There is one scene in which they take about a girl who got raped and joke and goof around at the crime scene. Also, there are many scenes in which people are drinking, smoking, doing drugs and using violence. We can sense a lot of anger among the characters, and it is expressed with a constant use of cuss-words. The film also shows a familial conflict between Jimmy and Stephanie. They show love and hatred alternately, and keep a distance throughout the film. <br/><br/>8 Mile is great in use of music; the protagonist's thoughts and feelings are well expressed through his lyrics and the rhyme is entertaining."
"Shaolin_Apu","8","1","1","27 October 2005"," Good introduction to Rap
","I knew nothing about this so called rap-music but after watching this film I knew at least something and, to some extent, even became interested in it. What hit me first was Eminem himself, for I completely forgot that he was not an actor of any kind. His 'acting' was brilliant because he knew what he was doing and what he presented was just himself. It became also evident that the story of the film was similar to that of Rocky movies. The world is an odd place, but a human can become a master his destiny with hard work and will.<br/><br/>The fact that Eminem succeeds in playing his role is also due to good supporting acting. Other actors and actresses are great in their roles, especially Brittany Murphy who seems to have established herself in playing crazy girlfriends roles. Overall work of actors helps to make the whole movie a very enjoyable viewing and it shifts the attention out of the everyday banality this movie actually represents. '8 Mile' will give you a good feeling and it helps you to forget desperation that some modern films with similar social subject rather induce than remove."

","I grew up in New York City just as rap was evolving into the art form we see today. I remember the breakthrough as if it were yesterday: it was 1979, disco was dying out, rock had yet to come back, and music generally sucked. The #1 songs from Billboard that year -- ""My Sharona"" from The Knack"" topped the charts for several weeks, for God's sake -- were from hunger. Music needed a fresh new voice, and rap was just the ticket. ""Rapper's Delight"" from the Sugarhill Gang actually cracked the Billboard Top 40 (it hit #37), and I still can sing all 15 minutes of the song, usually without error. That's the point: I'm WHITE. So were many of my private school and upper-east-side friends who also knew all the lyrics.<br/><br/>We weren't ""eight miles"" away from the other side of the tracks, but about four or five from the South Bronx, where rap was born. Debbi Harry's ""Rapture"" was an homage to her obviously many trips on the #4 train to and from the Village (for example, the lyrics ""Flash is fast, Flash is cool"" referred to Grandmaster Flash, while ""Fab Five Freddy"" also got props in what is actually the first rap song to hit #1). Because of this, I can relate to what it's like to be a white rapper, even now. Eminem, the king of the white rappers, works in this film because he has the same ""street cred"" that my peers and I sought by taking rap seriously when no one associated it with whites.<br/><br/>The movie ""8 Mile"" tells the story of ""B. Rabbit,"" a Detroit-based rapper with a crappy job, who lives in a trailer park with his mother, and who dreams of the day he can get his demo produced and get out of the slums. He's hard-working (unlike his peers) and also realistic (he talks of living ""down here"" rather than ""up there""). Like many working stiffs, he defines himself not by his work, but his hobbies. He begins the film by losing a ""rap battle"" (a freestyle rap competition), and suffers the humiliation of being ""not white, but white with a mic."" Racial tensions fly, along with the occasional bullets, but the main weapon of choice for these ""gangstas"" are their lyrics, which they all know can lead to riches.<br/><br/>The ""villain"" of the film is ""Papa Doc,"" the leader of the ""free world"" rap group, and the reigning rap battle champion. Papa Doc has street cred, and Rabbit wants to take it from him for his ""crew."" Mekhi Pfeifer turns in his usually grating performance as ""Future,"" and one has to wonder about his motivations (watch ""Scary Movie 3"" for a humorous statement of the obvious from Anthony Anderson). Rabbit is troubled, conflicted, but his trials and tribulations are meshed together in a way that every artist can only hope for.<br/><br/>One thing I've always liked about Eminem is that he's not a white rapper trying to be black, but that he puts a ""white"" spin on rap, mocking his race's perception as more grammatically correct, less ""gangsta"" and always the racial underdog. For example, his line ""notice that this man did not have his hands up"" in the final battle would have been spoken differently (but not inferior in any way) by a black rapper. Somehow, he manages to do this without appearing racist, but rather a mere product of his upbringing.<br/><br/>This movie's main objective is to show the world of hard-core rap to a mainstream audience, and I can't imagine anyone watching this film while paying attention and not understanding the culture, at least on a surface level, by the end.<br/><br/>One other note: Brittany Murphy stunk, as usual."
"philip_vanderveken","7","1","1","6 September 2005"," Probably best for people who know much about rap and it's subculture
","Even though I can appreciate a rap song so now and then, I can't say that I'm a big fan of the genre. But every kind of music has its idols and I guess most people have heard of Eminem before - although that hasn't always got something to do with his music. When this movie was released over here, I didn't go to the cinema to watch it, but decided to wait until it was shown on television. I didn't want to spend my money on a movie that told the life of a poor white kid who became a famous rapper, someone who I didn't think I could care for much. But now that it was finally shown, I gave it a try.<br/><br/>Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' is a white kid who wants to become a famous rapper. But he has a lot of problems that might keep him from becoming well-known. Not only does he get incredibly nervous when he has to perform in some rap battles, he also has a hard time during the rest of his life. His girlfriend told him she's pregnant and that's why he dumped her, his mom is an alcoholic who lives in a shabby trailer, his job's a dead end,... But then things finally seem to improve when he meets Alex, a girl who wants to leave the slums of Detroit to become a model in New York, and someone promises him to help him with his demo. However, is it all as nice as he hopes it will be, or will this become just another setback? <br/><br/>Even though it's said to be a completely fictional story, I guess there is a lot of Eminem's life that has been used as a source of inspiration for this movie. A young white rapper with a lot of difficulties to get to the top, problems with his mom,... that sounds a lot like what I've already heard about him. Does that mean that this movie isn't any good then? No, certainly not, this is a very decent drama that doesn't leave much to the imagination when it comes to all the misery, but which really does a good job in showing it all. And I guess it's only an advantage that Eminem played this role himself. Even though I don't consider him as a great actor, I must say that his performance in this movie felt very real (probably thanks to his own experiences in life). However, that doesn't mean that I want to see him act in other movies, as a regular actor. Somehow I don't really believe he would be as good then as he is in this movie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem this movie probably faces is the audience it wants to target. I'm afraid that there aren't that many adult people (people in their thirties, forties, fifties or older) who will really like this movie, because this is too far away from their own reality. I guess only teenagers and people in their early twenties who like rap music and know the entire subculture around it and/or who like Eminem as an artist, will really love this movie. The others should give it a try too, but I doubt if they will all like it all that much. Personally I think they did a good job with this movie and I give it a 7/10, maybe a 7.5/10, but than again, I'm not a complete stranger to the music either..."

Yes, it does ""reflect"" some of Eminem's life and challenges along the way...but the only way he agreed to do the movie was if he got to portray another character....made more fictional.

Like I said 8 Mile was clearly without a doubt one of the best movies of the previous year when it came to crowd pleasing. Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have tailor made a great first movie for Eminem. In his portrayl of Jimmy Smith Jr.,Eminem gives the charcter depth and while watching the film I didn't see Eminem, I saw Jimmy. Some of the film's best scenes invole no dialogue, scenes such as Jimmy writing and anazlying his surroundings are deep and give you a feel of what a rapper goes through trying to write hye lyrics. The supporting cast all give excellent performances Mehki Phifer who serves as Jimmy's main supporter contiunes to make star making movies. Omar Benson Miller as Sol and Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob provide a lot of comic relief. With the little screen time they are given Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy do good as the female leads. The highlight of the film is truly the battle scenes though. I give the movie ***** stars."
"mattymatt4ever","9","1","1","3 May 2003"," Lives up to the hype
","Another rapper making a transition to acting?  Eminem receiving worldwide acclaim for his performance with some promise of an Oscar nomination? This is the kind of stuff the press just has a field day with.  But guess what? This is not your standard vehicle for an up-and-coming hip-hop star. Directed by Curtis Hanson, who made the wonderful ""LA Confidential,"" this is a deeply moving, thought-provoking, unpretentious drama that sheds light on a world I knew nothing about:  the world of rap battles.<br/><br/>
I'm not the biggest fan of hip-hop, but it's an art like any other.  What I don't understand is when a movie is filled with profanity, sexual content and violence, it's deemed as realistic, yet when a rap song contains those same elements, it's deemed as exploitative.  These rappers are simply placing a mirror up to reality.  How can you write about beauty and happiness when it barely exists in the world you live in?  These rappers live in a world filled with gang violence and drive-by shootings, so they have to write what they know about.  Martin Scorcese lived in a rough neighborhood growing up, and that's why he makes hard-boiled films about gangsters and other characters of that sort.  And rightfully so, he receives much acclaim for placing that mirror up to reality.<br/><br/>I never knew about these rap battles, and I found them to be very interesting.  They're like boxing matches, only the competitors fight with words.  They search for each other's weaknesses, and do their best to mock those weaknesses via rap lyrics.<br/><br/>Now onto Eminem's performance...Yes, he was magnificent!  Some critics and audiences claimed it wasn't a stretch for him, since he's playing a character that's so close to who he really is.  First of all, acting is not just about being ""another person.""  Just watch Prince's ""Purple Rain"" and you'll see what I mean.  Was Prince playing a character vastly different from himself?  Of course not!  But he was still horrible!  Acting is about expressing yourself and showing emotion.  And Eminem did a beautiful job at showing emotion, and what impressed me the most was there was a lot of scenes in which he had no dialogue and had to express the way he was feeling nonverbally.  I know, as an aspiring actor, that the hardest thing to do in acting is to be silent.  It's easy to scream your head off in an intense dramatic scene, and let out all your aggression.  But to communicate your emotions simply through facial expressions and body language?  That takes talent.  Not to mention that's a huge challenge for a first-time, inexperienced actor.  I'm sure Curtis Hanson saw something great in him or else he wouldn't have hired him in the first place, because Hanson is a very reputable director and is not a whore for the industry, who'll allow any popular music star to walk onto his set to make a boatload of cash. Second of all, Eminem's character wasn't a carbon copy of himself, but an extension of himself, just like the story was inspired from moments in his life, but it's not exactly an autobiography.  I recall one critic saying that if playing yourself in a movie were so easy, then anybody can act.  That rings very true.  Acting is something many people say they can do with their hands tied behind their backs, but once they're in the spotlight, they freeze up. So for all of you smart-alecks who feel that Eminem's performance wasn't a stretch, I'd like YOU to make a movie about your life, and let's see how effective your performance turns out to be.  Much easier said than done.<br/><br/>
The story is touching and powerful, yet at the same time surprisingly honest.  There are a few contrivances, like Eminem finding out one of his best friends is screwing his girlfriend, and we're faced with the cliched scene in which he catches them in the act and beats the crap out of the guy. But other than that, the story is amazingly realistic, which is especially evident in the film's conclusion.  It's not a tragic ending, nor is it happy.  It's actually a character-driven ending.  How often do we see those in movies?  The whole film is pretty much character-driven, failing to take the easy way out by manipulating the audience left and right with corny melodrama and sentiment.  Each character is rich and multi-dimensional.  I assumed that Eminem's trailer-trash mother would be the standard foul-mouthed, abusive wench.  But instead I grew to like her character, despite her drinking and sleeping around, because I got a real sense of her humanity and love for her son.  The most powerful scene, in my mind, is when Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him as his little daughter watches from the window.  At that moment I was nearly brought to tears.<br/><br/>
The performances by the supporting cast are also great.  Kim Basinger is great as the mother, and her performance (along with the way the character was written) helps add humanity to the role.  A less-experienced, less-talented actress would've probably watched every ""Jerry Springer"" episode for research and hammed it up to extremes.  Mekhi Pfieffer, who never disappoints, is also great.<br/><br/>I'm proud that the song ""Lose Yourself"" won the Oscar, which is the first for a hip-hop song, because its lyrics are rich with meaning and I thought it would be immediately snubbed simply because it's a hip-hop song.  But luckily, the Academy voters kept an open mind, because it's really a beautiful song.<br/><br/>I don't care if you're 18 or 60, love hip-hop or hate it, I recommend you see ""8 Mile.""<br/><br/>My score:  9 (out of 10)"

So I went to see it, half expecting to hate it.<br/><br/>
I know nothing of rap or hip-hop. It is a culture that has eluded me so far. So I went to see this film without even a vague understanding of the background to this music we hear everyday on the radio. I came out from seeing this film finally seeing the point, finally seeing what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>Eminem impressed me so much. His acting skills, his verbal dexterity. He could have taken advantage of this film and really used it to kiss his own behind. But all credit to him, he chose to show us his human side.I can't think of another artist in his position who would expose themselves like this.The story is refreshing and the scripting feels natural. The acting from the rest of the cast is great-though I often missed a few things as I couldn't keep up with all the American slang (I'm soooo uncool!). I have shown it to several people who have all commented on how much they enjoyed it considering they didn't really want to see it.<br/><br/>In short the film has turned me in to a bit of a fan. I went out and got the film and the cds. I no longer think Eminem is a chainsaw weilding fool, but a talented and interesting man with something to say. Marshall, if you are out there, I am sorry I got you so wrong.<br/><br/>I guess what I am trying to say is even if you think you can't stand the man, give the film a shot. You may just be suprised."

","Rapper Eminem makes a spectacular screen debut in `8 Mile,' a film designed to showcase the performer's talents as singer, songwriter and, now, actor.<br/><br/>
In this semi-autobiographical tale, Eminem plays a young white rapper named Jimmy who is struggling to achieve respectability and recognition in an area dominated almost exclusively by black artists.   We've seen this story before in films ranging from `The Hustler' to `The Cincinnati Kid' to `Rocky':  the hotshot, talented newcomer attempts to make a name for himself in some specialized area (be it pool, poker, boxing or rapping) by challenging and defeating the highly respected and established reigning champ.  In terms of plotting, `8 Mile' offers little that is new or exciting, but what makes the movie work is the fine sense of detail and texture that writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson bring to the world they are showing us.  Set in 1995 Detroit, the film superbly captures the unmitigated bleakness of its urban setting:  from the burnt-out, abandoned buildings to the graffiti-covered walls to the dank, cavernous music clubs to the rundown trailer parks.  Jimmy is caught in a world that offers the poor working class stiff little opportunity for hopes and dreams beyond those he can make for himself - and Jimmy has found rap music to be the best chance for his ticket out.  Yet, Jimmy is no pie-in-the-sky idealist.  He knows that he can't afford to put all his eggs into one basket and so he remains levelheaded and pragmatic in his aspirations and goals. Beyond the obvious handicap of his skin color, Jimmy is also having to cope with a crumbling relationship, an alcoholic mother, her abusive boyfriend and some `concerned' parties who, despite what they may say, may not always have Jimmy's best interest at heart.<br/><br/>Each of these characters has the potential to become nothing more than a hokey stereotype, but the acting and the writing keep most of it real most of the time.  Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, Britanny Murphy and several others all turn in fine performances in their roles, but it is Eminem himself who makes the film work.  Jimmy, despite all the frustration and rage smoldering under the surface, comes across as a decent guy who wants to make something of himself and to help those people who mean the most to him in the process. Eminem is a natural on the screen, and it will be interesting to see if he will be able to so successfully inhabit a character who is not so carefully tailored to fit his ready-made persona.  My suspicion is that he will, though only time - and his next few roles - will tell.<br/><br/>
`8 Mile' affords a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that many of us have hitherto viewed only from the outside.  Especially intriguing are the `hip-hop battles,' wherein rappers come on stage and challenge one another to perform spontaneous mutual put-downs, with the audience getting to determine the contest's winner.  No matter what one may feel about rap music itself, one has to admire the talent involved in composing these rhyming verses extemporaneously.  The music may sometimes be execrable, but the love of language that pours forth out of the mouths of these young practitioners is actually quite encouraging and captivating (though one wishes that that talent would be channeled in a more positive direction at times).<br/><br/>
An interesting side note:  at one point, Jimmy recites a rap defending a homosexual co-worker.  After all the bad blood that has gone down between Eminem and the gay community in the past, I wonder if this is the rapper's attempt to make peace and bury the hatchet.  If so, it is a gesture well worth making."

","After viewing '8 Mile' I have to say that it definitely didn't deserve the accolades it received from critics, but it isn't a bad movie.  However, to anyone that watches this movie and thinks it's the greatest thing since sliced bread I do have two words for you: 'Purple Rain'.  This movie is basically a remake of the famous 80's movie starring Prince who battles his way from an alcoholic family and his own demons to ""win"" against the mean-spirited bad guy musicians played by Morris Day and the Time.  Scene after scene copied Purple Rain to the extent that I kept expecting Eminem to bust out with ""Baby, I'm a Star"" in the final scene.<br/><br/>The film is shot well and the performances are actually good in parts. Kim Basinger is so good as the white trash mom that it makes you wonder how she channeled that performance without a little trailer park in her blood. Brittany Murphy is an exception (as usual) who fumbles around in her role like Ray Charles strapped in a Tilt-O-Whirl.<br/><br/>Eminem, for his part, does a fairly decent job glaring and strutting about. Although I am no fan of rap music, the music throughout the movie is enjoyable and the ""rap battles"" are fairly engaging and funny at times.<br/><br/>
All in all, not a bad night's rental. It could have been much, much worse."
"Meltdown53098533","Null","1","1","20 March 2003"," a movie that makes you smile
","8 Mile is what a lot of the critics say. They praise it with great reviews and when I saw this in theatres I knew I HAD to get it on DVD because it wasa great 2 hours. Sure it relates a lot with Eminem's real life but a lot of it is a story. This movie is so good that people who saw Rocky will like this a lot because 8 Mile has its moments that have the feel of Rocky. Yet this is still a rap story of a white man named Jimmy Smith Jr.. He feels he must win a rap battle in order to get some recognition in hopes to be a rapper. He has his friends Future, Chedder Bob and finds romance in a beautiful girl named Alex. As things progressively get worse in ""Rabbit""'s life, he still finds a need to win one of the competitions, through all of the crap that is in his life. This movie is (of course) more for the teens, as they will enjoy it so much more than saaaay, teen parents who hate rap, language, sex, and drugs. But the ingrediants that the adult may dislike are the very ingrediants that make 8 Mile a winner for all who enjoy today's realities. 7.9/10-- my professional rating"
"krisrox","7","1","1","21 January 2003"," Obviously flawed, but authentic - and some classic moments, too.
","Although ""8 Mile"" has obvious flaws - a total lack of story, for one - I enjoyed it a lot. First and foremost, it is decidedly un-Hollywood in its authenticity; Curtis Hanson never forces the action and has managed to capture real hiphop on tape - even up to selecting all the classic songs from 1994-1995. If it wasn't for the presence of Kim Basinger (way to classy to portray a trailer park mom) and Eminem (whose acting didn't add much for me), the movie could've easily passed as a good documentary.<br/><br/>Still, Eminem's presence and rhymes make the film work, and make the final twenty minutes classic. Even if you don't like rap music, you should see the movie for the final battle alone."
"ilovedolby","8","1","1","18 January 2003"," Good Direction by Curtis Hanson!
","Surprisingly good film starring the notorious rapper, Eminem. Directed by Curtis Hanson who's done such films as L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys. Brian Grazer of A Beautiful Mind produced the film. I admit, I had my worries about this film from the start. I'm not an Eminem fan and when I heard that he was making a movie, I thought this was going to be another teen-music sensation disaster. Some of you must remember Brittany Spears' film; Crossroads released back in February of 2002. And what about the Lance Bass flop, On The Line. Not to worry though, 8 Mile was excellent. The reason I went to see it was because of Curtis Hanson, whose work on L.A. Confidential was enough for me to want to see this film. I was very impressed by most of the performances in the film. However, Kim Basinger, who portrays Eminem's character's mom, isn't all that great. She is believable at times, while other times she's phony. But over all, the film was very impressive. It's important to point out that this film is not about Eminem specifically, but rather, loosely based on his life. ***"
"jeev7882","8","1","1","4 December 2002"," Finally, a movie with a music star that's not just not bad, it's actually very good.
","The entire cast and crew did such an excellent job with this movie that it could have easily been the best movie of the year if Scott Silver's script hadn't messed up a thing or two here and there. Finally, a movie with a music star that's not just not bad, it's actually very good.<br/><br/>The discussion first starts with, who else, Eminem. He has come under some scrutiny because he is playing a character that is very loosely based on himself. Because of this, everyone seems ready to brush off his performance as either ""ok,"" or, ""pretty good."" There are two big things that disturb me about that. First, didn't Adam Sandler just get heaps of praise for playing a slight deviation from his normal characters in Punch-Drunk Love? Many seemed to think that it was the best performance of the year. And second, and most importantly, if anyone can name me just one other person - actor, director, music star, or anything else - that could have played Rabbit, please, let me know. There is not a rapper with as much talent in his lyrics or his rhymes as Eminem, so there is not another soul on this planet that could have played Rabbit (and if anyone E-Mail's me with the suggestion that Vanilla Ice could have done it, please, go find some help for yourself). Because of all this, Eminem gives one of the best performances this year. He is emotionally charged and you can tell that without him this would have been a bad movie. I don't know if it's because he's one of the biggest music stars in the world or something else, but he has a screen presence that is huge and magnetic.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast holds their own. Mekhi Phifer is easily the standout as Future, Rabbit's best friend. I didn't know much about Phifer before this movie, but he is definitely a promising talent. He never tries to take over a scene from Eminem; he knows he is on the side to play Rabbit's best friend and advisor. The women in the movie are played down quite a bit. Basinger who last won an Oscar when working with director Curtis Hanson, won't be getting one this time around, but she does what she can with her screen time. We love and hate her as Rabbit's mother and I think that she does a good job of playing the typical trailer mom. A lot of critics seemed to think she was too beautiful to play the character. This is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. Are these people honestly saying that there are no good looking people at all in trailers? Obviously, since all the rich higher class people are so beautiful. The other major female role is Rabbit's girlfriend, Alex, played by Brittany Murphy. Honestly, I'm as familiar with Murphy as I am with Phifer. Her character was the weakest one out of the bunch. We never got to know her at all, and I don't know if it's even correct to call her Rabbit's girlfriend. All they did was fool around once and we are expected to like her and take her words of wisdom to heart. Note to Scott Silver: don't put in a love interest just because you think there should be a love interest in the movie. Murphy herself is attractive, but not much more. She doesn't get to test her acting chops as much as she may have liked to.<br/><br/>Now, the movie itself has some scenes that will blow you away. The very beginning is one of the best opening sequences I've ever seen. The very first shots show Rabbit standing in front of a mirror preparing for a battle. He looks at himself as if his reflection is the enemy, he makes fierce rapping hand gestures at himself and goes through all the lyrics he can think of in his head - analogous of a boxer waiting in the wings before a fight. The battles are all incredible; a battle is a duel between rappers where they each get 45 seconds to trade insults. In the end, the winner is judged by the roar from the crowd. The battles are easily the highlight of the movie because of their originality and their capability to take the movie onto another level all together. There are official battles hosted by Future and everyday battles at work or on the street, both of which work in their own ways. It is incredible how these insult trading sessions of freestyle rap can completely engulf you into the world of 1995 Detroit. I immediately understood that these insults were not personal, that they were a way of fighting without physically beating the hell out of each other (though there is a decent bit of that too outside of the battles). Every time Rabbit was one of the performers the energy just shot though the roof and my eyes and ears were at full alert. There is one scene in particular during a lunch break at Rabbit's job where a girl raps about the hardships and unfair treatment they get at their job. A man responds and puts her down, seemingly winning the battle before Rabbit steps in and puts him in his place. And then there is the final battle; it definitely does not disappoint. Each rapper gets a 90 seconds and  Rabbit gets to go first. He tells the crowd everything that his opponent is going to say about him from white jokes to cracks about living in a trailer with his mom, and then he goes on to decimate away his opponent and his entire gang.<br/><br/>Another vital element of this movie is the settings. Hanson wisely chose to shoot in Detroit rather than cut costs and go across the border into Canada. Hanson now has an even more impressive resume adding 8 Mile to L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys, and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle. The eerie run down image of 1995 Detroit is both realistic and visually wonderful. Hanson has always been known for being able to capture the essence of a large city well with Pittsburgh and L.A. being the settings for his last two movies. Will someone just give this man an award? He is one of the most consistently brilliant directors right now but his commercial draw is almost irrelevant, especially when compared to names like Soderbergh or Shyamalan. Though he is a less impressive screenwriter (what was he thinking with A Knight's Tale?), no one can question his talent as a director.<br/><br/>For 8 Mile, although the script seemed to be left up to Eminem for the most important exchanges, Silver had a good message at heart. Instead of having the typical rags to riches story, he instead takes the approach of showing a young man who is going to work through his hardships and earn enough money to make it big himself without some multi-million dollar record deal coming out of the blue. After the final battle Rabbit goes back to his job where he has worked hard to earn extra shifts and make more money. In a sense it's anti-climactic, but it is abrupt and doesn't dwell on itself for long enough to bring the movie down from it's climax. Instead, it strikes the right tone as the movie fades out to the best song of the year (for a movie or otherwise) ""Lose Yourself."" I don't think a song has ever captured an entire movie and it's themes as well as ""Lose Yourself,"" and there may never be another song quite like it. Will Eminem get an invite to the Oscars? Don't bet on it, but it's not like the Academy ever gets it right anyways.<br/><br/>As I left this movie I felt myself wanting to go to a real life battle, and if I weren't fearful for my life I may have done that. I got the same feeling coming out of 8 Mile as I did coming out of The Legend of Bagger Vance. Coming out of the latter, I wanted nothing more than to go play golf all alone on a beautiful serene golf course. Coming out of the former I wanted to be Rabbit - a poet from the ghetto who can work magic with his lyrics off the top of his head."

","**Warning, may contain spoilers, I try never to use any but there may be accidental ones in my reviews**<br/><br/>8 Mile (2002)<br/><br/>By Trevor Stevens (The Anti Critic) 11-22-2002<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>The breakthrough vehicle for rap artist Eminem and a chance for Curtis Hanson to prove that he can make quality movies just like he did with L.A. Confidential. Hype galore and a trailer reminiscent of other rap star films would make anyone think this movie bombs. The story involves Eminem playing his quasi self (No matter what they say, this is a movie based on em's past, official or not) who is a struggling white collar worker in Detroit who gets a chance to move up by entering in the local rap battles and milks his chance for what it's worth.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy - Extremely sexy in a trashy skanky sort of way. She always lights up the screen every time she's on it. Playing both a muse and sex object, she doesn't get much screen time, but it's probably for the better because if she was up there too long the screen would melt, ok ok I'll stop. Brittany Murphy - Extremely sexy in a trashy skanky sort of way. She always lights up the screen every time she's on it. Playing both a muse and sex object, she doesn't get much screen time, but it's probably for the better because if she was up there too long the screen would melt, ok ok I'll stop.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger - Working again with the director that got her the Oscar she deserved and turning in a fine performance as the frenetic mother of Eminem.<br/><br/>Eminem - Great job is all I can say. I admit he is playing a role that is a direct caricature of himself so he doesn't have to stretch his acting muscles, but just watch a certain scene which involves him standing up to Kim Basinger and showing he can play a tug of war for scene chewing with Kim and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Mekhi Phifer - Odd but endearing performance from one of the better black actors in Hollywood. Reminiscent of his role from Hell's Kitchen with Angelina Jolie, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Reality - Loved the gritty look of (what I would guess) is the real streets of Detroit. Every scene had a dark and bleak look to it, which went well with the drama throughout cause it set a good somber mood.<br/><br/>Rap battles - Great and I wish there was more of them, but I understand they wanted to support the characters and story more. Not only the rap battles, but the occasional freestyles (although scripted) that appear from random people are fun to watch as well. Almost seems like a sub language and sure as hell beats ebonics.<br/><br/>CONS (not what I hated, but what others might not like and need to know):<br/><br/>Sex - yes there is sex, but it's not very graphic, you see Kim Basinger's and Brit Murphy's behinds.<br/><br/>Language - Yes, lots of language throughout, this is an urban movie after all. I would say a little more than average for a movie, but not to the point of being gratuitous.<br/><br/>Violence - The fighting in this film is more verbal than physical, but there are some semi-brutal beatings and a comical scene involving a gun.<br/><br/>OTHER:<br/><br/>Janeane - An apparent part of the story disappears for huge chunks at a time, more odd then anything.<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy - I was hoping to finally see some nudity from her, although this would be an odd movie to `debut' that on, she was in two different sex scenes, and the most that happens is Eminem gets to grab some luscious rump..oh well, one of these days she'll turn around.<br/><br/>Memorable - My personal favorite `rap star' movie, I also like watching Ice Cube when he does serious roles, but I'm talking solely about movies that involve rap stars rapping. I would like to see Em try other acting endeavors.<br/><br/>Ignore your bias - Just cause this movie involves Eminem, don't toss it to the side just because it stars him and you hate him and his music, that would be a bad move in my opinion and no it does not play out like a 2 hr music video and you will be seeing a real dramatic and not MTVish movie.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Remember as always, I do not intend to criticize, but give you information as an informed viewer. Critics look too much for flaws and refuse to just enjoy most of the time. As such, I do not rate movies as they all have merit of their own and I almost without exception like every movie I watch."

","I don't know or care anything about Eminem. I grew up outside Detroit and went to movie to see if my neighborhood would be on film.<br/><br/>This is an unusually accurate movie about having an alcoholic parent and living on the color border in Detroit.  The rest of this review is spoilery.<br/><br/>I think a lot of the reviewers here have entirely missed the point of the movie. It's not about Eminem. It's not about making it big.<br/><br/>
It's about figuring out how to get to work on time when you live in chaos. It's about maintaining your dreams before you succeed. It's about putting up with and trying to take care of your family and friends even though you'd rather not (much of the time). It's about living in Detroit.<br/><br/>The individual performances were very good, and the characters were (mostly) unusually realistic for a film. Someone said Basinger was too young to be Rabbit's mom. She's 19 years older than Eminem--that's three years older than is necessary. She portrayed an alcoholic with astonishing accuracy. Believe it or not, there are many attractive losers in the world and in Detroit. Playboy does not recruit in trailer parks. Perhaps the character could have become a hooker, but that is not the happy life you see in movies. The only thing unbelievable is that her teeth were in such good shape. Dentistry is expensive.<br/><br/>Murphy's character, the girl who will do ANYTHING to get out, was also very realistic. Most of the friends were people everyone knows (I found Cheddar Bob slightly over the top, but his house was awfully familiar; I could smell the cigarettes).<br/><br/>I'm surprised this movie was made. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The rap scene at the end was amazing. But if you can be that articulate, why would you ever need to hit anyone?<br/><br/>So interesting. 10 for 10 for me."

Basically, see this movie with an open mind.<br/><br/>I'll be honest, the plot of the movie isn't going to be the most complicated or original piece you've ever watched.  The power in this movie is from the performances of its cast and the vision of its director.  8 Mile is a moving movie if you can get past the hip-hop subculture.  Eminem does a convincing job of playing a tortured an unconfident man trying to make it.  It's pretty much a typical coming of age story, but it will capture you for the most part, for most of the movie."

","""8 Mile"", Curtis Hanson's look at a young rapper's rise to the top is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Eminem gives a stirring portrayal of Jimmy ""B.

Kim Basinger excels as Jimmy troubled mother, who stays with a boyfriend just because he claims he can provide for her soon. Throughout the movie Jimmy is given a hard time by his friends including Mekhi Pfiffer, who plays the role great despite his dreads. B Rabbit is also being stalked by a rival crew called the Leaders of the Free World, who only want to see him fail. I loved everything about the movie except for one thing that keeps it from a 10. The character of Cheddar Bob really annoyed me throughout. The humor he brings in the film feels forced at times. Despite this glaring fact, this is a great movie which i recommend to fans of Eminem or of Curtis Hanson, whos direction is Oscar worthy."

","Waddya mean this movie is predictable? What's a blue-collar white rappin' guy gonna be doing that wasn't depicted here?<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought that the movie showed a lot of guts in depicting the 'real America' and not the one where everyone lives in million-dollar houses in predominantly white suburbia. It showed a realistic depiction of  a blue-collar guy finding his own way. Sure some of the characters were a little on the 2-dimensional side but sometimes people are like that in life too.<br/><br/>As for Mr Mathers performance; I'd like to announce that this is a fine start to a promising acting career. Many have tried before (Elvis, Whitney, Sting... ad nauseum) and failed. So, the script didn't exercise his acting ability too much but I believed in the character.<br/><br/>Sure this isn't the 'true-to-life story of Marshall Mathers III' but it is analogous to some degree. The rap battles were particularly well photographed, directed and performed. The rhymes were awesome and hilarious and they showed Marshall's true talent.<br/><br/>Look beyond the hype and I think you'll find a well-told tale."
"nihonniboku","7","1","1","14 October 2002"," Good, but Nothing Special
","I was part of the very first audience in the world to see the final cut of 8 Mile. Universal Pictures and MTV held a special screening over here at Michigan State University last week, and the events of the night will be aired on MTV's Jammed, mostly because of the post-screening concert that Eminem held. But I digress...<br/><br/>The film itself is decent, but nothing special. The storyline is good, but it can get to be slow at times. The writing was good, but nothing really spectacular comes out of any of the characters mouths except for when they are freestyling. The acting was good, but it certainly won't win any awards. Eminem himself had relatively few lines, making it difficult to judge, which makes me curious if the producers were still worried about his acting ability. Kim Basinger for some reason tried to somewhat glamourize her role. The real insanity of his mom didn't come across as well it should have. Britney Murphy and Mekhi Phifer probably delivered the best performances, although neither actor is used to the best of their ability.<br/><br/>Growing up in the metro-Detroit area myself, it was nice to see that they actually filmed the movie in the city and surrounding areas, unlike last year's Exit Wounds which obviously wasn't shot anywhere near the city. Eminem's trailer park was in Warren for example, not Detroit. For people who don't know the Detroit area though, there is going to be some confusion while watching the movie. Especially when the characters make references to Cranbrook, and the various area codes in the region.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the movie is good, and there are no serious flaws with it, but it simply lacks that something special. Go see it if you're an Eminem fan. Go see it if you're from Detroit, if only to see Detroit on the big screen. It might be your only chance, even though it paints a bad picture of the city. If you don't fall into one of those two categories, I'd wait until it comes to video if you really want to see it, because the film really doesn't have a whole lot to offer to you."

Plus, who the hell would have sex in a factory?<br/><br/>Sure the rapping was good but that's all it was, a long music video depicting Eminem as the ruler of all he surveys. He's good but not that good.<br/><br/>The only plus to come out of the film was the performance of Mekhi Phifer as Future. At least he had a little bit of screen presence.<br/><br/>If you have yet to see it and expect this brilliant masterpiece some people will tell you it is then don't bother. If you have a hard on for Eminem and think he's the greatest rapper on the planet then this is the film for you."
"beatnick49","4","10","29","6 December 2004"," Like Saturday Night Fever in the 90s, and that's not a compliment
","This movie stinks, I didn't think highly of it and still don't. It is a rip off of Saturday Night Fever, only set in the 90s, for starters.<br/><br/>There are so many similarities between the two movies. For example; John Travolta has a lousy homelife, Eminem has a lousy homelife. John Travolta has a bland job, Eminem has a bland job. John Travolta seeks solace in his hobby and only escape, disco, Eminem seeks solace in his hobby and only escape, rapping. John Travolta goes into a contest, Eminem goes into a contest. John Travolta goes around town complaining with his mates, Eminem goes around town complaining with his mates. John Travolta meets a girl, Eminem meets a girl. John Travolta is a womaniser but gets upset when the lady he meets doesn't turn up, Eminem dumps his girlfriend but gets all upset when the new girl he meets is doing someone else. While I haven't seen the ending of either I'm guessing they both win the contests they enter.<br/><br/>There are a couple of differences between the two, SNF is fictional, while 8M has been the subject of debate as to whether is is true, semi-biographical, or fictional. Also, Travolta is actually king of the dance floor, Eminem must rise to the top. Another difference is that I actually like John Travolta; he seems like a nice person, makes a good interview, and he's worked for an Australian airline, yay. Eminem on the other hand I detest, he sings many of his songs with a hateful tone, and (another reason why I dislike this movie) he has a martyr complex numerous km wide, and wears it like a crown.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with Eminem's martyr complex, he's always wandering around with a pained look on his face, and frequently complains. ""Your friends don't know me"", ""We're still living at home with our mums."" Please! Whatever your hangup is Eminem get over it. I was glad to see this piece of trash for a movie sent up on Scary Movie 3.<br/><br/>However, One difference is that I could watch this movie longer than I could watch SNF. I reached a point in SNF where I had just had enough and went to bed. For this I was watching this at a friends place up to the end but missed it because I had to leave. It has been on TV but I have missed the ending there as well. So the director must have been doing something right to keep me watching.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, for this movie's unoriginality, protagonist, and annoying martyr complex running through it I give this four out of ten."

Overall the film story revolves around Eminem who plays a rap chap who battles other rap chaps. So its the plot of him doing his rap stuff with his ""Homies"" in other words his friends.

IM stunned and shocked a prostitute isn't a loyal girl, come on; not just any prostitute a prostitute with the worst hair style since Hillary Clinton. As annoying and stupid as Eminem's character is; his friends still manage to be annoying in their own way. The most annoying character since jar jar binks: cheddar bob. Why did the films writers and producers, in their infinite wisdom pick cheddar for bobs name? Why not Swiss bob? mozzarella bob? Or provolone bob? Muenster bob maybe? and the movie fails to specify what type of cheddar he is, is he mild or sharp? Well, we know he isn't sharp, I think his expiration date is a few years past. I am tired of hearing how great his rhymes are, a kindergarten class could write better stuff than he has in this movie. who does this stuff?

"AbrahamFroman","1","6","18","14 September 2003"," Terrible, vulgar, repulsive, but enough about Eminem...
","8 Mile of course is going to be the movie that people are going to love simply for the fact that the foul-mouthed eminem is in it. In the film, eminem is a poor, persecuted white boy who is being cruelly put down and crucified because white rappers are always being viciously put down and snagged on by black guys with dreadlocks, baggy pants, thousands of gold chains with dollar signs on them, and a firearm somewhere on them. Eminem of course curses, then he curses some more. He eventually gets on stage to do a ""rap battle"", which of course he loses, which really surprises me since anyone with the mental age of a six year old could easily perform any kind of rap song and wave their hands in the air like some kind of psychotic moron on crack. The whole point of the movie however is to try and make eminem look really great, which it miserably failed to do at least for me and here is why: The movie in several ways tries to mimic eminems early home life, trying to show his mother did not love him and so on. What message do I get out of this movie? Part of it is ""Be a rapper because anyone who does'nt even have a voice can do it, all rap is is basically talking in your own voice range and throw in a few hundred four letter words,"". The movie tries to glorify eminem in that he is really cool because he talks about raping women and killing them in his so-called ""Music"". Eminem is a very little man, and I can only conclude the same thing about the myriads of empty-headed baggy pants followers who I can only conclude never bothered to try and listen to any kind of music. In 10 years, no one will care about eminem at all, except for maybe eminem of course."

"overlook447","2","3","7","4 July 2003"," Highly overrated
","This film received fairly positive reviews and I even heard some Oscar talk concerning Eminem's performance.  I disagree and here is why:  The acting in this movie was generally laughable.  I wasn't expecting much in the way of acting from Mr. Mathers and that is exactly what I got.  His character was one-dimensional and featured the same line delivery for almost every single line.  Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob was silly and annoying.  I am thankful that The part of Janeane, played by Taryn Manning, was a small role.  I was embarrassed for her- I cringed every time she spoke.  Having Kim Basinger (who actually can act) in this movie really magnified the short-comings of the rest of the cast, although it wasn't one of her better performances either.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie I was able to enjoy was the rap-battle sequence at the end but this scene had its flaws as well.  The writing for the final raps was clever and smart but I was disappointed by the uninspired ""style"" of rapping by the combatants.  In Eminem's musical career, he excels by vocalizing in a way that is fresh and original but that is not the case here.  The director focused a bit too much on what they were saying (which was good) and not enough on how they were saying it.<br/><br/>A more impressive acting performance in recent times by a musical artist was Bjork's in ""Dancer in the Dark"".  Neither she nor Eminem will likely have enough acting range to form a long-term career in the movies but her very real portrayal in that film was noteworthy.<br/><br/>I give ""8 Mile"" a 2/10."

I guess not, since it pretends to be more of a drama, and the music supposed to give you a background to the hard life scenes from the Detroit poor people. I wonder how much Ms. Basinger was paid to agree on such a stupid role, she can do much better than that. Eminem, as always, is better musician than actor.<br/><br/>I guess if this movie was shot, say, 15 years ago, it would be shown all over the former Soviet Union, just to show how life in US sucks, and prove that Russian people do live much better than that.<br/><br/>Of course, not being black makes you miss some important things in this movie, taking into account that around 90% of cast is black.

By the end, the whole thing's spiraled into such a huge clichÃ© about ""how tough things are on the streets"" that you're watching just to see what other silly line is going to come out of the actors' mouths. It should become a cult favorite the way ""Showgirls"" has. The dialog is utterly ridiculous, none of the actors deliver performances that are anywhere near believable and Kim Basinger as Eminem's Mom??? How the heck did that get by the studio? Eminem is just plain awful in this role (if anyone ever gets hold of Conan O'Brien's spoof of it, they should post it on You Tube). I'm not convinced he's a bad actor because I think the blame on this one goes to director Curtis Hanson and writer Scott Silver who should know better. But we're supposed to believe that Eminem is some hard-ass white rapper from the tough streets of Detroit. The sad part is Eminem IS from the same area this film is about yet he's so unconvincing that you wonder if he even grew up there. Brittany Murphy turns out to be the worst of them all, however, turning in a performance on par with Sanjaya's singing on ""American Idol"" -- you cringe every time she has to say something. This role must have been an attractive one for her and probably helped her career but if I was her I'd mention it as little as possible in conversation because it shows the ugly side to her acting.

","I've seen many movies of singer telling how they made it or how they became big, in a way those movies were trite. One thing I like about this movie is that, this movie doesn't show you how Eminem became the best rapper in the world, but it ends showing he (B. Rabbit) realizes that he also can make it. In the end Eminem refuses Future to co-host the battles with him, because he realizes that his destiny wants something else.<br/><br/>Unlike other stars, I always believe that Eminem's life is an open book. Eminem is very honest, he is not a two faced person. He has committed many mistakes in his life, buy, he is a man enough to admit it. Talking about this film, its not just about rappers, while, it can be about anything in the world you love and trying very hard to attain it. The song 'lose yourself' is one of the most meaningful songs I've ever heard. The song is a mirror to the film. The song tells you to believe in yourself. "" You can be anything you set your mind to man..""<br/><br/>In this film, Jimmy Smith Jr. who doesn't have a good relationship with his mother, trying very hard to become a rapper. He is white, but wants to become go somewhere which is considered a black man's territory. He has 4 best friends, out of them 3 are black. These friends believe in Rabbit. There is a villainous group of rappers 'Free World' who dominates the rap battles. There's a guy Wink, who wants to en-cash the talent of both Rabbit and Papa Doc. Lastly, Alex, the infidel girlfriend of Rabbit, who has sex with Wink to advance her career.<br/><br/>Future always tells Rabbit, that Wink is scandalous stay away from him. But, Rabbit thinks that Wink might help him to get him a chance. But he is shattered when comes to know that Alex cheated on him with Wink. Wink shows his true colors, beats Rabbit with the help of Free World. In the end, Rabbit takes his revenge by beating the Free World and also obliterates the memories when he choked in the battle for the first time. <br/><br/>This movie doesn't show how Rabbit became a successful rapper, rather, it ends with Rabbit smiling and believing that he can become what he always have wanted to become. 8 mile is much more than a film, it is a learning curve. It is not just about the rapping, it can be associated with anything that we value in life and ready to give everything in our life to achieve it. This film is not about the success story of Eminem, but an honest story of Jimmy Smith who believes in his ability and knows he can become what he always aspired to become."

Hudson doesn't come from the same background as Eminem, so you can tell that Hudson & Eminem had a great, trustworthy bond, creating this movie together.<br/><br/>Mali Finn didn't cast quiet the all-star cast people would come see, but there was just enough raw emotion & charisma in all of the characters, to really build a great film, driven by the characters.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Scott Silver, was very raw, and ghetto natured. The emotional scenes seemed too scripted; Eminem's raps saved the script from being just okay.<br/><br/>The music and score all produced by Eminem, winning an Academy Award for Loose Yourself, was well thought out, beyond clever, and memorable. I personally tried to root for the antagonist rhymes, but they were all just inferior.<br/><br/>The cinematography by the up and coming Rodrigo Prieto was beautifully lit, with these dreary and dark scenes, to set this dull tone. The art directors in Phillip Messina, Kevin Kavanaugh & Harry E. Otto, shot this in the best location possible, Detroit.

","Eminem's head-on foray into the big screen is not as good as I remembered. While it is a solid film with a lethal soundtrack and some fine grim imagery of 1990's Detroit, it is fairly lacking when it comes to story and writing. Eminem is Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith. A steel-stamper at a car factory in Detroit. He is back living at home in his mother's trailer following the breakdown of his relationship. He dreams of making it on the rap and hip/hop circuit, but he is faced with prejudice on every stage as he is a white man attempting to make it in a black game. He chases this dream at 'The Shelter' where he engages in rap battles. After a bad night, he decides that something has got to happen with this soon, or he is out. He can't chase this dream on these bad streets much longer.<br/><br/>""Lose Yourself"". One of Eminem's best songs was born from this movie, and it epitomises the soundtrack. Eminem is brilliant as Rabbit. It could have been a disaster, but watching his performance again last night I noticed he was modest and fairly humble. ""8 Mile""s slight downfall is it's script. There is only so much Mathers can do here. We get a lot of what I'd call dead-end scenes of Rabbit and his crew bickering, meditating on life and getting in and back out of broken up Ford Escorts. Brittany Murphy's character was completely pointless. The last rap battle is truly epic and represents a tremendous character transformation. We root for Jimmy in them final scenes like we do for the underdog fighter in a million and one boxing movies."

I hear people say that rap is annoying and it's not 'real music' because they're not singing, only speaking fast, but watching the scathing, cunning and brutal rap battles in this movie I shudder at the thought of trying to keep that pace. Not just the pronunciation but the thoughts, the innovation, the ad-libbing.<br/><br/>So, it's a music movie. In a way you could even call it a musical because characters spontaneously burst into performance like they do in 'The Sound of Music'. Mostly it's a standard underdog story. Eminem is a guy in the dumps, close to rock bottom, but he endures and rises to the challenge with his quick wits and his perseverance. He's not a bad actor and the character is sympathetic enough.

The film covers his journey as he attempts to make the most of what could be his final chance to launch a rap career in a genre usually dominated by African Americans.<br/><br/>Directed by Curtis Hanson & written by Scott Silver, the story is pretty generic considering it's the same underdog tale we've seen many times before but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable for the rap contests here are a treat to watch. There's nothing special about any of its technical aspects although Eminem does provide us with one of the greatest & most inspiring songs ever written.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Brittany Murphy, Kim Basinger, Michael Shannon, Anthony Mackie & others. Eminem is actually quite convincing in his given role & is at his best during the film's final act. Murphy also manages to shine here, Phifer plays his role very well & so does Mackie, while Basinger & Shannon do a fine job in their supporting role.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 8 Mile is at its most entertaining during the rap battles but barely manages to hang along without those moments. The final act is what finishes the film on a high as seeing B-Rabbit completely decimate each n every one of his opponents is highly reminiscent of what Slim Shady did in real life & then to follow it up with Lose Yourself is an icing on the cake that shows why he's still The Undisputed King of Hip-Hop. A definite must for his fans."

","Only get those movie if its under £5, otherwise its not worth it. It's An average film with OK acting, BUT the music is absolutely amazing. I've got the soundtrack on my phone, it's almost worth Just buying the film for the music and the rap battles! On the other hand Eminem is a great actor (seeing as he's a rapper). But yeah definitely not worth over £5. It's is pretty funny though I did enjoy the laughs, they're is a lot of darkness as well. Basically it's 'B-Rabbit' (Eminem) in the ghettos of Detroit doing rap battles to try and become a famous rapper. However he lives in a caravan with his mom, so people are always bringing this up in the battles until the last one where he goes first and says everything about himself so his opponent has nothing to say, her therefore winds by default"

","(This review is based off of a repeat viewing, and not a first-time view) It's easy to write off 8 Mile. After all, it stars Eminem, an it was virtually ignored by the Oscars. It did win the Best Original Song award. So that's something. Rappers as actors, easy to disregard. Eminem changes that idea, and turns in a rather groundbreaking performance playing herself. He really dominates every scene that he's in. He never looks lost, and really feels invested in his character and performance. He's definitely one of the better rapper/actors we've seen.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is really good too. Kim Basinger, especially, turns in one of her best performances as his crazy mother. Her desperation is obvious in every frame. Brittany Murphy is great as Eminem's love interest, and Michael Shannon works well in a small role as a sleazy guy.<br/><br/>Since I'm reviewing this film on my third or fourth viewing, eleven years after it first came out, this is kind of a skewed review. But I've loved the film every time I've seen it. That has to stand for something.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film in a while, go back and explore it. Really watch Eminem, and you'll see his potential. Or, watch it again to appreciate what the late Brittany Murphy had to offer. She had so much going for her, I wish we had been able to see her career all the way to her old age."
"jb_campo","Null","0","0","13 July 2014"," Worthy effort by Eminem saves simple story
","My teenage son suggested we rent 8 Mile because he has been listening to a lot of Eminem's rap music lately. The story is pretty simple really. These rappers in downtrodden Detroit look to rap as a way to get a record deal and escape the hopelessness they experience daily.<br/><br/>If they work, they work in manual labor plants making car parts, or drink, or fight, or hang out. Eminem is the hope whose coattails these good guys hang to. They have a beef with the Free World rappers, not sure why. They act like Eminem is the only white guy they ever saw. You could look at this as Rocky, or as Karate Kid, where the leader is looking to get out and better himself while there are forces trying to hold him back..<br/><br/>Eminem's mom, played by Kim Basinger, gives a decent portrayal as his down and out mom living in a trailer park, shacking up with some going nowhere dude who is obviously just using her. Eminem's posse is pretty interesting, and they have his back always. They get into trouble and do stuff, and people promise stuff that turns out to be smoke/mirrors. It's all leading up to the climatic final rap battle at The Shelter.<br/><br/>Eminem does a pretty good acting job as Rabbit. My son thinks that the young girl theme follows his music, so there may be some reality behind the young Hailey who lives with his mom in the trailer. Finally Brittany Murphy is the shining star, acting wise. With her impish look, floused up hair, red lipstick, and cheap talk, she oozes sex appeal, and Eminem succumbs. She teaches him a lesson or two about honesty and how to make it in a tough world, and boy does he learn.<br/><br/>Overall, a better than average film that gives you a stark view of the poverty of Detroit, and the lives of the 3-1-3 people of D. Enjoy.<br/><br/>p.s. You should watch the Special Features Rap Battle segment which shows a really cool rap battle put on by the production team with the extras. good stuff."

","The story is based with a good premise about a struggle from the bottom. But the development wasn't that good. the side conflicts are too messed up they don't really intertwine, they are more like entangled on each other. The whole movie is just one slow work when it's about pace building. The editing doesn't help clear the mess up either. Although I must say that the mood of being quite gloomy and cold was maintained well and stable throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The acting is quite nice. Eminem did quite a nice job, one so predictable considering he is playing his own real-life experience. Kim Basinger also do quite good, although she doesn't really get the drift. So does Brittany Murphy in her role. The real attraction from this movie is those tight rap battle scenes and also.the freestyle lyrics. A 6 out of 10 is from me."

","I enjoy some of Eminem's music, and I think he is actually a fairly decent actor (well, compared to 50 Cent at least).<br/><br/>""8 Mile"" is watchable, but could've been better, I think. The film feels rushed and under-developed. I know it's essentially a vanity project (autobiography, perhaps), but they should've added more substance to it. Such an interesting/explorable personality as Eminem deserves better than this.<br/><br/>There are quite a few cringe-worthy moments. The nicknames were ridiculous. ""Bunny Rabbit""? Are you kidding me? Can anyone take a guy seriously with a nickname THAT dumb? And I think I know why they named that other guy ""Cheddar Bob"". Because this character is CHEESY beyond all human comprehension. He is just kind of out of place there.<br/><br/>The characters were mostly underdeveloped and quite one-dimensional. There is very little introduction to the leads, let alone the supporting cast. The black guys (the antagonists) all look the same and you can't really tell who's who. Also, you don't understand ""Future's"" involvement with Jimmy and his relationship with the ""bad"" guys. It should have been explained to at least some extent.<br/><br/>Jimmy's ex-girlfriend appears in the movie for no apparent reason -- her screen time is precisely 5 seconds. We never get to find out anything about her, except that she's the crappy actress that starred alongside Britney Spears in the lame disaster that her movie ""Crossroads"" was. Looks like this woman specializes in playing minor roles in musicians' vanity projects.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger IS a good actress, but, in my opinion, she was miscast. Not only is she unconvincing as trailer trash, but she really doesn't fit in with the rest of the cast. She is far too talented to star alongside such amateurs.<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy, on the other hand, does a fairly good job. While she is not super-talented, she is surprisingly good at playing a trailer trash junkie hooker. <br/><br/>But are we supposed to feel any sympathy for Jimmy when his new ""girlfriend"" (Brittany Murphy) makes fun of / cheats on him? For Pete's sake, she's the local prostitute, who has slept with most, if not all, of the guys Jimmy is feuding with, so what the f*** was he thinking asking out the neighborhood hooker? <br/><br/>But, please, tell me who did her hair for this movie. That person needs to be named and shamed.<br/><br/>The little girl is terrible. Her parents must be friends with Eminem or someone involved with the movie; I see no other reason why she'd get the part. There are many really talented child actors, who could have benefited from this role, but THIS is the one they picked...? Why?<br/><br/>Anyway... I did like the movie back when it first came out, and, having watched it again the other day, still enjoyed it. I won't say it's one of THE BEST movies ever made (it's not), but it's entertaining enough for my taste."

The story line had a lot of heart in it and portrayed the life of a young rapper wanting to make it big and the problems he faced to do so. A must watch film for any rap fan and anyone who likes a film full of heart. Set in Detroit where the 8 Mile is a boundary between where and who you want to be.

The late Brittany Murphy acts her character to her full potential and as always has a very appealing charm about her."

","I was seriously impressed by L.A confidential and wonder Boys.So i came forward to check out all of Curtis Hanson's movies. And then i stumbled onto 8 mile, starring Eminem. At first i was surprised to see a movie with Eminem in the lead. But then i was like can Eminem seriously act? And then i watched it. Although it may not have been the best of the movies ever made by Curtis Hanson, it was definitely better than what i expected it to be! Eminem was quite convincing as a wannabe rapper trying to make his way in Detroit. Quite unexpectedly, Eminem's first song in the movie is a lullaby which he sing to his sister. And he is good for most part in the movie. The direction is good too. Although the story has some minor loopholes, the movie never fails to engage.He does not get into clichés with too many songs or unnecessary dragging, just to woo the fans. All of the songs are appropriate and well placed. Kim Basinger does justice too her role. So does the rest of the cast. Murphy was okay. She did not have too much screen time to do something impressive anyhow. Over all, this movie was satisfactory. Some people might not want to watch this just because it has Eminem in it. But trust me, that guy can act. And with a director like Hanson, you can trust the movie has some good content.8/10 from me!"

","8 mile is a stretch of urban decay in Detroit. The rapper Eminem grew up there in a predominantly black neighborhood, which makes for a great story. A white kid struggling to make a career in a place where he doesn't belong. Here, he is Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, and he lives in a trailer with his mother, Stephanie(Kim Basinger), his sister, Lily, and mom's boyfriend, Greg; this is one screwed up family; not exactly the Waltons. A club nearby has rap contests, and on his first try, he chokes up and leaves the stage a failure. He works at a factory, doing as many hours as possible, to save enough money to buy a house. On his off time, he still works on his music in preparation for a tournament at the club against other rappers. It all leads to the inevitable showdown in which Rabbit must find the weak points of his opponent to his advantage.

","I guess anybody could act in a movie about their own life but Eminem still did do a good job. 8 mile is a neighborhood in Detroit where young Eminem tried to become known. 8 Mile is a story of Bunny Rabbit, Eminem, struggling to make it in the rap industry and life in general. He attempts a rap battle and fails. He draws a blank and completely embarrassed himself. Rabbit then decides to put his life on track and focus on his actual job and less on his friends, the 313rd gang if you will. He stays loyal to his friends and still tries to rap but he struggles throughout the movie with love, work, rap, his mother, friends, enemies, and life in general. <br/><br/>As a rapper Eminem is fantastic, my favorite even so I'm a little biased towards the movie to be honest. His acting was sub-par but I had very little expectations. The character Rabbit was very interesting. He flipped his priorities a lot between his family, his job, his friends, and his musical career. He was unsure of what he really wanted and he tried to do everything at once. He is a great character. He is smart, talented, funny, and even relatable. Everyone has been through tough times and everything seems to go from bad to worse. This is basically what happens. The movie starts with Rabbit breaking up with his girlfriend, embarrassing himself at the rap battle, he is poor, he hates his job, frustrated with his life, himself, his friend, and everything else in general. He goes home to his mother and daughter and she is having sex with a gross man who is just a few years older than him. His life is just pure hell and it was based off of his real life so I really hope it wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>It is based on a true story, it isn't the real story. Rabbit is Eminem. Lily is his daughter Haley. His mother resembles his actual mother. His girlfriend who cheats on him and he has problems with is Kim, the 313rd is the rap group D12 and Future is his lifelong friend Proof. True Eminem fans like me pick up on little details that are from his real life and are appreciated. This movie also shows the culture of Detroit and the projects. African Americans struggling and their only way out is rap. The story is brilliant and I'm a sucker for rags to riches story lines. Sure it's cheesy but it does work here.<br/><br/>Problems with the movie were few but they do exist. The movie is so depressing and there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. In the end Rabbit wins the rap battle and gets back at his enemies but he is still poor, he still has a poor job, he still lives with his mom, and his life is still horrible. All the ending brings is hope, but sometimes hope is enough. During the rap battles I could not understand a thing they were saying. They spoke too fast but subtitles easily fix that problem. This is no Oscar wining movie but it was a lot bigger than it was supposed to be. 8 Mile was incredibly popular and it deserves the credit. <br/><br/>Many rappers were in this movie which was interesting. People who don't normally act were thrown into a movie and acted. Granted they were just being themselves so it was more of an extreme documentary than a movie but I loved it.<br/><br/>Overall 8 Mile is great. It won't go down in history as one of the best, Eminem should never be on the big screen as a major role again, but he was entertaining. The movie was entertaining bringing many memorable scenes and moments true fans will never forget. This movie definitely gets the WillyT seal of approval. Being a loyal fan of Eminem and this work I do enjoy hearing about his struggles and how he was inspired to write his music. There are many faces to Eminem and he portrays them well in 8 Mile. I was entertained; I can watch it casually or with friends and I can see it again and again. I actually watched it twice in the past week. Once with friends and once alone and I loved it just the same both times. 8 Mile is a great movie for what it is. It exceeded expectations and deserves to be known in the movie world."
"ComedyFan2010","7","0","0","7 July 2012"," Way better than most musician movies
","I remember when this movie came out I as a young girl and I absolutely loved it. I didn't care for rap (and I still don't), but I had a huge crush on Eminem after it. Rewatching it 10 years later makes me less impressed, but I still believe that it was in general well done.<br/><br/>I would like to say that Eminem did a good job. I don't think it was an Oscar worthy performance or that he did something extraordinary, but he was convincing and didn't make me cringe. I am even surprised now that he didn't do more acting. I used to think he will become an actor like Justin Timberlake did.<br/><br/>Of course it shouldn't be too hard to act when the movie is his semi biography. One can see the problems with his mom that affected him so much in life that it was basically all he was talking about back in the days of the movie. Glad to know that he kind of stopped now. One could first think of Kim Basinger as a surprising choice given the age difference they have, but one should remember that Eminem is playing someone much younger than himself and this makes her a pretty good choice. I would like to know what his real mom thought of this, she must have been flattered.<br/><br/>I think Brittany Murphy is a very talented performer but in this movie she was awful. Same unnatural facial expression all the time. She was even horrible in the sex scene that would otherwise be very hot.<br/><br/>I think one of the things that annoyed me the most in the movie was trying to make Rabbit look like the good father for his sister. I hate those techniques to get sympathy from the viewer. And it was so sweet it was vomit provoking.<br/><br/>I think the scenery was great, including the factory and its lunch yard. It give a wonderful and fitting mood to the movie I still think the movie is good.<br/><br/>I believe it is made more for the age group I was in 10 years ago, his i why I loved it then. Also if one likes rap it definitely meas on enjoy it and especially the battle scenes much more. And I am not even talking about Eminem fans, they will love it"

"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","0","21 April 2012"," For Better or Worse, It's All About Marshall
","As publicity-focused biopics go, 8 Mile is one of the better-executed examples. Although it's self-serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self-imposed blockade of excuses he laid out for himself before catching so much as a whiff of stardom. The plot outside of Mr. Marshall Mathers is fairly simplistic and limited, though, with most of the cast simply orbiting the star and reacting to his angry, frustrated outbursts. I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance. Eminem himself is startlingly good in the lead role; it may not too much of a stretch to play yourself in the cinematic story of your own rise to fame, but I've certainly seen plenty try and fail. Authentic, street-smart inspiration that offers a fresh take on a tired old tale."
"rahul-atri","8","0","0","30 December 2011"," If you had one shot or one opportunity, To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment. Would you capture it or just let it slip?
","8 Mile may be about a rapper, but it isn't really about rap. It's about rap as much as Raging Bull is about boxing. 8 Mile is mostly a character study on Rabbit. Rabbit is a very interesting character and Eminem does a great job. Now, I realize Eminem is pretty much just playing himself, but that isn't a bad thing. Rabbit is a very likable character who just wants to make a good life for himself and his family. He's an easy character to get behind. By the end of the film, you are very invested in Rabbit's fate and you want to see him succeed.<br/><br/>The other characters here are also solid. Kim Basinger is great as Rabbit's mother Stephanie. At times you'll get so mad at her you just wanna slap her. But for the most part, you just feel sorry for her. Brittany Murphy plays Alex, the film's love interest. Murphy is great in this role and really sells that Rabbit would go for this woman. Probably the best supporting characters in the film are the members of Rabbit's crew. The group is made up of mostly unknown actors, but almost all of them are great. These characters aren't as deep as Rabbit, but they're interesting and likable anyway. A huge highlight of the film was just watching these characters interact. Of Rabbit's friends, my favourite was Future, played by Mekhi Phifer. The only character I have issues with is Cheddar Bob, played by Evan Jones. He provided a lot of comedic relief and while some of it was good, other bits seemed awkward and forced.<br/><br/>8 Mile is directed by Curtis Hanson (L.A Confidential). Hanson does a good job of capturing the setting and the world the film takes place in. The film feels very authentic. During a lot of scenes, you almost feel like a fly on the wall watching a conversation unfold.<br/><br/>Bottom line, you don't need to be a fan of Eminem to enjoy 8 Mile. While it does everything well to a degree, it's the performances in this that really make it worth watching. Particularly Eminem, who if you don't enjoy his music, you'll still enjoy his acting in this."
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","0","31 October 2011"," A newfound respect for rap
","I've never been a fan of rap music. I've never had any interest in it and its never been enjoyable to listen to for me. However, after watching 8 Mile I have developed a whole new respect for freestyle rap artists. I didn't use the more generic term ""rappers"" for a reason. I've developed a respect for the actual artists of the genre, the true poets and lyrical aficionados within the genre. Especially Eminiem, the lead in the film who plays Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, an impoverished young guy living in Detroit, just trying to make it out alive. The movie tells his story about his desire to make it big and all of the other factors holding him back. He is constantly barraged with problems concerning his mom and her abusive boyfriend, his friends who get him in nothing but trouble, and surviving as a white guy in a society dominated by African Americans. His make it or break it story is so compelling and so moving that it almost makes me want to start listening to Eminem.<br/><br/>At first it is hard to get into 8 Mile. On the outside so many of the characters in this film seem like a bunch of useless punks whose lives are going nowhere. From the first few minutes of the film we get the impression that we won't be able to connect with these somewhat pathetic characters. But as the movie progresses and grows more dramatic and more emotionally gripping we begin to see these characters as deep and complex humans whose stories are meaningful and who do serve a purpose in creating an all around excellent narrative. I never thought I could care so much about Eminem, but his portrayal of B-Rabbit makes me want to cheer for him all the way amidst his never ending hardships. There are a few characters who don't seem to grow throughout the movie and I had the same feelings about them at the end as I did in the beginning. But the important characters are the ones who I really grew to enjoy as I felt compelled to see and hear their story.<br/><br/>But what really makes 8 Mile work is the overall atmosphere and the superb way in which the chaos and insanity of poverty stricken Detroit operates. The dirty and musky city streets against the dark and ragged cityscapes accentuate this film's bleak atmosphere perfectly. It helps that it was actually shot in Detroit, but Curtis Hanson, the film's director, does an excellent job of framing all of his shots to capture Detroit in the somber light he wanted it in, full of false hope and empty promises that only a true fighter can overcome.<br/><br/>Credit also goes out to the screenwriter, Scott Silver, for doing such a fantastic job at capturing the fast moving, jumbled, cluttered dialect of the characters in the movie. The way they yell, argue, and talk over each other really gives the sense that these are real characters in real situations, thus making us more interested and more gripped by the emotional storyline. There is a cadence here dominated by slang and slickness, not to mention the actual raps which consist of some of the foulest yet hilariously entertaining put downs you'll ever hear. It's where the true poetry of rap comes in. 8 Mile really puts forth an effort to make rap seem like an art, rather than a joke and the results are excellent. This movie is an absolute triumph and shouldn't be missed."

","Jimmy Rabbit is a white kid on the poor (black) side of town. Growing up with this influence he has developed rapping skills but is too intimidated to showcase in the cruel 'Shelter' battles. Split from his girlfriend, Jimmy returns to his Mum's trailer park home and her young boyfriend. He keeps his job in a pressing shop while working on his rhymes and trying to work out who, out of all the hopes and promises, will be able to help him work his way out of Detroit.<br/><br/>After missing preview screenings and not being able to go when friends went, I eventually saw this a few nights ago. I was maybe better prepared by this point because the hype had been watered down by a few bad or balanced reviews of the film in the media. This helped me lower my expectations so that I wasn't let down. The plot is, well, difficult to describe because there isn't really one narrative to speak of, rather it is Rabbit's story. As a result it is a little rambling with things just drifting through the film. However that it still works is to it's credit. The film holds the attention and the story still has enough in it to follow it.<br/><br/>The telling is what does it the best I think. The direction is good, with washed out cameras not willing to glamorize anything. The biggest smart move was the liberal use of hip-hop through the film. Occasionally we get a beat of a song but it isn't wall to wall music like many rapper's films. Even where a Eminem track is played, Em's voice is limited to a few broken up words – saving his skills for the climax. Some of the film doesn't work – I got tired of several rap scenes in everyday situations and it didn't grasp me as reality (although in fairness I don't know if this is the norm in some lives). Also there are a few too many scenes of meaningless violence that didn't come across as normal life for Rabbit but instead felt like the film trying to show Rabbit to be tough and ready for action.<br/><br/>It is difficult to write a fair review after seeing the climax – which his why I left it a few days before writing this. The climax is a series of short battles in the Shelter that are pumping and exciting. Not to spoil it but some of the rapper's lines are cool – until Em takes his turns and rips the place down. It was so funny and funky that I wished that he had made some of his own joints that sharp in his recent Benzino disses. This is where he shines in the role but he also does well generally – maybe not worthy of an Oscar nomination but certainly very good. He makes his character likable but not easily, and he avoids being a sympathy figure.<br/><br/>Phieffer is not as good and didn't convince me as well as I've seen him do. He can act but here he is not really a good character. The support cast are all pretty good and are believable and only a few are clear stereotypical groups. Happily the usual rapper cameos are minimal and not in your face too much. There may be more but I only spotted Xhibit and Obi Trise and neither of them took anything away by their presence. Murphy is pretty good – sexy yet trashy – but her character and her sub- plot didn't really have anywhere to go and just became another part of the wandering story. Basinger is OK but she isn't as bad as I expected her to be (or felt she needed to be). She didn't need to be like his Mum in the songs, but a little less 'victim of circumstance' would have helped buy into it.<br/><br/>The message is worthy but heavily made and the story part of the film just didn't totally come off for me – instead it was a bit ordinary and not well written. However the telling makes it worth seeing – the direction is pretty good and the liberal use of music is one of the many good touches, meanwhile Eminem ensures that it is always worth watching – whether doing witty disses in a car park, ripping the opposition in a battle or just being understated in a good role.

","8 Mile is the movie that is somewhat based on the life of Eminem. It is about young man, Jimmy Smith Jr. also known as ""Rabbit"" who is played by Eminem, that is striving to be better and break away from the dead end that he is living in. He has grown up in Detroit in the poor (black) side of town. He dreams of being a rapper, but ends up choking when battling it out at the local night club. In hopes of being able to record an album, Rabbit moves in with his alcoholic mother, Stephanie Smith, played by Kim Basinger, in order to save some money. <br/><br/>Rabbit ends up meeting Alex, played by Brittany Murphy, and things start to take a turn for the better. When Rabbit finds out that Alex is not faithful to him, it really pushes him to be the best that he can be with his rapping. He finally finds the courage to stand up and battle it out at the night club.<br/><br/>I think that the Director did a great job with the lighting throughout the movie. The movie was shot in low key lighting that really helped to give a sense of the anger, fear, agony, and confusion that rabbit was dealing with in the movie, along with making Detroit seem more believable. <br/><br/>A lot of the angles of the camera were close ups throughout the film, and this really helped us to see the changes that were taking place in Rabbit throughout the movie. In the beginning of the movie he was filled with a lot of fear, but in the end of the movie you could see that he had learned to break through that fear and succeed. One of the turning points for Rabbit breaking through his fear was when he was talking with Alex, and she told him that she believed in him. Sometimes that is all a person needs is someone to believe in them.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of movies similar to this one like Get Rich or Die Trying and Save the last Dance that deal with similar themes of over coming obstacles and fear in your life. I think this movie really does a good job in portraying, that in order to succeed in life you just have to believe in yourself and work hard. There will always be obstacles that will try to to drag you down, but you have to have the courage to prevail."
"sharp23-1-779445","9","0","0","16 March 2011"," The story of 8 Mile centers around the life struggles and aspiring rapping career of a young, poor, white male named Jimmy Smith aka Rabbit.
","Rabbit is played by Martial Mathers, who is better known as the controversial rapper, Eminem. Kim Bassinger co-stars in the film as Rabbit's emotionally unstable mother, Stephanie. Brittany Murphy also co-stars as Rabbit's new girlfriend, Alex.<br/><br/>Rabbit grew-up in an unstable home on the wrong side of Detroit, Michigan with his alcoholic mother, where he still lives with his younger sister and his mother's young boyfriend whom Rabbit seriously does not get along with. Throughout the film there is the common, cliché feud of the opposing neighborhood crew that Rabbit and his friends feud with. In addition to these struggles, Rabbit deals with old girlfriend troubles and the start of the new relationship with Alex. Rabbit feels that his rapping skills are his only hope to escape the poverty, and hardships he is surrounded by. Rabbit makes various efforts to market his rap skills and prove him being white does not affect his musical ability, but he struggles to be accepted and respected by his local rap community. Do to this, and various other life problems, Rabbit begins to doubt himself.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is if you want something in life to not let anyone, even your own your own self doubt, stop you from achieving your dreams. Despite various betrayals by those he trusted, family troubles and being violently jumped by his rivals, Rabbit must stay strong and not let these problems break him down and ruin his shot at his rap dream. This film, and its theme, are similar to popular films such as the movie Get Rich or Die Trying and Hustle n Flow. Both of these films are about young, poor men from the projects who fight to pursue their dream of becoming well-known and well-respected rappers.<br/><br/>The lighting and color of 8 Mile are dark, gray and gloomy which helps the viewer feel the dreary, sad emotions of Rabbit, and helps the viewer feel the sense of being stuck in the projects of Detroit, Michigan. The strong language and rap music used in this film are necessary to help the viewer understand, and to properly illustrate, the life style of Rabbit, and also to help the viewer understand his struggles and aspirations.<br/><br/>Unlike many films where musicians try to cross-over into the acting, Eminem was very believable portraying Rabbit. 8 Mile, and the story of Rabbit's pursuit to become a respected white rapper, does a great job of demonstrating that one's self-doubt can be their worst enemy, and a person should trust in themselves, and fight for what they want."

","8 Mile is a movie based largely on an early life of Eminem in the suburb of Detroit. The movie does not show how Eminem became world-famous rapper. It shows that he was a talented white guy who loved rap which is primarily demesne of black guys. The film pictures very well how hard it is to make a breakthrough in music business. You have to be really gifted and likable and differ from others. Eminem shows exactly that. And there's no wonder what he has achieved for today. <br/><br/>Eminem has a flair to do well. His rapping is exceptional. But he also proves he can act. He portraits basically himself though, so it's not that hard as landing on the moon. But nevertheless, he gives a good performance. He can talk, not only rap.<br/><br/>Of course, what I most liked in this film, is music. Soundtrack is awesome. And I really enjoyed all the gigs in the movie. The lyrics were occasionally so money. As a big fan of Eminem and his music, I fully enjoyed it."

","Directed by Curtis Hanson, ""8 Mile"" is essentially a vehicle for hip-hop heavyweight Eminem to tell the tale of how he went from a trailer-park dwelling blue-collar worker to a pop music superstar seemingly overnight. Rather than capture all of the glories of fame, ""8 Mile"" instead focuses on the rapper's rugged beginnings and, although only loosely based on his life-story, humanizes the rapper, who at the time of the film's release, was the most controversial force in music.<br/><br/>The film opens with our hero, B-Rabbit (as portrayed by Eminem), practicing his routine in front of a bathroom mirror before engaging in a rap competition. Unfortunately, he fails before he even begins, and the rest of the film follows him as he struggles with poverty, his overbearing mother (Kim Basinger), his lesser-motivated crew of friends, his ex-girlfriend, his current girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) who will apparently do anything for her big break and a posse of hardcore rappers who may or may not see him as a threat, but see fit to beat him down at any opportunity anyway.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about ""8 Mile"" is how realistic and down to Earth it really is. A vanity project this is not, as Eminem clearly had a story worth telling and the film doesn't skimp on the dirt. The cinematography goes a long way in capturing the gritty feel of a decaying city and the people that inhabit it. From the decrepit trailer parking and crumbling buildings to the broken down vehicles that cart the characters around to their various jobs and musical endeavors, everything in the film has a genuine feel. You truly feel like you are on the cold streets of Detroit, alone and depressed. Even Eminem, arguably the most successful pop-culture figure at the time, looks miserable and underfed, which is only amplified by his random fits of rage which come all too naturally but feel justified within the context of the film.<br/><br/>They say it's tougher to play yourself than a character, and if that is so, then Eminem would have been wise to further pursue a film career (you know, aside from his hilarious cameo in ""Funny People""). His performance in this film is grounded and realistic, and we often find the rapper acting circles around more seasoned pros like Brittany Murphy (whose role suffers for being poorly written) and Mekhi Phifer (who plays essentially every character he's ever played before, albeit, with dreadlocks) and is sure to convince anyone regardless of whether you're a fan of his music/public persona or not. A few minor flaws do little to drag it down, and in spite of its oppressive tone at times, it's an uplifting and inspirational film that is likely to win over even the most cynical viewer."

","I found this to be a semi-pleasant surprise and gained some sympathy for the Eminems of the world along the way. To be honest, if he'd been black I wouldn't have been able to relate much.<br/><br/>I also learned what could motivate people to participate in this belligerent, mostly insulting form of music. It seems to be a matter of desperation, plus some innate obsession with rap as an art form. That part must be very internal, since I've never come close to feeling it myself.<br/><br/>I find rap mostly tuneless and grating, like listening to people hollering while banging on garbage cans. Prodigal musical talent doesn't seem to be required, just a chip on one's shoulder from life's hard knocks or whatever. This film at least got me thinking there's more to rap than pure criminality. <br/><br/>There was still a lot of mindless thug-talk, but not quite of the type I expected. It did open my eyes culturally, to a degree.<br/><br/>It seems when you come from nothing and have nothing to lose, latching on to a rude set of ""musical"" principles might indeed be your only way out. The Eminem character was lucky to be brighter than the average underdog, and found a way to rise above his situation by sinking into another one.<br/><br/>I'll never understand the whole ""culture of attitude"" (coming from any race) but this was a well-told story in its own right, enjoyable to watch, never boring, and quite funny at times."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","18 May 2010"," A mostly good and sometimes moving rap drama, with a notable lead performance
","After several years of massive commercial success, controversial rapper Eminem got to star in this fictionalized biopic. I was sixteen when this was released, and knew very well who played the lead role. I remember hearing Eminem's Oscar-winning hit from the soundtrack, ""Lose Yourself"", many times when it was current and liking the song. I remember being interested in seeing the movie for a while, but lost that interest before it happened. I think ""8 Mile"" was brought back to my attention by the sudden tragic death of Brittany Murphy last December. I knew she provided the voice of Luanne Platter in the long-running cartoon sitcom, ""King of the Hill"", but I had never seen her in any live action roles. Finally watching this film nearly eight years after its release, it certainly didn't blow me away, but was still a memorable experience.<br/><br/>Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith is a young, troubled aspiring rapper whose life is very troubled at the moment. He has just failed miserably at a local rap battle, too intimidated to compete, and currently lives in a Detroit trailer park with his alcoholic mother, Stephanie, his significantly younger sister Lily, and his mother's rotten new boyfriend, Greg Buehl. He cares deeply for his sister, but life with his disturbed mother isn't easy, and Greg certainly isn't helping. Jimmy has recently broken up with his pregnant girlfriend, Janeane, and currently has a dead-end job in a metal-pressing factory. He is trying to get his rap music career off the ground, but this proves to be difficult. One day at the factory, he meets a young woman named Alex, who is on her way to New York and aspiring to be a model. She soon becomes his new girlfriend, and it eventually turns out that the wannabe rapper will get to make his demo, so it seems that life is getting better for him, but unfortunately, his troubles are far from over.<br/><br/>Eminem (born Marshall Bruce Mathers III) didn't have a major acting career prior to this film, and certainly hasn't done a lot of on screen acting since. Nonetheless, his performance as the protagonist here is very impressive, playing a very flawed, short-tempered character, but one with redeeming qualities, such as his affection for his sister. Since ""8 Mile"" is partially biographical, based on Eminem's past, it was obviously a perfect role for him. The beginning may be a little shaky, but most of the film is intriguing, showing different aspects of the protagonist's life, including his dysfunctional home, his group of friends, his workplace, his rivals, and eventually his relationship with Alex, the character played by the late Brittany Murphy. Some scenes are very gripping, such as the fights Jimmy has with Greg. There are some weak parts of this movie, such as scenes where it's hard to pay attention to the dialogue over the loud rap music, and one particularly overlong sex scene with Jimmy and Alex. Certainly not everything in this rap drama works, but most of it does, to varying degrees.<br/><br/>I was in high school when this hit 2002 release came into theatres and then into stores, and I'm sure many of my peers saw it around that time. I even heard one of my fellow students talking about a four-year-old boy (a cousin or something) she knew watching the movie and quoting from it, which she seemed to think was really cute. A four-year-old watching an R-rated movie is pretty messed up, and for some reason, hearing this may have been what put me off watching it! However, even though it took years for me to get around to watching ""8 Mile"", I was reasonably impressed when I finally did. It's certainly not a film everybody could handle, with all the swearing, violence (sometimes with blood), and sex, but if you're old enough for all this and can take it, plus you're into the rap/hip hop genre (or at least some of it) and don't hate Eminem as a rapper, it could be worth watching, even if you don't think too highly of him as a person."

Eminem plays his character very well and the stuff he sings has meaning and actually sounds good (I'm not a big rap fan).

I also hate emenim and still do, but he didn't bother me here, I thought he did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>It's about a white kid trying to get ahead in a black man's world of the rap music business. He is scared and at times intimidated, but ultimately knows if you want something in life you have to get it for yourself because no one will just simply give it to you.<br/><br/>The film only used music as its core, but the story is not about music, the film is about life. It is about the things people have to deal with and over come. It is about making sacrifices and becoming a man.<br/><br/>The language is bad, but I think a lot of kids should watch it in their teen years because it has a good message, my point of bringing up language is that I think it should be shown in schools to teach people that life isn't easy and you don't know what people go through and no matter how bad you have got it, you can still make it in this tough world.<br/><br/>I think it's a good drama, so even if you hate rap music or emenim still watch the movie if you like a deep touching story. The acting was great too with Kim Basinger and Britney Murphy (R.I.P.) really standing out."

","Eminem's big film ""8 Mile"" was made in a period where it was almost a habit for superstars to have their own movies; Spice Girls with ""Spice World"" some years earlier, Britney Spears with ""Crossroads"" and Mariah Carey with ""Glitter"". Despite this reviewer haven't seen the two latter movies, I'll guess I'm not wrong when I suggest that ""8 Mile"" is different and has more credibility than the previous ""superstar"" films.<br/><br/>""LA Confidential"" Curtis Hanson as the director was a odd, but still interesting choice, cause a movie starring the superstar rapper Eminem isn't something that you would associate with him, but with Curtis as the director gives the movie immediately credibility. The reviewers and public (in my country) had only positive things to say about this film and when I finally saw it with those recommendations in mind, I turned out to be the opposite of disappointed.<br/><br/>""8 Mile"" is a gritty, but good and dynamic movie. It shows that a drama can be dark and gritty without being to gloomy. It shows that a movie can be dynamic without being too overdone. It shows that a movie can be violent, without being too explicit.<br/><br/>Like most of us knows (since it has already been some years since this movie's release), this isn't Eminem's biography, but still parallels the rapper's real, tough adolescence, which is enough to consider this movie as different and more valuable from the other ""superstar"" films.<br/><br/>Eminem is the one who carries the movie and it's nice to see a different and more calmer side of him. Still, in all consideration, there's no denial that he's a much better rapper than he is an actor. The best acting in the movie is from Kim Basinger as the rapper's mother. The rest of the cast does only a decent job, despite Mekhi Phifer as Future and Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob, two of our protagonist friends, are those who distinguish them self from the rest of the friend-group. Brittany Murphy as the love interest Alex delivers a decent performance, without being particularly memorable.<br/><br/>Like mentioned earlier, this flick is entertaining and engaging. There are some party, sex and action segments and a decent drama to keep the audiences attention and making this a memorable film. In fact, it's safe for non-Eminem fans to watch the flick and enjoying it. But there are some sections who are too slow and could have been cut to tighten the movie up. The relationship between Eminem and his little sister Lilly is a cute one, but could have been more developed. And some of Eminem's secondary friends are at times annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>But since this movie is starring a rapper, there are some of rap in the film and the rap battles are without doubt the highlights. And in those segments is where Eminem proofs why he's one of the best, white rappers out there (despite his content in his lyrics is another discussion).<br/><br/>Despite ""8 Mile"" is at times too slow, it's overall a great and entertaining movie that deserves to be seen."

Until 8-Mile came out my opinion of him was that he was a talented but somewhat white trashy performer with a lot of bitterness trapped inside. When I saw 8-Mile for the first time I was stunned. The movie carries an almost overwhelmingly positive and inspirational message and the acting is top notch. The rap battles are entertaining and really quite funny at times and the whole thing does a great job of explaining why Eminem is the way he is. I felt sorry for him then I felt happy for him and now I have a great deal of respect for him as an actor and a singer."

","You needn't to to appreciate this movie that makes you go deep into the world of rap like it's practiced and lived by the youths in the poor neighbourhoods, slums and trailers of Detroit mostly inhabited by Afro-Americans but also by some whites, all of those youngsters living together without showing any serious racist attitudes. This is also half biographical of Eminem the greatest rapper ever known and who does the main character in the movie. It's a very realistic movie showing the vivid relations between all those rap performers and fans and the contest rap battles they are involved in, trying to win a place in the sun which means to get a possible contract with a radio station or a record editor. These relations are sometimes very friendly and solidary sometimes antagonistic and violent. Besides this we have the depiction of the difficult relationship between the young rapper whose role is played by Eminem and his mother whose behaviour is not very orthodox, while at same time he cherishes and tries to protect his little sister. The dialogues are very realistic too in terms of corresponding to the real language that these youths use to express themselves. Though not a masterpiece (the script matter doesn't allow more anyhow) this is a movie worth to be seen chiefly by the authenticity of its scenes, by its music (for rap lovers) and by the great performance of the cast."

","My friends and I rented this movie the other day for two reasons. The first one is that we all like Eminem very much and have listened to all his songs (except for the new album, Relapse) at least 20 times. My favorite is ''Like Toy Soldiers'' in which Eminem describes conflicts with other rappers and with the recording industry ''Murder Inc.'', but I also like the song ''Superman'' in which he talks about one-night stands with girls. The second reason was that, judging by Eminem's rapping style, it would have something to do with street gangs and all. Well, if this can rejoice you, it does have it's gang themes, but there is hardly any violence, because it is a drama. It talks about B. Rabbit (his real name is Jimmy), which is interpreted by Eminem, who did an awesome job in this movie. I really mean it! He was very good and deserved an Oscar. By the way, 8 Mile won an Oscar for the song ''Lose Yourself'' which was written for this movie and that song is very good. It's probably my favorite after Superman and Like Toy Soldiers. Anyways, Rabbit wants to become a Rap artist, and what follows in the movie is his road to respect as a white rapper living in a black neighborhood. Fight duels, rap battles and everything else is a rendez-vous in this movie, but what steals the show is the awesome job the actors did on 8 Mile."

","But then again honey, if you did love this one, don't read any further. I was expecting some real funI was very disappointed. 8 MILE is just some bland schmaltzy melodrama about a kid making his way to the top in a wholly banal and uninteresting way . Now if this is supposed to have been inspiring and if indeed it did inspire some, good for them! I mean, it's nice to find out the flick proved of use. Art it ain't; fun, neither. <br/><br/>I was expecting a much much better movie than this schmaltzy averageatthebest melodrama; it was quite praised, and the director being who he is, and as a Basinger fan, I thought this might be up to something. <br/><br/>The poor script is, as a matter of fact, outrageously, and I mean outrageously bland and thin. The characters are nonexistentjust some cartoon silhouettes. Eminem's performance only amounts to some posing and dreadful posturing.<br/><br/>An aimless story about void characters.<br/><br/>Why did I expect something better, a flick of more worth? I guess I'm too like Eminem's charactertoo idealistic, I mean. <br/><br/>I guess Eminem did not continue his budding acting career; this is good, this is soothing. <br/><br/>But if you keep wishing to know my reading of the flick, then I think it's about a peed off kid who struggles to find a way developing his facility at expressing various rants and insults and slants in peculiarly rhymed language. I think that Slim Shady 's socalled verses suck. <br/><br/>The script is, of course, rubbish; no character really exists. 8 MILE is but a purposely educative and simplistic melodrama, extremely childish and awkward in Eminem's naive posing as Cagney and Dean simultaneously. In a word, pretty everything's phony. Mrs. Basinger, though apparently a favorite of the shady director, has got again no stuff to play."

","I first saw ""8 Mile"" a few years ago when Eminem was still hugely popular as a rap artist. I didn't like it very much, and I was largely bored throughout. But now I am involved in the spoken word scene in London, and witnessed live some actual rap battles (as of yet I have not summoned the balls to actually take part in one). So it felt it would be appropriate to revisit the movie, so I rented it out in DVD. I was well impressed.<br/><br/>Eminem plays Rabbit, a young man living and working in Detroit where he has a job at a mechanics plant. His only passion is for hip-hop rhyming slang, at which he excels, and routinely takes part in the rap battles that take place at his local club. But problems at home with his trailer trash mother (Kim Basinger), a spunky but unfaithful girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) and fist-fights with rival rappers, grind Rabbit into the ground as he prepares to face his doubts and engage in the battle his life...<br/><br/>I am now better able to appreciate the courage and the brilliant skill that goes into these rap battles, so I really enjoyed these parts of it. The film nails the atmosphere of the battles perfectly, with a well-choreographed and spirited crowd of extras. The drama in Rabbit's life with his friends and family is carefully and realistically portrayed but is REALLY harrowing and I found these scenes difficult to watch.<br/><br/>It is safe to assume that the story is based on Eminem's own life story, and though it follows a well-worn theme, produces a couple of unexpected surprises. Rabbit is a white man operating in a world dominated by blacks, yet it's fair to say that while the black man may be oppressed and the white man privileged in other areas of life, the reverse is sometimes true and so it is here.<br/><br/>Eminem acquits himself perfectly playing a version of himself, and his performance makes the movie. He is surrounded by a gallery of excellent supporting players who are all superbly well-cast. The cinematography really captures the gritty seediness of the setting and the movie is great to look at.<br/><br/>Perhaps you need to be a fan of hip-hop or spoken word in general to really appreciate this, but it's still a very compelling picture."

","This is not my kind of film. Rap is all rhythm. If you like the beat well and good. If you're looking for a happy tune you won't find it in hip-hop. It seems to me it's a new way of making cutting remarks or nasty insinuations. Eminen as Rabbit Smith does it very well. His character is maintained as an unsmiling teenager throughout the film, unhappy, unpleasant , poker-faced and ashamed to be still living with his mother. Very protective of his little sister we see another side of his character if only for a few minutes. This is the only heart warming scene in the whole film.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are all good as they prowl the city streets in cars. Apart from the 45 second hip-hop contests there is not much to the story. Rabbit's mum has a sexy admirer but the partnership breaks up over a noisy argument. This adds a bit of life and action to an otherwise fairly boring film. Rabbit gets a job working the big metal presses which turn out parts for the assembly of automobiles. Rabbit relieves the boredom of this repetitive work with a little sexual workout in a quiet corner of the factory.<br/><br/>This film should appeal to the younger set who are happy to listen to hip-hop and get a laugh from the suggestive lyrics. but don't expect a lot of drama.

","Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith is a rap kid from the poor side of Detroit trying to escape through his music. At odds with his buddies, his bosses, his mother and his rival rappers, will he give up his dream and accept his fate, or strive to make himself heard ?<br/><br/>Ostensibly, this is a fictional film, but although some of the facts have been changed, it's essentially Eminem - The Movie. That's not a criticism though - it's a great story, and Eminem gives a great performance in it; he's angry and bucked-up, but he's also pensive, sincere and tender. And it's no vanity project either - it may be one man against the world but he makes plenty of mistakes and his success is in his intelligence and perseverance, not what he actually achieves. He radiates energy, like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, right from the opening scene where he practices his moves in a bathroom, and the Rap Battles which take up the last half-hour are a hypnotic piece of choreography, almost like a boxing flick where the fighters hit each other with words. Equally impressive is Basinger in a head-turning gee-look-what-I-can-do role as Jimmy's trailer-trash Mom. She completely debunks her sexpot image (typified by her role in Hanson's earlier LA Confidential) to play a fairly revolting sponger, but she doesn't make the mistake of overplaying it - she just slots into it nicely and seems completely authentic. With a good support cast, great locations in Detroit's gritty 313 area code and lots of cool music, this is a thought-provoking and highly original drama. I like the way the story constantly forces Jimmy to choose his path - should he stay with his old girlfriend, should he trust the buddy who says he can get him studio time, should he put up with his Mom's putz of a boyfriend, should he take the offer of a ride to New York - and eventually realises the only person who can change his fate is him. Other than his talent, what I admire about Eminem is his tenacity, and that's what this character is all about. The only thing the movie is a little lacking is a sense of humour, although Basinger does have one hilarious line. Even if you don't like hip-hop or the erudite Mr Mathers, check this film out - it's a great little wrong-side-of-the-tracks drama."

","When word got out that a movie starring everybody's favorite person, Eminem, was in the making, people flocked to see it. A few years earlier, Marshall Mathers caught the nation's eye screaming ""I just don't give a ****!"" But what wasn't known was whether the movie would follow the general consensus that Eminem can't entertain for whatever reason, and that you either love him or hate him. I can gladly say that whatever your stance is on Slim Shady, there's a 96% chance you won't be drooling on your shirt (or even making out) while you watch this movie.<br/><br/>When you're watching this movie you won't see any plot twists, maybe a few unexpected things, but for the most part you'll know what's going to happen. But still, that doesn't stop this movie from being enjoyable -- not to mention inspirational. A classic rags-to-riches/Rocky sort of story, the plot follow's Eminem's character, Jimmy Smith Jr. (Who is known as 'Rabbit' or 'B-Rabbit' by his friends, the B I'm assuming stands for Bunny) Jimmy who is still in his twenties, but already taking on the problems and challenges of a married man, has to juggle a multitude of problems daily ranging from taking care his little sister to trying to keep peace between his friends.<br/><br/>(Ahem, possible spoiler) The movie starts out with a scene most people can relate to, Rabbit is in the bathroom of a local club and is getting ready to freestyle in a rap battle. Clearly nervous, he is shown singing along to a song he is listening to on his Walkman (Which can be heard by the audience). Right before he leaves he ends up throwing up on himself and goes around back to change his shirt before getting up on stage. Scenes like this, showing Jimmy's personal struggle are commonplace throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie continues on and introduces new characters for the first few scenes, each establishing another sub-plot. As the movie wears on and Jimmy struggles to keep his life in order, relationships between characters and the audience are firmly established, especially that of Rabbit's, which is of course is needed when the climax roles around and Jimmy inevitably triumphs.<br/><br/>The movie flows smoothly for the most part, no boring scenes at all. However, if you can't stand to listen to rap (Not necessarily what they sing about, but the actual rapping part of it) you may get sick of this movie as some scenes are centered around this (As expected). The music and rapping are very while done, not surprising as Eminem composed a lot of it. Eminem's winner ""Lose Yourself"" is the theme song, along with ""8 Mile"". The characters seem to fit and Mathers plays the part of a hot-headed, but at the same time reserved, character quite well. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother believably, even his younger sister's part is played well.<br/><br/>Overall, in general, 8 Mile is an excellent movie, if a bit clichéd. Providing you don't mind that little bit, or hate Eminem with a passion (or rap in general), 8 Mile and it's very urban feel should be worth a rent and who knows, maybe you'll even decide to buy it."

Some of the moments in the film are very funny, and the rap scenes are the same top quality that we should expect from Eminem. However there are some bits that don't need to be in there and could of been edited out. i also feel that some of the more experienced actors aren't used to the ability they can create. Inparticular Kim's performance isn't that convincing because she is playing a totally unchallenging role. The fight sequences are well worked they all look real and aren't unbelievable they are kept simple and realistic.<br/><br/>So all over a good watch, could of been better but still worth a quick look.

","I was very surprised at the show that rapper Eminem put on in his fictional biopic '8 Mile', named for the very street near which Eminem grew up. Curtis Hanson does a good job directing the film, making sure it doesn't stray towards a gang film, and away from the good personal story that it is. It explores one young man, Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) and his quest to escape the slums of Detroit to rise to hip hop stardom, thrusting his daughter Lily and mother (Kim Basinger) out as well. One thing that stands out besides Eminem and Hanson's direction is the supporting cast. Mekhi Phifer, Kim Basinger, Evan Jones, and Brittany Murphy stand out in particular. Basinger gives a great performance as Jimmy's emotional and struggling mother. In every film about one man rising above the rest, he needs his friends, and Mekhi Phifer's character, Future, provides the steadfast, older, kind, yet tough friend for Jimmy to turn to when he needs help. The story has some well written moments, but can seem unnecessary at times. There is also a large overuse of the f-word in the film, but it doesn't take away from the great story that should inspire any viewer of the film. I really hope Marshall Mathers gives acting another shot, because he did very well in this film.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"

","Well a pop culture icon in a movie about rapping. Thats how i went into this movie. I came out a little bit more surprised then I thought. The story is about Eminem growing up in the ghetto with a horrible life. Living in a trailer with his family. This is a basic story about being raised in the ghetto so u know what to expect coming into this movie but how they executed it was pretty good. Eminem is a surprisingly good in this movie believably partly because this is based off his life. I loved the free style scenes witty, funny, and a big part of the film. Eminem goes through trials and tribulations to reach it to the big time. He encounters a love interest in Brittany Murphies Character. They have chemistry but ultimately he drops her for his dreams. His friend played by Meki Phifer. He is good in this movie but just a supporting actor.Eminem goes through the toughness of trying to make it as a white rapper in a land of black rappers.

","Eminem's debut performance was very strong and gritty. He won an Oscar for his song ""Lose Yourself"" and is one of the great talents of his generation. <br/><br/>This movie realistically portrays the physical decay of urban areas such as Detroit that accompanies the rapid expansion of suburban areas. The rap battles central to the plot of the film are very interesting from an anthropological point of view. I first saw 8 Mile on 22 March, 2003, during the first week of America's illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq. What struck me strongly was that the characters in the film generally used words as weapons, instead of violence. Although impoverished, they are far more civilized than the current leaders of their country. We can only hope that more wise people like Eminem assume leadership roles around the world, in the future."

"lazearm","7","0","0","18 March 2004"," `8 Mile' shows that despite the environment that surrounds an individual, success can be found through inner strength and an unwillingness to settle for what one is handed in life.
","`8 Mile' shows that despite the environment that surrounds an individual, success can be found through inner strength and an unwillingness to settle for what one is handed in life. This theme is reflected most often in the character of Jimmy `B-Rabbit' Smith, played by Eminem, who is a fledgling rapper trying to find his voice in an environment that does not want to accept him. In many ways, this is a simple coming of age story, but I think the best comparison still comes from Sylvester Stallone in `Rocky.' Both Stallone and Eminem's characters are in negative environments, they both are looking to move up and out, but only have one real vehicle to do it. Stallone's was boxing, Eminem's is rapping.<br/><br/>The inner strength theme is also played out through the film by the techniques that the director, Curtis Hanson, and the cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto, use to tell the story. They are especially effective at using shot angles to convey the emotion of Eminem's character. In the opening scene of the movie, when Eminem is handed the microphone, they are quick to focus solely on him and the audience surrounding him, intimidating him. They use high angle shots to make him look smaller, more vulnerable, and also do their best to keep his battle opponent out of the shot, as to symbolize that Eminem's current battle is with his surroundings, not his opponent. They are also quick to zoom right in on Eminem when he is first handed the microphone, making him look trapped within the screen, symbolizing his trapped feeling on stage. The entire opening battle scene is symbolic of Eminem's feeling of helplessness, that he has no control over his situation.<br/><br/>Hanson and Prieto do a wonderful job of weaving this theme of the sometimes negative impact environment and circumstances can have on an individual and how they can overcome these obstacles. Without this theme, `8 Mile' is nothing more than a showcase of the pitfalls of the inner city, falling into the usual belief that nothing positive comes from these areas. This theme changes the entire movie, making it a message of hope and courage, showing that an individual can overcome the pratfalls and accomplish their goals if they refuse to accept failure as the inevitable."

","Being that this is his first big role in a feature film, I was excited to see how well Eminem could act. I'm happy to say that he pulls it off perfectly. I didn't even think about that it was Eminem in the lead role, as he portrays his character perfectly. Even though it's similar to his real personality, it must have been hard for him. The rest of the actors mostly perform well too, actually pretty much everybody except Kim Basinger is completely believable. Unfortunately, she seems a bit out of place in this film, and she didn't portray her character too believably, in my opinion. The plot is interesting and keeps your attention, for the duration of the film. The characters are all believable. The cinematography is excellent; it really makes you feel that you're there, in every single scene, in every battle. Being a rap fan, I really enjoyed the rap music aspect of the film too, though I guess people who aren't into rap will dislike big parts of the film. I also felt that the ex-girlfriend subplot was a bit underdeveloped; it could have been take a bit further. Apart from that, and the acting of Kim Basinger, this couldn't have been much better. I really liked that it wasn't entirely autobiographical, that would have been predictable and probably boring, especially for us fans of Eminem who know his background well. I like what they did with the theme, and where they took the plot. Overall, a pretty good drama that could have been better. I'd recommend this to most fans of dramas, and fans of hip-hop/rap/Eminem. 7/10"

","As much as people continually told me not to see this movie, just because it was so bad, I was bored and decided to give it a try.  Plus, I had really wanted to see Kim Basinger and Brittney Murphy in their roles, since those had been the only positive reviews I'd heard about the film.  But, I have to say that it was much better than I had aniticipated.<br/><br/>Basic Plot: B. Rabbit (Eminem), is a kid on the ""wrong side of the tracks"" and more appropriately, lives on the wrong side of 8 mile. Growing up in Detroit, MI, he is berated and harrassed from the black community (more correctly, the black gangs)about not being black and how he tries to act it.  However, with the support of his friends, and none from his mother (Basinger), he becomes stronger in the world of music and challenges himself, and his dreams.<br/><br/>Basically it's a movie about Eminem's life story, only with a few fictional characters thrown into the process.  Murphy and Basinger are certainly more than noteworthy, and in fact, Basinger was so convincing as his mother, it's hard to believe she and Eminem had an affair in real life.  Brittney's role was amazingly carried out and I love her in everything that she does. Eminem, however, I couldn't quite figure some of his facial expressions out. He looks upset when he should be crying and he looks like he's going to cry when he's upset.  It confused me.  And his acting with regards to the rest of the film, was hard to determine whether it was good or not.  I mean, how hard is it to play yourself.  But, at any rate, I felt that he did a good job, whether he was playing himself or not.  At the very least, it's probably hard to remember what you did or how you acted when you were younger, so in that regard, I give him snaps for his efforts.<br/><br/>So, with that said I give the movie a 7.5 out of 10.  Just because it was better than I thought it would be, and I liked the acting and all the music. Really well written script and music.<br/><br/>And that's my review."

","Being totally unfamiliar with Eminem or his music I didn't know what to expect from this film.  So I'm not qualified to comment on its accuracy. From the little I've heard of rap it sounds to me hopelessly repetitive and whiny.<br/><br/>So one might naturally expect a rap film starring Eminem to be merely one long, drawn-out rap video but - surprise! - Eminem and Director Curtis Hanson provide us with a simple and small but deftly crafted, satisfying cinematic gem:  the struggle of a freestyle rapper who fights to assert his style and maintain his dignity in a poor Detroit neighbourhood.<br/><br/>The story is alleged to be based on Eminem's actual background and examines the young rapper's life with a terrifically biased view:  Eminem is presented to us as a brilliant iconclast; an inspired, hard-working artist; and an entirely decent, determined young man who defends his mother and protects his little sister.  Which he may be, I don't know.  Eminem plays a rapper nicknamed Rabbit who has practically everything and everybody against him:  he's dirt poor; his mother (played by Kim Bassinger - a weird but successful casting choice) is an alcoholic; he's got a dreadful job at a factory where the foreman hates him; a competing gang of rappers is out to hurt him and his girlfriend cheats on him with one of his buddies.<br/><br/>But despite the whitewashing, it's a very enjoyable film.  Eminem's performance is astonishingly masterful and carefully modulated; we never catch him acting.  Of course, he is playing himself, after all, but nevertheless he delivers a winning performance that's full of shades and nuances.  He glares, smolders and absorbs the barbs of his fellow rappers with an evaluative, Robert Mitchem-esque detachment.<br/><br/>Though this is a film about a form of music it bears far more resemblance to Boxing Films than musicals:  8 Mile is the ""Rocky"" of rap films.  Which is to say that it's a predictable and one-sided presentation of a young rapper's struggle to earn the respect of his peers and maintain his self respect.  The rap sequences are presented as competitions full of bravura and grandstanding with rappers competing in front of racucous crowds in short, time-limited sets, much like the rounds in a boxing match.<br/><br/>The beat-up texture of the Detroit locations is reflected in the look of the film which has a coarse, harshness; natural colour has been drained of all the scenes and replaced with a chemical green tint; skin is glossy and lit with ochre light.  The dialgoue is clipped and choppy street patios and if you're like me you may find yourself wanting to watch this film with the subtitles turned on just to figure out what the hell people are saying now and again.<br/><br/>But all in all it's a great ride and I think this film - as good as it looks now - will only look better with time, seeing as it's a time capsule of a certain time and place, like ""Saturday Night Fever"", only better, in my view."
"biddlet","Null","0","0","30 November 2003"," poor young white man trying to break his way onto the rap scene
","8 Mile is a story of a poor young white man trying to break his way onto the rap scene in the big ugly city of Detroit. Eminem plays the leading role of (Rabbit) who lives in a beat down trailer park with his dead beat mom played by Kim Basinger, and the trailer park is located on the other side of 8 mile road which is predominately lower class whites. Eminem's character works at a dead end factory that makes car parts.<br/><br/>When he isn't dealing with his mom or his workplace Eminem character is hanging out with his crew 313 including his best friend played by Mekhi Phifer. He and his crew are in constant pursuit to make a break in the rap game and sign a record deal. In this pursuit Eminem's character fights through tough times as a white kid in a predominately black industry while trying to find his identity and what kind of person he is going to be.<br/><br/>
Directed by Curtis Hanson who has made memorable movies such as `L.A Confidential' and `Wonder Boys', 8 Mile pushes the issue of a white guy making it as a rap star. Before Eminem's time as a rap star white guys were regarded as a joke when it came to being a hip-hop artist. This is first depicted when Eminem does his first battle rap and freezes up on stage and is booed off, while you hear random comments about him taking his white ass back to 8 mile. But as with all the adversity that Eminem's character Rabbit faces, he survives and it only makes him stronger.<br/><br/>The tough times that Eminem (Rabbit) is put through help to build his character and this central insight is again relevant when Eminem's car breaks down and he gets a ride from his friend to work. Eminem states the following line `Hey Sol, do you ever wonder at what point you just got to say f-it man, like when you gotta stop living up here and start living down here?' This line really signifies the movie theme by saying how much crap can one person go through before they give up their dreams and live a so- called normal life.<br/><br/>8 Mile is `Rocky' for the hip-hop community, where a young low class white guy does the unthinkable by making a name for themselves in an industry where white guys are not the norm. 8 Mile could also be compared to plenty other American movies where this same sort of story line exist like `Karate Kid'.<br/><br/>Curtis Hanson also makes great use of Eminem's dominant talent, which is music and correlating it with the theme of the movie. In the scene after Eminem loses the battle rap the `theme song' of the movie is playing in the background as he is writing lyrics down while riding the bus. The lyrics are jumbled and missing as to signify his inability to put everything together to make a total song. This scene shows him trying to get over the fear of being labeled as a white rapper, which correlates with having no skills.<br/><br/>
The race card is pulled many times during the film where characters make comments to Eminem about being white. As in real life in these racially heated situations, 8 Mile and Eminem show us that it is better not to lash back racially but to prove your enemies wrong with your display of skills and creativity."

","Very loosely based on the life of real-life rapper Eminem, ""8 Mile"" ends up being one of those movies that is more content with selling soundtracks than making a legitimate cinematic point. In 1995 Detroit, Eminem seems to be a young man going nowhere fast. His mother (Kim Basinger) is the only real family around (and that is not necessarily a good thing) and his friends (led by Mekhi Phifer) are little more than urban thugs, running around and causing mischief. Eminem struggles through as a laborer at a plant that manufactures car parts and also suffers with stage fright issues when he has the opportunity to free-style rap at shady competitions (Eminem shy!?). He meets a girl from the neighborhood (Brittany Murphy) and instantly becomes attracted to her, but her past and present activities are suspicious at best. Mean dudes, the broken landscape of a major metropolitan area, poor relationships and a fiery attitude may be too much for Eminem to overcome in the end. ""8 Mile"" is a film that I thought would be an intense U.S. slice of life, but it becomes a cop-out movie that staggers around for a plot and becomes a tiring music-video-styled horror. Eminem shows some real talent. I have always been indifferent to his music, but he shows the makings of a potentially impressive cinematic performer. Everyone else just gets lost in the ugly mess. Basinger and Phifer never do intrigue and Murphy seems wasted as well (she too has shown some talent in the past). Director Curtis Hanson (who dominated with ""L.A. Confidential"" several years ago) seems like he just does not understand the film's dark landscape. I really think a director like Spike Lee, John Singleton or Antonie Fuqua would have been a better fit for ""8 Mile"". The primary theme, ""Lose Yourself"", was the Best Original Song Oscar winner for 2002. Eminem co-wrote that piece. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","For all the hype that was first surrounding this film, it delivered shockingly well considering the expectations. I must admit, I was very surprised by how much I was rooting for the underdog protagonist by the end of Eminem's great drama ""8 Mile"". Backed by an impressive all-star cast, an amazing director, and of course, the raw, intense material that is freestyle rap, this ""rags-to-riches"" story is always a compelling watch. Unlike some other recent ill-fated leaps to the big screen by musicians, this film can certainly stand out as one of the few crowned jewels of 2002. It is a terrifically entertaining, and powerful, picture. I don't know if I would quite call it a masterpiece, nor would I go so far as to praise Eminem's acting as Oscar-worthy (which some people obviously did). He's a fine actor, I agree, but when one is essentially playing a sketchy version of him/herself, I don't know if that would exactly qualify for the coveted statuette.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film is a moving tale of struggle, hardship, and pain, and how much success in the world of music can mean to one person. Jimmy Smith ""Bunny Rabbit"" Jr. (Eminem) is truly a sympathetic character whom, despite some of his clear flaws, is the kind of person most people would want to see make it in the real world, due to his sincere dedication and his personal turmoil.<br/><br/>""8 Mile"" is without a doubt one of the best musician-to-actor-transition films I have ever seen. Although it can be more than a little mainstream and clichéd at times, I disagree with the people who claim this film is far too tame. No way. This is about as real as it gets in the underground. It's a keeper."

","I am way ""behind the wave"" of posting my viewpoint on such an influential movie; I live in Michigan and must agree that such a ""true life"" filmed project needed to have been filmed on location to establish its veracity and mood.  So as to establish its time frame, the director/screenwriter furthermore mention that it is set in the late 1990's.  As a film released at the height of Eminem's (Marshall Mathers') musical influence in the area of rap/hip-hop, it does a great job of revealing how this artist's version of ""rap"" is born out of the working poor of the American Midwest.  A musical set in an urban ghetto is rather far from the typical Hollywood feature and it does go off in some quite odd directions.  I was relieved that the young child was not molested by a rapist in a run-down house and only slightly befuddled how the burning of an abandoned slum house was viewed as not having any substantial side-effects (e.g. catching other nearby housing on fire or injuring any of the young men who spray the incendiary materials around).   Certain of the conventional plot devices that could have been utilized are discretely undermined; for example, the disfigurement of being in a fight just before the film finale musical ""number"" is referred to by the hero in his disabling rap to Papa Doc.  A quite comparable film, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, treats Tony's injuries before the final dance sequence as just being casually not worth noticing.  The director has negotiated a quirky film that's really not spliced together video sequences and instead significantly tries to bring some of the despair of America's desperate poor to the attention of the entire youth subculture.  I rate it as an 8 kind of in acknowledgment of its calling itself after the landmark Detroit ""dividing line."""

Even Brittany Murphy, who I have discovered that many people detest, does an acceptable job of portraying Eminem's girlfriend.

Many of the best moments are when Jimmy Smith Jr., aka B-Rabbit (played by Eminem), is engaging in rap ""battles."" Outside of that, the movie, honestly, is kind of boring. It basically shows the lifestyle of Eminem's character: going to work and almost getting fired a couple of times, breaking up with and having encounters with an ex-girlfriend (Tarryn Manning), meeting a new girl (Brittany Murphy, ick), fighting with his mom and her boyfriend, as well as rival rappers in the city of Detroit. But through it all, all he really wants to do is get a deal as a rapper, and he shows a tough shell, but has a soft spot inside for his baby sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield). The movie is basically a bunch of trials and tribulations, but it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>All of the actors are in a range from alright to awesome. Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, and most of the supporting cast has good moments and alright moments.

He's practically a messiah.<br/><br/>It takes some kind of ego to make a film like this. Eminem's ""based on a true story"" autobiography is written like a band's promotional bio, and comes off as terrific propaganda.

Trying to fight the color barriers while trying to get respect in the music business as a white rapper.  8 Mile Road is a dividing line that separates the blacks from the whites.  Growing up on the suburban side of 8 Mile, known as the white side of the dividing line, black rappers on the Detroit side of the 8 Mile don't take the white rappers on the suburban side of 8 Mile seriously. Eminem's character (Jimmy `Rabbit' Smith Jr.) is trying to get the respect as a white rapper.<br/><br/>This movie could easily be compared to sports movies that have an underdog that prove they can emerge against the odds to come out on top.  The same types of movies that come to mind are Rocky or Karate Kid.  It's a story that demonstrates an `everything is against you' type of story, and emerges the underdog on top and becomes an inspirational story.<br/><br/>In the free-style rap battles, opponents use their rap skills in one-on-one war of words.  The words rhymes, and are aimed at the weakness of their opponents.  They use the words as weapons instead of using guns or their fists.  The feeling of a loss in a battle is the feeling of their world crumbling down around them.  If a rapper looses a battle to an opponent, they feel like their life, as they knew it is over.<br/><br/>The movie is based on young, lower class people that have a dream of busting out of the low-class lifestyle with the right break.  The movie is not totally based on Rabbit's struggle on getting out of the low-class trailer park living with his mother (Kim Basinger).

With his knitted brow and underdog stance he is electrifying on-screen. Think of him as a slimmer and shadier James Dean.

","I really wasn't expecting much from this film.  I had already shrugged it off as another hiphop advertisement geared at malcontents and hooligans complete with materialistic superfluity and a self-indulgent, career boosting performance by yet another rapper.  Fortunately this wasn't the case.  We don't get too many pictures about the grim reality of life at the 'bottom of the food chain' where, as viewers, we are even denied a glimpse of the world we are so accustomed to.   It's thought provoking.  The graininess of the film and shaky cameras helped create the atmosphere of enslavement in this reality, claustrophobia..  in a Dogme-reminiscent style. The performances are good; Eminem is surprisingly three-dimensional and convincing as struggling proletarian rapper Jimmy Smith Jr.  Even with the autobiographical overtones we forget it is actually him.  Most of the other leading parts seem flat and underdeveloped;  Jimmy's sister is a sad excuse for showing off his sympathy and his would-be step father is plain evil, etc.  The story is actually pretty standard with generic plot twists complete with the good old theme of the underdog overcoming obstacles and succeeding, with great satisfaction for the audience.  As for the hiphop, I was surprised that the other elements of hiphop (graffiti, breakdance, DJing) were given no attention.  They would have helped non-afficionados of this movement conjure a clearer picture of where hiphop is derived from and what the motivations behind it are.  Freestyling as a form of competition and means of degrading others surely is not the essence of rap.  I did find the rhymes clever but not the best I have heard and they were obviously premeditated.  Oh well, after all it is not a dogme film.  The competition is the focal point of this film and goes hand in hand with the Karate Kid theme i pointed out earlier.

His mother is hardly supportive, being more interested in sleeping with as many men as she can on the block, and Rabbit has no siblings to talk to.<br/><br/>
What is so disappointing about this is that it feels so ""safe"". The issue of race and how major a factor it is in rap is never fully explored. The only thing that comes close to it is an incoherent set of ramblings about conformity. The dialogue should be witty and clever but is merely just inane reverting to stereotypical ghetto speak (a lot of ""**** this"" and ""****that""). The acting is also third rate due to the lack of material the performers have to work with. Kim Basinger is merely a sketchy stereotype as the trailer trash mother. <br/><br/>What it comes down to, is a set of the emperor's new clothes. It wants to be an involving, emotive drama but what it really is, is a shallow popcorn flick with no soul and no intelligence. Dull, duller, dullest- you'd be better off watching Boyz in the Hood for the umpteenth time- at least it's genuine."

","After finally seeing this movie, I understand what the hype is about. Judging crossover performances as a whole, I believe Eminem certainly presents a more compelling screen presence than Prince did back in the eighties. The story is realistic, and well-told. Even if you're not a rap fan, as I am not, the movie has more to do with the lives of people whose story is rarely told without histrionics and distortion. My only real complaint is that Eminem's sense of humor, which for me is the only thing that sets him apart, should have been more in evidence. Let's hope he gets another chance to showcase that side of himself."

","Oh my god, it's a post about 8-Mile on the 8-Mile board.  This is what stands as my review of the movie, for better or worse.  As such, guess I'll have to go on record saying that I'm sort of ambivalent toward Eminem's music.  Dig quite a bit of it, but my hip-hop tastes tend more toward Common and his ilk.<br/><br/>That said, I didn't like 8-Mile.  It was just dull.  I would say that it was slow, but there was no real plot to develop.  80% of the film was spent in falling action while building up to the final competition and climax...with more falling action to follow.  In fact, the only thing that made the flic even remotely enjoyable for me was the soundtrack and the afformentioned climax battle.  Also, it has no resolution.  Now, I have no problem with movies with loose-end conclusions (The Ring, Ringu, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, et al) so long as the movie has enough meat to back it up. 8-Mile was devoid of any real content.  It just sort of dredged through what felt like 2 hours of greyscale monotony.  All in all, not very well done. Haven't actually been that big a fan of Hanson's other films either.  LA Confidential was decent, but nothing really standout.<br/><br/>
As far as the performances, Em's was extremely lackluster...though he did end up actually blowing Kim Bassenger out of the water by comparison.  Had the cast built an ensemble, I think it could've at least placed the film into my ""ok"" list, but the utter lack of chemistry between any two actors doomed 8-Mile to a life of sharing space in my head with 3 Kings and Beat."

In fact, I may be interested enough to see a sequel, providing that the quality portrayed in this film is maintained.<br/><br/>One character, however, criticized by many was Brittany Murphy's character, Alex.  When I first saw her, I wondered how much she charges by the hour, if you catch my drift.  Sure she looked hot, but she seemed to be out of Rabbit's league.<br/><br/>One thing I asked myself throughout the movie was:  being in the mid-90's, where are the Vanilla Ice jokes?  Rabbit was certainly a prime candidate, at least in the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>Normally, I am not one who watches dramas, but I found that I had enjoyed the movie and may add it to my collection.  I gave it an 8 out of 10, solely based upon entertainment value.<br/><br/>Now to compare this one to the other extreme, I eventually plan to see Jamie Kennedy in ""Malibu's Most Wanted."""

He left her his car after hearing that she is pregnant, which shows that he is really a soft person inside.

","I was pleased and surprised by 8 Mile. I'm not a fan of Eminem, so that it wasn't initally drew me to this film.  I was amazed at the acting- I thought he did a brilliant job, basically playing himself.  The story was well-written and follows B. Rabbit through his miserable life on the wrong side of the 8 Mile Road in Detroit.  The film seems to follow Paul Schrader's model for a Transcendental film.  It is full of the 'everyday,' the mundane things that make our lives what they are.  There is definite disparity, conflicts and confusions within Rabbit's daily life.  And the ending is amazing; he simply walks away from the competion that he has just won so that he can go back to work.  And that's the end.  This isn't really the story of a rising rap star, nor is it a love story, as it seemed to be billed.  It is rather the story of someone overcoming in daily life without really resolving any of the true problems that plague him.  The film is actually deeply spiritual (I know that not everyone will agree with me) but I will argue to say that this is the most transcendent film that I've seen released in awhile."

","Spoiler alert This movie was TIGHT, dope fresh, whatever you wanna call it. I watched it with my friends and I saw it twice in theaters and bought it the day it came out. I loved it. Eminem is the best rapper ever, and the movie was a piece of real life. I really felt for Jimmy, because that's kinda how I grew up. But I have two little brothers, Nathan and Robbie, not a little sister named Lily, lol. I loved all the battles, but was kind of disappointed when B-Rabbit choked. I loved it when he was the champ though.<br/><br/>I think the 313 was believable, and I think they might have been meant to represent D12, because the film is loosely based on Marshall's life. Sol reminded me of Bizare from D12, sick mind, you know. However, no matter how much I loved the movie, I hated Alex. Brittany Murphy may be my fave actress of all time, but she was such a slut in the movie. First she had sex with Jimmy, then Wink?! Like, okaaaaaaaaaay.<br/><br/>I cried so many times in the movie, like when Jimmy got beat up, when Cheddar Bob shot himself, when Jimmy caught Alex f***ing Wink, etc. It was a really great movie, and I really got the whole vibe of it. It was a movie you could really get into, you know what I'm sayin'? At times I actually felt as though I was a part of the crowd at the Rap Battles, and stuff.<br/><br/>I hated the Leadaz of the Freeworld. They suck, lol. HOW CAN THEY BEAT UP JIMMY?! Lol, anyway, Lily was ADORABLE, and the relationship between her and Jimmy reminded me a lot of Eminem's realtionship with Hailie. I think that Lickety Split was actually a pretty good battler though. Lotto sucked! I was pretty happy when Papa Doc choked, though. I also loved the Lunch Truck Freestyle. That was tight, man, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/><br/>It was kinda unbelievable how Jimmy had sex with Alex so quickly, but oh well. Overall it was a very good movie and I loved it. Not only because Eminem was in it. Just because the very hot, very sexy, very taletned Eminem was in a video doesn't make it the best. It adds to the movie, but I wouldn't watch Barney if Eminem was the dude in the suit. I give 8 Mile 9.9/10: it lost .1 because of Alex, who I hated. She just kept showing up everywhere.<br/><br/>I didn't like how the movie was a cliff-hanger, when Jimmy said he had to go do his own thing. Now they HAVE to make an 8 Mile 2, or else I will die. What happened to Jimmy? Did Alex leave? Did Jimmy go with Alex? Did Jimmy fulfil his dreams? What happened to 313? Did Jimmy forgive Wink? What about Janine? And Lily? Did Jimmy's Mom get a job or a nicer place to live? Do Jimmy and Lily have a dad yet? What happened to the Leadaz of the Freeworld? Did they split? Did they leave? Did they get successful? And, my friend wants to know this: Did Jimmy later become Eminem (I don't agree with this, but w/e)? WHAT HAPPENED TO B-RABBIT? Did Jimmy stick with that name, or did he change it? I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!! Or else I will DIE!!!!!! Please write a sequel or at least tell me what happened.<br/><br/>Wait, I just read what I wrote. Maybe the ending gave you all you needed to know. It just depends in how you look at it. I think Jimmy did his demo tape, but that's just me. Maybe he didn't. You never know. But I hated and liked the ending at the same time. Future seemed like Proof, Eminem's best friend. Yeah, thinking back on it, they are similar. I loved that movie!"

Mekhi Phifer is just getting better and better to watch! his hot streak carried on from Paid In Full which is good.  This was a pretty good everyday life story about Jimmy who is a working man burdened by poverty and his color due to his taste of music which turns out to be irrelevant as the movie goes on(especially at the end).  I loved the hip-hop insight, Curtis Hanson really did his research as the dialogue of hip-hop talk really coincided w/ the time(1995-96), not only did the dialog help but the music really made it stand out when Mobb Deep's shook ones, Showbiz and AG's next level and Onyx's Last Dayz came on during the battles along w/ a bunch of other songs from BIG and Tupac, etc., etc.  The movie will seem to lag a bit but the ending really puts this movie over the top especially w/ the final battle between Em and Papa-Doc(Anthony Mackie) - Em single-handedly crushes it w/ the ""313"" verse to Mobb Deep's shook ones.<br/><br/>Nice movie w/ a great DVD package as well"

"ecto216","8","0","0","7 April 2003"," Through the eyes of a non-Eminem fan...
","Coming home from a long day at work, I planned on retiring to my room to relax and partake in my favorite past time ritual: watching B-movies. Tonight's feature presentation? Spiders 2 starringwell, staring no one that's important, but that's not the point. As one could deduce from the title, the film revolves around giant arachnids constructed from plaster and other molding materials whose sole purpose on earth is to terrorize young nineteen year old couples about to consummate their premarital love. Sound interesting? Moving along, as I stepped through the door to my house, there lie on the dining room table, a rented copy of `8 Mile'. Going upstairs only to find my brother, the renter of this movie, asleep in his bed, I decided not to let his money go to waste on a movie that no one was going to watch. And so began my trip down 8 Mile road<br/><br/>Before I can talk about this movie, two things must be said. Number one, I'm not an Eminem fan. I don't like rap music, not because I'm your average white suburbanite, but because it truly does not appeal to what I like to hear in my music. As for Eminem himself, I think the man is somewhat of a genius; he knows exactly what to say, he knows exactly who to offend, and he definitely knows who is going to take a stand against him (which is what he plans on). This Detroit rapper isn't just a troubled youth from the streets, he's much more; he's got brains. And although being an Eminem fan has nothing to do with being able to enjoy a movie, it does when the context of said movie revolves around Eminem, which leads me to the second thing that needs to be addressed: the basis of this film. We have to make clear that this film really revolves around Eminem's life; it's a semi-biographical piece. The fact is, put Eminem in any feature film as the main character at this point in time and it's going to succeed. However, put Eminem into a feature film discussing his taboo life which is covered by everyone from household kids to senators in Washington, and you've got yourself a blockbuster. <br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, finally, we arrive at the movie itself. After almost two hours straight consisting of a ritualistic, movie-watching silence and no in-between pausing, the verdict has arrived. Eminem is guilty of an excellent job of debut acting and this movie, which serves as his partner in crime, is found to be truly worth the near two hours that it takes to watch. From start to finish, this film creates such interest in its struggling characters, whether their on the screen for one minute or one hour, that the pace becomes unrelenting regardless of the scene moving at a fast or slow pace. Credit must also be given to the set designer and lighting technician who both created an atmosphere, which could take any six-figure CEO watching this film out of their mansion and into a trailer park. The combination of freestyle rapping set in with the night sky scenery and police sirens in the distance create this ambient affect, which you truly don't get in many well-crafted dramas such as this one. All together, for those who are on the ladder about whether or not to partake in the viewing experience of `8 Mile', I have this to say: take it from a heavy metal listening, horror movie watching, white, middle class suburban college student, this movie will have you mesmerized regardless of social status and leave you feeling inspired to pursue your own dreams of excellence.<br/><br/>And I suppose that's where the problem with this movie begins, with the pursuit of excellence. Or better yet, Eminem's excellence. Those of us who finished the film thinking that we could stand up to our enemies, burn the bridges we built with our parents, and fight anyone in our way, need to take a look at the big picture. Sure, it's broadcast on national television all the time, stories about how people go from nothing to something and make a life for themselves; Jewel lived in a car, Eminem lived in a trailer park, but the reality is none of us are going to win rap battles, pave a path to Dr. Dre's record label, and get a movie based on our lives. My point is, the inspiration one gets out of this movie, while at first is a nice warm feeling, quickly fades as one realizes that it's impossible to live the life that Eminem has and even more impossible to rise to his level of stardom. It's a dream that honestly, maybe only one or two of us will get to live. It's with that said, that the inspiring feeling one gets out of this picture is false, because none of us will follow Eminem's footsteps.<br/><br/>
Otherwise, there's the usual gripes with lots a films: some bad dialogue, some lousy acting, one scene with unnecessary sex talk from Kim Basinger that had absolutely no place in the film and felt very out of context. It was probably added to stress the fact that Em's mom was not a very sophisticated woman, but it ended up delivering the message with poor taste and really just got me to laugh, which also could have been why it was used. On a side note, `Cheddar' of Eminem's posse was also a lazy addition and unpleasant idea. Used mainly to emphasize Em's unique style, this token white character adds a sitcom feel to the drama of the story. Every time he says some dorky `white person' line, I anticipated canned laughter to kick in directly after. <br/><br/>But the biggest problem this movie has is Brittany Murphy's character, Alex. While everyone else in the film is obviously not pleased about his or her situation, be it in the rap world revolving around Detroit, or even Detroit itself, Alex comes along and 8 Mile goes from compelling drama to ghetto `Almost Famous' (That's the best way I can think to describe it, you know, `Almost Famous' with Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit?) Brittany Murphy plays a dirty Detroit vixen who perfectly mimics Almost Famous' Penny Lane played by Kate Hudson, except this time instead of having Ms. Penny Lane inspire an up and coming journalist with her connections to the rock and roll world, this knock off Penny Lane inspires a rapper by, well, unconventional means. Alex is an unrealistic, unwelcome, and out of place part of this film. She acts like no one in the rest of the group and sticks out like a sore thumb. This is the only part of the film I had major issue with.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving `8 Mile' an eight out of ten. I really enjoyed the movie much more than I though I would and have found myself retracting the negative comments I made about it without even viewing it first. Anyone looking for a movie to watch on a night where you have nothing to do can pick up this film and really get into it without getting bored. The pacing is fast, the rap battles are intriguing, and character development proceeds at rapid paces and never lets go. Even if you're not an Eminem fan, if you liked the proceeding descriptions of what this movie has to offer, I'd recommend you at least rent it."

","Everything is good about this movie except the core concept.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from very good to astounding, the writing sometimes soars, cinematography and editing a pleasure to watch.  Even a certain amount of the development is pretty good.<br/><br/>The faulty concept I'm referring to involves most of the elements of role and plot.  The ""love"" interest is vapid (not the character, just the role, as developed), the main interpersonal conflict is pretty much a sterile, undeveloped ""white-hats/black-hats"" sort of thing that lacks real depth. Some might say the depiction of sordid white trash life teeters artfully on the brink; I say it falls squarely over that brink and into the abyss. Sorry, I'm not going to say you can find redemption there, ""compassionate"" though it might be to do so.  You can hawk anything you like at me as heroism, but I might not buy it.<br/><br/>High points are actual performance footage.  Also, Eminem's character pulls off a clever moral coup at the very end (which I won't reveal, of course). This was certainly a valiant effort to redeem all that had gone before, but not quite enough, in my book.  I'm not just being facetious, by-the-way; it *was* pretty stunning.  But it wasn't enough to cover the sins of the first 95% of the film, which pretty much showcases degradation, in a manner so raw as to dare itself to engineer a redemption against very hard odds.  I suppose I should give this film *that*--in that respect, it was very ambitious, and that's admirable.<br/><br/>I guess there is one other aspect of this film that seems a little weird to me; the crafting of an image of a white boy being taken quite to the heart of the black urban community (though not without some struggle).  An interesting idea, but I couldn't help but feel that only very careful artistry could mold such images and make them look as ""slice o' life"" as this film does.  On one hand, this is a tribute to the artistry of this film, but on the other, it does mitigate against the idea that artists can always get their ways pushing any and all social envelopes with impunity.<br/><br/>Wow.  I can't believe I've said so much about a movie that, in the end, I couldn't really bring myself to characterize as ""good"".  Maybe that says something in itself.<br/><br/>See this movie if you want to see how far fine cinematic artistry will try to go to craft an image that would appear to spite social/racial convention in an elemental way.  If you like rap music, just be aware there's only about 10 minutes of rapping in the whole movie (more if you count occasional vocal rap background music over silent segments), and that it's all rap of the antagonistic ""challenge"" variety, tearing down an opponent, full of filth, meanness, and venom, but sometimes so clever that you laugh out loud. The handful of belly laughs in this film didn't pay for all the cheepniz I had to put up with to get there.<br/><br/>Yo."

","It was inevitable that Eminem would get his own movie, but everyone questioned whether or not Marshal Mathers, a kid from Detroit with absolutely no experience in acting, could pull it off.  Eminem does in fact do a sufficient job, but overall, there's nothing too special about 8 Mile.<br/><br/>  The script is quite old fashioned, any by that I mean it seems to follow soem of the harsh guidlines that were formerly imposed on films.  You know, the ""Anyone that does wrong must be punished before the end of the movie."" In otherwords, the good guy is going to emerge as a winner in the end of this movie.  From nearly the very first scene, it's very apparent as to which way this film is going and how it will most likely end. <br/><br/>
  But the script is somewhat redeemed by surprisingly good acting.  Eminem, as I stated earlier, does a pretty good job as Jimmy Smith Jr., but Phiefer, Bassinger and Murphy all give good performances, which really helps move the script along.<br/><br/>  Normally, I would give this movie a 6.  However, there is one aspect to the movie that I really liked and that was the sparing or rap battles.  I doubt the ones that made the movie were impromptu, but regardless, the battles flowed extremely well, and they were undoubtely the best part of the movie.  The crowd interaction was great as well, making me feel as if I were actually in Detroit, watching one of these battles live.<br/><br/>  In fact, I wish there were more of these battles in the movie.  4 addition, actually improvised battles were included in the DVD, and those were great.  If they had been in the movie, I would have given it a 8, but since they were not, 8 mile receives a 7/10."

Wondering, who the cute guy was in the movie.  When finding out it was Eminem I was in shock, my mouth was open for fifteen minutes.  Knowing that I don't like him or his music shock me that I wanted to see this movie. For months I waited, and also when I saw the preview I was wondering who sang the preview to his movie.  When finally Eminem's new music CD came out I found out that Cleaning Out My closet was not only the song that I heard from the preview, but I enjyed that song.  Not only did I get the CD I enjoyed most of his songs.  When it came to the movie, my boyfriend had doubts that this man could act.  Knowing that I have not shown any interest in any of the rapper's acting, I thought that he was probably right.<br/><br/>  Even though I thought maybe his acting would suck, I still went to see it not only because I believed maybe I could be wrong, but I would like this movie.

","OK, I finally decided to break down and see what all the critical hooplah was all about. Fortunately, I waited for the DVD to come out so that I could see the subtitles and read the lyrics that are almost impossible to decipher from listening to them. Wow! This was a tragic story.  A young misguided youth lives on the right side of the tracks or rather (8 Mile).  He longs to be on the other side of the fence where everything is not greener, but blacker. He writes rap music, well maybe not music, but he can rhyme connected sentences. Our hero, Rabbit, is handicapped from pursuing his goal. You see, he has the problem or rather the stigma of being white.  Poor kid! He gets his chance to compete against the King of the Rappers, but it's early in the movie. If he succeeds in winning, then the movie will only be fifteen minutes long and we can go home before we get a headache. But this film isn't ordinary. It has the distinction of being a Curtis Hanson movie. We can expect more and exciting things to happen. Surely our hero won't fall in love with the rich white girl!!! That would be too conventional. He must somehow find a way to move out of his mother's trailer which she shares with a kid about our hero's age. What can be mother's problem by dating her son's school mate. Did I hear correctly? She's angry because the mate won't perform oral sex on her when she's hasn't bathed in many a day...and there's not a bathtub in sight. Good grief! Mother is handicapped by filth and odor.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the good stuff. I haven't read such accolades about a young actor's performance since James Dean appeared in ""Rebel Without a Cause"". Mr. Eminem is versatile. He can managed to look sad like a puppy dog or he can elevate it to one more emotion...an ANGRY sad puppy dog.  Sometimes he went from one expression to the other with such agility, I got goosebumps. I'll bet he's magnificent in still photos. like a CD cover. Oh My! Some 90 minutes later, after seeing Rabbit's best friend, blow off his testicles (with a real gun!), it's time to build the epic to a climax.<br/><br/>The ""comeback kid"" gets another shot at beating the King of the Rappers. Will he freeze as he did before? We he be able to create lyrics on the spot about things that are happening now, all with a syncopated beat which can change tempos at will, whenever he needs to? The mounting tension is too much for the average theatergoers heart to stand. If you see it, make sure you have a ""nitro"" tablet handy to place under your tongue. The least you can do is to take a Xanax before the movie starts. I won't spoil the ending. You'll be thrilled at the conclusion if you've never seen ""Rocky"", ""Hoosiers"", ""Rudy"", or countless other ripoffs.  It will ruin it for you if you can outguess the predictable ending.  Will he win, finally? Will he decide he's out of the rich girl's league? Or will he walk off alone down a dark alleyway looking for the sunset and trying how to look like a happy sad puppy dog? I can't wait for the sequel! I guess I'll have to settle for other pieces of Hollywood schlock until then...you know...movies starring Nicole, Brad, Julia, Tom, Colin, Meryl, Rene, Gwenyth, Matt, Ben, Cate, Catherine, Anthony, Mel, Bruce, and other talents lesser then Eminem in the meantime. WHAT A FILM! ""8 Mile""! A landmark in cinematic history. It ranks only slightly above, ""Dude, Where's My Car?--the sequel""."

He holds the camera extremely well and I think he could be a huge film star if they don't make him remake Blue Hawaii with hip hop.  The only criticism is that I thought the location of the burning house right basically on a playground was forced and unnatural.  Other than that, perfect and I give it a ten.

","Listen close, my friends, as I'm telling you this, and bear in mind that this is coming to you from a man who's absolutely NOT into rap music - 8 Mile is very, VERY good. First, it's got great drive. Watching it, you can't help going with it the same way you can't resist nodding your head when you hear some thick & powerful beat coming from the speakers. The story of a young white rapper's struggles is gritty enough yet the filmmakers have enough taste to not push it too far & keep it firmly in believable territory. Yes, I should mention that both Kim Basinger & Brittany Murphy don't really have much to play, and as a result they look rather poorly - but that's understandable since the real star of the film is Eminem and his rapping skills. And Eminem delivers powerfully & thrillingly. He really has what it takes to be a film star - it's great to watch him even when he does nothing special, just riding a bus looking out of a window. The freestyle battles are just brilliant - it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen (though I really should mention that I could understand very little in what those guys were saying). Since I enjoyed it so much not being a rap fan, I have only one questions - how do fans of Eminem survive this film without dying of pleasure overload?"

"slimshady9053","10","0","0","16 February 2003"," Definitive hip-hop/inspirational movie!
","This is the definitive inspirational movie of all time. The cinematography is great, there is a grainy, gloomy type of setting which signifies Rabbit's sorrow and anger for not being able to blow up and make it out of Detroit and 8 Mile road. The film (for those who haven't seen it and should), is about a young artist named Jimmy Smith Jr. (Em) who is very angry and frustrated with life. He raps in battles at a local nightclub, they don't rap for money in the streets of Detroit, they win the battles, they get the RESPECT, which is far more important to them. The film follows a very eventful week of ups and downs in Rabbit's life. He works a dead-end job at a steel mill called Detroit Stamping. His mother is a slut who is dating one of Rabbit's old high school classmates, she is about to get removed from her trailer for overdue rent with Rabbit's little sister, Lily. She is also constantly giving him crap about his rap career and his life decisions. He is forced to live with his mom after getting kicked out of his apartment by his girlfriend who says she's pregnant and is not, she also takes his car in the break-up. He finds a girl named Alex who he likes and she encourages him in his rap career, she ends up cheating on him with a so-called friend of his. He and his friends are in kahuts with another local rap gang-The Free World. Rabbit's group is from the 313 another local rap gang. His friend Future is the host of the battles at the club and encourages Rabbit because he sees his true potential. And in the end Rabbit finally makes it and wins the battles, gets the respect and goes home standing a little taller. This movie is the Rocky of inspirational films. It is raw, real and absolutely amazing. Eminem's performance is extraordinary for a first time actor, a performance not seen in a debut since Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. You should definitely see this film, it is a touching story underneath the gritty drama. Eminem does such a great job at playing a relatable character that you will find yourself laughing with his disses, feeling sorry for his losses, and rooting for him every step of the way."
"isminos","Null","0","0","15 February 2003"," I would avoid reading the critical review b4 u see the film
","I went to watch this movie (after strong, long, repetitive and persuasive enough arguments with my friends) on the first day of its release. We arrived at the cinema 30 minutes earlier but even then the cue was unexpectedly long. People seemed to be cuing forever in the rain waiting to issue their ticket, which, all of a sudden, seemed amazingly precious to everyone. As I joined the huge cue, I glanced at the crowd. People with baggy jeans and T-shirts, baseball hats and/or hoods, funky (to me) ghetto jewelry and trainers. I wondered what was I doing there. This seemed to be a specific film for a specific audience. But as I watched the crowd more carefully I also saw people that were less familiar with the hip hop or rap life style and attitude. I was getting more and more puzzled and intrigued as a few guys at the back of the cue were actually `rapping' some of Eminem's lyrics.<br/><br/>I was quite unsure about Eminem's debut in the cinema business. Great singers with huge success in the music industry, having sold billions of records worldwide proved to be quite unsuccessful on their attempt in the big screen. One could significantly mention names like Mariah Carey in `Glitter', Britney Spears in `Crossroads', Jennifer Lopez in `Enough' and even Madonna in `God only knows which one to mention first'. How Eminem's attempt could be different from all the previous attempts?<br/><br/>
The answer to the question above is not very complicated. `8 mile' is a movie about life in Detroit in the late 80's. Focused mostly on how young people lived in that area, we watch the straggle of a young white rapper (Jimmy a.k.a. Eminem or vice versa-since the story strongly resembles some biographical elements of Eminem's life) to be recognized in a world dominated by black people.<br/><br/>`8 Mile', however, is not, under any circumstance, Eminem's personal story. Some biographical elements are obvious and inevitable (Eminem is indeed a white rapper in a music industry in which the vast majority is represented by black people), but Eminem is not selling out his personal, private and unquestionably strange, eccentric and therefore `catchy' story of his life (the father that never known, the mother and wife he hates, a beloved daughter and a single parenthood carried out by a man, and finally one of the top places in rap music in the world).<br/><br/>Jimmy lives in a world that more or less works like a social ghetto. The majority of people live their lives from week to week, working double shifts and given low salaries. Most of the characters that surround Jimmy have given up any hope for a better life. They just `hung around' letting things happen to them rather than doing things.<br/><br/>Jimmy's family status is a sufficient example of this particular way of living. His mother (Kim Basinger a.k.a. Stephanie) is a divorced woman having spent most of her life in a trailer with her little daughter. She has reposed every hope for a better life to earnings from bingo and to her much younger lover who lives like a parasite in the family, waiting for his disability payment check to come. Her desperation, instead of leading her to do something drastic about her life, is making her more idle and pathetic.<br/><br/>
However, there are people who want to make a difference and pursue their dream. Brittany Murphy (a.k.a. Alex) wants to escape from the strict closure perimeter of 8 mile. Although she fells in love with Jimmy, she wouldn't hesitate to sleep with an other man in order to promote her career. In this case, her desperation is leading her to become more energetic and drastic about her life but she loses her self-integrity and respect in order to reach her goals.<br/><br/>In a society that almost everyone acts and reacts in such a way, Jimmy stands out. Not because of his colour. He is a young man with dreams, who gives his personal fight not only to achieve his goals but he also tries to overcome his personal fears, doubts and societal norms. Self-actualization is presented as Jimmy's main objective. Neither success, nor money is of his primal attention. He just wants to escape from this way of living, alter his life.  Jimmy represents every young person that wants to believe in himself and his abilities in order to fulfill his dreams.<br/><br/>However, this seems that it was concerned to be an unimportant factor to the movie rating councils in many countries (including Greece). The members of the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) believed that it would be beneficial to rate the movie with an R certificate making it inappropriate for people under 18 years old (and in some cases 21 years -depending the laws and regulations of each country). It has been often noticed that critics and members of the rating council persist to focus only to the obvious events of a film and they don't try to understand what the movie is all about. In most of the cases, the majority of the audience would identify with Jimmy, the most positive character in the film. Jimmy stands out as a role model. He's not doing drugs, he is committed on what he believes and he reaches his goal only when he believes in his self and in his abilities. Moreover, he achieves his objectives with a decent, self-respecting way. This could be taken in account as a positive message for young audience. We have to admit that he uses strong language, gets into trouble, he falls in love and has sex, but then again who doesn't? Eminem represents the courage and the inner self power to stand up to what one believes and dreams of in a city that seems to be on a lethargy under the societal norms and a pathetic and pessimistic view of the future which is restricted just on a 8 mile road. Additionally, Eminem's role seems to be even more `gay friendly' in comparison with his homophobic, up to a point, past song lyrics. Therefore, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to suggest that the rating was wrongfully put in an R level.<br/><br/>To conclude, we could mention that the performance on the main roles is more that satisfactory. Kim Basinger neglects and reverses all her previous `femme fatale ` roles as she appears in a less charming but powerful and not `shallow' role. Additionally, Eminem gives, to many people's surprise, a good and persuasive performance. Besides, he does what he knows to do best: be an innovative musician and one of the best rappers in the music industry. Finally, director Curtis Hanson, gives a realistic view in Detroit of 80's and creates in a far more than a successful way a music documentary of rap and hip hop music which could be described as a significant contribution to the history of music. Not to mention that the soundtrack has been nominated for an Oscar Award."

","In the viewers comments, I was surprised to read a few negative comments by British viewers. I thought this would be more ""our"" sort of film than it would be an Americans. The film is very much akin to ""Scum"" and other British films in that it merely offers a snapshot of someones life as opposed to the Hollywood happy ending hero gets the girl. (I'm not being patronising to Americans there, it's just in our film making culture the hero never wins - infact he's lucky to survive the film, e.g., Get Carter, Kes - albeit the bird dies).<br/><br/>Eminem's performance is exemplary, demonstrating why he is the ""all round entertainer"". Many pop music / pop acting crossovers are embarrassing at least, if not deleterious to careers.<br/><br/>Even though the film was in the most part irrelevant in a social sense to the British audience, it was well directed and acted and I left the cinema saying ""that was a good film""."

","First of all, I've read plenty of comments from people saying that there's not much of a plot to the film. Correct. The film is simply about a week in the life of a amateur rapper and how he battles his confidence to finally prove himself, despite all the bad things happening around him. That's all. Read the tagline - 'Find your voice'. This film simply told you how Rabbit found his. Hollywood *could* have put a lot more side stories into the film, but they weren't necessary; the story kept its focus on Rabbit, where it belonged - even though it wasn't very exciting at times. I was also glad there wasn't some huge happy ending where Rabbit got famous. Instead we have more of a realistic storyline -- after all -- no-one goes from being a nobody to a megastar in a week. (even though Eminem's own rise was pretty fast.) I liked the way you were left guessing 'so what now?' for Rabbit.<br/><br/>People who expected more plot, more side-stories and a 'bigger' ending have been living on a diet comprising of too much Hollywood shmultz. If you'd learned what the film was telling you, you wouldn't have been disappointed. I certainly wasn't. 8/10"

","My first impression after I saw 8 Mile's trailer a few months ago was the same many people had. At that moment I was sure I wasn't going to see this joke of a movie, which only purpose is to keep selling that character called Eminem, who is funny, yes, he is, but I didn't necesarialy consider him an artist of any kind. Man if I was wrong! This is not quite an original movie, neither a blockbuster happy-ending flick. Luckily, it was directed by Curtis Hanson, a man who knows how to direct actors, like Kim Basinger, and people who wanna be actors, say Eminem or the girl who play his sexy girlfriend of the week. Before I get any further, I'd like to remark this: one thing that came to my head the moment this film started was, 'hey, what about 'Dancer in the Dark', I think there could be some similarities'. And I was right, just compare Eminem and BjÃ¶rk. Both music artist who tried acting the only way a non-professional can do it, feeling it for real, as if they wouldn't be acting at all. And this time works, as it worked with the emotive Dancer in the Dark. You keep comparing this two movies, I already did. Back to 8 Mile. Music, this movie wouldn't even exist without music. I'm not gonna say I'm a into hip-hop or rap, but I can feel music, I can feel the beat in my chest. This is one of those movies which have the right music at the right moment, and you can feel it. The scenes when ""Lose Yourself"" tune was beating in the background, with only one or two words of the lyrics we've heard on the radio, were ones of the best. As touching as these scenes were the battles scenes. Sadly my ear is no so good yet to understand english that well, that fast. (By this time I forgot about the subtitles in spanish, they were all wrong and didn't capture the core of the rhymes). Perhaps I could understand half of the rhymes, I bet you guys laugh more that me, although I catched some great lines and managed to laugh from time to time. In order not to make this too long, I'll add: you can do a great movie capturing the beauty even in ugly places, disturbing realities, and letting the hit song go on at the last scene as the hero walks away down by the alley. Classic but not cliche.<br/><br/>Just to say a number: 7/10"

","8 Mile can be viewed two ways, a semi-autobiographical tale about Eminem, that seeks to make him more sympathetic, or as a general tale about growing in a rough neighbourhood and aspiring to be someone. The truth is it probably lies in the middle.<br/><br/>The film has a great opening with Eminem's, Jimmy Smith Jr or Rabbit to his friends, psyching himself up to contest in the ultimate challenge for an aspiring MC, a rap battle. Curtis Hanson directs this scene in a way which picks up on the emotions running through Rabbit, as he chokes at his big moment. The close ups of his face show his fear. Hanson is an actors director, something he'd shown to masterly levels in LA Confidential, and something he displays here with all actors given a chance to display their potential. He also deserves credit for making Eminem, ditch the Shady look, and the ego, and become the average looking nobody type.<br/><br/>The supporting cast do a great job, with Mekhi Phifer believable as Rabbit's best buddy Future and cool enough to pass as the MC who hosts the slams. Kim Basinger is suitably trashy as his trailer dwelling mother, who is sleeping with one of his former school comtemporaries. She creates enough pathos with her situation to have sympathy with her. Brittany Murphy generates enough sex appeal as Alex who seduces Rabbit, but is never dispisable despite the fact she appears to be sleeping her way to the top.<br/><br/>Special mention to, for Rabbit's one white pal, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones). He is involved in one moment that demonstrates that this group are just street punks, and not gangstas, when he injures himself with his Mom's gun.<br/><br/>As for Eminem, he demonstrates that he has screen presence, always the focus even when he isn't doing anything. If we take the view that he's playing himself he does it well, but the fact is he seems to understand that you don't have to jump up and down screaming to give a good performance. Less is often more, and the shots of him in contemplation, as he travels to work on the bus are as good as his verbal assaults. Not that the final rap battles aren't extremely entertaining and exciting. Having seen so much CGI and explosions over the last year, it's nice to know as much adrenaline can be pumped with a bit of verbal. His final acappela assault, literally leaves his opponent speechless.<br/><br/>The ending also works out well, as Hanson doesn't allow Rabbit to suddenly become a star, but keeps him grounded in reality, by sending him back to work his factory job. The film's about aspiring to be somebody, but wanting to do it your way, on your own terms.<br/><br/>Is it Eminem the actor on screen or is it just Slim Shady. I don't think I know, but it's enthralling whatever."

","It's really easy to discard ""8 Mile"" as the latest attempt from Hollywood at milking a pop cash cow, but in fact this is a surprisingly strong acting debut for star rapper Eminem, who essentially plays a Hollywoodized version of his own rise to fame in this rags-to-riches melodrama that recycles the time-honoured story of the outsider who becomes a star, set in Detroit's derelict urban districts and rap underground of the mid-nineties. Scott Silver's script follows the tried-and-tested rule of the coming-of-age of a young man striving to get out from his no-future life, only this time transferred to the rap world and playing up the inverted race card (a white boy trying to make it in a predominantly black world), but it's really Curtis Hanson's handling that makes it all worthwhile: edgy, nervous, urgent, the on-the-move setups and visceral editing choices (always flowing with the beat and the rhymes) make the best of Eminem's intense, possessed screen presence, permanently attuned to the flow of his lyrics and the demented passion in his eyes. Never shying away from showing an abandoned, apocalyptic Detroit and using it as a setting to enhance the film's do-or-die energy, Hanson proves himself as one of the most astonishingly attuned of contemporary American directors and effectively transcends the initial pop-exploitation concept by turning it into a litany for the American Dream. Eminem certainly can hold himself up there on screen -- it helps that he is playing someone very close to himself and that the supporting cast makes for strong support -- but it remains to be seen if he can hold on playing against type. A great surprise."

In fact it gave 8 mile standards to meet.<br/><br/>Thankfully I wasn't left disappointed by an inspiring tale set in a gritty and painful backdrop.<br/><br/>The cast didn't over-perform and certainly didn't under-perform as they carried out some real and meaningful scenes. Eminem proved that he can act though it is difficult to see him in any other role, the story of Rabbit is practically biographical. The only slight doubt in casting was Kim Basinger. Not that her performance was bad, in fact she was fantastic as Rabbit's trashy mother, however she seemed a little too glamorous for the part.<br/><br/>I have never really been a big fan of rap but I sat in open-mouthed amazement as Eminem did his stuff in the various battles throughout the film. The final battle is an immense build up of emotion and leaves you on a real high.<br/><br/>There is nothing to say other than this film delivers in a big way. It was everything that I hoped it would be and I was hugely impressed and entertained.<br/><br/>So Eminem does meet the levels of Rocky in terms of the film but I still know who I'd back in a fight.<br/><br/>8 Mile deserves a street-wise 9/10"

The movie concentrates on how he began. That's it! Theres no rise to fame, It doesn't end with the Eminem we all love. It's based entirely on Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith, not the transformation of Jimmy to the Eminem we know and love. It just ends nowhere? He doesn't even get famous in the movie! It ends before we get the chance to see how he did. I felt cheated that I missed out on that. It was as if I was only told half the story.<br/><br/>Because of the fact that it only concentrates on one part of his life, the movie seems to drag on and on and on, like it's trying to kill time. You could've crammed the entire storyline into 30 minutes but it was stretched out so much that it gets boring. You keep thinking...Ok is this gonna go any where yet? You keep expecting that ONE SCENE that will turn the tables. That will make the movie start to get suspenseful and interesting. And you'll be happy to know that YES! That scene does exist!

Although once in a blue moon they may just get it right, with a good director and reasonable cast all hope is not lost. 8 mile hit's the screen with rap artist Eminem in his acting debut teaming up alongside `L.A.

His only gateway to sanity is his personal communication through rap music, which this film is obviously filled with. What makes this films stand out from so many others is that the music was a simple communication tool between the characters and the audience.<br/><br/>The semi-raw cinematography certainly added more drama to the picture without the actual film giving off the impression of it being anything else but a drama piece of cinematic filmmaking.

","For those who claim to enjoy rap but know little about it, or are attracted to the raw and sexy image of hip hop, or who fancied a bit of that Eminem as he clowns around in his videos, then this film is not for you. This is no glossy, airbrushed Hollywood interpretation of life on the streets of Detroit. The characters are as gritty as picture is grainy. Whether this stands up as a testimony to Marshall Mather's early years is immaterial - it can certainly be viewed as such given what we know about the rapper's tough upbringing - but this is a movie and ultimately is about entertainment. Authenticity is irrelevant.<br/><br/>And entertaining it certainly is. If only for a glimpse into the hip hop scene in a deprived area of the Midwest from the comfort of your multiplex. The tired theme of a young man struggling to make his mark, overcoming all odds, from rags to riches, is typical of this kind of biopic and offers no surprises, but what is surprising is the relative lack of musical offerings from Eminem himself. I found myself willing the man to speak up from the beginning and itching to hear catchy tunes in the soundtrack throughout, but we only really get rewarded at the film's climactic last scene. It's worth the wait but the film could have packed in more music. Eminem fans will be disappointed.<br/><br/>The examination of the Detroit hip hop scene is fascinating and filmed to appear intimidating; the Shelter, the venue where the weekly duels between sparring rappers are performed to an alternately scornful and delighted audience is deliberately squalid and designed to shock. But the effect is immediate and the atmosphere electric. The contrast between these conditions and the tender affection the various characters display for each other seems designed that way, touching though it is, as if the director is asking you to believe that all these guys really have hearts of gold, they just look terrifying. Or you could say the intention is that despite the hardship, friendship has blossomed.<br/><br/>While the male characters in general are likeable enough, the characterisation is rather ham-fisted and cliched. 'Future', the Shelter's MC and all-round geezer has OB1 Kenobe written all over him, and it's hard not to think of C-3PO and R2D2 with regards to the other two 'homies' - a classic Greek chorus consisting of the grotesquely overweight, the brainbox with a social conscience and the in-bred trailer park boy who's picked on by everyone and inevitably protected by our hero. Next to this dysfunctional lot Eminem seems enviably well-balanced and normal, which may be intentional but it's not entirely believable, given his troubling domestic circumstances. Where is his alcohol/gambling problem, his violent outbursts, his criminal record? Saved by rap, it would seem. While vicious gangs are roaming the streets looking for his ass, he's tucked up at home writing songs - our very own Brian Wilson of the trailer park. A bit trite really.<br/><br/>
The female characters however, are so beyond liking there's a strong case for accusing the director of sexism in this movie. There are only 3 women characters of any significance and all seem incapable of functioning without the approval and attention of our protagonist, which is irritating anyway, and they are all portrayed as complete slappers, every one of them - particularly Rabbit's mother(played by Kim Basinger)- using sex as a way of elevating themselves from their various pitiful circumstances. The only one who takes the men on at their own game appears briefly during a scene at Rabbit's workplace, rapping to an audience over a coffee break and generally 'dissing' a male workmate for a laugh. This is not an isolated incident however; it merely serves as a vehicle for Eminem's character, Rabbit, to get some  practice in front of an audience, defend the woman who is being slated by her opponent verbally, and emerge triumphant, ready to take on the big boys at the Shelter that Friday night.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a pretty formulaic piece of work with some very entertaining and funny moments. If this was set in a middle class suburban environment the film would divebomb and surely have nothing to offer the most forgiving of audiences; what saves it is its relatively original and occasionally disturbing setting. Oh and Eminem's pecs."

","The hype machine surrounding `8 Mile' has been supremely effective. We've by now been assaulted with so many reports of Eminem's `auspicious,' `dazzling,' and `stunning' acting debut  read: he doesn't suck  that it's quite easy to overlook the fact that the film itself is little more than a shopworn Impossible Dream Story that's as predictable as figuring out what part of his chocolate Easter bunny Mike Tyson will eat first.<br/><br/>     Director Curtis Hanson sure-handedly lets us know that the titular Detroit neighborhood is, as Eminem himself might put it, `more poorer than you are.' Everyone's clothes are worn, their cars rusted, their houses decrepit. Even the sky seems unable to cast more than a bleak gray upon the wretched inhabitants below. Life around 8 Mile is so miserable, in fact, that the only salvation anyone finds is in freestyle rapping. No longer does the grizzled bluesman croon about his sorrows on the corner. No barbershop quartets singing sweet harmonies into the evening as they warm their hands over burning oil drums here. No, folks in 8 Mile seem to communicate exclusively in improvised insult rhyming. Indeed, even the street gangs settle their beefs with rap battles, recalling the dancing thugs of `West Side Story' and `Breakin.' Will Jimmy `Rabbit' Smith Jr. (Eminem) come up with clever enough rhymes to win the battle at the local club, giving him a shot at a recording contract? He's Eminem  you figure it out. There's an engaging film to be made on the culture of freestyle rap battles, as showcased by last 15 or so admittedly fun minutes of `8 Mile.' Unfortunately, a tiresome and silly plot forced upon a subject that doesn't necessarily need one keeps us from getting what we really want out of the film."

","I didn't used to like Eminem.. I have listened to a few songs of his that I really liked and I started getting more and more hooked.  I saw the movie and just fell in love with him.  The movie was not written for him or his life, but I have heard that some of the ideas Silver got, he got from Eminem.  I think Eminem did a wonderful job on the movie.  I could tell the difference between his moods, and the conflict his character carried.  I can't see him making another movie, though.  That would probably not be wise.  I am not a rap lover, but I feel he has brought something unique to the music industry and he would become just another sellout in the name of fame if he were to act in something else.  I loved the movie, I have no complaints.  See it.  It appears that rapping is his outlet.  When someone has an outlet, there are no rules unless it hurts someone else.  This is a good thing because if you don't like his music, don't listen to it.  There are a few tracks that I have to skip because they are a little too intense for me.  There are no gimmicks to this movie.  Just a guy trying to make a better life for himself.  He showed a side of himself that softened him a bit in my eyes.  All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't like the actor.  They did an excellent job and made me believe."

","If the lack of success of recent movies like `Crossroads' and `Glitter' were any indication, `8 Mile' would just have been another movie starring a famous musician trying to translate their record sales to a credible film career---and failing miserably in the process. With an excellent director in Curtis Hanson (`LA Confidential', one of the best films of the 90's) and Brian Grazer, producer of last year's Best Picture winner, attached to the project, Eminem won't be suffering the same fate as Mariah or Britney.<br/><br/>`8 Mile' takes its name from the road that separates the suburbs from the slums in Detroit. For Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem), 8 Mile is the obstacle he must surpass to be truly happy in his life. Jimmy has been forced to live with his deadbeat mother (we don't see many of those in movies these days) played by Kim Basinger in a cramped trailer after a breakup with his girlfriend Janeane. He works at a dead end job in a stamping factory making bumpers, a place where only `ex-cons and welfare moms' are employed. He needs to escape the violence and desperation of a neighborhood built on broken dreams. The only way he can beat the odds is to gain prominence in hip-hop.<br/><br/>Eminem does pull off a good performance in his film debut, but one can give him only so much credit in a film loosely based on the events of his own life. He does play a toned down version of the Eminem we know, this movie is almost an explanation of how he ended up writing the songs that he does about his ex-wife and mother. What makes him look that much better acting wise are the performances of the supporting actors around him, most notably Mekhi Phifer as Future, host of the battle raps (basically a fight with words), who acts as somewhat of a guide to Jimmy throughout the film. The role of Jimmy does require the talented rhyming skill something even non-fans cannot deny that Eminem possesses, best on display during the film's climatic battle.<br/><br/>Although it's all in the movie: the sex, violence and language in `8 Mile' is never exploited, not one character is murdered in the film. `8 Mile' is a meaningful film about the element of hip-hop beyond the expensive cars and objectified women we normally see in music videos. While it's not Best Picture material, `8 Mile' succeeds at what it set out to do, to show parents and cynics what all the fuss is about (not for Eminem, but for the music as a whole) and to give dedicated hip-hop fans what `Saturday Night Fever' gave to disco fans 25 years ago.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"cstead","8","0","0","10 December 2002"," The Real Marshal Mathers III stands up!
","Singers should stick to singing and actors should stick to acting, but rappers, it would appear, can do whatever they want. Although far from critically successful, Ice T, Ice Cube, Tone Loc, LL-cool-J and even Busta Rhymes acquire regular billing in B-grade schlock and, at times, have all been top of their game in their primary profession. There is no doubt that Eminem is at the top of his game, so naturally, celluloid has beckoned, but there is no Eminem here, or Slim Shady, forget the monikers as it is time for the real Marshal Mathers III to please stand up, and he does.<br/><br/>	8 Mile refers to the stretch of road that separates black urban from white suburban Detroit. In a place of poverty and crime, a man is measured be his street cred and this cred is measured by his ability to rap, or, by being a friend of a rapper. Mathers plays B.Rabbit, a white rapper with loads of untapped talent, held back by fear, his friends, his colour and domestic issues. It is a complex time for Mr. Rabbit and 8 Mile studies his struggle to raise himself above the adversities that surround him.<br/><br/>	Thus, 8 mile is very formulaic and predictable, elevating the world of underground rapping to the same heights as nascar in Days of Thunder, Jet-fighters in Top Gun and almost every other hero-struggles-but-eventually-wins-the-day scenario. However, it is propelled above the masses by never rising above its station and by superb performances from Murphy, Phifer and Mathers himself. Scott Silver's script allows the many supporting roles to flesh out, without grabbing the lime light, but perhaps the audiences knowledge of Mather's life aids us in what is, supposedly, a semi-autobiographical movie.<br/><br/>	8 Mile manages to present a world that many might believe does not exist by portraying it with reality and reason. There is little in the way of unbelievable theatrics and despite the massive draw power of its star, comes across more like and independent film than a Hollywood blockbuster. This is in large thanks due to Curtis Hanson whose direction is inspired. Like B.Rabbit's life, the film is gritty and dark, but allows enough humour to remind us that we are dealing with real people in a world where you never know who your friends are. B.Rabbits talent is also held back just enough to make the finale twice as rewarding, as Eminem's detractors root for Shady to cuss and rhyme more opulently than his opponent.<br/><br/>	Obviously, in a movie such as this, music is going to play an important part and 8 mile kicks more goals than not on a soundtrack that his heaped with legends of the past (TuPac, Notorious BIG, Montell Jordan) and the present (Mathers himself). In a film with so many lyrics, the question posed is how much Mathers himself contributed to the rhymes, but they are often more witty than gross and may help to open the eyes of non-believers'. There is no doubt that the Lose Yourself' track and single is a killer tune and pleasantly, the rap-offs' are generally left to the skills of the combatants rather that the production team and there is no D.R.E label anywhere in sight.<br/><br/>	8 Mile is a formulaic movie that, plot-wise, comes along way from shattering the boundaries Eminem's music career has with reckless abandon, but, it does portray his world without the gloss of MTV. However, with such a mature performance, returning to that music scene and taking his lyrics seriously may become and issue for some of his fans. How could B.Rabbit be Eminem? Whether he likes it or not, the past is definitely that for the king of Black' music, despite a finale which raises some possible racial concerns (white man leaving the black to the ghetto) that although subtle, are noticed. 8 Mile is a success for all concerned and I look forward to the next step in the career of this, the figurehead for 21st century culture."

","For those of you who are biased because a white man wants to rap, this is NOT a wigger movie. As a matter of fact, it's about that bias. It's not about Eminem and his rise to fame, it's about a kid trying to achieve success in a world that does nothing more than shoot him down. Everybody wants to succeed, this is just one person's story. The film itself was quite good.  I have seen other online ""reviews"" and they said ""it was good, but we've seen it before."" Where the hell have we seen this before? 8 Mile is quite original. It's the first (and only) movie that I have seen where the racism role is reversed. In this movie, the white guy is the one who is discriminated by racist black people. It's a very bold step because people are too afraid to incorperate the fact that ""black people can be racist too"" into film. Eminem is just the man to show that prejudice, but keeps it from going over the top and too far. This is a great film and I didn't expect it to be so well done. I think that everyone can relate to it in some way or another..."

","8 Mile is not a comforting film, but it's a good one. It shows us the most realistic portrait of life in the ghetto since last year's Training Day. While many would hate to think about Eminem's debut film, I took the chance of seeing it, and was shocked. It seemed impossible that such a disgrace to music could have feeling towards filmmaking, and against all odds, perform well. While Mr. Mather's had a huge crew behind him, he was excellent, and I was actually able to like the film as a whole. There have been previous attempts at film made by his fellow rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, but they were wasted opportunities. Eminem falls into the same category as Ice Cube; he is just as good on film as he is at selling c.d.'s, if not better.<br/><br/>Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem), also called `Bunny Rabbit,' is a white man, in the middle of the Detroit ghetto. He strives for stardom, and wants to be a professional rapper, but his constant misfortunes in life are stopping him from doing so. In the beginning of the film, we see Jimmy rehearsing for an act in the middle of a tattered bathroom; motioning with hand-movements, and mouthing the words to a song. He exits the bathroom and then steps up to the microphone on a stage, in front of a crowd of homeless people at a shelter. He has a DJ to back him, and he is supposed to freestyle right into his competitors face (it is a competition between about 10 rappers). The track begins and he starts to say `Yo-Yo' repetitively for about five seconds. After that, nothing comes out of his mouth. He is frozen, and says nothing, and after forty long seconds of being humiliated, he runs off the stage.<br/><br/>Jimmy is the constant victim of these types of unlucky situations, though he tries to prevent them from happening. His girlfriend has left him, and he has given her his car. This has left him without money, and nothing to sell, so he must resort to living with his mom (Kim Bassinger) in the local trailer park. He has problems with her boyfriend, who is about his age, and lives with her. Her boyfriend constantly teases him about being fired from lots of jobs, including one at a local Pizza place. One of the main things dragging Jimmy down is his careless group of friends. Most of them are black, though the most careless one is white, and pretends to be of another race. They shoot themselves on accident, light vacant houses on fire, and get into fights on a regular basis. Jimmy is constantly scowling upon what they do, but never chooses to abandon in them.<br/><br/>I went into some depth about Eminem's performance in the introductory paragraph, but now I would like to further concentrate on it, as well as the cast as a whole. The role of a trailer-trash, two-timing mother was an odd choice for Kim Bassinger, but she was excellent in executing it. Her emotionally needy character was well-written, and she provided great support to what was already there. Brittany Murphy was also terrific. She plays Jimmy's love interest, after he breaks up with his other girlfriend. Mekhi Phifer was good, but not great; though his role wasn't very well written. And once again, the leading man, Eminem, was surprisingly good. And I am in shock because of it.<br/><br/>Brain Grazer can make any normal flick a masterpiece. His inspirational work on A Beautiful Mind was what made it so good. The way he dealt with the many unique shots in Blue Crush was fabulous. His efforts on 8 Mile are no different. Without a good producer the numerous grim shots of the ghetto would not be pleasurable to watch. With masterful skill he makes the depressing area lively, and this makes it all the more better. Most think that all a film relies on is the actors, but Grazer proves this wrong. Films like Federal Protection, Kung Pow! Enter the Fist, and The Transporter suffered because of this; but 8 Mile does not. I hope that Grazer's work continues to be as magical in future years.<br/><br/>All I can say is: what a surprise. I walked into this film thinking that it would be as wretched as a Nazi prison camp. Similar to the recent Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights, 8 Mile classifies as a guilty pleasure. It has a great deal of truth to the material that it presents and is quite realistic. Eminem, Brittany Murphy, and Kim Bassinger give ecstatic performances, and Mekhi Phifer dishes out a good one. Grazer produces with style, and Hanson directs with confidence. I can't say I walked out of the theatre with a newfound respect for rap music, but I am able to say one thing: 8 Mile is a great movie.<br/><br/>-Danny, Bucket Reviews"

","8 Mile is the sleazy, urban remake of The Karate Kid. Eminem plays the Daniel character, the ""new"" kid who has been poking around where the more popular kids hang. He's got talent, but can he show this talent to the other kids (rappers)? There's the girlfriend who has affiliations with both Daniel, I mean Eminem, and the bad kids. I use the word ""affiliations"" VERY loosely here (pun unintended). There's the struggling mom who loves her kid but cannot provide the crucial life lessons Daniel/Eminem needs, so we have Miyagi (Phifer), the wise teacher/counselor/companion. But there's no Karate in 8 Mile. Just rap. So ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,""  right? Not so. There are some hurtful things being said here. Hurtful rap. And to add insult to injury--or rather injury to insult--there are young guys with guns out waiting in the street outside the ""Hall of Rap"" who seem quite willing to pop caps into people. Johnny and his Cobra gang from the Karate film seem like real pansies next to these hooligans. At least Eminem didn't get spaghetti sauce all over a perfectly good outfit at the club, though! Talk about hurt. So in the sequel to 8 Mile, Eminem will get the you-know-what kicked out of him by Johnny and his Cobra cronies (many now with illegitimate kids, beer bellies, and memories of ""the old days""). A flop, you say? Guaranteed."

That is the foundation of this film. Filled with likable and dispicable folks alike. Each one reminding us of someone we talked to just today, or grew up with yesterday.

If this is just reppin' 313 - it does a good job, dawg But while I give it full props, it will not stand the test of time compared to other music movies. Spinal Tap was way funnier, and The Commitments was both funnier and more poignant (and by the way, wasn't it all too Americanly derivative to cop the name ""Jimmy Rabbitte"" from the latter film?)<br/><br/>So as a movie it will probably disappear in our conciousness too quickly. Some script flaws can be overlooked, but Britney Murphy looked too old to play the girlfriend while Kim Basinger seemed too young (and too Texan) to be his mom. Then again, there were pieces of brilliance in getting MM to play against type (the rappin' defence of the gay at the lunch wagon, and his self-dissin' in the final throw-down that left his competition unable to respond).<br/><br/>That being said, ""MM"" impressed the F out of me with his restrained effort here, and I'd consider him for an Oscar (especially if Denzel can scoop one for one of his weakest, and most over-the top efforts).<br/><br/>Peace out!"

","While 8 Mile may be an interesting look at what was, at the time, still a subculture, and a movie worth viewing, I found it to pale in comparison to Curtis Hanson's last two films:  Wonder Boys and L.A. Confidential.  Why did it pale in comparison?  Two reasons.  One, the casting.  Two, the script. Eminem should be given some slack as this is his first theatrical endeavor and with that taken into consideration, it's easier to let him off the hook for the lack of range of emotion and the stiffness that he gives off intermittently throughout the picture.  But Kim Basinger as his mother?  I'm sorry, but in her first scene, I cringed.  If ever there was an definition of what miscasting is, this would be a prime example of it.  That being said, Hanson managed to make only this one blunder in casting and the rest of the actors only help to protect his lead and give the film more dramatic credibility.  Which leaves the script.  In my opinion, if the script had been tighter and more cohesive, half the other problems that came through, even with Ms. Basinger in it, would have been swept under the rug.  But the script lacked direction much of the time.  There were multiple scenes in the film that didn't really do anything to make the film stronger.  If anything, they diluted it.  Besides from that, Hanson did a good job of directing a first time actor in a lead role and a wonderful job in recreating what seemed to be a very authentic world.  Certainly not a waste of time, just frustrating when one compares it to Hanson's last two films."

That being said, I liked this movie.  I enjoyed the way Mekhi Phifer and Kim Basinger played their roles.  Both were top notch.  I thought Eminem did a fine job for his debut, although he was basically playing himself.<br/><br/>The backdrop was done superbly.  Having grown up near trailer parks, I think the movie captured their gritty reality.  I especially loved the parts where they had to bum rides and go on buses because their car wouldn't work. Make no mistake, this is how poor live in this country.<br/><br/>I also liked how gunplay was kept in its proper perspective.  Guns are dangerous and should not be played with, and I think the movie showed how most people react to them in real life.  Of course, the way the movie was written, I think it was intentionally attempting to alleviate the anti-homosexual and sexist remarks Eminem had made a little while back (in fact, this is the only thing I ever heard about Eminem before this movie).<br/><br/>The editing was excellent and smooth, and I enjoyed some of the scenes that were tossed in purely for the cheap laughs.

","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>The ending was real.  As a matter of fact the film even with its cinematic flaws redeemed itself in my opinion, by avoiding the happy sappy ending.  I am not a die-hard Eminem fan, but I applaud him for portraying the role in as real a manner as he did.  In the end of the film, it did not finish with the typical montage-style switchover, starting with the cheering fans at the Shelter and ending with some packed stadium.  The film did not start with a preamble of ""this is what happened.""  The film did start, however, with the main character in a bad situation, and at the virge of a defining moment in his life, which is what could easily be told of many a young person's life. Through the course of a couple hours we witness what he actively does to make his situation better, and witness turnarounds of other characters as well.  I think that the writer of the film added Eminem's mother's bingo success in to not make the situation so dire as to suspend disbelief.  The fact that she won 3200 dollars in bingo only stabilizes her situation, as she has no job to speak of.  This ensures that Lily is taken care of for the moment, but in a way is real as well.  In real life oftentimes all we can do is stabilize the situations that occur.  To continue, Eminem holds his own in the rap contest and finds his true voice out of personal anguish.  He ends the film walking off to ""do his own thing,"" because he finally realized this was the only thing he could do.  In real life if you hit your mark you don't give up what you do to support that mark.  As Mark Twain once said, ""Put your eggs in one basket; then watch that basket.""  He knew he couldn't miss the rest of his shift, for he would have been fired for sure and not get enough money to record his newfound voice.  All of this, ending included, makes the film real, and I think realism is what the film was stressing throughout."

B Rabbit was played with such sutble understatement that a I forgot almost immediately that the actor behind the character was so infamous. From the very first scene, as he faced himself in the mirror, I could feel that Rabbit was going to be a young man with emotional depth. I absolutely loved that he threw-up on himself and that he so completely choked on stage. He became utterly real. And so did the music. I may never be a fan, but I can approach an understanding of its emotional drive.<br/><br/>This is very much a movie worth seeing.

Reminds me of that relationship between him and his real-life daughter.  I have a feeling that this guy will become a great actor in the near future.

","First of all, I should start by saying that I'm not the world's biggest Eminem fan. I've generally liked several of his songs (especially ""Stan""), but not enough of them to ever buy an album. That's not to say I don't respect him. He's smart, talented, and I like anybody who isn't afraid to ruffle some feathers. He also seems like the kind of performer who would have a natural ability to be a good actor, and from the first time I saw a trailer for ""8 Mile"", I knew that was the case.<br/><br/>I wasn't wrong. Admittedly, you can argue that he's more-or-less playing an earlier version of himself, but this ain't no music video. Eminem is more than a capable actor, he's an excellent one, able to do what he's required to here, which is anchor the whole movie and impress a lot of people out there (fans included) who would so quickly be naysayers if he didn't do a great job.<br/><br/>It also didn't hurt that he had a really good director (Curtis Hanson, of ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"") and cinematographer (Rodrigo Prieta, of ""Frida"" and Spike Lee's upcoming ""25th Hour"") leading the way.<br/><br/>Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., an aspiring rapper who goes by the nickname ""Rabbit"". He and his family are poor, living in a trailer park with an eviction notice on the door. His mother, Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is loving but selfish and a hard drinker. Also living in the trailer is Stephanie's pathetic white-trash boyfriend, Luke (Michael Shannon) and Rabbit's kid sister, Lily (Chloe Greenfield), who is the only family member he feels genuinely close with. Lily, his music, and his friends are the only things that really keep him going.<br/><br/>This kind of believe-in-yourself, dreams-can-come-true plot won't be unfamiliar to anyone who has seen a few movies before, but by the end of the film, we suddenly realize that the issues at hand have become more complex and deeper than that simple outline.<br/><br/>It's not perfect. It's a little too long, the climax is too drawn out, and some of the comic relief is kinda lame. But this is a movie you go to for the feeling, the performances and the little moments and scenes that make you go ""wow, this is really good"". ""8 Mile"" has lots of those."

","Not a great movie at all.  It supposedly depicts Eminem and his world, but it is about the overuse of the 4 letter word.  Prefixing mother to the 4 letter word makes these rap aritsts ""in.""  Sorry, I can't feel that way. The script shows his struggles, etc., and we are supposed to empathize.<br/><br/>
I ended up watching this movie because I'd have to wait 2-3 hours to see Bowling For Columbine, or Punch Drunk Love. I was glad when the movie was over.  I like going to the movies, and 8 Mile is a passable movie.  I felt the same way about The Rookie.  They keep playing to your sympathy, and you are like, ""Come of it man.""<br/><br/>If you like rap, like Eminem, go see it.  You'd get your money's worth, as it is not a ""bad"" movie.

","Although the film is briefly based on his life, I thought Marshall Mathers did an excellent job of acting, considering it was his first feature film. The idea of an Oscar nomination is not an overstatement, based on what I saw from the rapper.  I felt he was believable as Jimmy Smith, Jr., and not Eminem.  Kim Basingner and Mekhi Phyfer do excellent acting jobs as well. Britney Murphy looks hot and that adds to the charisma of the film.  The drama with a little bit of comedy is the perfect combination for the Academy Awards.  The end Battle Raps by Jimmy Smith, Jr. versus the Freeworld rappers is and unforgettable scene that will forever go down in history. Congrats to Eminem on a great acting debut and we'll see him at the Oscars this year, if not for acting, he will definately be accepting the award for Best Song from a Motion Picture."

Well anyways, he's mom is a trailor trash { kim basinger}, and the only reason why he even sticks around with her is because of his young sister. Kim Basinger did a great job, even with all that trailer trash makeover she still looked beautiful. The only reason why this movie was any good was because of all that loud music that just makes you want to get up and dance and all that beating up and stuff.

","I am a HUGE Eminem fan...and this movie wasn't nearly what I expected. First of all, the plot was stupid. Eminem's character spends 151 minutes trying to succeed in the rap world. Come On! People say that this is an inspiring film? For whom, wanna-be rappers? <br/><br/>And the relationship he develops with Brittany Murphy's character is unrealistic as well. She said in the movie that she has a good feeling about him. And she had only met him two scenes before she said that. How could someone believe in someone that fast? It just didn't make sense. Do not get me wrong, Eminem and Brittany are really good actors, but the dumb plot and high amount of swearing & violence cannot carry this film. In my opinion, maybe this film would have been better with a more realistic plot, less violence and less swearing (Especially with out any usage of the 'N' word.) Other Eminem fans may enjoy this film, but I didn't think his movie debut was anything to rap about!"

I went with a friend as a joke, and wound up loving it. It's harsh, funny, sad, intense, touching and everything that a good film should be. I don't really like rap, nor do I care much for Eminem (although he is hot...sorry), but this was a good movie, end of story. I loved the unsanitized feel and the human touches afforded by the director. My only problem was ""What happened to...?"" his sister, his mom, his girlfriend, his other friends.

Didn't happen! It stayed real, which is a breath of fresh air for this movie goer.<br/><br/>Also refreshing was how Eminem handled the rap battles. He actually ACTED like he was making it up on the fly, and he was quite convincing! On my movie scale of ""MANOS-THE HANDS of FATE"" to ""CITIZEN KANE"", I give this one a robust ""PATTON""!"
"kmberger","8","0","0","19 November 2002"," The psyche of a star.
","Eminem could have taken an easy road.  He could have costarred in the latest Steven Seagal flick, or done a cameo for the Farrelly Brothers' next movie. He could have cashed in on anything he wanted to with his first movie, but he chose something a little more challenging than that.<br/><br/>'8 Mile', named for the road that is the northern border between Detroit and the suburbs, is loosely autobiographical, shaped around the events of an up-and-coming rapper named Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. (Eminem).  Rabbit has to balance working for a living at Detroit Stamping with his dreams of a rap career and an escape from the trailer park he calls home with his mother (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lilly.  At night, he cruises the city in his beat-up car with his friends, the 313 crew (named for Detroit's area code).  One of the 313 is Future (Mekhi Phifer), who organizes rap 'battles' downtown, where young MC's square off against each other with stylized insults and rhymes - winner gets all the respect.<br/><br/>The film starts with Rabbit psyching himself up for one of these battles, showing none of the anger and cockiness that the real-life Eminem is so known for.  Rabbit is unsure of himself, knowing he has talent but intimidated by the forceful personalities that surround him and not quite ready to burst out of his shell and let the world know who he is.  Even standing on stage, mic in hand and silent, hearing the boos and calls of 'Choke!', you can see that Eminem the actor has something here, a sense of character that isn't just him playing himself.  It's an intensity and a force of personality that is waiting for an outlet and he keeps it smoldering throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) keeps the film flowing as sidebars and challenges arise that twist Rabbit in the wind.  His mother's boyfriend is a complete waste and not much older than he is.  Money is always an issue.  An opportunity for free studio time arises, but with strings attached.  A muse of sorts (Brittany Murphy, elegantly trashy here) wanders into his life at just the right time.  And finally, another rap battle against his rivals, in the same place he choked before.  By the time he takes the mic again, the audience has seen his long, hard climb to this point.  Opportunity is there, all he has to do is seize it.<br/><br/>And seize it he does - the final rap battle brings the house down. Eminem finally lets loose with the skills we all know he has into a series of cathartic rhymes, taking on all comers. The last rap, where he takes all the bad things people have said about him and uses them to build himself back up, is pure genius and pure adrenaline.  By the time all is said and done, Rabbit walks off into the distance on his own - with all the confidence he'll ever need.<br/><br/>Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver make some good choices here. Eminem's real-life controversial attitudes towards gays and violence is muted with Rabbit to the point where he befriends and sticks up for a gay coworker. The final scenes aren't the big payoffs - the record deals, the demos, the sold-out concerts - but instead are personal victories.  Phifer and Basinger do creditable jobs of building up and supporting Eminem's inexperience as an actor and help carry the film through.<br/><br/>It's a worthy debut, and a movie to take seriously. '8 Mile' is gritty, honest, and rewarding."
"dugpj","10","0","0","19 November 2002"," It turns out musicians besides Bjork can make art films.
","Curtis Hanson and Eminem have one thing in common: they are creative in America at a time when creativity has succumbed, like everything else, to laziness. Instead of Glitter or Crossroads or any number of crapcrapcrappy films out there made by musicians who think they can act. And the comparison can be made to Dancer in the Dark, if only for the squalor that the protagonists in each movie must endure, combined with the violence necessary for each of them and the dream--that dream of music--that is there for both of them, at least in their fantastic visions of their futures.<br/><br/>And all of this without a grandiose conclusion to the story. Eminem's Rabbit walks away from the movie with no BIG CONTRACT, no GIRLFRIEND, no RELATIONSHIP with his mother; in fact, he goes back to work at the factory. There's something to be admired in a story that doesn't have to bang us over the head with what it's trying to say. And the emotion rings true in Hanson's 8 Mile simply because he lets the actors act and the drama flows naturally."
"rob.cottrell-2","Null","0","0","19 November 2002"," A right ear-bashing
","Believe it or not, I didn't attend the European premiere of '8 Mile' cos I love Eminem's music, I'm not hip enough for that . I went to see this movie cos it was directed by Curtis Hanson, whose last two films ""LA Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"" were two of most interesting films to come out of Hollywood in the last few years. So I knew that '8 Mile' wouldn't be given the normal glossy treatment.<br/><br/>and so it proved. Filmed on location in Detroit, it has a look and a cast that feels uncomfortably authentic. You really feel the hopeless squalor these people have to live in - 8 Mile incidentally refers to the road that acts as a boundary between the right side of the tracks (i.e.; the white side) and the wrong side (the black). Eminem stars as a young piece of white trash (gosh what a surprise!) who was born on the wrong side of the tracks. He, his mother and daughter live in a run-down trailer. His mother is also having a relationship with local slob who is only using her until his redundancy payment comes through and hates Eminem because he can see through him. It's a pretty dark picture. Faced with a bleak and hopeless future Eminem together with his multi-ethnic friends cruise the streets in cars that barely work. His only way to express his despair and frustration is through rapping.<br/><br/>The centrepiece of the film revolves around hip-hop contests where in a pugilistic battle of words - the prize-fighter imagery is none too subtle here - two rappers throw insults at each other, the winner being the one who has the last word, literally.<br/><br/>and yet..although there are no glib Hollywood endings, either upbeat or downbeat this does contain a few things which left me feeling a little uncomfortable. Casting Kim Bassinger as Eminem's mother is a good start. Although Kim does a fine turn as the sluttish white Trash mother, you always get the feeling that come the end of the shoot, off will come the make-up and this stunningly beautiful film star will reappear. This is reinforced by the little girl who plays Eminem's daughter. She is so cute that she comes straight out of the Shirley Temple school of toddlers. She, of course, adores and is adored by her big brother. Altogether now...""aarrrr"".<br/><br/>There are some Guns in the film, most notably when one of Eminems' friends - who plays the stupid and clumsy comic side-kick - manages to shoot himself in the thigh, at least I hope it was the thigh. There are a couple of beatings and fist-fights but these result in a few bruised ribs and black eyes rather than any permanent damage. Indeed the worst acts of crime these boys seem to get up to is firing paint balls at the local police cars..and..where are the drugs? It seems in this movie people get high on a few bottles of Bud.<br/><br/>I know I'm being a little glib here. It is great to see a movie that looks this real and does not the portray the ""blacks in the ghetto"" as either out of their boxes on crack, or blowing out each others brains in drug-related gang wars, but you can it take too far the other way.<br/><br/>Enough of the brickbats. Eminem gives a sensitive and intelligent performance  for a first-timer although not Oscar-winning since it's far too one-dimensional. Moreover, it does confirm what people were beginning to suspect from his music; that there is a lot more to Eminem than the Demon from hell the tabloids like to portray him as.<br/><br/>Putting this film into the right context and especially when comparing it with the usual 'Star Vehicles' that are produced to carry the latest pop sensation into the movies, this really is a fine film.<br/><br/>A couple of points I picked up from the Screening. There was a large crowd at the showing who were probably there for Eminem, on the chance he might turn up personally. A pretty good indicator of his pulling power. He didn't turn up by the way, but Curtis Hanson did. At the end of the screening, he talked unpretentiously about the film and was honest enough to admit that hip-hop wasn't really his sort of music. He also answered the obvious question about whether the film, in which 95% of the cast was black, would have been as successful in the white mainstream market if Eminem had not starred in him. Well, if he hadn't starred in it, it wouldn't have made was the simple answer. As I was leaving the cinema I had a quick check to see how many black faces there had been in the audience. There were a few..they were the ushers."

","For those of you who haven't heard about this movie, it's the acting debut (ignoring Da Hip Hop Witch Project and The Wash) of Marshal Mathers III. This is not another film with a singer wanting to play at acting, this is Eminem demonstrating that the last three years of switching between Slim Shady, Eminem and Marshal have taught him how to play at being someone else. And that is the last I intend on referring to Eminem (as he is credited) and his other career, not referring to him as an actor demeans him and this movie.  <br/><br/>Not due out for a couple of months in this country, I will try not to spoil too much of the story for you.  I will however, try to save you from a little of the hype - and there's going to be a lot of hype.  This film is not a semi-autobiographical `Life of Eminem,' it has a couple of similarities and that's it.  Set in Detroit in 1995, 8 Mile tells the story of Bunny Rabbit (Eminem), a white, working class rapper and his struggle against gangs, racism and his own insecurities.  8 Mile focuses on Rabbit's attempts to get a record deal or at least some respect for his skills as a rapper.  At the start of the film we see Rabbit `battling' on stage at a rap venue, the only problem being that there are no words coming out of his mouth.  Despite the directors (Curtis Hanson) pedigree, this is still an American movie and we can all see where the narrative is going.  What Hanson does manage to do is guide us through the journey to its inevitable climax without us ever being too concerned with the fact that we know where we are going.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are well played by a mix of actors and rappers. Mekhi Phifer is probably the pick of the pack as Future, Rabbit's best friend, who hosts the battles and pushes Rabbit when he needs pushing, even at the risk of their friendship.  Basinger as Rabbit's alcoholic trailer park mother is cast strangely.  Her performance is perfect, but perhaps the make-up department could do with a few tips.  If a poor single mother of two was living in a trailer park desperate for money to avoid eviction and she looked like Kim Basinger, she would be straight to Playboy.  Basinger needed making-down, not up.  Brittany Murphy, apart from looking eternally drugged to the eyeballs, was sorely underused, serving mainly as a shag piece for Rabbit just after he has defended a gay guy (the audience obviously needed reminding that Rabbit was open minded but heterosexual).  The other performances are fitting, no one steeling the show and everybody contributing to the plot.  We can only assume that Hanson directed them all well, as he has certainly directed the rest of the movie well.  Locations are honest (especially as the whole movie was shot in Detroit) and the visually are realistic, at times seeming almost like a documentary.  The final showdown battle feels like a climax to Faking It.<br/><br/>8 Mile is a portrayal of the individual following their dream and doing what they need to do to achieve it.  The entire meaning of the film is captured by Eminem himself in the theme tune to the film:  `Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity / To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment / Would you capture it or just let it slip?'  The movie is uplifting in an unusual way.  It would not be giving away the ending to say that it doesn't end exactly the way you expect, although you can't help but feel a little pleased for Hollywood for having made a film that satisfies the audience yet doesn't stick to all the rules.<br/><br/>Talks of Eminem being Oscars bound are probably a little premature.  There is no doubt that he has what it takes to be an Oscar winner, but it seems unlikely that this will be the performance that will garner him the little golden genital free man.  The film itself probably won't win too much by way of serious silverware, other than maybe for the soundtrack (which is itself integral to the film, in the most part).  In terms of major drawbacks from enjoying 8 Mile there are only a couple.  The same reason that most people will want to go an see it, Eminem, will be the main reason that lots won't. Those that aren't staunch Eminem haters should give this a chance, as he succeeds where so many singers fail, he convinces you that he is the character, you stop seeing him as Eminem very early on.  The other problem may well be the language barrier.  Large sections of the movie are rapped, not like a hip hop musical, but because the scene dictates this.  The battles, where much of the character creation takes place, for example, requires a keen ear to catch every word, but you will be rewarded for your concentration with some insults of quite unbelievable grace.<br/><br/>This is a convincing debut from about the most famous man in the entertainment world and a good film that might suffer due to its inevitable hype.  Worth seeing as soon as you get the chance, in the hope of avoiding the media attention 8 Mile will get.  It is in parts amusing, tragic and painful, and will leave feeling hopeful although not completely euphoric as many an American fell good movie can do.  This is intelligent entertainment, something the film world is often found lacking.<br/><br/>

Anyway, I'm not that big of a fan of Eminem but I do respect his talent and perserverance in the industry. I am a fan of rap, I am from Detroit and I read movie reviews. Those elements were enough to get me to the theater. My immediate thoughts centered on the excitement(?) of seeing Detroit represented on the big screen. Even though the ""D"" is one of the country's largest metro areas, I can't think of any other movie since Beverly Hills Cop that actually was filmed in the city. If you're wondering, that's REALLY Detroit's westside. The eastside's worse (which is why I escaped to ATL). Eminem really represented his hometown and how it is for alot of white guys there.<br/><br/>The movie was good overall but left me wanting a bit more substance at the end. I'd rate it 6.5 out of 10 - better than average but just barely. The real success of this movie should be credited to the marketing agency.<br/><br/>BTW, if you don't take life too seriously and want to see a hilarious movie based on a white guy who wants to become a rapper and be ""down"", go rent Whiteboyz."

As a man who appreciates the value of words, you'd think Eminem would realize this.<br/><br/>SOFT SOFT SOFT! This is basically a PG movie with the word ""f**k"" a lot... Sort of like an urban ""Wayne's World"" or a rap ""Karate Kid"" this is anything but gritty and realistic. Basically a comedy, although at times unintentional. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many unresolved plot threads- what happened to his mom? his sister? his girlfriend? etc etc etc<br/><br/>Elvis' movies may have been bad, but at least he sang, which is what people wanted. Eminem doesn't even rap until WAY WAY too late in the film. This is the exact opposite of his music- bland, innoffensive despite the swearing, and at times blatantly PC (heroic Em stands up for a gay guy and a woman? COME ON!!!)<br/><br/>Maybe just a documentary of one of his tours would've been better. The real Eminem onstage is way more interesting than this bland attempt at image-polishing or whatever the hell they were trying to do..."

","A surprising success given that most music scene films are abysmal.  I know little or nothing about rap music and seldom listen to it.  Even so, the music fit perfectly with the tone and pacing of 8 Mile.  If you flow with 8 Mile's tone and pacing, you can overlook some of the script's awkwardness.<br/><br/>Eminem may prove himself a credible actor.  Few singers have gone on to have successful careers as actors.  He may join the short list with another pretty face (Mark Wahlberg).  He showed a screen presence uncommon in a first film.<br/><br/>Few films and set in the Detroit area and most of those were filmed elsewhere (i.e.; Grosse Pointe Blank).

Not knowing much of anything positive about Eminem, I thought it best to view it before taking her.  The R rating was also a tip..... I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  Not to the extent that the critics seem to be, but surprised nonetheless.  As many have already mentioned, the plot was somewhat limited, but the movie in general was good. It took a little getting used to the singsong of the rap as I don't typically listen to that kind of music, but it was entertaining and even humorous once I adapted. The sex scene, although unprotected(like any Hollywood sex scene is) was intense.  It was a bit nerve wracking, though, contemplating the possibility of them getting caught.

It seems to me, from what little I could understand of the rap lyrics, that most of the films songs are little more than weak insults interspersed with the occasional curse.  I'm guessing the problem is that Eminem did not actually wright most of the film's music. Not that I encourage potty mouth lyrics, but most of what they say would even be permissible on television (shock!).  Without any sort of edge to its songs, this movie is just a tired rehash of better rags to riches stories.

"mike-925","Null","0","0","11 November 2002"," Good film of its kind, but not up to Curtis Hanson standards
","**Some Spoilers**<br/><br/>Eminem's 8 Mile movie did $54.5 million its first weekend.  It was a pretty fair movie, but it wasn't great.  Eminem has about one face- a defiant, fierce look- to display to the camera. The director is Curtis Hanson, who gave us the extraordinary LA Confidential and the not so extraordinary Wonder Boys with Michael Douglas.  Kim Basinger plays Rabbit's trailer trash Mom, who is divorced, of course, and going out with a guy only 2 years older than Eminem's 20 year old character Jimmy.  At one point Eminem is talking with his Mom and she blurts out something about how her boyfriend won't do something with her sexually. Rabbitt pushes her away and shouts ""Mom, I can't discuss that with you."" Basinger got an Oscar for Best Actress in LA Confidential but she won't get one here.  This is a better movie than you would expect from a rock star but its still not first rate.<br/><br/>There are a lot of black people in support of the Eminem character. The setting is ghetto Detroit.  Rabbit hangs around with black guys and has learned to rap with the best of them.  But he's afraid to go head-to-head in a Rap contest at a local nightclub, even though his good friend is announcer and MC of the contest.  Sorting people into heroes and villians is a bit of a trick for the storytellers. In the end, Rabbit is the good guy and a group of rival blacks are the bad guys.  If Rabbit hadn't had his own group of more loveable blacks (to the audience) backing him, this politically incorrect maneuver couldn't have been pulled off.  Toward the end, when Basinger's boyfriend has ditched her and she has received an eviction notice, she wins $3,400 at a Bingo parlor and so the trailer is saved.<br/><br/>With that kind of encouragement, Rabbit summons the chutzpah and poetry to compete in the rap contest and shrewdly beat the black contestants who three scenes earlier had beaten him up pretty badly. Among the character actors supporting Eminem are a white Michael J. Pollard lookalike and a pretty funny and large Forrest Whitaker clone.  Everyone has seen a variation on this story before, but with Eminem in it, there is apparently all the difference in the world.<br/><br/>There's a minor trend in this movie and another with Adam Sandler. The good directors like Hanson have thrown in the towel trying to get quality scripts and have just decided to compromise their highbrow film esthetic with pop culture.  Paul-Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights and Magnolias fame has made a minor art movie with Sandler in the lead, pulling the same routine as Hanson does with Eminem. So, the actor isn't so hot!  No problem. Find out what the actor can manage, actingwise, then select a simple enough story so the actor can play the role.  The new Sandler film is called Punch Drunk Love. I'll probably go have a look see.  It will be the first Adam Sandler I've ever looked at, since this guy's comedies are unbearably dumb and unfunny.  Emily Watson and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, extraordinary character actors, are there to back up Sandler. The movie might even be good."

Eminem (as controversial as he may be) is very talented as an actor, and is especially talented as a musical artist.  I think many people may swear off this film simply because many of his lyrics can offend so many types of different people.  Hey, everyone has a right to their opinion, right?

Eminem is the funniest man in music, ever, no question. You'd think that I am a big Eminem fan by how this is written. I like his music. I own one of his CDs. But I think Eminem has a quality about him, the same quality as Tom Cruise or Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, women find them great looking, but there are male models that don't have ten million fans. These select people, and I think there is only a handful, have a certain presence that feels like they walk on water, like they have a spotlight on them at all times. It's a strange phenomenom that happens only a few times a decade, but Eminem has arrived. I don't care if he stars in another movie, he probably won't.

If a story can take me on a journey that sucks me into the life of the characters and makes me forget my own (not trying to escape a horrible life) for the time I am in that seat, then it is hands down, a great movie.  8 mile did this for me.  Marshall Mathers made me forget who he was, and made me believe he was Jimmy Smith Jr.  I don't think viewers got enough time with Kim Bassinger's character, nor Britany Murphy's to really identify and feel for them.

","Let me start by saying, I had little knowledge about Eminem before going to see this movie. I am a fan of rap music up until the early 90s, but haven't been too interested in anything that I've heard recently. I can't name you an Eminem song and the few minutes of his music that I'd heard before this movie definitely weren't my style. When I saw a preview for this movie, it looked like it might be mildly interesting, but definitely wasn't on my must see list by any means. Yesterday I read my good friend Vince's review of the movie at Qwipster's Movie Reviews and decided to go see it. It was a good modern story reminiscent of the old school days where rappers would ""battle"" each other with freestyle raps. I love the scene where B. Rabbit dogs the guy in the lunch line who is making fun of other people. Back in the day, these battles were common. Rappers Kool Moe Dee and L.L. Cool J had an ongoing feud and each would come out with songs dissing (before dissing was a word) each other. But more commonly, it was just a way to trash your enemies in the street in a non-violent manner or a little good-natured ribbing among your friends. The overall story was a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man struggling against the odds to make it big. Not knowing Eminem's story, I can't say how close this movie is to his life, but it's a pretty good story. Though fairly typical and predictable, it's well acted especially by Eminem and Kim Basinger. I think it's safe to say that I won't become a big fan of Eminem's music, but he was good in this movie.<br/><br/>

He also shows that rap (that is before the ""hip-hop"" word came along)is an art and that it is a culture of the African American community. Its a way of life to express yourself through words and ryhme. I appreciate that. It wasn't demeaned in any way. He showed it positively. I'm glad someone out there shows  that rap ain't all about being a baller, a bitch and a banger. The rappers who do the above don't realize how embarrassingly stupid it sounds. True its a disgrace.

","I had qualms about seeing this movie at all. Primarily rap stars don't change into actors very well. With that aside let's see how to sum this up.<br/><br/>1. Eminem is definately not the typical rap/actor. He has talent. He can express feeling in his face. Problem is...if you were acting out a semi-autobiography of your life, wouldn't you play yourself pretty dang well? I don't see how talent had much to do with it but I give him his credits. His writing in lyrics is wonderful too. <br/><br/>2. The rest of the actors, who are primarily actors...well...suck. No depth, no progression, no character. It's an Eminem story so don't expect anyone else to have any growth. Kim Basinger especially.<br/><br/>3. Story line. HOLLYWOOD PLEASE HELP YOURSELF! Story is getting hard to come by, with deep emotional stories being overlooked for pretty faces and vulgarity. 8 Mile is a long winded tale of day to day life with almost nothing to do with any real story. It begins and it ends on the same note but other than that, it's just a romp through Rabbit's life...and an unexciting one if you know anything about big city life in dirt poor areas.<br/><br/>Conclusion? Save the money. Go to this at the dollar movies or rent it. The top box office position belongs to much more worthy films.

However, the movie had a naturalistic sense about it that did remind me of ""Wonder Boys.""<br/><br/>And Eminem can act!  Who would have thought it?  I thought he out-acted Kim Basinger in fact.  There are lovely naturalistic touches to this film: Eminem making up a rap to the tune of ""Sweet Home Alabama""; images of the depopulated and gritty streets of Detroit (who among us isn't fascinated by Detroit-- which has lost over 1 million residents since 1950-- and at the same time ashamed that the city doesn't get more assistance from our government and private charities in this supposedly prosperous nation); and the light banter between Rabbit and his friends.  No, naturalism and realism aren't exactly the same.  So I can't vouch for its authenticity, but no one associated with the film has maintained that it's an autobiography of Eminem's life.<br/><br/>It's not the best film of the year and there are parts of it I would have cut out (the scene in the radio station, for one, which added nothing to the plot-- in fact I would have taken most of that woman's scenes out and replaced them with more about Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, whose brief scene showed her to be a capable actress who probably would have proved to be a more interesting character), but the fact remains that it does hold together and provides a refreshing naturalistic counterpoint to most of the stilted Hollywood films of today."

But what I don't understand is how the world has encouraged this guy to be rude, crude, disrespectful, disgusting and just outright evil.  What is wrong with parents that they would allow their children to listen to this guy and even allow them to emmulate him?  Now, Eminem fans and duped movie goers alike, will all go out and pay $7-$10 a person to watch this guy in a movie.  Why encourage him? What is he saying and doing that is so useful, and worthwhile that we need to pay money to hear it and see it?  Is he contributing anything positive to society? Why give this guy the time of day?  This is just one more situation where a whole lot of money has been thrown into a trash can and set on fire. You want an underdog story?  Hollywood has a million of em', and many were actually made about respectful people who contribute something worthwhile to society. Go rent those.  You, your children and anyone else you know will be so much better off for it.  Better yet, take the money you would have wasted on this movie and send it to me!

","Many people refused to accept the fact that Eminem could possibly act. That refusal now looks silly and ridiculous after seeing 8 Mile.  While the movie is a typical Rocky-esque little guy trying to go big inspirational film, it is done with style and is very entertaining.  The two big things about this film are the actors and the director. Eminem (Slim Shady(Marshall Mathers III)) is absolutly astonishing in this film.  You want him to suceed.  You feel the pain of his failure.  You applaud his victories, and you love him, a thing many would not think possible of the white rapper.  As well, Kim Basinger's role as Rabbit's (Eminem's character's name) mother is amazing.  She has such poise and such ability.  Although she has a smaller role, it is felt during the film, and she keeps an amazing presence on screen. Curtis Hanson deserves props all over the place.

","This movie was gaining a lot of hype down here in Australia, so I decided it was worth a look since Eminem is one of my favourite artists. I missed it on the big screen, so I hired it on DVD. I was pretty glad I did see it. What I thought, according to the trailer and general gossip, was that this movie was directly based on Eminem's life. In fact, it's only loosely based on his life in Detroit 1995. He plays Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, a white wannabe rapper who battles at ""The Shelter"" (which is just when two rappers bag each other out in a song they think up on the spot) He's split from his wife, has to live in a trailer with his mom at 8 mile court, and is trying to get a record deal at J.O.B. His friends are Future (Mekiah Phifer) who hosts the rap battles, a fat guy (not sure of name) and his brother (Proof from D12) and a hilarious drug addict called Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones). Why I liked this movie was because it could combine a dark drama with some humor throughout, which Cheddar Bob provided most of. They also managed to squeeze Xzibit and Obie Trice some small roles, which was cool.<br/><br/>Anyway, I bought this movie on video and I love it. While it isn't some great masterpiece, it is enjoyable and a good movie. It has A LOT of swearing though. Not for young ones.<br/><br/>Great movie. 8/10"

Anyways, this movie really suprised me to the fact that it's better than I expected.  Eminem is actually a pretty decent actor, and a person who might not have known anything about his life before this movie might gain some insight into the person behind the music, something people rarely try to understand before judging him.   Other than that, go see this movie and decide for yourself.  If you don't like it, at least have a good reason.

The movie runs the gamut of dysfunctional relationships, trying to find at least one that you'll buy into, but none of them are developed, and none of them are at all suspenseful because you know that it'll all work out in the end (or you don't care enough to notice that the conflicts weren't developed and were simply forgot about).

","I just saw 8 Mile last night at an advance screening at the University of Pennsylvania and I have to agree with most of the other comments already on here.  I thought Eminem did a pretty good job in his acting debut.  I thought he was most believable in the scenes where he was joking around with his friends.  It seemed a little forced to me that they had Eminem standing up for the gay guy at work and then talking with him near the end before he goes off to the rap battle.  It was an all to obvious way to show people that Eminem is not really homophobic.  I also noticed that it didn't seem like Eminem had very much dialogue at all which made me think that perhaps the makers of the film were not completely confident in his acting abilities.  I thought that the Brittany Murphy character was a complete waste and was just thrown in there to get Eminem a sex scene and was just added in to the very formulaic plot as the girl who has sex with two friends and causes them to fight.  The movie was very predictable, but I thought it was enjoyable and the rap battles were awesome.  They made the movie for me. The other acting was pretty good too.  I thought Mekhi Phifer probably turned in the best acting performance of the entire cast and Kim Basinger was pretty good too. I think if you are an Eminem fan and you enjoy his lyrics, then you would enjoy this movie.  Particularly the rap battles at the end, the lunch truck scene and when Eminem and Mekhi Phifer change the words around to Sweet Home Alabama."

I can only account for the 1's being people who hate Eminem for reasons other than the film.  Make no mistake, this film is everything you want in a film. The film is hilarious.  I saw it with a very diverse audience, Ivy Leaguers and West Philly residents.  Everyone was laughing throughout the film.  The funniest movie I've seen this year and great because it wasn't a standard movie ""humour"". I felt a real bond to the characters (except for the stereotypical urban preacher friend).  The nuances captured of just hanging out with your hometown friends are unlike any film I've seen.  The great songs playing in the background bring back '95 memories. The casting is perfect.  Eminem is a great actor because he has an anger to tell the world his story.  You can feel from the movie that he's not trying to make loads of cash with the film, just tell the story of the broke nobody who wants to be somebody. The film isn't simplistic.  The film is not a shrine to Eminem which finds him rolling in dough at the end.  Eminem is shown to find his motivation in anger.  The ends like it begins and a lot of ends not tied up.  The director is excellent and didn't allow this film to become another cliche.  Best Camerawork I've seen since Traffic. In conclusion, I'm seeing this film again when it comes out on Friday. And will definitely be buying the DVD.  Puts a geniune smile on your face."

","I had the opportunity to attend the first public screening of '8 Mile' at the Toronto Film Festival. It was introduced by director Curtis Hanson as a ""work in progress"", and was attended by a large contingent of Hollywood power-broker and film-executive types, all of whom I'm sure were curious to witness the outcome of the movie and gage the audience's reaction. Despite the director's caveat that the film didn't yet have final sound or picture, it was for all intensive purposes finished. And the result? A decent, if highly manipulative and incredibly formulaic movie. To Hanson's credit, the direction of the movie is skilled, and it rarely imposes itself on the flow of the narrative. As is his style, he rejects wacky angles and pretentious blocking and simply allows the characters to tell the story. And what about those characters? Well, despite all the public hand-wringing and worrying that Eminem has been doing about the quality of his performance, he is actually quite good. The real surprise isn't his acting ability, which is fine, but the extent to which he allows the film to grind down his badboy edges. Hardcore fans who are expecting Eminem in all his lewd, violent, shocking, homophobic, misogynistic glory simply won't find him here. Instead, we get to see Eminem as a caring brother, decent son, hard-worker, loyal friend, and a brave guardian of the rights of his female and gay co-workers. In fact, Eminem's character has so many wonderful virtues, the occasional angry or violent outbursts he has feel almost saintly. It's all more than a bit disingenuous. For Eminem the rapper, this is somewhat risky proposition, because in discarding his real-life thug image in favor of the role of virtuous hero, he may ingratiate himself to a legion of new fans who like his sensitive side, but he may just as easily end up compromising the well-cultivated bad-ass persona that has led to his success.  That's because in terms of pure rawness, 8 Mile is closer to a Disney flick than it is to one by Harmony Korine. But then again, as a giant love letter to himself, '8 Mile' was bound to feel more like a fluff piece than a candid window into his life. It portrays him as a persecuted, mythical hero type who has to overcome insurmountable obstacles in order to transcend his miserable, squalid circumstances. But somehow, it just doesn't seems consistent with his own personality, nor does it make for a very compelling or truthful film. In fact, the script mirrors manipulative crowd-pleasers like Karate Kid and Bloodsport so closely, it feels like they've simply dropped the template onto Eminem's life, inserted rap contests instead of Martial arts, and voila, you have instant mass appeal. 8 Mile is competently executed adolescent fare that is designed to capitalize on the current popularity of a modern icon using a well-trodden formula. As a film, it is both well-produced and unoriginal. Which would be quite consistent with his music, I suppose."

","I just came from the world premiere of ""8 Mile"", Eminem's much anticipated semi-autobiographical hip-hop flick twenty minutes ago.<br/><br/>First of all, the film was a huge hit with the audience, with several spontaneous ovations for E's character (Bunny Rabbitt) when he rhymes (not enough) in the film.  Although you could dub the showing a love-in (many devoted fans were in attendance) the film definitely held its own.<br/><br/>The Toronto Film Festival is best when its films show you a world you will never know, and 8Mile definitely did that.  It showcases life in central Detroit, which rivals Liverpool England for social mobility, and hip hop in general.  In order for hiphop to completely cross over, it needs to provide its middle-of-the-road audience with some touchstones that they can understand.  This film does that, and, thus, is more of a cultural event than a film.<br/><br/>The film itself is fine, with excellent acting (E and Kim Bassinger) direction and cinematography, and a script that keeps you interested, even if the story is something we've all seen before.  It would have been nice if there could have been a deeper message than one of individual inspiration and strength.  I keep thinking of all the sad lives Bunny Rabbit must have left behind after he ""made it"", but this is an American film, so don't look for any Marxist messages of inspiration here.<br/><br/>8Mile is the definitive hiphop film, but it only offers as much insight into the big picture of American life as Elvis' films did.

","8 Mile (2002): Dir: Curtis Hanson / Cast: Eminem, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Pfifer, Taryn Manning: Title regards a dividing line between the black and white turf but that barely represents the story. Eminem debuts as a white rapper who frequents a club that specializes in rap wars but he freezes and is jeered off stage. He works at a press factory and lives with his mother in a trailer. Plot is in the tradition of Saturday Night Fever with a Rocky conclusion where doors are closed instead of opened. Despite its repetitious structure director Curtis Hanson examines the world of rap. Hanson has made far better movies such as L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys, which are far more creative narrative wise than this. It celebrates the celebrity of Eminem who seems to be quoting the roles played within the earlier mentioned films. It isn't a bad performance but it just seems like he is treading where other stars have traveled. Mekhi Pfifer as Future runs the club and that pretty much sums it up for him. Kim Basinger as Eminem's drunken mother is predictable. She will argue with Eminem before he deals with his abusive lover, etc. Brittany Murphy is unnecessary girlfriend and although the role may be a quote from his life, she still comes off as a pointless outsider. Instead of analyzing rap and hip-hop music it plays off Eminem's rants against society. Score: 1 / 10"

","Much of the action in 8 MILE takes place at ""slam poetry"" competitions. The best way to describe these events as they are portrayed in the movie is to envision a bunch of over-sized children, standing around a garage/clubhouse, pretending to be Don Rickles spouting insults in the form of obscenity-laden Dr. Seuss rhymes to the pounding rhythms of bad disco; not so much as comedy routines, but as a form of warfare designed to humiliate and degrade an opponent. Rap -- music for people with no musical talent performed for people with no musical appreciation -- has taken the art of poetry and left it beaten and bleeding in the gutter. An art form created to extol on the beauty of life and to reveal the innermost sentiments of the poet has become a popular entertainment composed of superficial crudity, anger and mean-spirited verbal sadism. <br/><br/>Eminem, the great white hope of rap, adds at least one extra element to the mix: Self pity.<br/><br/>Obviously, I don't ""get"" rap. As poetry, it is as complicated as nursery rhymes, without the innocence. The lyrics tend toward the hateful and condescending, a tough-guy attempt to justify poetry by turning it into a weapon. Melodically, its seems to depend on a pounding beat, which quickly becomes monotonous. And those who defend it as an urban art form, a from-the-streets poetry that cannot be divorced from the racial and social roots from which it sprang, seem to be making a desperate attempt to overlook the inherent racism, sexism and homophobia of the material. If you criticize the message, you're criticizing the source; i.e., to hate rap is to reveal yourself as a racist. <br/><br/>Into this milieu came Eminem, a.k.a. Marshall Mathers, a white boy in a black man's game. Unlike his predecessor, the artificially flavored poser Vanilla Ice, Mathers could at least claim to be from the streets. And apparently he is good at his craft, though personally I can't tell good rap from bad rap. But, it seems his main contribution is that he legitimized rap for white audiences; primarily white, middle-class teenage boys who feel they can now do the ""black"" thing and not look too foolish (though Justin Timberlake, disproves this). Eminem became sort of the Pat Boone of rap. But, being white, Eminem could still be criticized for his racism, sexism and homophobia by critics who would feel uncomfortably politically incorrect doing the same about black rap. Presumably, minorities have a right to bigotry that whites don't. <br/><br/>Anyway, that is where 8 MILE comes in. It seems to be an attempt to legitimize Eminem as a more mainstream celebrity -- to clean up his image, in much the same way PRIVATE PARTS tried to make Howard Stern look like a swell guy. To its credit, the film doesn't try to give us a major whitewash, preferring instead to perpetuate Eminem's prepackaged image as an embittered rebel. The film has been compared to Prince's PURPLE RAIN, but it perversely has more in common with The Beatles' A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. That landmark musical took The Beatles image of being impish pranksters and joyous musicmakers and centered it in a pseudo-biographical slice of life comedy. Eminem's film does the same in the other direction, placing his crafted image as a put-upon, angst-ridden, victimized teenager against a pseudo-biographical backdrop of urban depression. It is telling that while The Beatles sang about love and longing, Eminem's repertoire seems to consist largely self-pitying rants about how miserable his life is. He seems to appeal to the same core audience that identifies with Holden Caulfield and reads ""The Catcher in the Rye"" repeatedly -- assuming, of course, that Eminem's fans actually read. <br/><br/>I don't know just how accurate the film is, but I do have trouble believing that improvised poetry sessions would attract large numbers of disenfranchised urban youths, or that a largely black audience would get all charged up over hearing a white boy spouting badly rhyming verses filled with references to ""Leave it to Beaver."" The film's genius is that even though it is yet another story designed to show white superiority -- even when invading a uniquely African-American culture -- it makes the white boy appear to be the victim of the racism. <br/><br/>As for Eminem, I don't see any long term cinematic success for him. Though he wears the persona comfortably, there just aren't that many roles for mopey, dopey, petulant, perpetually unhappy twentysomething teenaged boys. The film itself will find its place as a cultural oddity and as fodder for trivia games: i.e., What is the only Oscar nominated song not to be performed at the Awards show because of its use of obscenities? Answer: Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"" -- which, by the way, is the only Oscar-winning song to include the word ""vomit."" That says something right there."

","I cant understand what has happened to movies. Movies that not that long ago would got review ratings of 4-5 are now getting 8+ to 9. Changing lanes, Panic Room, etc.. and now this junk called 8 Mile. First off, Mathers cant act. Im sorry but he's being spoon fed by the director the whole time. thats not acting. and from i've seen lately, who cant act now days? It seems any rapper that gets a movie made is a ""natural"" and comes off the screen with this presence,etc... There's no doubt that Mathers would not have even got a try out for this or any other movie unless is was has big in ""music"" as he is so that pretty much tells you what he shouldnt be doing. Norton, Crowe, and even Cruise have nothing to worry about from Mathers, but the fate of the movie biz does! If Citizen Kane, 2001, etc.. are 10's then how on Earth can Signs,Panic Room, 8 Mile be 8's and 9's? Whats wrong with that picture?"
"jimbo-53-186511","5","2","5","23 April 2013"," A few good moments, but generally disappointing
","8 mile certainly started out interesting - we begin with Jimmy 'B Rabbit Smith' played by Eminem practicing rapping in front of a mirror. He then takes part in a 'rap battle' which he doesn't win as he 'chokes' or doesn't say anything. After the initial rap battle we start to learn a bit more about him and the problems that he faces - his girlfriend Janeane has dumped him, he's in a dead end job, he's forced to live with his mother and step father in their trailer park home and that his mother is facing eviction from her home. Whilst 8 mile started out great, I also had a lot of problems with the film which I'll attempt to explain one by one;<br/><br/>1) Jimmy's crew - they consisted of David 'Future' Porter, Cheddar Bob, & Sol George. OK, I can understand Porter being part of this film, but what purpose did the other two crew members serve? They were just spare parts and I think they were only there to make up the numbers. The other issue is that these 3 characters weren't developed at all (I had to go back to the cast list as I forgot what they were called as I think their names were only mentioned once maybe)<br/><br/>2) Music over dialogue - I realise that a lot of films have 'background' music whilst actors are having conversations, but to me the volume of the music during the conversations in 8 mile was ridiculously loud. At times, I couldn't hear what was being said so I tried turning the volume up but it just became unbearable. The conversations were doubtfully of any significance, but even so I found it very distracting and it made my head hurt.<br/><br/>3) Pointless and unnecessary scenes - what was the point of the scene where Jimmy and his crew are driving round and randomly shooting at people? It served no purpose and just added an extra 10 minutes to the running time which could have been spent more constructively by developing some characters in the film. Then later setting fire to an 'abandoned house' as they believe a rapist lived there. Whilst in this instance, I understand that they did this because a 'rapist' used to live there and wanted to destroy it, but I still didn't see the point in including it in the film.<br/><br/>4) The dialogue - hearing the words 'dawg' and 'man' every 2 minutes quickly became irritating. I know that's how rappers talk, but couldn't the writers have been more subtle?<br/><br/>5) Alex - I thought that her character was fairly poorly written. Once introduced to Jimmy, she tells him that she thinks that he's a good rapper and that he'll go far. The 2 of them have sex, fall out, she then has sex with another man (who is a rival from another rapping troop) and Jimmy catches her out and beats up the other bloke. Afterwards, she comes and sees Jimmy at his place of work, announces she's leaving but says she's going to the club and hopes to see him there. Jimmy decides to go to the club to perform the 'rap battle' and seems to be OK with Alex. Have I missed something? This is the women who we all thought he was falling for who slept with another man and got caught out by Jimmy and didn't even say 'Sorry' and then Jimmy acts as if nothing happened. This just seemed odd and both Alex and Jimmy came across as false in my opinion.<br/><br/>I didn't completely hate 8 mile and there were a few good moments. I enjoyed the 'rap battles' (particularly between Jimmy and the lunch truck rapper (played by Xzibit) and I liked the rap sequence that Jimmy and Porter did to sweet home alabama - I thought that was funny and clever. Eminem's acting was actually pretty good (much better than I thought it would be) and Kim Basinger also put in a good performance as Stephanie Smith (Jimmy's mother). Eminem's character Jimmy was the only character who was properly developed and thankfully his character was at least a fairly likable person (otherwise my rating would be even lower). He looked after his family, worked hard and was a decent person. The only problem was on a few occasions his fists were 5 seconds ahead of his brain. I gave it 5/10, mainly for Eminem's character and the 'rap battles'"

","After the classic ""Slim Shady"" and ""Marshall Mathers"" LPs, Eminem hit the Hollywood show biz button with ""The Eminem Show"" (album) and ""8 Mile"" (film). The film is tailor made for the White Rapper. Eminem (as Jimmy ""B Rabbit"" Smith) blows a ""Rap Battle"", hangs with his Detroit 'hoodies, and nails slutty Brittany Murphy (as Alex). Eminem wants to be a Big Rap Star. He lives with trailer park trashy mother Kim Basinger (as Stephanie) and lil' blonde sista Chloe Greenfield (as Lily). Ms. Basinger gets to say the line, ""Greg won't go down on me."" Word way up...<br/><br/>Curiously, Eminem does not sport his familiar (at the time) short, bleached do; instead, he wears a knit hat over more natural brown locks. Eminem doesn't contribute any rent money, but he works hard. He is careful to avoid drugs, unlike boozy mother Basinger. Who knew Detroit's ""8 Mile"" was so drug free? The soundtrack highlights are ""Lose Yourself"" and a fun rap-up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Sweet Home Alabama"", which comes off better here than on ""youtube"". Still, Eminem's pre-Hollywood studio work is much more highly recommended than this semi-autobiographical movie sanitization.<br/><br/>*** 8 Mile (2002) Curtis Hanson ~ Eminem, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy"
"Nitemareb4xmas000","6","2","5","5 March 2006"," It's OK, but not Excellent
","I know people might stereotype Eminem as an eminent bastard trying to make himself into the ghetto (hence the name Eminem). It's compelling to some degree because it not what everyone to relate to or even understand. Some parts of the movie don't make sense because they're rather plot holes. The conflict of his girlfriend is vague. There is really no artistic base to this movie. It seems to me that this movie may be attracted to teenagers who dress ghetto and where highly pricey clothes than opposed to a classier audience. The struggle gave a boring reflection because Eminem didn't really capture any feelings towards this character. It's so static that it seems that nothing affected him at all. ""Lose Yourself"" is just another song for teenage wannabe/premadonnas with no life. To me, I'm rather a person with culture. So I'm not to fond in the hip-hop world. The artistic business should wait awhile to introduce hip-hop as a cultural color to the American painting. No offense, but hip-hop is a cultural waste because it's talking about prostitutes and killing, and how it's fun. I don't think 8 Mile is up to a general standard."
"silvercreature","4","2","5","9 January 2005"," wow, this was boring
","Firstly, let me just say that I don't have anything against Eminem. I'm not a fan of his, really, but, as far as hip-hop goes, I like him more than most other artists.<br/><br/>The hype for this movie when it first came out, was, of course, ridiculous. Eminem was riding the wave of his popularity so it was clear that a lot of people were excited to see this film. I wonder how they felt after seeing it. I didn't see it in theatres in that I wasn't interested in the slightest and wound up seeing it after it came out on video. A friend of mine who is a HUGE Eminem fan immediately bought it and forced me and another friend to watch it with him. Well, I can sort of understand why people have compared this movie to Rocky, as it tells the story of underdog living in a tough situation and eventually overcoming some sort of adversity, but everything in 8 Mile just seems so over the top while, astonishingly at the same time, bland. I mean, no wonder the audience feels inclined to root for Rabbit - the guy is surrounded on all sides by a bunch of complete pricks. Even the girl he starts to get involved with turns out to be a worthless skank who never even cared about him.<br/><br/>As for how the movie is put together, each scene is a weak ripoff of scenes we've seen in lots of other movies. And the whole vibe is so stagnant - nothing really evolves or changes in this movie - not even Rabbit. Unlike other underdog movies, there's no real sense of improvement on the part of the protagonist - i don't know exactly what it is that gives Rabbit the courage and ability to suddenly start rapping well. At first, he chokes, but then, when the stakes increase, he doesn't. I'm not really sure why. There's no montage of him practicing, really. He just scribbles some words on the bus and spends the rest of his time goofing around with his moron friends and being beaten up.<br/><br/>In the end, he succeeds only on the most mediocre of levels and brings about literally no change in his life. Everything basically remains the same as when the movie started. Perhaps Rabbit has gained some valuable life experience but the whole thing sure was underwhelming. Not to mention tedious.<br/><br/>The rap battles were cool enough, I suppose, but lacked the intensity and drama of something like a boxing match (a movie boxing match like in the Rocky movies anyway) and by the time of the final battle, I can't see how anyone watching could really care anymore. There wasn't really anything about it that separated it from the ones we'd seen before. And nothing particularly significant seemed to be at stake - not even credibility. It was pretty apparent at the movie's ""conclusion"" that Rabbit still had his share of enemies and doubters, even after his victory. He wasn't suddenly regarded with more respect, his ex girlfriend was still the same whore and his mom the same alcoholic loser. I suppose this all makes the movie more realistic but it also makes it disappointing and dull. Well, it was already pretty dull.<br/><br/>If you really like Eminem, then you'll be happy to see a movie where he's not only the main character, but a character that closely resembles himself in real life. Otherwise, I really can't see the point in watching this crap. The underdog story has been done before and done better. As far as making a movie about the hip-hop world goes, maybe they should give it another go. This time, they could try to refrain from using tired clichÃ©s, hateful characters and bland plots and subplots.<br/><br/>Another movie that takes advantage of an individual's popularity at a given time to make you give a damn that turns out only to be a waste of time that will most likely annoy and bore you simultaneously. Go Hollywood."

","`B-Rabbit' (Eminem) is a young man living in a poor district of Detroit. He spend his time working as a worker in a sheet-metal stamping press for parts of cars and with his four friends, participating in raps and hip-hop competitions. He dreams on being successful with music and consequently leaving that poor area of Detroit. He is living temporarily with his mother Stephany (a Kim Basinger without any glamour) and his young sister Lily. He meets Alex (the charming Brittany Murphy) and starts dating with her. The climax of this movie is the dispute of rap in the end of the plot between B-Rabbit and the Free World group. I myself expected much more of this movie than offered. It is not a bad film, but it is very related to Afro-Americans culture. There is one great aspect to be highlighted in this movie: Hollywood loves to show these ghettos of poor people as places where only drug dealers, bandits and criminals live. This movie redeems these poor areas, showing simple, honest and working people fighting for survival and having some fun. Further, his rap dispute, as a type of social relief valve, is also interesting: men and women fighting with words, trying to defeat the weakest. Music as a weapon! I do not follow the work of Eminem, but his performance has also surprised me: his cool character is great. All the cast performs an excellent acting. I myself like Brittany Murphy very much and Kim Basinger surprised me without any charming, as a drunken and looser mother. My vote is six."

The tiny details are well taken care of.<br/><br/>But that's where I draw the line.<br/><br/>I couldn't agree with the plot. We never understand why winning a rap contest means so much for B-Rabbit. If it's held weekly, then it shouldn't be such a big deal to lose and/or win. Even in the film, he loses one week to win in another. B-Rabbit's goals do not make sense at all. Some of B-Rabbit's actions in the film doesn't make sense, either.<br/><br/>And the antagonists don't get much character development at all. They don't even say much at all. There are only a few lines spoken by the ""boss"" in the entire film. How can I understand the antagonist(s) if they don't even speak?<br/><br/>The ending itself feels a bit...empty. B-Rabbit wins a rap contest, but his situation is still the same. He got a lucky break but he could be in the same spot next week.

","The first time I heard of the rapper Eminem, was in the year 2000 when I listened to the song, ""The Real Slim Shady"". At first I thought the voice was really awkward. Can some really have that much of a nasal voice?<br/><br/>But the legend that is Eminem lives on. I had my doubts about seeing his movie debut in the 2002, titled ""8 Mile"" because over the course of history, various hip-hop and rap artists tried to expand their horizons and try out their acting chops to prove that they are not one-trick ponies. But over the course of time, each performer had failed. But after getting a mixed reception from the critics, I decided to see the movie myself and be the judge if this movie was good or if it was pure dog poop. <br/><br/>In my opinion, ""8 Mile"" is good enough to purchase on DVD and for if you can't decipher hip-hip lingo, I would strongly advise you to caption the English subtitles to get a better understanding of the words being said. The film itself succeeds in keeping it real, plus everything looks authentic and never once does it feel forced or even contrived. I think it deserves to be seen many times and to me this movie holds a special place in my heart. Director Curtis Hanson has made many iconic films like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"". Here in ""8 Mile"" he gives it everything he's got and not once does the movie feel like a letdown. <br/><br/>The main man that holds this film together is Eminem. His role as Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. is the definitive anti-hero. He's got a bit of a mean streak in him and seems to have the neurotic pleasures in talking trash and picking fights with people, only to lose most of them. His romantic scene with Alex (Brittany Murphy) was only on briefly while he was a working at an auto plant in the heart of Detroit (cliche). If you think this movie will have the predictable, formulaic conclusion where everything comes up roses for Rabbit, you are all out on a limb. <br/><br/>Eminem is not the only one carrying the weight here, the supporting cast is also equally poignant. One of the more notable supporters include Mekhi Phifer who plays the part as Future, who comes across as Rabbit's mentor and sort of a father-figure to Rabbit. Evan Jones is very likable as Cheddar Bob,a crew member who's funny, even though he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But the real scene stealing comes from the decrepit city of Detroit itself. The landscapes depicted here showcase some of the bleakest ever put on celluloid. It's been said that this movie was shot at the infamous 313 so I'm heard. <br/><br/>On DVD the extras are not very impressive. For one thing, the ""making of"" features are not anything worthwhile because they're on for only 10 minutes and very little contribution is delivered by Eminem. I was however, impressed by the soundtrack listings where you can go over to the scene where each song is featured. In that is in sync to the free style rap battles that happens in this movie. <br/><br/>The behind the scenes look at the freestyle battles that occur in ""8 Mile"" are quite stunning. It has a bit of an ""American Idol"" like atmosphere as four extras try to duke it out with the ""King of Rap"" himself Eminem. What makes this feature poignant is that this scene never made the final cut. This addition in the DVD holds it's merits as we see first and forehand just how dynamic and witty Eminem really is and he is the ""King of Rap""."

","When pop stars make films, these are often based of fictionalised versions of themselves, and Eminem's effort, '8 Mile', is no exception. But there are some things that make this movie more intriguing than most in the genre: firstly, his life story, a white kid growing up in a poor, mostly black district of Detroit who became a major rap star, is genuinely interesting; secondly, the director, Curtis Hanson, is a cut above the typical director of such an effort. And the film delivers on most of this promise: Eminem actually acts quite well, and the decayed environment of urban Detroit is a grimly fascinating slice of America relatively rarely depicted in the movies. As for the rapping, even if you don't like this music in general (and it's aggressive, misogynistic tendencies are very much on display), the idea of tongue-tied street kids finding their voice in spontaneous performance makes for an entertaining narrative. The film is quite long, however, and a little shapeless - unlike Eminem's real life story, there's no fairytale ending. The film obviously needed a real rapper to make it work, but this is no empty star vehicle, but a grimy and unglamourous film about life on the underside of the U.S.A."

As the text continued to roll across my screen, I began listening to it more intently, and then, as half a minute or so passed, I realised I was probably listening to it as intently as I had ever done so any previous Eminem track that I'd previously caught through whatever means. Against most odds, and this is the startling thing, I actually came to begin to rather enjoy listening to it; actually came to begin to rather enjoy listening to the pace and tempo of the thing; actually came to rather enjoy the pace and rhythm of what I was hearing combined with what it was I had just seen in the film itself, something I was still in an immediate process of digesting anyway. Such a moment caught me off guard, but told me deep down that 8 Mile had worked.<br/><br/>Eminem is an American rap artist whose successes around the turn of the 2000's somewhat lingers in the backgrounds of my memory.

I'd heard the guy's music, but didn't pay an awful lot of attention to it; the tracks striking me as more often than not just a lot of angry talking, bordering on ranting, in a rapid manner which was peppered by four lettered words that became even harder to decipher when your only true exposure to it was listening to ""Real Slim Shady"" on the radio during Sunday's Top 40 count-down – this a weekly occurrence that always saw the whole thing cut to ribbons out of censorship anyway. Curtis Hanson's 8 Mile puts all of these things aside and tells a cutting tale of a man, whom does not share Eminem's true-to-life name but is nevertheless an interesting case of what appears to be an example of pseudo-biopic film-making, with a passion and a skill slowly finding his forte with such things whilst learning of some harsh realities along the way.<br/><br/>Hanson begins proceedings in a grotty public lavatory in a dingy night club, at least it looks like a night club, because the young and rather innocuously named Jimmy Smith is there practising for the building's true purpose: to host these things called rap-battles that pit two guys on stage and has them face off with each other via their lyrical abilities so as to verbally shoot the other one down. Our Smith, stage-named B-Rabbit and played by Eminem, stares at a cracked mirror amidst the filth, a literal reflection of a man whose skills and place in this world at this point are unfixed. He exits for the stage, a lone Caucasian amidst many African-Americans, upon winning the toss of the the coin, he concedes to go second in what is a defensive act that sees him on the way to ""choking"" and leaving embarrassed and beaten having been unable to get started.<br/><br/>Hanson paints an enlightening and rarefied image of this underworld of rhymes and egotisms, his general locale is pent-up and aggressive with one looking to get the better over any one other; but it is not necessarily an existence imbued with violence and criminal gamesmanship, rather, rap battle duels are limited to that of verbally berating the opponent in a controlled manner in a specified zone most can occupy. This is a world full of young, impetulant youths angry and embittered and yet words, not guns, often drive the hostilities; words whose perpetrators must think creatively and logically so as to formulate and be able to use as ammunition to force victory. These face-offs carry with them concealed aggression, but are calculated and organised in a methodical and mature manner: if you win the consensus of your audience, you head through to the next round in a tennis-bracket inspired set up. By day, Smith is a factory worker with a hard-up boss and dreams of being a rap star, the lyrics to his tunes of which he scrawls down on his palms so as to remember. Work seemingly consists of walking a few feet every so often in a steel-mill and hitting a button before waiting a few seconds and repeating the process; his bus rides to this place are fraught with roadside iconography establishing his dishevelled roots here, in 1995 Michigan; streets consisting of seedy looking bars and such that are shut down but probably not looking too dissimilar now to what they resembled when they were open and thriving.<br/><br/>The presence of Smith's mother Stephanie played by Kim Basinger, working with the director again after L.A. Confidential, and her daughter Lilly (Greenfield), whom she had with a temperamental Michael Shannon character named Greg Buehl, pepper proceedings. These people face eviction from their trailer park home, as Stephanie strives to win big at Bingo and provides Smith with extra incentive to succeed at his dream. Brewed in amidst all of this is Brittany Murphy's character Alex, the object of most of the men's gaze and Smith's constantly on/off girlfriend in what is a strand that amply supports the primary content. But Hanson's film is first and foremost the tale of Smith chasing his dream of becoming a musician, a goal verbally reiterated early on by a connected character whose monologue on demo tapes and such lays things out and allows Eminem's character to undergo a transition beginning and ending on the stage which rejects the initial paths it alludes to us it will venture down, in what is a well made and intriguingly downplayed drama in spite of the lead's raging fame."

","I was surprised how good ""8 Mile"" was, really. I thought this was going to be another one of those ""rapper's road from rags to riches"" type of films. And let me tell you something, this is NOT the case here. It's just a very good drama. I love the realism in this film, and the fact that it avoids cliché's. There is no big-time gangsters with big guns here, there is no certain way for big time success - it's about hard life of young men in the poorest parts of Detroit. Unlike 99% of the rappers out there (50 Cent being the best example), Eminem actually did a good job with his role, and he did show some emotion range. It would be interesting to see him in another film in the future, I think he has some acting talent... The supporting cast is very strong, and I think that helped Eminem too (although I agree that Kim Basinger's acting wasn't really convincing). The film itself is dark, realistic, down to earth. There isn't really a bad guy, and even the main characters' rivals The Free World crew aren't that awful. The freestyle battles were really impressive, you could see that a Lot of thought was put into that part of the film, especially the last 15 minutes. All throughout the story, you get to hear that every says Eminem's character is such a great rapper, but you barely hear it. Until the end of the movie, where the big battles go through, and then you actually see what his character is all about. Although Britanny Murphy's character's motives weren't clear, I liked that about her, because that's sometime how life is. You cannot always tell what a girl or a man actually want. I thought that all of the characters had depth in them, they were definitely not one-dimensional. By the way this is not supposed to be Eminem's biography, it's just based on some experiences he had growing up in Detroit. I really cannot understand how could anyone compare ""8 Mile"" to that piece of trash excuse for a movie ""Get Rich or Die Trying"". 8 Miles is heads and shoulders above the second film I mentioned, and to me it's the best rap movie behind ""Huslte and Flow"". I definitely recommend this movie, not only to Eminem fans (I am not a fan too). I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. It's not really a rap movie, come to think of it. It's a movie about life, about struggle, about finding the way to make your life better, rather than getting stuck in one place. And isn't that something we all search for?..."

Some people get the wrong impression with some of the lryical contents he seems to project, or maybe are put off by the way he raps because of the bad examples that may influence children that are young and want to have the same attitude towards life. But lets be realistic here,times have changed and life has changed,and we all got to admit that films,music and everything in society has changed as well teenagers and adults know that,they experience some dramatic situations,they know what is going on out there and that times got hard and life always becomes more and more complicated. but lets put his music aside and talk about the true meaning of this movie. although it is mainly about hip hop culture and eminems lifestyle,there is a positive message which a lot of us can relate to. a lot might not understand whats so positive about this movie because they don't want to face the real facts of life and keep themselves close minded,but on watching this movie who has an open mind and knows that everything in life requires sacrifice or lets even say practice and if you are in a hard situation you gotta see what your main options are and find out if you can create something with your talent or call it a gift,whatever and eminems talent was rapping and letting loose his angry moments which im sure every each and every one of us have.and this isn't easy, there are lots of fish in the sea that have what your skills require,so you really got to work hard at it and be original, sharp and motivated,keep on thinking positive even when the rainy days come,in fact when they come struggle harder, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.in his first battle he knew that he was capable of doing what he was set up to do but he felt the tension of being rejected. his friends knew he had what it takes to be a great mc and one of them in particular wanted him to show and prove to himself that he can make it, he believed in him till the end,he knew he was going through a rough time and supported him mentally and phisically.and the second time he entered the battle he proved to himself and everyone around him that he had what it takes to be a perfectionist when it comes to hip hop,and that is a satisfaction and proof that you can do anything you set your mind to.and the lesson here is not to give up,or let go of an opportunity that comes your way, believe in yourself, and that is why i give this movie a 9 out of 10"

","I'm a big fan of Eminem and his music, and this movie looked appealing in the fact I assumed it would be based more so on his life and experiences then it actually was. The story line lacked direction and focus, and it was basically just a bunch of rappers from the wrong side of the tracks, trying to make music, and get into fights. You see very little emotion from Em, a.k.a. ""Jimmy Smith"", and I thought his performance was a little weak in comparison to the persona he plays out in his music and videos. I guess I came in with expectations that differed from the movie. I knew it wasn't an actual bio-flick in a sense, that it was only LOOSELY based on Em's life, but I thought there'd be a lot more to it, like maybe his relationships, his daughter. In fact, I thought Lily was supposed to be Hailie at first......LOL. They never really tell you who she is, and I'm assuming a sibling (?) And who exactly is Alex? And Janean? The point is, a bio-flick would have been a lot more interesting because of the controversial nature of Marshall Mathers and his music, and this movie was only a glimpse into that life. So, case in point, it was a bit boring. It didn't show what became of his trials and efforts, and ended rather LOOSELY, if you can call that an ending. I know it left me thinking, ""WTF""? But, if you're into a lot of fighting, swearing, and some poorly written rap music, it's a good flick. If you're looking for something with substance, I'd recommend ""Walk the Line"". That's my opinion......we welcome yours......LOL."

What I also liked about the film was the music. I am a big rap music fan and i think they did a good job putting together all of the music.I think they made a great portrayal of Detroit and what life is like for people growing up poor.This film is truly an underrated masterpiece that people need to see.I think that people who don't like rap music still would enjoy this film because this movie has a lot more elements then just rap.

Kim Basinger was OK too, though she had better roles in previous films.<br/><br/>The musical scenes in the movie are a real treat for rap & hip hop fans, as well as R&B fans. There is also a handful of classic & old school hip hop songs playing in the backgrounds of certain scenes, which would definitely be good for the hip hop fans.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't disappointing, but it wasn't so great either. It was a good film to see, and it's even better when you have the DVD with all its special features. However, don't expect this movie to be over-the-top, because it isn't.

Earlier, when it came out, I heard good criticism about it, but Somewhere in the back of my head I thought, how can a rapper 'story of my life' be good? So I never saw it. Now I've seen it and the movie confirmed my earlier thoughts. I wanted to like the movie, because I admire someone who is afraid to seize an opportunity (because it's scary to expose yourself!) but who did in the end. I also like Eminem and his 'Lose yourself' has often accompanied me when training for a marathon.<br/><br/>But the clichés! The story is the way it is, I don't mind, but did everything need to be in a way that you knew exactly what would be coming the next moment? Had the characters been a little more subtle, the movie could have been good, but the lines were cheesy, the people-people interactions were cheesier, and the cheesiest were the outbursts of anger and the sex scenes. Didn't the director had the nerve to tell miss Murphy she looked like a suffocated dog on heroin in that sex scene!? Sigh. I wasn't impressed with her acting skills either. When comparing the movie to another 'true story', Monster, there is so much more depth in the latter movie compared to this one.

I just have a problem with Brittany Murphy's role in the movie. She had zero character development, except that she was a slut (ooh, what a surprise! I'm not talking about the actress. I love Brittany Murphy.) She was basically in the movie for one long disgusting sex scene which I fast-forwarded through and then some vague lines about ""I have a feeling about you.""

"Spleen","Null","1","2","24 March 2003"," We have a new winner.
","""8 Mile"" has recently won the most questionable Oscar of all time.<br/><br/>The worst that can be said of previous Oscar decisions is that they've been aesthetically misguided: ""Hamlet"" (1948) being awarded Best Picture despite being inferior to ""The Red Shoes""; ""Forrest Gump"" winning the same award despite being no good at all; that type of thing. There have also been one or two doubtful procedural decisions. Denzel Washington won Best Lead Actor even though he wasn't, in fact, the lead actor of the film he won the award for - but whether or not he was the lead is itself an aesthetic judgment, of sorts, and anyway, it's ARGUABLE that he was the lead, at least to the extent it's arguable that the musical score of ""Chariots of Fire"" is superior to that of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".<br/><br/>But declaring ""Lose Yourself"" to be the best song is to make a simple mistake of classification. ""Lose Yourself"" is not a song. I'm not saying anything against it here. I'm sure it's a very fine piece of rap (and I'm not saying this in a patronising way - I really AM sure it's a fine piece of rap, and what's more, I find myself liking it), just as I'm sure that ""Kubla Khan"" is a fine poem. But anyone who calls either work a song has failed to grasp the meaning of the word. Songs are sung. Rap is rapped. To rap is not to sing.<br/><br/>If I loathed rap in an exaggerated way before seeing ""8 Mile"" it was probably because it had been sold to me as music, and while some (but not all) rap may in fact be music (in a borderline kind of way), its virtues are not musical virtues; and even the most musical rap comes nowhere near to being a form of song. ""8 Mile"" wisely leaves the music side entirely out of it. The impression we get of Detroit here is of a city alive with an artform unlike any other, one combining verbal and vocal dexterity, timing, rhythm, and the ability to cultivate a kind of false truculence. And Rabbit does it differently again. For most of the film he comes across as being inferior to many of those around him. His friends and enemies alike have smoother, more relaxed, in almost every way more impressive delivery; Rabbit comes off as being detatched and studied, so much so that he's almost embarrassingly awkward at first, although his style shows its strengths towards the end.<br/><br/>At least one reviewer claims that ""8 Mile"" shows Eminem not to be honestly expressive after all, and he's right. That's what's refreshing about it. The idea that art should be expressive of the artist, or that the best art is on average more expressive than the worst, or that more expressive art is on average better than less expressive art... well, some of these claims MAY be true, but we'd need to conduct a cunning statistical survey in order to find out. It was the claim that it was ""expressive"" that helped turned me off rap in he first place. I thought I was being told to like bad music on the grounds that (like an anguished scream) it expressed something. ""8 Mile"" shows me that some rap is not so much bad music as good something-else, but rap as a genre probably includes a lot of bad something-else, too, and that stuff is no doubt expressive, too. I like the fact that Eminem's closing song says ""lose yourself"", not ""express yourself"".<br/><br/>I still feel it's something of a waste of a film to give us this vision of Detroit, sketch out for us the virtues and nature of rap, and then mold the material into no particular form, not even that of a struggling artist eventually making it. The story progresses from the point at which Rabbit has stage fright to the point at which he no longer has stage fright. That's it. A lot of other story strands must go nowhere in order for so much good film-making to come to, compared to what's promised, so little.<br/><br/>Despite what you may have heard there's nothing wrong with Eminem's performance. It may be that this is the only role he can play at all, but so long as he plays it well, what business is this of ours?"

I was disappointed that Brittany Murphy had such a small insignificant role, given the way the movie was advertised.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger was also good, although there were a couple of moments where I found her accent not convincing enough (it wasn't THAT bad).<br/><br/>The movie was well shot and the sound was done well.  I liked the handheld, sweeping feel and the dirty, brown PD and cinematography was quite suitable to the setting (Detroit).  It reminded me a bit of ""Ali"".  As I've mentioned, the acting was good (I would go so far as to say some of it, including from Eminem, was excellent).  Dialogue was good - and not just in the rapping.<br/><br/>The humour was good.  I found myself laughing, however most of this was at Eminem (rabbit)'s words in the finale.<br/><br/>The only thing that I think caused a number of problems was the story.  With a more original, more structured story, with better conflict and resolution, and cause and effect, the movie could have been better.<br/><br/>The characters in the group were not well developed and were based on trite stereotypes - the white, stupid guy provided comic relief (as does the fat guy), the taller intelligent guy with glasses spent the movie saying things that were supposedly 'intellectual', and so on.  The characters in the rival gang 'free world' seemed to be even more devoid of personality.<br/><br/>However, the good direction, art, sound and technical quite an enjoyable movie.

Eminem is not bad in the film. He gives that raw type of performance that studios and directors look for when they put singers(!) in films. The film does have a gritty and dirty look about it that I found effective and of course, the big competition at the end! It was exciting and fun. I was very entertained by the rap competition, in fact I think it made the whole film work. Like the big match at the end of ""The Karate Kid"". But I did have some problems. Kim Basinger is horribly miscast as his mother. She doesn't work, lives in a trailer home and of course dates some worthless bum. Brittany Murphy plays the cheapest, filthiest whore since Jennifer Jason Leigh in ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"". Her character really has no redeeming quality and I felt like I needed a shower after her character was onscreen. And all the dumb dialogue...Yo Dawg! The shooting with the paintball gun I thought was a backfire for the makers of the film.

","When music stars make the transition to movie making, the results have been eclectic to say the least. David Bowie was surreal in the mind-bending Labyrinth, Madonna has been decent in her movies in general (With the exception of the panned Swept Away), and there was the dreadful Crossroads with Britney Spears. S Club 7 Seeing Double was another example of a shocking attempt at bridging the gap between music and film.<br/><br/>Bearing all this in mind it would be highly understandable to be somewhat skeptical of 8 Mile given it stars Eminem in his first big-screen role. The supporting cast is hardly strong (With the exception of Kim Basinger) clearly designed to give him the limelight, so ultimately the quality of the movie depends on him. However, the doubters, after watching this, would surely be willing to consume humble pie because 8 Mile is a thoroughly enthralling story which is universally well acted and extremely well directed.<br/><br/>Eminem is essentially himself in this, though his name is Rabbit. He plays a trailer-trash young man who's locked in the slums by circumstance, and who is trying to use rap/hip hop as a vehicle to escape. Sure, it's been done before, albeit not this exact setting, but the lack of originality in premise is more than made up for by the quality of the acting, and the way the story is told. In his first film, Eminem is breathtaking. Yes, he might not have had to do a lot of research into the part due to his clear familiarity with the situation, but just because he empathises with it does not automatically make him a good actor in front of a camera.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a rap battle, where 2 rappers try to outwit each other in front of an audience. Rabbit is up next but freezes on stage and experiences ridicule from his peers as a result. The rest of the movie sees him struggle to make ends meet, hold down a job, keep his family together, attempt to regain his reputation and all the while never being sure what tomorrow holds.<br/><br/>Britney Murphy plays his love interest, but it isn't exactly a match made in heaven and the story does a good job of conveying her as apparently out of his league initially before making us realise she's the same as the rest of them, albeit with a hint of glamour.<br/><br/>Director Curtis Hanson does a terrific job with this film, making it fast and dynamic, but not too quick as to be incomprehendable, though he *is* guilty of slightly overdoing the stereotyping, which is prominent throughout.<br/><br/>Generally it is extremely worth seeing, and although the ending is pretty predictable it is still well made.<br/><br/>Good job."

","I really don't know why all the critics are slobbering on themselves over this movie.  I'm not a fan of Eminem, but I don't hate him either.  I guess I really just wanted more of the exciting rap battles and less of the ""life of B.Rabbit"".  I mean, isn't that why people go to movies with musicians in them?  Purple Rain was EXCITING... sure there were the ""Prince's bad home life"" scenes, and ""Prince meets/gets/loses Appolonia"" scenes... but there was also a lot of on-stage action from Prince, Appolonia 6, and The Time that makes Purple Rain a classic.  8 Mile is just too slow for the most part.  No matter how great the last reel is, it doesn't make up for the lackluster majority of the film."

","They almost did it.with the tactically placed billboards all up and down the Base Line.with the theme song that reminisced 'Eye of the Tiger' played over a montage of clips that almost looked like a boxing movie.with all the internet ads on every pop up screen.thinking people began to wonder.'Could it be a good movie?'<br/><br/>A hard life.a troubled past.poverty.bad family.shady girlfriends.pasty-faced kid sisters.what else could explain his degrading, distasteful, yes even disgraceful decent into hip hop? The Man wants to know how he can prevent it from happening again.<br/><br/>The Plot- Eminem plays Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith a young man seemingly from the ""right side of the tracks"" which Detroiters know as neighborhoods north of Eight Mile Rd. However, all is not what it seems for the suburban hero of this film. He lives in a trailer park with a garden variety of ""la garbage blanche"" including his trampy mother and her out of work boyfriend. With only a dead end job in his life, he rests all of his hopes for success in a rap music career. This is the story of one week in Rabbit's life.  The month starts out in humiliation and ends in triumph.<br/><br/>The Acting- No Kudos to Marshall Mathers for believably playing himself. No kudos to academy award winning actress and Georgia Peach Kim Bassinger for playing the hillbilly-esque trailer park dweller with hair that blew in directly from Beverly Hills.  Mekhi Phifer is an exceptional actor who has yet to disappoint me. I even liked him in Clockers.<br/><br/>The Opinion-<br/><br/>I am very proud of the rap element that was introduced in the film. Detroit stepped up and delivered very good performances by members of the Mountain Climbaz, an up and coming Detroit rap group.<br/><br/>It is apparent that Eminem is seeking to prove to the urban culture that he has a right to sing the blues while also validating his decision to ""act black"" to the masses. Futile endeavors. You can't buy cultural acceptance with money but maybe with a few strategically placed sound bytes, (Tupac if you like the West, Notorious if you like the East).<br/><br/>This movie is neither heart wrenching nor powerful enough to change opinions of Eminem. The people that think Eminem is a loser will continue.the people that think that Eminem is a god will continue.the people that don't care will continue.<br/><br/>I had to resist the urge to take offense. First of all the name of the movie should have been called 'Gratiot Ave' because that's all it shows. With the exception of a bus with an Eight Mile sign there was no trace of the base in the film. It will be hard for Mayor Kilpatrick to speak about the growth and development with nothing but scene after scene of abandoned and dilapidated buildings being seen by the whole world. Brian Grazer made Detroit look like Lebanon. Not to mention that the significance of 8 Mile Rd. was not sufficiently explained for the sake of the rest of the country that does not know Detroit's geography.<br/><br/>It is an insult to all the forefathers of rap to make a big deal about the poverty and struggle of one just because he was the first of his kind. Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Tupac Shakur, Common, they were also born poor with crosses to bear some bigger than Eminem's. I can't see too much sympathy coming from the African-American community just because of the impoverished past of a millionaire.<br/><br/>The great Rap Music door was closed to Eminem because he is white and he had to kick it in. That took a lot of courage and determination. Historically, the doors of every other industry and trade have been closed to African-Americans and we have had to kick them open time and time again, generation after generation. Some still kicking in doors even today. And we don't do it for a record deal and millions of dollars. We kicked doors in to feed families and to have a fair chance at a house with a white picket fence and to prove our equality.  Cry me a river Marshall."

","In the movie 8 Mile, directed by Chris Hanson, the obvious theme was standing up and using your voice but it was really about getting up when you've hit the absolute bottom. The main character is actually based off of Eminem, the real life rapper. This story is told in Detroit and he's trying to become a well known rapper. He is only stopped by one thing, his skin color. His white shell causes him to lose ""street cred"" and is disrespected by all of the rap community. They don't believe a white person should be rapping and think that it isn't right for him to join the weekly ""rap offs"". This causes him to go through a lot of pain, emotionally and physically. With his life at home falling apart with his unemployed mother and her drinking addiction, he struggles to keep a steady job and support for his baby sister. He gets jumped and mugged in the streets by the same group that dominates at the rap offs and continues to bully him. He hits a point where it doesn't look good for him and he has hit the absolute bottom. If you've ever been bullied or suppressed at any point in your life then you need to watch this movie as soon as possible."
"DVR_Brale","10","1","3","14 August 2016"," ""It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'""
","Once again I'm not able to write an objective review. I've been listening to Eminem since I was twelve. Many of his lyrics are stored right in my brain. His Infinite from 1996. is what made me a hip-hop fan even to this day.<br/><br/>This autobiographical music drama is going to exhilarate Em's fans as well as hip-hop fans. Some others may find this movie boring or even ridiculous. When it comes to acting Eminem did a pretty good job for a rapper. I remember him speaking how hard he had worked in order to impersonate B-Rabbit. He had very little sleep (maybe few hours a day), took sleeping pills, wrote lyrics on set in spare time, had to drive long mileage to his place and back to the set. His fans know him well: if he's passionate about something he'll act almost like an addict.<br/><br/>Other B-Rabbit's crew members did a solid job in acting. They were fun to watch and looked like they knew each other for years; even his opponents! I can only imagine Em's fans seeing B-Rabbit (Eminem) going toe-to-toe in a rap battle with Lil' Tic (Proof, R.I.P.) who was Eminem's best friend and amazing hype man. His fans know Proof's death almost ruined Em's career and sadly almost ended his life. Seeing them on stage, years after Proof passed away, makes me melancholic about early 2000's when Dre, D12 and Em swept the whole world with funky and violent Slim Shady as a leader. Look at his raw energy when he performed Square Dance (his concert intro theme) on Anger Management Tour 2002! You can clearly see the difference now without Proof. Back to the movie.<br/><br/>When I was a teenage boy I almost fell in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy, R.I.P.). She was just to cute and cool! That short haired blonde girl played B-Rabbits girlfriend and did it amazingly; who can forget her cool, mellow swagger? Kim Basinger played Stephanie Smith, Em's mother he wrote so much about. She played his mother exactly as I had seen her from Em's songs. He's now sorry for writing ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and ""no more plays that song on shows and cringes every time it's on the radio"" (Headlights ft. Nate Ruess). Michael Shannon (now starring in Midnight Special, 2016.) played Greg Buehl, his mother's boyfriend for whom B-Rabbit sings ""He's tapping my mom and we're almost the same age"". In reality, Michale is two years younger that Marshall.<br/><br/>Now the music for which 8 mile won an Oscar. Opening scene hi-hats from Mobb Deep's Shook Ones pt.2 stick with me permanently. Feel Me Flow played by Naughty by Nature as well. What about Outkast's Players Ball, The Pharcyde's Runnin', Wu Tang Clan's C.R.E.A.M, Biggie's Juicy and many others? Not to mention first hip-hop song ever to win Academy Awards - Lose Yourself. 8 mile's soundtrack will delight all hip-hop fans and make them nod their heads.<br/><br/>Story itself will be very familiar to those listening to Em. It's truly inspiring and in that ""stands head, shoulders and heart above other movies made that year"" as Joe Morgenstern from Wall Street Journal notes. It's a story about passion for something. And that's Em's life story. Now, fourteen years after movie was made, Eminem's made such success and has won so many prizes that's it very hard to list all of them. Wikipedia notes he won 155 prizes and was nominated for 311 on them. He's won 15 Grammy awards and was nominated for 43 more. Sold more than 120 million albums. He's now 44 and still doesn't look like giving up or doing something else.<br/><br/>In conclusion: 8 mile is a modern poetry in motion for which hip-hop fans will forever be grateful. Great punch lines and multies in wintry 1995. Detroit? You've gotta love it."

This Movie is not autobiographical, Jimmy this is not Eminem, but as he said ""It was so close to that period of my life, it was crazy"". In Detroit, 8 Mile was the border between the black and the white neighborhoods.Jimmy can rapping, can very good rapping, but it turns this is not enough for success, people were thinking that rap music is only for black people and very hard to convince them of this otherwise. And Jimmy trying to prove that no matter where you come from, whether it's north side or the south side of 8 Mile, you can break out of it if your mentality and drive are right."

All characters (except mentioned rappers when they were arguing in car) and some events are entirely made-up, but still were based on true story. The story of Eminem. The greatest story of hip-hop. I'd easily call this movie the modern time, word based Rocky and whenever I am nervous I always watch this film, watch Jimmy's rap battle struggle or listen to Lose Yourself and it instantly makes me feel better.

","Your black one. Our red blood. So many artists are screaming at us. God is screaming. Trees are yelling. The sky has almost given up on us. The great artist eminem, who chose to remain in the 313, made a movie in the early 00s: ""8 Mile."" I'm from Michigan, an' I know. 8 mile means it's 8 miles from the center of downtown D. <br/><br/>in ""8 Mile"" all the boys who are friends yell at each other every time they are together, jammed into the front seats and back seats of a beater. They yell so much you can hardly understand them, but if you understand what 'f***' means, you can. They caress with punches. Those are the friends. The enemies, they yell at each other too, and they punch for real. Crack, crack, crack go the jaws between them. Blood flowing is the repeated reminder  of blood. When a gun is pulled, however, then it's for real. Whether out of a natural reciprocity even on this level of brutality or out of a hard steel realization that the gun might really mean trouble if the cops come, the boys in the 313 pull back. ""Don' kill 'em."" ""Don' do it, bitch."" That's the streets. You gotta even things up—but choo don't have to kill.<br/><br/>Of course there is home. But home is a banged up trailer with a blond mom (Kim Basinger) who f***s a dude in front of her four year old daughter—your little sister. She has to: the dude is expecting a check for his disability from when he got dinged in the head which, if nothing else already did, made him darned stupid. Yes, you have mom. Of course mom throws you out when the ding bat head injury guy swipes you and you swipe back so you've kind of got nothing except that you're white. There's that. But there isn't. Almost all the other guys you hang with are black. There's one other white guy, but he's so stupid he almost shoots his dick off. <br/><br/>Let's burn a house. OK.<br/><br/>Now then there's a white girl. She wants to be f****d, so do you, and it's good—even for the audience. The another day she f***s one of your associates and you even kind of understand for she needs a job, too, but you gotta mess up the associate. You have to; it's not right to screw an associate's girl, even if the girl has to, to get a job. Girls are relations between the guys. <br/><br/>Your boss at the auto plant is a fat black guy, a little older. He threatens you when you're bad and you hate him and when you're good he gives you more work and you love him. Hey. So that's how it works. Paying attention to him is like getting a phd in the 313. But choo still don't have a home and your car usually doesn't run. It's cold. <br/><br/>So whaddya do?<br/><br/>With a black eye popped out of its socket you finally get the balls to utter when it's your turn at ""The Battle."" Last week at ""The Battle"" you chocked. You couldn't rap a syllable. Not even a vowel. The hood was laughing atchoo. Everyone knew. ""The Battle"" is a local sport: the club is jammed with all blacks except the couple of white chicks who like it. And you and the stupid white guy who almost shot his dick off. Your dred locks friend with the cute teeth is the MC. He flips a coin and you go up against your ""class"" of rapper. It's wrestling. But it's balls wrestling. How much can you out-do insults to the punk you are up against and the f*** words that gush out of his pie hole? You got better bullets coming out of yours? You got 45 seconds, bitch. <br/><br/>The lights went out in Detroit yesterday. All of them. What has eminem taught us? Everything we need to know, dude. He taught us to hug our little sister. He taught us to get a job. He taught us to come down here from up there. He taught us not to be afraid. He taught us to practice, rehearse, write it down in circles, trust our minds. He taught us to bare our ass. He taught us to stay in Detroit. People survive.<br/><br/>How great would be things if Romney were Mayor, eminem were Deputy, Sugarman the Sage, and there were a plan to rise art out of the muck of the f****d up TVland on which we sucked and to forget skin color and remember poetry. TV is good now—but are we? Or are we all caught in Birdmanland, flying out the window to the skies or to our demise?"

Rabbit had many white and black friends as well as an ex gal friend who told him she was pregnant and another Alex, (Brittany Murphy). Rabbit appeared at a rapper contest and when he got up on stage, he froze and was unable to utter a word, which made things bad for him and many people began to talk in bad ways about his being a very poor rapper with words and music.

There were some amazing scene's all throughout the movie, but I felt it dragged in certain places and some things didn't go together.  I think if they would have focused more on the music and showed some definate movement towards a greater goal it would have been off the charts.  I felt like we were just floating through his life, not really knowing where to go, which I suppose is the effect they were going for.  I just kept waiting for this big build-up to the climax - that never came.

But at least appreciate that his performance was quite good, especially considering that he had never acted in a film before. His eyes told a lot, and I really connected with his character, in part because of his strugle, but mostly through his interactions with his friends, which I felt came off genuine and real. Agreed, Kim Basinger's Oscar should be taken away for her performance. She was lousy, and I'm still trying to figure out hom a woman from the slums of Detroit has a southern accent.

I also learned to flick people off is to show emotion and love towards that person in which you are flicking off. That and i got to see his butt. plus I got to see his butt. To see his butt was to see a picture form heaven.it is perfectly constructed and the only reason they made this movie was to please the female viewers in the audience.I am only going on because they said it has to ten lines but I do really love his ass!"

","Semi-autobiographical look at Eminem's early years in Detroit while he was trying to become a rapper. Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr (Eminem) is a young man living in a trailer with his white trash mom Stephanie (Kim Basinger). But at night, he goes to the rap contests, and the contestants all try to out-dis each other.<br/><br/>More important than the fact that this movie stars Eminem is its focus on trying to make something of oneself in an environment where everything seems as bleak as can be. The ad-libbed songs definitely add to the movie's gritty feeling, with the type of profanity that one usually expects to hear only from a Joe Pesci character. But above all, it humanizes the rap world, showing why it is like it is.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie under all circumstances."

","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>
What I am talking about is the fact that 8 Mile may be the first movie I have ever seen with no musical score.  Scenes are painfully quiet, and have no background instrumentals to keep us company.  Trust me, the dialogue is not that compelling, so the lack of music is definitely noticeable.  What else is noticeable is the fact that Eminem has about as much screen presence as the Key Grip credit in the end of the movie.  As an actor, he has 3 ranges: Mad, madder, and sorta mad.  Just watch the scenes when he gets angry and snaps on people.  It's some of the funniest work you'll ever see from an ""actor.""<br/><br/>How can a movie about the greatest form of music be so bad?  There is no such thing as a bad rap movie.  Even the bad ones are good!!  I love Krush Groove, Beat Street, CB4, and Rappin'.  Okay, maybe not Rappin'...but you guys get my point.  It's a fool proof topic that can't fail.  But 8 Mile does, and fails miserably at best.  I also don't appreciate how 8 Mile tried to deceive me.  This is a low budget independent movie, disguised as a major Hollywood production.  They do a sneaky good job hiding the fact that the film has no score by filling every scene with a soundtrack song from somebody's album.  And although the songs they chose are great, this movie cannot fool Rocky the Bear.<br/><br/>It starts with Eminem playing-- you guessed it, a rapper-- named B. Rabbit. The B stands for ""Bunny.""  That's right folks...Bunny.  And he actually thinks it's because he's white that people make fun of him.  The film opens with him in the bathroom of a Detroit nightclub, all alone, rehearsing his rhymes.  Ladies and gentlemen, I go to clubs routinely and I have never seen a vacant bathroom once.  Anyway, he is involved in a rap battle, he chokes on the mic and is booed off stage.  Hilarity ensues.  He leaves the club, eyeballing his number one nemesis, Papa Doc, the Clubber Lang of MC's. Bunny Rabbit then goes home to his mom's trailer where we get an awesome shot of a naked body double we're supposed to believe is Kim Basinger. Basinger, playing his mom, speaks in southern hillbilly dialect, the same way most Detroiters do.<br/><br/>Nothing is right in Bunny Rabbit's life.  He works at what everyone calls a dead end job (personally, I thought he had a very good job) and he has just broken up with his girlfriend and moved out their house, and back with Moms and live in boyfriend.  Kim Basinger without question agrees to take Bunny Rabbit in (how realistic) and of course, the rest of the movie becomes Bunny vs. Boyfriend.  Eminem is one dead actor.  Sometimes I wondered if he was actually present during the movie, or did they just use still photographs of him and animate his mouth, Clutch Cargo style.  One funny thing he does repeatedly is get angry at Boyfriend, cuss him out and threaten him, then in 2 seconds turns into Mr. friggin' Rogers and grabs his little sister and showers her with over-affectionate baby talk.  In one scene even serenades her.  Very creepy; it's probably the scene that secured the R rating.<br/><br/>8 Mile, or as I like to call it, ""Riding Around In Cars With Boys"" is one boring snoozefest of a movie.  Every scene entails Bunny Rabbit riding around in different cars with his boys.  After a while, it becomes painful to endure, and I made the decision that I'd rather use gravel as eyedrops than to watch another frame.  And to make matters worse, while I was in the theater, this strange smell would not leave my area, so I had to sit there in my seat, continually smelling this God awful aroma.  Then I looked up at the screen and realized it was 8 Mile I was smelling.<br/><br/>Bunny Rabbit hangs with the wackest crew in crew history.  It's leader is a guy named Future, which is actually Mekhi Phifer with a brown mop on his head we're supposed to believe are dreads.  Next up is the Farrakhan of the group, Angry Boy X.  Angry Boy X is one of Hollywood's latest stereotypes they've been doing since Zebrahead.  There's also a big fat boy for comic relief (fat boys are always funny) and a true loser named Cheddar who's slightly retarded.  Watch the sensitive scene where Bunny Rabbit visits him after he is shot.  Cheddar actually tells Rabbit, ""I-- I just don't want them making fun of me.""  Oh, boo hoo.  I thought they were going to kiss.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the movie also stars Brittany ""I'll Never Tell"" Murphy, playing what else-- a slut.  Early in the movie, the gang set an abandoned building on fire, I think they were trying to make some Detroit public service announcement.  Unfortunately, Bunny Rabbit makes it out the building alive. He then walks over to Brittany, who's watching the fire she actually says this line: ""It's almost beautiful.""  I hate when movies feel obligated to include that mushy mumbo jumbo and force out lines like ""It's almost beautiful.""  These days anybody can be a director, the only requirement is a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Eminem also looks really weird in this movie.  For the most part, he keeps a hat on, I guess to hide his thinning hair.  When he does take it off, he looks like a chemo patient you feel sorry for.  As for the movie itself, it's so boring!  It's like watching an ABC After School Special with no message at the end.  No message because after the big rap showdown at the end, Bunny Rabbit beats his nemesis, but does he get a record deal and become famous?  NO.  He goes back to work!!  What the hell did I even watch this crap for?!<br/><br/>I've even read lots of professional critics hail this movie, and compare it to Purple Rain-- like that's a good thing.  That's like telling a new mayor he reminds you of Marion Barry.  8 Mile is basically bad scene after bad scene.  Eminem gets into a fight with his mom's boyfriend, Eminem gets into a fight with a rival rap group, Eminem gets into a fight with his old girlfriend, Eminem gets into a fight with his new girlfriend, Eminem gets into a fight with his best friend, Eminem gets into a fight with a rap promoter, and then Eminem befriends a gay guy??  Hey, YOU try to make sense out of this movie.  I gave up on the lunch truck scene.  Pure crap.<br/><br/>Zero stars out of 5."

","In my estimation this movie is far from anything you can call ""a Well done Movie"". Its lack of substancialism and acting, clearly shows this ""muscician"" has to stay away from any set available. The movie has no rhythm at all. they are a lot of worthless takes, putting in evidence a lack of script. AT no point we see a sign of continuity. The expression is far from being good. If the movie appeal at one pint to show us the crude reality of the ghetto it failed big time. Thre are no clear deep moments, which bound to the core of their carachters. The music is poorly executed, and at sometimes it actually doesn't fit with the continuity of the film and makes it slower from what it actually is. There are better movies who express the relations between a dysfunctional family that this paid advertisement for a mediocre rapper. I still cant believe this movie got 6 points in this site... wow this totally show a lack of knowledge among all... I can't believe it actually has a higher rating than classic films. Prety ironic- FInally, we see Eminem's sister, screaming like a malfunction robot at every thing this kid that wrong... what a waste of salary, they should have left that girl inside a daycare, and off the set. It doesn't express or teach any message at all. But hey, they have to get a disturbed little girl for a good drama... NOT <br/><br/>IT is a parade of verbal language, sexuality, and drugs perfect for that junkie next door... but not enough for someone looking for something interesting"
"SquigglyCrunch","2","1","7","7 February 2017"," A Compilation of Idiots Who Can't Act Doing Dumb Stuff and Driving Around in a Broken Car
","8 Mile is a biography following rapper 'Eminem' in a week leading up to when people started to notice his talent more, starting with a couple of freestyle rap battles. <br/><br/>Eminem was hired to play himself in this movie, and he does a great job...at rapping. He really does, the rap battles are the best parts of the movie, and whenever the script demands that he open his mouth to do so it's something of a treat to listen to. <br/><br/>As for his acting, I really can't say the same. He holds the same deadpan expression for the entire movie, whether he's being beaten up or trying to show compassion. It's always just wide open eyes like a fish, a drooping face, and a slightly gaped mouth constantly moaning 'duuuuuuuh...' At least that's how it looks. With the subject matter this movie handles, an effectively emotional performance would make or break pretty much every major scene, but all we got was deadpan Eminem trying to put some level of emotion into his voice or face but failing miserably. He's a horrid actor, and I'm so happy he never continued. As for the rest of the cast, they aren't anything special either. This is closer to being the writing's fault, but nobody bothers to try to push their characters past black stereotypes. They all talk the same, walk the same, and act the same. They're just different sizes and shapes. Now you could argue that they actually acted like that in real life, this is a biography after all. However, I am all for changing the source material for the betterment of the film. This is a film, it's entertainment. If a better actor were chosen for Eminem we could have gotten a deep and engaging character, but we just got Senior Deadpan over here. I'd have changed the source material if Eminem really was this boring of a person, then hired a better actor. <br/><br/>As for the writing, it's one of the main reasons this movie sucks. None of the characters are written to be interesting or deep or anything. I didn't care about any of them, especially not when they decide to spend their nights lighting houses on fire with people still in them. And yes, there is actually a scene where that happens. It's absurdly stupid. There are plenty of other dumb scenes, like two characters sneaking off during their lunch break to engage in intercourse in a factory, surrounded by machinery. Machinery that could probably kill them if turned on at the wrong moment. Then the male party in this scene has the audacity to get mad when his female counterpart goes and engages in intercourse with someone else. Maybe that would be a bigger deal if they'd known each other long enough to be 'going steady'. They knew each other for two whole days, and spoke maybe twice. It's a one-night stand, male party, do you seriously expect her to be committed to you? Apparently. I don't want to say much more, but more stupidity ensues from this already dumb situation. Seriously, there's nothing to this writing. Even the dialogue is uninspired and uninteresting. It's hopelessly average at best, horridly stupid at worst. It's like the screenplay was written by a sixth grader who just learned some new swear words and had a couple sex-ed classes. The movie is overloaded with cussing, and while I have no problem with cursing in movies, it's used in so much excess that the audience becomes numb to it, and whatever effect it had beforehand is completely lost. I couldn't tell when a line of dialogue was supposed to be emphasized because a) cussing happened in every sentence, which would normally bring emphasis to a scene but instead blended in with the rest of the dialogue and b) because all the acting was so dull that it was impossible to tell whether the characters were trying to emphasize anything they were saying. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the characters are all completely bland. Every single one is just a blatant embodiment of their own racial stereotype, save for Eminem. Although he's just a white guy acting black, so there's really nothing to his character anyway. There's this fantastically awful scene where a character forgets to take his finger off the trigger of his gun and shoots himself with it. It makes me wonder how completely stupid you'd have to be to actually manage that. And again, I don't care if it really happened, though I find that to be the most unbelievable part of the whole movie. <br/><br/>Overall 8 Mile is a walking trash can filled with all it's qualities. The writing is garbage, the characters are junk, and the acting is rubbish. There's nothing to this movie, save for the handful of rapping scenes. In a near 2 hour movie, there really wasn't enough rapping to save it, although even that would get old after 2 hours. In the end I would never recommend investing even a second in this movie."

"aidanratesmovies","10","0","1","19 April 2020"," Incredibly grounded, and very entertaining- 8 Mile is a job well done
","Entertaining, incredibly grounded, and certainly inspiring- 8 Mile is more than just a rise to fame like origin story- it's about the choices made that lead us to who we become. Eminem is surprisingly great as 'Rabbit', a rapper with a gift, but having a hard time showing it. The film is very cleverly acted in general as well, with all the performances feeling more than real, and not just average stereotypes like most of these types of films. The film is really entertaining to watch, even with its nearly 2 hour runtime and its slow progression of plot most of the time. It's written superbly well, and directed with a very careful precision that I can't help but admire. The film does aim to please, and seems to nail that fact most of the time, but can prove to be tedious in certain progression of its story. In the end, 8 Mile is a more than impressive job inspired by and starring one of the greatest rappers of all time. The film is very grounded, very realistic, as it should be, and written and directed with great passion. It's inspiring, entertaining, and by all means an impressive feat.

","When I think of 8 mile I think of the word ""Realistic."" I wouldn't say ""Good"" nor ""Bad"" but realistic.<br/><br/>To start, the characters are very realistic, layered, and each one of them behaves in ways you'd expect people in their situations to be like. This is a heavy foundation of the film as you enjoy seeing these characters on screen and how they react to new situations. Also the direction was surprisingly well done. I went in expecting this film to be carried by it's star actor but the direction, especially the atmosphere of the city at night, was very authentic.<br/><br/>However, the story is not the greatest. Don't get me wrong, the idea is great and I suppose all boys have at least dreamt about being a rapper, but the film fails to support it's realism in the story. Things happen in this film to inconvenience or convenience the main character, and don't happen naturally. Sometimes there is hinting that these things will happen but that is the most you are given. This makes the films three act structure really forced. Another problem I had was that the film sort of forced you to agree with its opinion. Staying spoiler free, the characters do things, or make some rhymes, and the film sort of says ""Yeah that's right, this is cool, and this is right!"" without leaving you the space to make your own mind. Final problem, for a film about music, there is quite a lack of music and original songs. There was only one original song, which was ""Lose Yourself."" It did deserve to win the Oscar as it matched everything in the film and, by itself, is a good song.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film to watch as an example of what a totally realistic film looks like, for better or worse."

","In 8 Mile, Eminem is Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith a slightly fictionalised version of himself living in a working class neighbourhood of Detroit. Rabbit has moved back to his trailer thrash mum (Kim Basinger) after a break up with his girlfriend. <br/><br/>Rabbit works hard, his friend gets him gigs to engage in rap battles in clubs where he is dubbed as Elvis, AKA as a white guy trying to sell a piece of black culture. The trouble is Rabbit gets overcome with nerves every time he tries to perform in front of a crowd and take his rival down.<br/><br/>8 Mile is an underdog story as the working class guy makes good with the help of his multi racial friends.<br/><br/>Director Curtis Hanson uses all his Oscar winning skills to try to sell this as a real, gritty film. Eminem is rather flat swerving somewhere between mournful and angry. Each time he goes to his mother's house it ends up in some sort of a fight. Basinger never convinces as a rough lower working class mom type.<br/><br/>The script wants to be a modern version of Saturday Night Fever but it lacks that film's showboating."
"nmholland","7","0","1","27 January 2016"," Somewhat Disappointed
","8 Mile is directed by Curtis Hanson and stars Eminem (obviously), Kim Basinger, and Brittany Murphy. Before I start, let me just say I am a huge fan of Eminem. I listen to his music often, and think he's an amazing musician. However, this has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>I have wanted to see this movie for a long time, but never got the chance to until recently, and I was pretty disappointed. I was hoping to see Marshall Mathers, and some other people in his life, like Kim (I'm sure most of you have heard of her). However, I got Jimmy Smith and Janeane. Yeah, they changed the names. This kind of made me mad. Eminem is a millionaire, and he couldn't pay for the rights of one person (obviously he wouldn't have to pay for his own). This was easily my main problem with the movie. Anyways, now that I got that off of my chest, I can move on.<br/><br/>Some of the good points on this movie would start with Marshall's ability to rap. I mentioned earlier that he is an amazing musician (my opinion, of course), but his rapping abilities in this movie impressed me even more. On top of that, he is a pretty decent actor. That actually leads me to my second problem. I only cared about B Rabbit. I didn't care for any other of the characters at all, which was really a let down.<br/><br/>The second positive would be the story line. This is a true story, as you should know, about the rapper Eminem and how his early life was. The storyline is great, and inspires a good message: don't let anybody put you down. Throughout the whole film, a group of buddies from across 8 Mile give ""Jimmy"" trash, and he ends up winning the rap battle at the end, and makes the other guys look like complete idiots. I enjoy moments in movies where the ""bad guy"" gets what he deserves. There are a couple of plot holes, but it's still a great story, nevertheless.<br/><br/>Now, for the negatives.<br/><br/>First off, this whole movie was dull. Now, I understand that it takes place in Detroit, and that's a horrible place, but the whole movie looks grey, and depressing, and just ugly. If they would've added a little color every here and there, it would've looked much better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Other than the color, the flat characters and the name changes, I don't really have any other problems with it. I didn't enjoy it like I thought I would, but I definitely wouldn't say it was bad. Overall, I would have to give 8 Mile a B, or a 7 out of 10."

"risquezalejandro99","10","0","1","18 May 2014"," My critic about the movie ""8 Mile""
","Controversial rap star Eminem makes his acting debut in this hard-edged urban drama, inspired in part by incidents from the musician's own life. Jimmy Smith (Eminem), known to his friends as Rabbit, is a young man trying to make his way out of the burned-out shell of inner-city Detroit. Rabbit's entire life has been a hard climb, and it certainly hasn't gotten any easier lately; Rabbit has just been dumped by his girlfriend, forcing him to move back in with his emotionally unstable mother, Stephanie (Kim Basinger), and he's getting along especially poorly with Stephanie's new boyfriend. Rabbit has a factory job that's tough, demeaning, and doesn't pay especially well, and he's convinced his skills as a rapper are his only real hope at a better life. Rabbit makes music with a crew of DJ's and MC's who call themselves Three One Third, among them his close friend Future (Mekhi Phifer), but his status as a white kid making music in a predominantly African-American community and culture is extremely intimidating, and after Rabbit freezes up in the midst of an MC battle, he's convinced he's missed his chance and that he's doomed to lead a marginal life as a factory rat for the rest of his days. With the help of his friends, and his new girlfriend Alex (Brittany Murphy), Rabbit struggles to work up the courage and the confidence to take one more shot at making his dream a reality. 8 Mile was shot on location in Detroit; the name refers to 8 Mile Road, a thoroughfare along the city's perimeter which effectively separates the middle-class suburban neighborhoods from the lower-class inner-city."

","8 Mile is a vary inspirational movie to anyone who watches. This movie s a drama about how someone coming from a mean neighborhood to becoming one of the most famous rappers of all time. This movie can be described as determination, inspiration, and dramatic. The reason I chose this movie is because when Jimmy (Eminem) a young and unhappy blue collar worker started to rap he and told a story and those story's were sad but they had an upside to them.<br/><br/>Firstly, I feel that this is a great movie for someone that feels like they have nothing and feel sad that they have no future. The reason I say this is because when you watch this movie Jimmy (Eminem) has the roughest life that any person can imagine. Jimmy is a white boy in a black neighborhood, in a rundown trailer home in Warren of his alcoholic mother, he is ganged up on, beat up, and made fun of. Jimmy is practically a father to his younger sister Lily. He becomes a rapper that is the opposite of the others. Jimmy makes fun of himself and tells his story. <br/><br/>In addition, to everything he went through he had vary powerful lyrics. This movie is about determination. Jimmy is scared because a group called ""free world"" think there the best of the best rappers and don't want anyone to steal their show. They come to 8 Mile (the neighborhood that Jimmy lives in) and beat him so he won't rap anymore. Yet, Jimmy (Eminem) finds out that there is a big rap battle a while later where all the gang members are going to be. He decides to show up and tell everyone about what he doesn't have and disses himself so they can't. Eventually Jimmy gets a record deal and changes his name to Eminem and he earns a ton of money and becomes a great rapper. <br/><br/>However, even though Jimmy did have this opportunity to become the person he is today, he had a tough life even before 8 mile. He dropped out of high school and got fired from his first job and had to leave his hometown. When he came to 8 mile he had to live with his mom and her no good live-in boyfriend. Jimmy and his moms boyfriend didn't get along they got in many fights and he left. After that their life went down hill and they had no money to spend so Jimmy had to get a new job and things got a little better.<br/><br/>Finally, this is an excellent drama about determination and overcoming fear. Jimmy a 18 year old boy getting beat up and having the roughest life, yet comes through all his trouble by releasing his anger in his raps. He got a job as a mechanic. The person that was kissing his girl friend was later the one who got him a record deal. Today Eminem is considered one of the best rappers in history. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I recommend this movie, because I feel that if you are depressed and sad and you watch this movie you will see that you don't have it that bad. Eminem is a world famous rapper that came from all of this trouble and hurt and he still has hurt and pain but he can let it out his way. At is why I recommend this movie."

Eminem is a great actor which is odd for an artist but the film is believable and real. It is surely one of my favorite movies. The movie is sort of like a documentary, but a live action documentary if that makes sense. It depicts Eminem's early life before he had become a rapper and it's sometimes sad, sometimes moving, and sometimes inspirational. The rap battles are really something, especially the last one on the film, that had me going crazy. He faces stereotypes, controversy, and everything in between. This film is just beautiful and I find it somewhat disturbing that this isn't on the top 250. 8 Mile is a great film that makes me believe that even movies that are rated below 7 could become one of my favorites. 10/10."

","In 2007, i started listening to Eminem's music after i heard his performance in smack that, and i was impressed with his early work and the little amount of music he was putting out during that tough period of his life. i watched 8 Mile after he came back into the public eye and my best mate told me i wasn't a true Eminem fan if i hadn't watched 8 mile, which was rather childish. However, soon after this conversation, a screening of it was on ITV 4. <br/><br/>At the time i was a little too young to understand it fully, but after watching it again recently, i was breath taken by the beauty and realism of this hip hop underground gem of a flick.<br/><br/>If you are so polite as to keep reading this, and you are thinking that this is a biased film review because i am a huge fan of Marshall Mathers, i am attempting not to be.<br/><br/>So, here's the plot. You have your extremely talented rapper (Eminem) trying to make it big, but failing cos he shuts down. 'when it comes crunch time, where do my punch line's go' (quote from the 8 Mile song)who humiliates himself at the beginning of the movie by chocking against rapper Lil Tic (Proof) in a rap battle. After this, the film is about sub plots in his life which include, love, love lost, fighting, gang wars, backstabbing, and problems with his mum and his mums partner. The film concludes with all of these plots coming to a head and sneaking into his amazing final freestyle against the leader of the opposing gang.<br/><br/>Its a rare gem for music movie's, and will be considered a modern classic in years to come, and quite rightly, because this truly is an exhilarating dramatic cinematic accomplishment (some big words for the more intellectual readers)<br/><br/>How does it do this? Well the splendid acting from all of the cast is a big part, a well thought out plot, and an uplifting, funny, and unforgettable conclusion. <br/><br/>In my reviews i usually write about a problem within the film, however, i can not fault this movie at all. The whole thing is just brilliantly perfect.<br/><br/>So, in summary, it doesn't matter if you hate Eminem, hip hop, films, or life, this movie should be watched no matter what.

","No matter where we live, no matter who we are, we're all bound by borders... some real, some imagined. Many of us are content to live within these borders. Others are forced to. But some of us need to break out, burst through, even if what lies on the other side is both frightening and unknown. 8 Mile is a story about these boundaries that define our lives, and a young man's (Eminem) struggle to find the strength and courage to transcend them. I know a good movie when i see one and this one is just one of the very few in Hollywood these days. My personal opinion is that the movie isn't just telling us the life of Eminem but the hardships of near poverty and the struggle to survive in the slums of Detroit. 8 Mile 10/10"

","Eminem's acting debut wasn't that bad... for a rapper. The role was perfect for him anyway, he didn't have to extend himself. He played a poor guy trying to get by on a blue collar job and doing rapping on the side. I think that is his actual life story. Not too hard to play yourself.<br/><br/>The story didn't intrigue me at all. None of the characters were compelling nor were the issues the main character had to face. This movie had to be for Eminem fans. If you like Eminem, then perhaps you liked the movie because he was in it and he did some rapping.

"joshbutters","10","0","1","9 February 2007"," One of my favorites
","To be honest, 8 Mile is one of my favorite movies to this day. Eminem is a good actor in this movie and does a nice job. Eminem plays B Rabbit, a hopeful future rapper in Detroit. He lives with his mother and they both go through tough trials in their lives throughout the movie. B Rabbit dreams of becoming a successful battle rapper, and through encouragement from his friends he takes on his opponents in a rap battle tournament at the end of the movie, overcomes the odds, and proves to everyone that he has the talent. I liked this movie for a couple reasons, first, Eminem is one of my favorite music artists. The Marshall Mathers LP is one of my favorite music albums today. Eminem is brave enough to show the world how he feels, and I respect that. Second, this movie in a way shows the lesson that you can achieve your dreams if you never give up and always give it your best. This is an awesome movie, and I recommend it to everyone. Whether you're a rap fan or not, I believe you will like this movie."

","I am a 49 year old father with teenage children, so I am way outside of the demographic that this movie was meant for, but I have seen it twice, the second time just last night, and I found it to be compelling and surprisingly uplifting. I have no interest in hip hop and I find some of Eminem's songs and subject matter to be offensive at times but there is no denying that he is a talented man, and he can act as well. Having said that, you have to bear in mind that he was basically playing the part of himself in this movie, but he does have a lot of presence on the screen, and a viewer like myself can sympathise with the character he is playing, not because I am a fan, (as would be the case with a lot of people), but because of his ability as an actor to move the audience and involve them in his character's world. This was a movie that made me think, and it showed a side of life that is unfamiliar to me, so if I had gained nothing else from it, those two things would have made it worth watching, but there was a lot more to it than that. In the final ""rap battle"", if that is the correct term, I thought it was great the way Rabbit exposed the ""Free World"" for the losers that they were, with wit and style. I doubt if this was the message he or the movie were trying to get across, but he showed that you can get even with someone without having to beat the sh*t out of them, as they had done to him the previous night. It is a great scene.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll ever be a fan of Eminem, but I hear my son playing his CD's all the time, and I have to respect his ability as a song writer and performer. I was surprised to have gained so much from a movie like this, and I will probably watch it again some time."

"fivedimensionalmanifold","8","0","1","10 July 2005"," Well-crafted and engaging
","I'm an Eminem fan and have enjoyed his music going back to his first major label CD, The Slim Shady LP. I read a lot of advance press for this movie when it was first coming out that stated that it was very good, and that even those who were not Eminem fans might enjoy the movie for its engaging pace or for its powerful depiction of realistic urban life or etc. I was still somewhat skeptical about seeing this, because I worried about Eminem's acting ability. Plus I thought he might be releasing it simply to promote his career in hip-hop. I found myself enjoying the movie on multiple levels. I mentioned that I'm a fan of hip-hop and specifically of Eminem. Thus, I was able to enjoy the rap battles and casual freestyling done by Eminem and his 8 Mile crew. I also found it to be refreshing in its realistic depiction of the experiences of ""B-Rabbit"". We see him living miserably with his sleazeball mother and his young sister in a trailer, and we see him working thankless factory jobs for low pay and with little job security. The movie takes the time to show us the mundane aspects of Rabbit's daily life, rather than inflating him to superhuman status merely because of his aspirations to leave the trailer park life behind or because of his skill at rapping. One thing that honestly came as a complete shock was the inclusion of a gay co-worker at the factory at which Rabbit works. I wonder whether they included this character in order to soften the public image of Eminem, who had previously made homophobic remarks in his songs and implied a sense of homophobia in his public statements. This character is depicted as being a nice guy, who covers Rabbit's shift, and he does not exist as the butt of any homophobic jokes (at least as far as I observed). The ending is unique, I won't give it away, but let's say that it doesn't take a textbook approach and I enjoyed it for its bold choice to be different from Hollywood format. The depiction of the 8 Mile neighborhood seemed realistic enough, although I've never actually been to Detroit so I suppose I am not familiar enough to say for sure. The supporting actors give decent performances, and their characters are written well enough to allow them room to really act. I had worried that this movie might become simply a close-up on the main character and might therefore force other characters to deal with poorly developed backstories. But that wasn't the case. Most supporting characters had well thought out parts. Although B-Rabbit's mother did seem a bit hazily written, just generally sleazy and revolting but not quite specific enough to convince me that this was a viable character. I would recommend this movie to Eminem fans (although I'm sure most have already seen it by now) and also to anyone who has an interest in the way life is lived by 20something people in the tougher sections of American cities. It's not a glorified world of gunplay, but guns are a part of their lives, and few of them have found happiness in their work or personal lives."

","When I watched this movie on TV last night I wasn't expecting anything great. Just something to kill some time. Well, I didn't get anything great, as expected! 8 mile ain't no Oscar winner, but it does contain some interesting insights and social commentary. Rabbit (Eminem) is a young white boy who lives in a trailer park with his mum and young sister. His mother is an alcoholic who is dating someone barely older than him. In fact they went to the same school! Who wouldn't be frustrated with that? His friends are all wannabe rappers who just think it's a matter of time before they get a record deal. Rabbit is also a talented MC, but freezes in front of people other than his friends. Since music is the only outlet for his frustration, this kinda sucks! He is constantly promised that he will be a part of a music 'empire' which always fails to materialize. The film follows his frustration with his white trash existence and his struggle to come to terms with it and realise his own potential. It's not hard to root for Rabbit. Who doesn't know guys that sit around talking s#!t about when they become the next big thing, only they never get off their ass to do anything about it? Who doesn't know families that seem to exist day by day, or people that are always looking for a hand out and not a hand up? Who hasn't been promised this or that by someone who tells you they have connections? OK maybe not everyone, but everyone loves an underdog, right? Rabbit ultimately decides he needs to walk his own path, and not rely on anyone else, which is the message I feel this movie is trying to push. No one is going to hand you what you want in life, you have to work hard and sacrifice to get to where you want to be. The ending isn't typical Hollywood drivel either. He's not handed a record deal, he's not famous, but he is determined and knows what he has to do to get there. Work hard at your day job, stay passionate and keep focused on the goal. Not sure how close the film is to Eminem's own success story, but there are some great positive messages that can be taken out of this film. Great to see my man Rabbit get his props!!!!"

","I spent my early childhood in the hood, moved to upper middle class for my latter teenage years, went back to the 'hood' at 18 for a brief while, and now live in suburbia with the picket fence and ""beautiful people' family. However, I am also now a cop, working in the hood and see/care-about/talk-to/fight-with the inner city inhabitants on a daily basis. This movie did nothing to capture even an iota of the real grit of the hood. Movies more than a decade older than 8 mile did a much better job at capturing this grit (New Jack City, 1991) (Boyz in the Hood, 1991). This movie was hard to 'get into' and the plot was decidedly blasÃ©.<br/><br/>But I want to get on a soapbox for moment about the gangsta lifestyle. The character ""Mekhi"" depicted by Brittany Murphy is a cute, sweet, genuine, pure hearted girl that looks like she's straight out of Bel Air. Give me a break. I've got news for the casting directors and writers of 8 Mile: cute, sweet, genuine, pure-hearted girls with a sweet innocent and demure laugh like Mekhi's don't hang out with no life having, ""I'm so full of myself' exhibiting, gangsta emulating, disrespectful thug wannabe's who think it's cool and 'big' to talk trash to each other and exude the same traits as a wayward identity-searching Goth teen. Girls like that are girls like that because they grow up AWAY from crap like that. While there is the occasional cute girl in the hood, or the occasional sweet girl, or shy girl, or 'thinking' girl, or 'solidly grounded with both feet' girl, you would be extremely hard pressed to find one with all the traits that ""Mehki' has *and* who prefers the company of the personality/behavioral types depicted in 8 mile.<br/><br/>In fact, I think it's the writer's way of having his cake and eating it too. Getting a chance to glorify a portion of inner city reduced-frontal-brain angst *and* pretend like that kind of hood life is so 'regular' that it can produce ""Beverly hills' type sweet cute girls who don't flinch when the driver of the hoopty car they are in almost hits an on coming car head on, or look at the abandon house that has just been criminally burned down by her 'friends' and say in a soft, cutely broken voice out of a Disney movie: ""It looks so beautiful"". Give me a break.

"arspoetica13","8","0","1","22 March 2005"," It's nice to see a side of rap that few actually see
","8 Mile is a retelling of the classic theme of an underdog overcoming the obstacles attempting to hold them back from achieving a specific goal. In this case, Eminem plays Jimmy 'B Rabbit' Smith whose goals are set to make something of himself in the hip-hop world.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Detroit and is focused around the 8 Mile border which separates the industrial part of the city from the suburbs, in effect separating blacks and whites. This is difficult for Eminem's character as his chances for finding success, much less making a name for himself, in the hip-hop scene is greatly effected by him living on the other side of 8 Mile. Though, due to his growing talent, he can't be ignored and once he finds his voice, he can't be stopped. Really, I think the most important aspect of this film is the realization of how important rap is as a creative outlet and how opening yourself without fear in that or any creative medium can defy even the boundaries of prejudice.<br/><br/>As we know, Eminem became infamous for his controversial lyrics, however he also made it by being a good musician and writing his nonetheless controversial lyrics well. This is an important aspect in the film because throughout it, Eminem's character competes in ""battle raps"" where rappers throw ad-libbed insults at each other for 45 seconds to a house beat. Here is where the obvious Rocky comparison can be made pertaining to the ""big fight"" in the end where the outcome of the event is crucial. However, the ""big fight"" in Eminem's case is a final battle rap and it is an inspiring example of the pen being mightier than the sword. Also, while watching these, you can't help but appreciate the literary knowledge that goes into some of these performances. It's nice to see a side of rap that few actually see, which is how much poetry and soul actually get put into many of these songs, aside from guns-girls-gangsta lyrics that we're all used to hearing.<br/><br/>Also in the movie, Eminem's character goes through many hardships within his personal life. His mother, played by Kim Basinger, is a drunk, drug-addicted, woman who's sleeping with an annoying redneck that Eminem's character went to high school with. On top of that, he's dealing with his own relationship troubles and the threats from the rival rap gang the ""New World"". So, with everything slowly spiraling down in front of his eyes, he becomes self-conscious and afraid. However, through his music he's able to open himself up and clear his mind and thus rejuvenate his inner strength.<br/><br/>Also worthy of mention are the actual film making techniques this movie used. For example, to elevate the feelings of despair and claustrophobia, many scenes are at night or in dark clubs with characters in mainly black clothing. The color blue is also used a lot to elevate those feelings. Also, the camera work is fast-paced, yet sharp, giving off a feeling of anxiety and dangerousness. This accompanies the roles outside of Eminem's because there's a certain mysteriousness surrounding everyone that makes the viewer not want to trust their intentions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the fact that the outcome is somewhat predictable because it is, in fact, loosely based around Eminem's real life. However, this can be forgiven because the part that's intriguing is how he gets there. Overall, this movie is bound to, at very least, tickle the literary senses of those who can find it in obscure places and to (hopefully) open the viewer's mind to the beautiful side of a culture that has gained an ugly reputation."
"fadedGlory","7","0","1","1 March 2005"," Not bad
","This is actually not a bad movie. It is a bit limited in scope, a week in the life of a young working-class guy living in a dilapidated part of Detroit. Split-up from his girlfriend, having to move back in with his Mum and her violent boyfriend in a trailer, fired from his job - at the start of the movie his life has hit rock bottom. All he has left are his buddies, and his only outlet is the rap scene where he is struggling to be accepted because he is white. And initially it goes wrong there too, when his talent fails him in a critical contest ('battle').<br/><br/>In the middle part of the film he slowly finds himself back, but it is not an easy road. He meets a girl and loses her again, there is violence with a competing rap gang, big trouble with his Mum and her nasty boyfriend, and he struggles in his new job in a steel factory.<br/><br/>Then, at the end, he 'finds himself', goes back into the rapping 'battles' and soundly defeats the reigning champion who is also the leader of the competing gang, and all should be well.<br/><br/>But is it? Many people call this a typical Hollywood story, but the film does actually not have the typical Hollywood ending: he doesn't get the girl and he only goes back to his mind-numbing job in the factory instead of breaking through as a rap star. He may still escape, but we don't get to see it and we will never know. Equally likely he stays stuck here for the rest of his life - the film doesn't tell us.<br/><br/>I think this is a fairly effective film with exactly the right bleak atmosphere, shot in the winter in an awful run-down part of Detroit, almost a slum. There is some good friendship and some nasty hatred and mindless violence. Eminem's acting is not all that bad given his lack of experience, although most of the time he is just in some kind of sullen mood. The actors playing his buddies keep him straight, but Kim Basinger is simply awful. An interesting glimpse of a sub-culture that many of us won't know at all."

I certainly enjoyed this movie, which was good on many levels.<br/><br/>The story is set in the mid 90s in the poorer districts of Detroit. It follows a white rapper trying to succeed in an almost completely black music style. The similarities between Saturday Night Fever and 8 Mile represent themselves in the main character's families, their work, their friends and in their one real talent. In the case of Saturday Night Fever it was dancing, in this movie it's rap music.<br/><br/>This was a good movie to watch and the performances from all the main characters were excellent. It's difficult for me to relate to the environment in which the movie was set and the prejudices a 'white trailer trash' rapper would face, not having experienced anything like it.

","Although Eminem is a little overblown, I have to support this movie. I live in a moderately big city, Baltimore, and most of his acquaintances, mot being a stranger to the music business myself, were portrayed in a realistic manner. Opportunism runs rampant in any large metropolis, and 'Everyone knows Everyone'. Especially when they're working class, children of 'non-priveledge'. Very accurate, I just wish that every 15 year old in South Baltimore with a child and a ""Baby's Mama"" would stop walking around rapping to themselves. Not everyone gets the luck of the draw ..., i.e. Talent, Appearance, Charismo( Yeah, I spelled it that way!:)). As my 5th grade teacher, Mr. Lindsay, put it, ""The world needs ditch diggers, too""."

He stuck 2 scene and showed the rest of the world what Detroit is like. People down Detroit all the time. It's really not that bad. But Eminem did an excellent job playing Jimmy. You find a lot of men in Detroit that has the same back ground as his character. Eminem told a similar story of his own. He's a white male from Detroit that always dreamed of becoming a rapper. This movie was nothing but non-stop drama and that's what I loved about it mainly. It had it's humor, it had it's fun, it has all of the qualities of a good film.

I think this movie could have a sequel that'd be better then the prequel showing him just break into the Rap game as an underground cat and making his way up. But, yeah hope you like the movie and enjoyed my comments."

","Finally, the white man triumphs over the black oppressors! I feel so vindicated, thank you Eminem. Since hip-hop was never political in the first place, it's so good to see Hollywood finally choosing to recognize the truth of a scenario and present it to us raw and uncut! Seriously, those freestyles were hot, I don't know how they pulled it off! In one take?!?!?! Watch this movie, enjoy it even, as far as big-budget Hollywood goes, it's quite well done, cleverly edited, great attention to color and overall atmosphere. But just remember, in real life anyone can rap, but this doesn't change the fact that it grew out of the black stuggle and cannot be reduced to tacky emotional manipulation tactics. I heard Eminem had a mullet back in the day."

","8 Mile is a great movie combining hip hop music and an abbreviated autobiography of Eminem's life in Detroit. It is the story of a white boy's struggles to make it in the hip hop work of music that is dominated mostly by African Americans, while living in the tough streets of Detroit.<br/><br/>8 Mile is in part about the life of Rabbit, who is played by the white hip hop rapper Eminem, while Rabbit's mother is played by Kim Basinger.<br/><br/>Eminem plays a character similar to his own life. The film talks about Eminem's struggle to live a hard life in the tough streets of Detroit. Eminem is forced to move back into a trailer where his mother (Kim Basinger) lives in the white ghetto neighborhood of 8 Mile trailer park.<br/><br/>During the film, Eminem faces different struggles. One struggle that Eminem is faced with is not only dealing with trying to get a demo made of him rapping so that he can get a recording deal. One scene of the film, shows Eminem's struggle when he is in the restroom of the Shelter, preparing himself for the rap battle. This battle involves a lyrical war between want-to-be rap artists. In the restroom, there are no windows and the graffiti on the walls give the appearance that the walls are closing in. Also, the lighting in the Shelter before Eminem's opportunity to battle, is low key lighting and there is hardly any color used in the scene as far as the cast's clothing. Low key lighting is generally used in gangster films and this film is in a sense a gangster film.<br/><br/>Another struggle that Eminem's character deals with is a sense of life closing in on him or confining him. The feeling of confinement is felt throughout the movie. Tight frame shots are used throughout the film. One tight frame shot is while Eminem and Kim Basinger are in the trailer. When some people see a trailer, they may envision closeness, no room to move, or confinement.<br/><br/>During the film, there are many profile shots of Eminem. These shots are used to show a character lost in thought. Going back to the bathroom scene in the beginning of the film, Eminem's profile is shot while he is deep in thought and concentrating on his lyrics and rhymes he wants to use in the battle. Another profile shot is while Eminem is sitting on a bus, again deep in thought.<br/><br/>While the film 8 Mile was not totally true in terms of Eminem's life, some aspects are factual.<br/><br/>As far as film comparisons, 8 Mile is similar to the film directed by Charles Stone, III. That film is named Drumline. It is a movie about Devon Miles, played by Nick Cannon. Nick Cannon struggles to make it to the drumline of a Southern University marching band. Like 8 Mile, Drumline battles not with guns or violence, but with music (instrumental and lyrical).<br/><br/>Although Eminem struggles throughout his life and his role in the film, he shows that barriers can be broken and that a white boy from the ghetto of Detroit can rap in the world of African American hip hop."

","8 mile pleased me very much and others it didn't. I'll go with the negavites first. The acting wasn't all great. Eminem did okay, but sometimes he just didn't clear his words out and he always got mad all the time. The rest of the actors were okay to but needed just a little bit more of teaching in acting school. Some parts were boring also. I mean it just got boring sometimes. Eminem was always through troubles and it just got boring that he got mad all the time at the world. It's like, okay now your a rap hero. Hard Life!! My positives were is that the movie was very exciting and funny. It kept you at the edge of your seat in a lot of areas, which I liked. The funny parts are like when Eminem rapped at the end to that one guy and was making fun of him. That and when the white guy in the ghetto shot himself accidentally. Oh my god that was hilarious. There were many very good scenes actually. I mean it was very realistic of all the happenings growing up in Detroit and it was just very stimualting as it grew. I think living in that neighborhood of trailers with one white guy and black kids around is very tough actually. I can see through Eminem's eyes how tough it was. Very realistic, indeed. Overall a very suspenseful film with great rapping from the greatest rapper of all time. If you want to see this movie, I highly recommend you watching this. I mean you can't miss the film or know what it's about. It's pretty easy if the movie comes from Eminem. Good movie and this what I call a movie, ""a fine warmth.""

"pintofsmooth","Null","0","1","19 October 2004"," Welcome to the Eminem Show
","Despite the fact that he seems to be suffering a perennial identity crisis, Eminem, as we shall simply call him for now, has quickly become the biggest phenomenon in pop music since Michael Jackson. And much as that superstar continues to alter his visage, we are presented with the three faces of our new hero. Three albums, three monikers, with Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers thrown in there alongside the more straightforward Eminem, or Em for short. It is this latter branding that is in most favour at the moment; the title of his latest album on which he tried to shake off the Slim Shady. Annoyingly for him, the best song on that disc was 'Without Me', performed from the point of view of alter ego number two. It doesn't matter how hard he tries to avoid it; people just want to be Eminem, as his assembled posse of 'talent' just goes to show. Step forward 50 Cent, Obie Trice et al, rappers whose best music coincidentally features the input of the man himself.<br/><br/>As if all that were not enough, identity number four is on the way in the shape of Rabbit, the role that Marshall plays in his movie debut 8 Mile, a seemingly autobiographical film set in the rap community of Detroit. His performance is impressive, skilfully avoiding the potential charges of simply playing himself in a nuanced role he was effectively born to play. This is indeed the Eminem Show, as Brittany Murphy may be a fine young actress but she has little to indicate that here and ditto Kim Basinger, who shines in the screen time that she is allowed, unfortunately not enough to see if she has regained L.A. Confidential form. The same can be said about her director, who has taken a critical mauling since producing his undeniable masterpiece. Hanson's dramatic pacing may be lacking in this film, but his awareness of the strength of the verbal material is admirable.<br/><br/>At a time when directors such as Quentin Tarantino talk about CGI sounding the 'death knell' for cinema, 8 Mile discovers a new found raw power in its rap battles, sequences that are both brutal and funny and executed to perfection by the talented cast. It at these moments that the man with the many names displays his exhilarating talent; delivering three songs that could well be the most searing pieces of hip hop ever captured on record. The best of these is 'Lose Yourself', the Oscar winning theme song that added just one more string to the man's bow, blowing bland formulaic fare such as U2's Gangs of New York ballad out of the water. 8 Mile may not be anywhere near the best film you'll see but as a showcase for a performer at the very apex of his career, it is second to none. Eminem has the world in the palm of his hand. What he chooses to do with it next may not involve cinema, but Hollywood has been sufficiently shook up for now."

","Marshal Mathers is the popular 'Eminem', which I will abbreviate M/M<br/><br/>because it is easier. Against the odds he became a successful white rapper amongst an almost all-black rapping backdrop in Detroit. What is revealed in this movie, and it makes sense, just being able to make rhymes does not make one a good rapper. You also have to be very intelligent with a superior vocabulary. That is why he succeeded, not because of anything else. This movie was a revelation of sorts for me, because I have almost ZERO interest in rappers and rap recordings (I will not call them music, for they are not). What this movie did for me was open my eyes to an important cross-section of the rapper environment. It is a well-made semi-documentary on the rise of M/M. However, for content and entertainment value I give it a rather low IMDb rating. I was, however, impressed with the acting of M/M. It<br/><br/>will be curious to see if he can handle a role that is not close to his own identity.<br/><br/>Of interest was the recreation of 'freestyle' rap contests, one-on-one, where the participants, eyeball-to-eyeball, do impromptu raps aimed at the other's weaknesses. The winner goes forward in this staged elimination tournament, and is apparently the proving grounds for aspiring rappers. Like open mike night at comedy clubs. In the DVD extras M/M explains that the story parallels his life, but in fact the character is NOT him, which gave them the freedom to be creative. He hopes the message one gets from the movie is ""It's up to you, if you want to make something of yourself.""<br/><br/>However, if a successful rapper doesn't nothing more with his fame than earn money, and not be a positive role model, then he has accomplished nothing."

And it's also a boarder line between rich and poor ones if it's possible to say it like this, roughly it means that on one side there are lots of people living in trailers while on the opposite side it's different-not so bad.The other really vital thing for you to know is what the battle among rappers means.It's not just stupid using of various words that could break them down.It's a battle in which you have to win, and if you lose, it's the worst thing that could ever happen to you. You have to put true and all your dislike and hate you have kept inside. For rappers it does mean a lot really. I liked the film also because it was not typical happy-ending one, and the main actor, Marshall Mathers acted perfectly, although it was his first film. He did it not only for money but mainly for people to understand him, and there was great cooperation with director."

The thing that surprises is that Marshall Bruce Mathers III (Em') is cool and collected before the camera. A bit one-note, but not a bad first try. Maybe his secret is that he couldn't care less about how he looks or acts - like the way he says things to offend people in his lyrics.<br/><br/>Wrong-side-of-the-tracks Detroit looks like the slum it really is and the support characters look real enough too.

","""8 Mile"", in its own right, is a towering achievement in reflecting the anguish, turmoil, survival, and fame of impoverished Detroit life. It is perhaps a personal account of Eminem's own struggles in discovering identity, in ""losing himself"" from the frustrations and injustices of his life in his music, in aspiring to break away from a ""street nobody"" to a vocal lyricist, lending his life experiences to his angry ""rhymes"". Yes indeed, this is an homage for anybody who has ever experienced constant affliction, deprivation, and discouragement, for anyone who is restrained from being themselves, who might finally receive a chance to stand up and ""lose themselves"". This is also very much a profile of poverty and its inhabitants, of crime and corruption and of surviving oppression and hopelessness. This is contemporary ghetto life in the slums of Detroit in a most explicit, honest presentation. The characters are irreverent, defiant, and infuriated, and it seems their only escape from their apparent despair lies in ""the shelter"", where they can relinquish all of their frustrations and perform ""battle"" with another, countering their conflictions through angry, relentless lyricism. Dark, enraged, and sometimes too dark and depressing, yet very inspirational, prolific study of poverty, confliction, and aspiration, in rising above adversities to achieve excellence. ***1/2 out of ****"

I think Eminem should carry on with his progress, because i think he is great and I'm a big fan of his. So keep up the good work Eminem. I like the way that Eminem has actually set out his past life and plotted it into a film because he finds this is an easy way to show people what he has been through. Eminem just started off as an ordinary rapper with not a lot of money but now he is a famous rapper and singer and all my mates like him and have loads of his albums and his 8 mile video. I hope i could be like eminem one day because hes wicked but he has a more stronger past than me and more of a story to tell. Eminem has many fans and maybe even more to come as the small children grow up. Whoever 8 mile is proper good and is a respected video.

The script is no more than average, it jumps all over the place and leaves us none the wiser - leaving a not particularly startling insight into B Rabbit's mind.<br/><br/>It also leaves lot of loose ends. For example - what exactly does happen to their home - and in the context of the film, does it actually matter? What is the significance of him driving by his ex-girlfriends house and what did it add to the film?<br/><br/>You could also see most of the plot twists coming from 8 miles away and the supporting characters are weak and not entirely believable.<br/><br/>
Future - for example dresses and acts like a daisy age hip-hopper. He sounds middle class and eloquent and really doesn't seem the type who would be a local success, hosting underground hip-hop battles. Alex's character is woefully underused and Kim Basinger just doesn't seem suited to her role of the trailer trash mum.<br/><br/>The comedy element in Cheddar Bob just doesn't work and ends up being grating and predictable rather than amusing. He is seriously overused, especially as his sole purpose seems to be to give Eminem the inspiration for his final battle.<br/><br/>Also, as it is set in inner city poverty in an extremely violent city, in the middle of the gangsta rap era, why is the pulling of a gun in a fight seen as something horrendously shocking? Why are none of the characters involved in anything illegal?<br/><br/>In short - it comes across like a bad student of wong kar wai's incidental, isolationist style of film making having a crack at a 21st century rocky story."

","A loosely fictionalized biography of Eminem is given the Hollywood treatment by noted director Curtis Hanson (`L.A. Confidential') with the rapper essentially playing himself. It's a very watchable movie, screenwriter Scott Silver's hip-hop variation on `Saturday Night Fever'; it's also not much of a stretch for all concerned (it's hard not to be convincing when you're essentially playing yourself) and not a whole lot of passion gets generated. Instead, much of the time is spent in self-admiration of its design and purpose, a tough-acting `exploration' of a `sub-culture'. Hanson insists on constantly using a handheld camera (the cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto who also shot `Frida') but rather than provide immediacy, the typically glossy Universal Studio sheen makes this look only slightly different from an episode of `N.Y.P.D. Blue'. Eminem, far from the angry young man persona that's brought him notoriety, seems positively charitable, with the screenplay giving him a haloed aura, a poor, responsible (he loves his little sister), hardworking white waif desperate to make his way into a black culture that wants nothing more than to see him fail, trying to find love in the process (only to be misled by career-driven schemer Brittany Murphy, whose character is sorely underdeveloped); needless to say, as relaxed as he looks, he seems compromised. The supporting cast is filled with solid, professional actors who strip the film of the street credibility it's desperately trying to push across; particularly unconvincing is Kim Basinger, playing Eminem's white trash mom--cast in a purely sympathetic role, no matter how she tries (unfortunately, not very much), she radiates glamour. Other actors include Mekhi Phifer and Evan Jones (in the pathetic-follower role that Barry Miller got to play first in `Saturday Night Fever')."

She was OK, but they could have casted a better actress. She looks too good for white trash, and I didn't get her southern accent since this is set in Detroit.  Also, Brittany Murphey doesn't do much. I mean, the movie doesn't even show if she dated Rabbit; it just shows her being some slut by hooking up with Rabbit at his job.<br/><br/>And another thing is Eminem looks too old to play his character. You would think Rabbit would be some 20 year old, but Eminem looks 30.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  I would recommend this just because I like stories like this. But, it was slow and boring in parts and not for everyone. If you hate rap music, definitely don't see this."

","8 mile is a decent movie, but the Karate Kid formula is getting old.  It is this cliche Hollywood formula that drags down the movie for me.  This is the urban retelling of the Karate Kid, just substitute rap battles for karate tournaments.  And yes there is a Mr. Miyagi character played by Mekhi Pfifer, just none of the ""wax on...wax off""...but wait he does tell the DJ to spin the record, so in essence he IS telling the DJ to turn the ""wax"" on and off.  Hmmmmm.<br/><br/>There is even a group of rappers called the Free World that are this movie's equivalent of the Cobra Kai.  And you guessed it, they harass our poor protagonist Eminem.  The analogies can go on and on....see if you can spot the rap equivalent of ""The Crane.""  Actually get together with some of your friends and this could be a great drinking game...see if you can spot all The Karate Kid similarities.<br/><br/>Granted, this formula is still fun to watch at times, and this movie is one of the better recreations of it, but I think what tainted it for me was the fact that this movie held itself out to be of dramatic importance and full of depth.  Even some critics led you to believe that this film is full of dramatic power.  It really isn't.  Watch it for the formulaic fun that it can be, especially if you like rap music, but don't forget the formula from whence it came.  Maybe we could even get a sequel where Eminem-san will use the rap equivalent of ""The Drum.""  We can only hope.  Til then...""Wax on...wax off...wax on ...wax off..."""
"movieguy1021","5","0","2","27 June 2003"," 8 Mile: 5/10
","Basically, Eminem's acting `showcase' 8 Mile is one thing: unremarkable. Acting is unremarkable, direction, location, music, plot, all basic and nothing to write home about. About the only thing that could be said about this movie is the amount of language that was used (although it's nowhere near as much as South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut), and that's not something to brag about. The characters were all basic, no or barely any development to them, and they were just general people in Detroit.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing new, just basically a `day in the life of' movie. We follow Jimmy Smith, Jr. (Eminem). Could screenwriter Scott Silver think of a cleverer name? His nickname is Bunny Rabbit, aka Rabbit, aka B-Rabbit, and he's a struggling rapper who has to move in with his mom Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), while being the only white rapper out there, being that this is supposed to be semi-autobiographical. He is `discriminated' against, but he works his way uplove these deep plots in movies today!<br/><br/>Well, what's there to talk about? I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, because there WERE none. I would have liked some development to all of the characters, since most of them were just thrown in there. Also, since everyone looked exactly the same, it was hard to tell everyone apart (well, obviously). We find out bits and pieces of Jimmy, Future (Mekhi Phifer), and Alex (Brittany Murphy), who pops up in various places. She must have used tons of hair gel to get her hair to stick out to make her look in poverty. LOOK in poverty, which isn't as good as Murphy actually acting like she was poor.<br/><br/>Eminem's acting was like this movie was: either love-it-or-hate-it. As in the movie, I didn't love it nor hate it. He's not that great of an actor-he shouldn't quit his day job-but he's not like Charlize Theron. Basinger, after winning Best Supporting Actress in another Curtis Hanson movie (L.A. Confidential), thought she could be worthy of another one, and she tried, by God she tried, but I'm sorry, you just didn't cut it. Phifer was okay, while Murphy was stiffer than her hair was during the movie.<br/><br/>Something that made this movie hard to believe is that it was `based' on Eminem's life. I can NOT believe this. This is not where Eminem had to live, it just seems so wrong. Also, I couldn't make sense out of that everyone was using the f- and n- word every second and had nowhere to go but still used 50-cent words. Basically, after you see 8 Mile, you won't learn anything new, your life won't be changed, you'll just have used up two hours of your life.<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong language, sexuality, some violence and drug use."

","I will never understand why such a talented director, Curtis Hanson, would make such a boring, cliche, unoriginal, uninspired movie. Eminem winning an oscar? Hollywood needs to pulls it's head from it's own ass and see where the true talent is.<br/><br/>I know all you ""hardcore"" white suburban kids can relate to this, God knows why considering you know NOTHING about oppression and hatred except that which he bring upon yourself, but if you're going to write a review don't call a movie ""tight"". THat's not even the meaning behind that word. Ebonics is not a real language.<br/><br/>That said, this movie stunk. Not one bit of originality behind it. How many times can they make a damn movie about someone trying to make it and being the odds? I know most of the people who thought this and Eminem can't count that high, but this didn't even give us a little plot twist.<br/><br/>I do have to say the rap battles at the end were well done, but its not worth sitting through to get there. Eminem is a good actor? Please. he had one expression and one way of delivering every line in the movie. NO ONE IS THAT MONOTONE is real life. and it's just like his music. He's a whinny little poor-me brat, just like most of the spoiled white kids out there who's parents but them his albums. Granted he came from nothing but enough. We get that you had it bad, HAD, and your mother was mean to you and your dad left, and people put you down. Well, now your rich and you complain about that? Get a life man, millions of people would love to be in your position. Why don't you do something intelligent like putting a positive message in your music, Stan was good, but that's it. And producing 50 Cent? Don't get me started on him. That is DUMB MUSIC for DUMB PEOPLE.<br/><br/>
But don't worry all you new to puberty spolied suburban white kids, I used to be like you when I was your age, not as rude or dumb, but you'll grow up one day.<br/><br/>Bottom line...movie was OVER RATED and poorly paced. Boring as expected coming from an overrated singer. Better luck next time Madonna."

","I must admit that even though I do not like Eminem's music, the surmise of the film did intrigue me. Indeed watching the film I felt that I had much to identify with. However you realise that anybody with any dream could identify with this picture!<br/><br/>This may seem like a good thing, however it is a flaw. That is because once you start thinking about the accesibility of the film. You begin to realise that this is an extremely manipulative picture, which basically exists as public relations for Eminem. It is also a nice little money maker for Hollywood. People in PR get paid loads of money, money that I can only dream about. I therefore resent being made to watch PR by an an acclaimed director on my time! This film will obviously cause even more teenagers to think that Eminem is the second coming of Christ. You can almost hear the cash registers at Hollywood opening with glee at this film. What is apparent, more than anything else here is Hollywood in its greed hurriedly cashing in on the Eminem fad.<br/><br/>The cinematography is something that stuck out to me. What is shown is a very hard looking, poverty stricken Detroit. A Detroit that is full of ex-cons and welfare mums. It is obviously the perfect and humble base on which to start a superstar's life. The city looks real but everything walking around in it is false. The question of why the city is doing so poorly is again sidestepped and the viewer isn't told what is keeping these people in crap jobs. This factor makes the film kind of exploitative, its taking hip hop and rap, playing it to the masses as if saying, 'here is something cool and interesting.' But at the same time ignoring the whole hip hop history by not looking at why rap first came to Detroit.<br/><br/>The characters come across as fakes and phonies. Firstly you have Eminem himself playing Rabbit. he is portrayed as brooding and introspective, yet sensitive to the needs of others. He does this by being kind to Cheddar Bob who shoots himself in the leg. He makes fun of Exhibit but only to stick up for the homosexual man at his work. His tirades against women in the film are justified because all except 'the virgin,' his little sister, betray him in some way. In fact the sister seems to be nothing more than another emotional button to press on the audience. Eminem seems to have the biggest virgin/whore complex that I have ever witnessed in an entertainer. What is happening is that media spin  tactics are being forced, like bits of broken glass, jaggedly down the viewers throat. O'l Curtis is maximising Eminems conventional side and his working class ethic to work hard and succeed. On the other hand we have dodgy Curtis downplaying the negative side of Eminem, such as his noted homophobia and his misogynistic hatred of women. Well they gave him a sister so he must love women right?<br/><br/>His friends also are about as real as Hulk Hogan and the other characters from the WWF. There is, Future, who is obviously based partially on Dre. He is Eminems mentor and almost personifies support. His other friends are just paragons of loyalty and support. How could a woman ever compare to his posse? Yet he is homophobic, maybe not. Maybe he likes hanging loose with the boyz!<br/><br/>All of Eminems friends are bad in a ghetto sought of way, but not really bad. Actually and predictably they all have hearts of gold. None of them, of course, use guns and this issue is sidestepped. It's more played up for comic effect with the scene with Cheddar Bob. Naughty Curtis has lil Kim Basinger screech her way into the epitome of bad mothers so she can become yet another symbol of adversity for Eminem. When she won the lottery after her bastard boyfriend left her. I just groaned. Can it get any more corny? I wondered this with beer. Yes it could and the ending with Eminem in rap battles shows just how corny one film can be.<br/><br/>Rabbit had to lose his first competition, why? Well to truly find himself in a macho sought of way he must go through a series of masochistic episodes. He is kicked out of his apartment by his ex. He is forced to move back into the trailer with his hated Mommy and then finally has to take a beating. Only through pain can he develop his identity enough to use it as a kind of weapon in the last part of the film. Calling himself trash and a bum he goes onto win the freestyle comp through what I call poverty rap. Eminem is not a gangster like Ice Cube or Tupac. However he gets kudos for being poor. This is enough to win him the competition because Papa Doc his competition is found out to be a poseur from a private school and has the real name of Clarence. Clarence loses his 'blackness' and Eminem gains street cred for being 'real.'<br/><br/>The end is the most interesting part of the film. Eminem just goes bact to work. He decides not to team up with his mentor, Future as an announcer at the club. Neither does he hang out with his buddies. What is the point? They no longer serve any purpose within the narrative of the story. He walks off into the distance like big 'ol John Wayne in any Western. It is odd because this is a film that draws two cultures together and now it pulls them back apart. Huh? Start the debate on this scene someone.<br/><br/>I give this film a 5.5 rabid, foaming dawg D.J. battles out of 10 or a C. Next time Eminem have some balls and make sure Inholywood represents life in the ghetto properly. Everybody sees through this!"

","*slight spoilers about the ending which you already knew before seeing the movie*<br/><br/>After watching this, I was reminded of Eddie Murphy's stand-up act, making fun of the italians screaming ""go Rockooooooo!"" after Rocky defeats yet another Black Guy.<br/><br/>On one hand, the movie is well-shot and doesn't feel like an Eminem commercial. On the other, you KNOW that despite whatever appeareances, it IS an Eminem commercial. I could see in my mind a scene of a writer presenting his script to the movie label, and then a bunch of white executives/producers sitting around in a fancy meeting room, ivory backscratchers in one hand, scotch whiskeys in the other, and deciding to change the black lead to Eminem to make more money (after all, movie audiences don't respond well to minority actors), and hey, maybe linking it to an album! Things like that genuinely prevent me from completely marking out to a movie, they stay in the back of my head and are forever associated with it.<br/><br/>Now, on to the movie itself. Like I said, it's well-done. Every character's acting feels natural (probably because they're just supposed to be natural, there's no real acting involved), except Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy, who can't possibly pass as ""street"" characters. The director probably thought their names would give the movie more credibility, but in the end it did more harm than good.<br/><br/>The movie builds up great, but kinda loses track in the final 30-40 minutes. It's hard to put into words how, it's just that you let yourself be lead all throughout without commenting ""they should've done this, done that"", and then it starts slowly derailing and you end up feeling it could've been great if only they did this or that. Things like pointless temper outbursts on the part of Eminem, bad dynamic in the plot progression, things that are only there to trigger the next event, even though they don't go with the flow of the movie, etc.<br/><br/>A few minor flaws do get to me. Like I already mentionned, this is Rapping Rocky. Except unlike boxing, where the winner is the guy left standing, the winner in the rap battles isn't as clearly defined. During the ending, Eminem ""defeats"" two other rappers, thanks to the vote-like cheering of the audience. Supposedly he won because everyone felt his lyrics were more powerful, except his lyrics weren't as good as Lyckety's or Lotto's. And yet you watch him advance to the next round. Odd. And whatever happened with his pregnant girlfriend? She stopped existing because Brittany Murphy showed up?<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a good movie, and worth watching if you can get over the fact that it's tied so close with the black community's equivalent of bubblegum pop music."

I would like to see another film with him in it not on this subject, before I would give him a full review of his acting. I had seen this kind of plot before, poor guy goes so far and gets rich & famous. They could've used some different actors in this movie, i.e. Basinger could've tried harder. But there is a good overall feeling to it, and leaves you waiting for more at the last scene.

"mpofarrell","6","0","1","14 April 2003"," Stuck In Detroit
","To anyone over 30 and not familiar with rap music and its culture, watching Curtis Hanson's 8 MILE is bound to be a rather distancing experience. But given an open mind and the willingness to accept the movie on its own terms, this semi-fictional account of white rapper Eminem's nascent rise to fame has its rewards. That it's your basic ""A Star is Born"" story coupled with references to past ""troubled youth"" movies (the films of James Dean come to mind) makes the movie quite accessible to older audiences. Shorn of its profane language (there's a lot of it)and obligatory sex scenes, 8 MILE is a rather unremarkable tale of a young man's desire to escape the confines of work and life in downtown Detroit for a better life as a successful recording artist.<br/><br/>At every turn Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith is confronted by stumbling blocks, be they domestic (his ""trailer trash"" mom is dating one of his former high school chums), work related (he's not on good terms with the boss at the auto pressing plant), or social (he's an outsider, being a white rapper in a Black rappers' world.) The world of contemporary Detroit, circa 1995, dominates this movie as much as Eminem's star performance. Eminem (real name, Marshall Mathers, for the uninformed) portray's a version of himself here - a kinder, gentler version. His Rabbit, for all the swearing and incendiary rap lyrics, is deep down a sweet natured fellow given to occasional outbursts of angry frustration, understandable considering what he has to deal with. As with ""Rocky"", another movie that vaguely resembles this new film, 8 MILE gets a lot of mileage out of pitting our hero against seemingly unbeatable odds . The city of Detroit, depicted here in all it's paint-peeling austerity by noted cinematographer Rodrigo Priesto, would give anyone pause. This kid's triumph over adversity makes for a fairly absorbing film experience, but aside from it's distinction as Eminem's fist big movie, the overall impression is one of numbing deja vu. What gives the project distinction is Eminem's very appealing performance. Under the expert guidance of director Hanson, Eminem proves to be a magnetic screen personality. Not a natural actor, he does come blazingly alive when he's in his own element. The rap music sequences are compulsively watchable, even though the uninitiated may weary of them after awhile.<br/><br/>Dramatic scenes involving Rabbit's mom (played in convincing, frowzy fashion by the usually gorgeous Kim Basinger) are realistically put forth, and there is able support by other cast members, particularly Mekhi Phifer as a rap club owner and Tarryn Manning, striking in the brief role of Rabbit's ex girlfriend.<br/><br/>Unlike most of Mr. Hanson's previous films, 8 MILE lacks the narrative drive that made L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE RIVER WILD so distinctive. For all its kitchen sink drama and stabs at realism, it emerges as only a middling achievement."

","Two kinds of filmgoers may want to see 8 Mile, fans of Rap/Eminem and those who thought Curtis Hanson's ""LA Confidential"" was one of the best films of the last few years. Eminem films are likely to be very happy. The high vote given the film by females under 18 confirms that. Eminem turns out to be a surprisingly good actor and the music is brilliant.<br/><br/>Followers of Curtis Hanson like me may be less enthusiastic. The film is certainly interesting and well made, but lacks the mix of excitement, tension, mystery, comedy, sex, drama and star performances that makes LA Confidential interesting to watch over and over again. Eminem plays Jimmy's, whose relationships with his friends, family, workmates and girlfriends are well handled, as are his efforts to break into the commercial world of Rap music. But this is all quite low-key stuff compared with the dazzle of LA Confidential. And Detroit at night or gloomy daylight is at the opposite end of the USA to sunny Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Maybe there lies a clue to why Curtis Hanson chose to make this film.

","Eminem plays aspiring rapper Jimmy (nickname Rabbit') who lives in a trailer in Detroit with his mother (Kim Basinger) and his little sister. The story of 8 Mile' is pretty uneventful.  When we first meet Rabbit', he has just broken up with his girlfriend but he soon finds new romance in the form of Brittany Murphy.  We see him hanging out with his buddies and by day, he works at a steel pressing plant while trying to build up the nerve to compete in the rap duels' which take place at the local club.  Although Rabbit' has the raw talent, his nerves get the better of him at his first attempt and he freezes when he is passed the microphone while an all black audience heckles him.<br/><br/>The lead role is one which is hardly going to stretch Eminem but he does give a credible performance and I emerged from the cinema liking him a bit more than when I went in.  <br/><br/>8 Mile' is a very well acted film but I did not find it a great film.  This is one which will be enjoyed more by rap fans.  During the rapping scenes, I felt like I would have benefited if the speed of the lyrics were either slowed down or printed on the screen as subtitles.  Also, the ending was a little abrupt which for me took away the sense of personal triumph which Rabbit' must have been feeling."

","I was very surprised by the lightness of the film, having heard that this was the unofficial story of how Eminem started, and hearing how tough and violent his life had been, I had thought this film was going to be far grittier and tougher than it was. As it stands, I was surprised by the ease of the life of the character, he had a job, his Mum was actually not that bad, and many of the fights that were started were purely down to him. However, that said about the story, the Rap battles were powerful and enjoyable, and some of the scenes have surprising humour  I laughed so much when the poor guy shot himself. Eminem also shows a good talent for acting; although one would suspect he is simply playing the character he played most of his life. Overall, a good movie, but if, as the title song suggests, you have one chance at making it, this characters chance wasn't that apparent. A not truly bad family life, and life just seems to turn around for everyone before our hero's chance seems to arrive, and after all that it doesn't seem like a payoff after all, especially for something that promises a feel-good pay off."
"Thund3rheart","3","0","1","5 February 2003"," Two hours of Hip-Hop promotion, salvaged by solid Eminem performance
","My biggest problem perhaps is that I'm not a fan of Hip-Hop music and hence I do not enjoy the work of Eminem. Even so, I thought I'll give the movie a shot, even if I did not though tat Eminem could act. On this point however, I was surprised. Eminem does a solid performance of portraying the white guy in the black gangs of The Motor City. I must confess it's one of the better performances I've seen for a while, especially when it came from a performer that has music as a head act. The movie however is really about, nothing. Rabbit (Eminem) is trying to get a record contract as an rap artist. Other than that it's really just a bunch of friends roaming the streets of Detroit. I might've enjoyed the picture more had I been a fan of rap music. I gave this movie a 3, but I strongly suggest anyone to see it, because of the performance by Eminem, it shows that not all celeberties that try to make a career in motion pictures are totally out of context. Totally unknown cast besides Kim Bassinger's role as Stephanie.<br/><br/>Generally, with total resistance from hip-hip fans, this is a promotion for hip-hop music as well as it plays a major role in Eminem's road to remembarance. Eminem started out as the kid that does anything, sings about anything and almost harrasses other people, including his mother. As time passes, he starts to soften up, because now he's famous. It all started with writing the song where he apologized to his mother, who was furious at this time. Now he's moved on to portray a soft and caring person in a motion picture. There's a reason why he doesn't portray a bad ghetto gangster in this movie. Even so, great performance!"

","The track record of rappers-turned-actors, and hip-hop films is not good. So lets get one thing straight, this is not a bad film. Also Eminem is the best thing about it, acting the likes of Basinger off the screen. What lets the film down is the script. It really is ""Rocky"" in old-skool sneakers. So it's not a classic, and a disappointment after Hanson's previous work; but it's still a very watchable film."

Now about the movie itself, it builds up slowly, lots of details describing his youth(i guess), has some comedy in it, some drama, but overall i think it tries to show he(Eminem or Jimmy, hard to tell) is really not that bad of a person, which might be kind of exaggerated. I liked watching it, but i think the end should've been different, its like they ran out of film and had to make a quick ending....what a pity.<br/><br/>Recommendations: if you don't know what to go see and you don't hate eminem, check it out."
"mark000","6","0","1","5 January 2003"," Definitely a Stroke movie for Eminem
","This movie shows some of the grit of modern day mo-town.  The acting is generally solid, and while the story may be in-part autobiographical, it's one big tribute to Eminem.  He's heroic in almost every scene, saving little girls, trying to get his mom on the right path, sticking up for his love interest until he finds out she's sleeping around, overcoming racist black folk in Detroit who don't want him to succeed, and spreading his genius for rapping.  It doesn't get overly laughable, but it is ridiculous at times. The tension in many scenes is good, and the dirt and seediness are captured. If you're a big fan of Eminem, you'll probably like this movie, but all in all, I give this a modest recommendation.  To the extent the film is biographical, it appears to be quite biased."

","One upon a time there was a film, which starred a rapper that took place on the broken streets of a worn down town. The film dealt with such issues as friendship and striving to achieve greatness with the very little you have been given. That film was called Boyz N The Hood and it has come to be one of the most powerful blacksplotion flicks to every emerge from Hollywood. Now, over ten years later, we have 8 Mile, a film starring number one selling rapper Eminem, that touches on some of the same basic principles as Boyz... Foul-mouthed,  white-boy rapper who feuds with his mom and tries to raise his young daughter (this must have been a real stretch for our star). Rabbit lives in a trailer with his mom and her boyfriend whom he hates and vice versa. He wants to be a rapper but finds it a struggle not only with the crowds but also with himself to follow through with his dream. In the opening scene we see Rabbit in the washroom of a local club called the Shelter preparing himself for a battle. But as his eyes gaze over the room he catches a quick glimpse of himself in the mirror and throws up. Seems that maybe Rabbit doesn't have the belief in himself that we first thought he did. For the rest of the film his must face every imaginable roadblock that life can throw at him. He gets in a fight with his mom's boyfriend and gets kicked out, he finds his girl having sex with one of his friends in the studio where he was supposed to record his demo and he keeps getting hassled by another group of rappers known as Free World. The trailer showed this film as being a hard-edged, gritty drama but it seems that the film is nothing more than one big practical joke. Eminem is probably laughing right now as he is sitting in his multi-million dollar mansion counting our hard-earned money. See every time you think the film is going to throw something serious at your face it instead throws a sucker-punch and slaps you with a bit of comedy, ruining the entire build-up of the scene. For example Rabbit comes home to hear that his mom and her boyfriend are fighting. He asks her what's wrong. ""He heard about the eviction?"" He asks her. Her reply is no, the problem is that he won't go down on her. In the film's first single Loose Yourself Emienm sings ""You better loose yourself in the music, the moment, your own it, you better never let it go."" I suppose that this song is referring to the rap-offs he takes place in know as battles because that is the only rapping he does this entire film. But if that is the case I don't know what there is to loose yourself in. These battles consist of no more than two rappers who are given 45 seconds to see who can be the most offensive to the other. Some of the lyrics during these battles are even as much as boarder-line comedy. The best way to describe watching this film would be to compare it to listening to Eminem's music. You listen to a song like Loose Yourself and you feel that maybe Eminem isn't just some money making gimmick. He sings about following your dreams and making the best out of what life gives you. Then you flip to a song like The Real Slim Shady or Without me, exposing him for what he really is. I found myself thinking through films most effective moments ""how can I take a guy seriously who sings about gay bashing."" This film only got made because Eminem sold a million records. That's not to say that Eminem did a bad job in the acting department. In fact he handled himself rather well for his first role, but again, even though he gave a good performance I still couldn't help but get a feeling of insincerity while watching him. Next comes Kim Basinger as Rabbit's mom. Basinger seems to be trying so hard that her performance comes off as hammy and over-played. I guess no one let her in on the joke, she acts as if she is the only one on screen trying to do a professional job. I happen to like Mekhi Phifer a lot. I thought he was very good in O and he appears to be carrying this film on his shoulders. His character is a sign of hope and strong ethical friendships, a man who will not let anyone who he believes in fail and Phifer gets that across rather well. Within the film there appears to be two scenes that aren't either making a mockery of themselves or being just plain boring. On in which Rabbit gets into a fight with his mom's boyfriend and during his angry fit of rage, consisting of a stream of never-ending profanity, he sees his daughter and instantly stops. The other is of the same nature when his daughter is witnessing him beat the crap out of his mom's boyfriend. Both of these scenes just broke my heart because it seems so horrifying that an innocent child could be subject to such inhuman acts. Because these two were the most effective I was disappointed that the film didn't show more of the personal relationship between Rabbit and his daughter. In fact almost everything the film presents is almost immediately dropped. To talk about why this film didn't work entertainment wise was mainly due to bad scripting. In Boyz... we were able to feel the central characters pain because we lived a day in his shoes and went through all of his hardships. There were also very powerful lines like ""can't we just have one night where nobody gets shot?"" There are no powerful, or even all that meaningful lines in this film. We are never really given the change to know Rabbit either. He goes into his wild fits of rage but never slows down to explain his state and let the audience feel for him, making the film rather boring. If we have no information about a character how can we feel for them? If we can't care for them how can we enjoy watching them? See where I am going? Also the story is just plain bad due to its sketchiness. We know that Rabbit's dream is to become a rapper and his talks about making his demo but the film packs up and ends so quickly that we never really figure out what Rabbit's future could hold for him and if he will pursue his dreams. We are also left without any concrete message that the film is supposedly trying to get across. The final scene shows Rabbit walking down an alley, when the music kicks in. At that point I thought to myself ""Finally the film is going to get started. Just then the scene cut to black and the credits started rolling. I had to sit for a moment in silence and wonder what I was supposed to make of what I had just saw. So when it comes down to it, this was a film that could have been but wasn't quite because it failed to possess the emotion it needed to accomplish its purpose and instead just threw together a bunch of rehashed material to fit its big star."
"javamikey","5","0","1","1 December 2002"," Points of View on 8 MILE
","I saw him in concert.  I even bought his new CD this past summer.  But the movie kind of fell short of winning me over.  Some of it felt more like a PR campaign than a movie.<br/><br/>To combat Eminem's rep of being a bad role model for kids, the movie shows him concerned for what his little sister sees.  For the flack he got over making homosexual remarks, the movie shows him using his rapping skills to defend a gay co-worker.  But, to keep his street cred, he then fires a paintball gun at a parked police cruiser to show he's still a young buck with edge.<br/><br/>As far as his relationship with his buddies, that was kind of odd how he never really seemed to respect them.  It's as if they were just people he rode with on the bus - and he never got too close because he planned to get off at the next stop.  Even after he insulted them, they still treated him like some kind of superstar instead of smacking him across the mouth and flying without him for a while.<br/><br/>But the oddest part of the movie was Brittany Murphy's character.  She's a wonderful actress.  But, the motive for her character thinking he's so great based on the little she observed of him was a stretch.<br/><br/>They really could have had fun with her character by making her a puppet who was being used by the threatening posse to entice B-Rabbit to do a deal with them.  That way, it shows two ways to get what you want: To want the dream so bad that you'd sell yourself and do anything... or to go your own way and keep your integrity.  That could have been a good story point.<br/><br/>Even after B-Rabbit finds his new lover having sex with his supposed friend, there was a fist fight between the males but never a frank discussion between man and woman about what happened, why it happened, and what this meant.<br/><br/>In a further blow to his manhood, had his mother not been totally lucky and won bingo, he, his mom, and his little sister would have been evicted from their trailer. I guess the bingo solution was easier (and better for Em's fans) than showing B-Rabbit having no money to keep them from getting evicted.<br/><br/>But what the hell.  It was fun anyway.  :}"

","Alright, after seeing 8 Mile I have decided that it is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  I don't think there is any way I can compile a definitive statement on how bad I felt the movie was so I will simply list all my gripes about the movie.  I am going to spoil some of the movie so if you haven't seen this movie yet you may not want to read this.<br/><br/>1) Eminem gets to beat up a guy twice his size because it's his movie.<br/><br/>2) The scene where they have sex in the factory is just stupid.  You can't do that.<br/><br/>3) The scene where Rabbit is trapped in a burning building and can't get out.  Dramatic music starts playing and it gets really tense like OH MY GOD WHAT WILL HAPPEN.  Then he very calmly and cooly goes and jumps out the window and nothing happens.  The movie just leads you one way and then cuts back another way and does it quite poorly.<br/><br/>4) The cameramen and cinematographer have an inexcusably bad understanding of how to shoot a movie.  The camera jumps from one side of a scene to another completely at random.  This may not bother some people but for me it's very jarring and disorienting and makes the movie look amateurish.<br/><br/>5) Another technical gripe.  The lighting is dramatic ALL THE TIME.  In every scene one side of Rabbit's face is completely blacked out.  Even in scenes where there is clearly a light source on the dark side of his face.<br/><br/>6) Why do the people who've just burned down a building (a felony) just stand around proud of themselves and not even worry for a second about cops or anything?<br/><br/>7) There are about five scenes in the movie where Rabbit's crappy car wont start.<br/><br/>8) They never say whether the little girl in the movie is his daughter or his sister.  I am guessing sister but they could have made it clearer.<br/><br/>9) The movie has no introduction and no conclusion.  You are just thrust suddenly in to Rabbit's trailer-park life and how he has just broken up with his girlfriend but there's no real explaination or background for either of those.  In some movies they do this well where there's some mystery about things that are slowly revealed, but in 8 Mile there is no purpose for this.<br/><br/>10) The ending of the movie has no point.  He wins the battle, his friend offers for him to host the battles with him, and he says ""No, I just gotta do my own thing."" and walks off down an alley.  What's the point?<br/><br/>11) The whole point of the movie is how these people are all living their lives wrong and not doing anything and are never going to get better.  But then his mom goes to bingo and wins $3200 dollars.  Not every movie has to have a cheery ending or a beautiful message, but what kind of a moral is that?!<br/><br/>12) More about the ending.  I couldn't tell whether it all worked out for him in the end and they lived happily-ever-after or if his life got screwed up.  What happened?!  What's the point of all this?!<br/><br/>13) People say this is supposed to be such an accurate description of early/mid-ninties Detroit.  I have two problems with that.  Does everyone in the entire town rap?  Is it really that hard to replicate conditions of an urban setting a whopping 10 years ago?<br/><br/>14) What is the point of that other white guy Cheddar Bob who shoots himself in the groin?  I mean, you could say comic relief but he's really more stupid than funny, and all his other friends are by far funnier (i.e. when one of them calls the other one Fredrick Douglas)<br/><br/>That's all the complaints about this movie that I have the energy to think up right now.  I have nothing against Eminem, and his acting surprisingly was not the worst part of this movie.  However I hope this horrible movie discourages him from trying to act and sticking to rapping, which not-surprisingly was the best part of this movie."

","Granted, this movie was not horrible and I was surprised to see that Eminem could actually act.  While watching this movie I was entertained and did actually care about the characters.  It was when the movie ended I became indifferent about it.<br/><br/>For about a week and a half before the movie released in theaters, movie critics from all over were hailing this film and giving out accolades like water in a marathon.  Because of all this I went to this movie with relatively high expectations and they were not met.  Sure the movie is entertaining for the 2 hours it runs and it does have some neat rap/flow scenes, but in the end I did not really see the point the movie was trying to stress.  For the type of movie it is it left you hanging and wondering about it too much.  It seems as if the film makers wanted to make this film as real as possible (which they successfully did) that they forgot the reason that they were making the movie.<br/><br/>Now, I did enjoy the movie for the most part, but I kept waiting for something to happen that would turn the plot and it never did.  It is not a movie I would watch again nor would I recommend it (the audience who will appreciate it for what it is worth is a definite younger audience).<br/><br/>Because the movie kept me decently entertained but really put out no substance I give 8 MILE a 6/10."
"odor007","Null","0","1","17 November 2002"," Silly and Ignorant...mediocre at best
","I went to see ""8 Mile"" because of three reasons; 1.  Curtis Hanson, the director, who also did the wonderful ""LA Confidential.""  2.  Kim Basinger, who is both beautiful as well as a talented actor.  3.  Rodrigo Pierto, the cinematographer, who also did the cinematography for the fabulous, gritty, Mexican film, ""Amores Perros.""  But despite all these pros, the movie was a disappointment.  The script was no more than serviceable, and had nothing original or interesting about it. The acting was good from Kim Basinger, but wow--she was so mis-cast that I was surprised--they tried their best to cover her amazing beauty with make up, wrinkles, and dirty clothes, to portray her as a drunken trailer-park mom, but it was obvious she was only a few years older than Eminem himself, and never could be his mom.  Mekhi Phifer was by far the best actor in the film, but again, the script was so average that not even his acting abilities could show through the crap.  The film centered on the baby-faced (I'm sure neither him nor his fans want to see him that way), wannabe tough-guy Eminem who slowly ruins nearly every positive relationship he has around him, and then has to go back and apologize.  During all this conflict, I kept wondering to myself...why should I care whatsoever about some poor white kid that wants to rap and who can't seem to express himself clearly?  Besides all this, I dislike rap completely, but believe Eminem to be someone who is changing the music--he doesn't center on girls, cars, and jewelry, and seems to stay true to himself.  But I was disappointed to see that the only rapping in the film takes place in the desperately dark and grungy clubs where ignorant verbal battles take place to gain respect in the terd-of-a-neighborhood.   The rappers go at it one after the other in these clubs, and the audience eventually chooses who's insults they liked the best.<br/><br/>SPOILERS__  And by the end of the film, we see Eminem win the rap contest and walk back to work.  The film seemed too long in the first place because of the lack of action and the horrible dialogue, but by the end the audience needed more--it was too suggestive.  The ""MC Bob"" character was really clichÃ© and stupid--he was the classic ""Hollywood"" character in these big dramatic films starring someone famous who provides the Jester-like comic relief.  He's so annoying that at one point he shoots himself in his groin, and all we can do is laugh at the stupidity of it all.  By the end you will leave unsatisfied and wondering--how else could I have spent that $10?  I wouldn't even see this again on video.  Eminem and Curtin Hanson are money-obsessed sellouts that never should be forgiven for this level of crap.  And that's all I gots to say."
"easmith03","5","0","1","17 November 2002"," Not much there.
","I will qualify my review by saying I'm in my 40's, lived in the suburbs my whole life, and I tend to avoid rap music.  However, I have heard a few Eminem songs that I like, and I had heard the movie wasn't really featuring a lot of rap music.  So, I had an expectation of a movie about a guy using his talent to pursue his music career.  And, that is kind of what the movie was about... kind of.  <br/><br/>The movie certainly portrays people in dire circumstances.  They drive cars that barely run.  they live in places that are barely inhabitable.  I don't know how realistic it is, but it is certainly gritty.  ""Bunny"" (Eminem) is seeking a better life through his music career.  He has an interesting band of friends that all seem close, and supportive.  One character was impossibly dim-witted.  But, the others came across as decent people, with distinct personalities and life goals.  They are are depending on Bunny to be a big hit as a rapper.  <br/><br/>The acting was varied.  I thought Eminem was a little wooden, he would go from very kind and sensitive, to quite hostile and violent with not too much in between.  His gang of friends were all good, with Mekhi Phifer's character being the most interesting.  Brittany Murphy's character Alex seemed kind of out of place.  I'm not sure that the ""love interest"" really did much for the story.  The rival ""rap gang"", were kind of one dimensional also, but they weren't given a lot to do.  <br/><br/>As Bunny pursues his rap career we see a dismal failure early in the movie when he ""chokes"" and has to walk off stage.  He seems to now have a stage fright, and he is determined to purse a rap career, without rapping in public.  It would seem like there would be a chance for a big climatic conclusion in the movie with with him making a triumphant return to the stage, and winning over the crowd... <br/><br/>*** spoilers follow ***<br/><br/>This does kind of happen.  However, the big rap contest at the end turns out to be a ""rapping out insults"" contest.  So, rather than get Eminim's big smash hit song for the movie, you get a couple of episodes of him insulting people better than they insulted him.  With each witty zinger, the crowd ooo's and aaah's its approval.  But, while mildly entertaining, it wasn't as much fun as listening to one of his real songs, and the conclusion was no more dramatic than the ending of Sly Stalone's ""Over the Top"" movie where he tried to make arm wrestling even less interesting than it already is.  The conclusion wasn't particularly satisfying for me.  The story was a little slow with out too much really happening."

","I did enjoy this movie while watching it but afterwards, when my adrenaline lessened, my opinion kept sliding down on the rating scale 7.5.....7......6.5......6.The characterization is flat and the story is limited. Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for the last rap battle to take place (Ok, already, stop the BS and get to it)--which was fabulous, and I will probably purchase the movie just to watch that scene again. And I can't help but like Eminem;  he is a charizmatic individual. I did enjoy the glimpse into lives that are completely unlike my own. And I am a sucker for Eminem's music. So I would recommend the movie for a one time viewing, but probably not much more than that."

","Right before I went to see this movie my friend told me that the writer wrote this ""script""  by just sitting around with Eminem and gang and recalling old stories of the hood.   This is exactly what you'll see on the big screen.  If you are from Detroit , like me, and you are into music, like me, you'll enjoy at least 20 minutes of this film.  If you don't know anything about rap or its roots add another 5 or so minutes of enjoyment, other than that it couldn't have been more boring.

Wait for the DVD, watch the first 10 minute skip to last 20 minutes and you'll get you $$ worth.  If you feel like you have to get more Eminem here's an idea;  stop the DVD around minute 10 and  stare at your latest picture of Eminem for 45 minutes then restart the movie at the 80 minute of so mark."

His character is three-dimensional, he's layered, full of emotions...but aren't all good characters supposed to have these qualities? Still, you won't be able to find Eminem anywhere in this performance. The performance stands out from many performances this year. I'd be really surprised if he didn't at least get a Golden Globe nomination.<br/><br/>Curtis, Curtis, Curtis. After the dissapointing box office that was ""Wonder Boys"", you decide to hop on the mainstream train to riches by casting one of the most popular properties in America...Shame on you...Just kidding. Watching the film, you can see how much Curtis fights the mainstream with the grainy cinematography, mug locations, and subject matter. Alas, if any other unknown was to star in this film, it would be of little to no interest of the movie going public. Hanson nontheless shows us a gritty portrayl of life on the streets. Where hope is just a dream and living a simplistic life is a reality. Mainstream movie? I think not. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is more or less supporting Jimmy in this coming of age story, but they're all solid. I understand many wanted to see Jimmy succeed in getting a record deal, but they're missing the point. It isn't traveling down that formulaic road. That wasn't the point. He just showed that with a little confidence in yourself, you could do just about anything. The movie was about Jimmy having the courage to take the first step. A true inspiration. As far as him getting a record deal? Doesn't happen for all of us, but that first step could.<br/><br/>Using rap as a major subject in a movie is like the kiss of death -- most of us could care less for it. But it grabs you from the opening scene and continuously gets in your ears until the end credits, so when Jimmy's freestyling at a battle, it doesn't seem out of place.<br/><br/>
This is nothing more than a good, solid movie that doesn't break any new ground in the drama genre, but sometimes all we need is an inspirational movie to help us through life."

","I'm not a friend of Rap or Eminem, but Eminem's performance in 8 mile is really impressive. I can see that Eminem did put some efforts in showing the character's inner feeling. The story is a standard underdog story that a really talent person fights for a chance to be recognized. I think Eminem is a fine actor and he could be another Will Smith who is both a successful musician and a successful movie star."

","ok i have to admit that 8 mile was a good movie but not what i was expecting..on the movie trailer of 8 mile it seemd like eminem is going to this place to sing his music and he starts singing in front of all of these ppl..but its not its about seeing who can check each other the best and the crowd descides who was the best ....i think if your going to make a movie at least let the movie trailer be somewhat like it and dont have ppl sining songs if they aint going to be singing and dancing and stuff....i think that it could have been better and they could have not of put some of the information in there that they did and then i think it would have been better because the ending wasnt all that great...but s*** i have to admit it was a good movie though except for those few issues it had in it..."
"Sammygrl56","Null","0","1","10 November 2002"," Great film!
","This film was great!  However I think it would only be great for Eminem fans and people aged 13-30.  I thought it was awesome!  Besides the fact that Eminem was really hot in this movie I really liked his acting.  People have been saying that the movie should get an Oscar, it's really Eminem who should get the Oscar.  Without Eminem the movie would not be the same.  He plays the part so well, because well, he was the part.  The movie is not exactly like his real life, but sort of based on it.  You can definitly tell why the movie got an R rating though.  Just about every sentence has the F-word in it and Eminem is involved in a pretty heavy sex scene.  The rapping in this movie is great and when you hear it you will be doing what the audience in the movie is doing, laughing and going ooooooh!  This movie was great and if you are an Eminem fan you will love him in it.  Out of a 10 I give the movie an 8 and a half."
"Sugarshox","10","0","1","10 November 2002"," EXCELLENT!!!!
","Eminem proves that he is more than just a rapper in this gritty tale about a young Detroit star in the making. His performance shocked me in a way I never thought possible. Kim Bassinger and Britney Murphy back him up as the women in his life,his mother (Bassinger) and ""love"" interest (Murphy) , who did a very nice job in the acting as well. I did however, feel very puzzled at the end of the movie, (DON'T WORRY... I WILL NOT GIVE AWAY THE ENDING) because it did leave alot of unanswered questions. But as soon as I got home, I was able to solve the hidden message behind the film. All you have to do is think about it and you will be just fine. I strongly recomend 8 Mile. Please don't write off eminem because even an elderly couple went to see he film and they seemed to like it. grade- A+"
"moconnell-2","Null","0","1","8 November 2002"," A Good Movie!
","I saw 8 Mile opening day and my assumptions that it would be a good movie came full circle. Eminem did a good job for his first movie. I do not know why some people are saying Oscar because it was in no way anything close to an Oscar performance and I am glad that Eminem is not buying into all the hype that has surrounded the movie. Also much respect to Eminem for stepping out and doing a movie without a pre established action star. I though Mekhi was great and Cheddar Bob provided good comic relief while at the same time portraying a genuine friend to Eminem's character. I really enjoyed the movie and I will most likely see it at least one more time on the big screen and I wil definately own the DVD when it comes out. My overall rating is 7.5 out of 10 stars."

","8 Mile came out today and of course i went and saw it. It was a great movie. It proved Eminem could hold his own in the world of Movies. The plot was put together really well. Even if for some reason u do not like Eminem, which i wouldnt understand cuz hes awesome, u would have to admit he did it like a pro in this movie. Even though of course Brittany Murphy was a gross in this movie, u couldve guessed that since she is trashy. I really liked to see Eminems soft side, it was great. I did cry at one of the scenes. Yea well i just wanted 2 say what a great movie 8 Mile is! GO SEE IT!!"

"wally-52","10","0","1","8 November 2002"," A good flick
","A gritty portrayal of life in the urban wasteland of Warren/Detroit Michigan.  I was not a fan of hip hop or Eminem (until now) but this film really moved me.  It's really a story about overcoming adversity and not giving up. The cinematography was excellent in capturing the desolation of Warren, MI, which truly is a bleephole if you've ever been there.  The characters were well defined and you couldn't help but root for B. Rabbit and especially his little sister. Kim B. played an excellent trailer trash mama, despite some people's opinions to the contrary. I'll go see it again. The lyrics to Em's song ""Lose yourself"" have new meaning after seeing this film.<br/><br/>""You can do anything you set your mind to, man."""
"BreeBurden","Null","0","1","8 November 2002"," Very Good
","Having been a fan of Eminem for a long time, I knew this movie was going to be something worth seeing.  Little did I know how wonderful he and the movie were going to be.  In Rap music, he is honest, amazing, and over the top. In acting, he is new to the world but can hold his own.  Every actor in this movie was really good.  In this movie, I saw many sides to Eminem. During the movie, I was sad for Rabbit, happy for him, & mad for him.  His emotions shined throughout the whole movie.  Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer, and Kim Basigner did a really good job.  You don't have to be a fan of Eminem to like this movie.  His acting is good enough that you enjoy him, and you will enjoy him portraying someone else.  Many times you will see the movie because you enjoy the star.  Having seen Crossroads, Glitter, and many other mediocore movies containing singers, I was a little bit leary.  Eminem blew me away.  His career in acting is going to be something very special. The dialogue is really great, and the transitions and scenery are really superb as well.  This movie is good from start to finish.  It is well worth the money and I will see it again and again, and be in awe of something so special that shines in Eminem.  A++++++++"
"lambiepie-2","Null","0","2","8 November 2002"," Boo-hoo for the White Rapper
","For me, there was no way to see this movie other than a feature length promo for Eminem's CD's. Will it hold up over the years? No. This is entertainment for the white rap audience to accept themselves and have a 'hero', nothing more.<br/><br/>For me, this was like watching Pat Boone perform Little Richard tunes for acceptance and miracles upon miracles, he's beloved and embraced by everyone. Who gives a damn about Little Richard during all of this? And that is my point. (Before you ""howl"", I am aware of how many years ago that was -- and how supposedly different the world was --  but the idea behind Eminem is the same and proves to me the world hasn't changed. And yes I know Dr. Dre produced alot of his CD work, but I will stand by my Pat Boone analogy.)<br/><br/>Granted, Eminem plays a ""fish outa water"" character that overcomes his obstacles to become a big star in the crappy portion of Detroit (or Chicago, or Philadelphia, or Los Angeles or ....???) Come on folks, like HE wouldn't? Just because his mom was an alcoholic, etc., etc.? Please. My heart bleeds for Eminem's problems. You just KNOW he's got the odds against him. Please.<br/><br/>This coulda been a movie of the week on a network channel except they needed the ""white boy recording star of the day"" to star in it and get it to the screen. And it WILL make money for there are TONS of young Eminem music fans. But if you aren't one, this film will do nothing for you.<br/><br/>My point is replace ""rap"" with any genre that Black musicians perfected...like ""blues"" or ""jazz"", throw the mega white selling music flavor of the day in and and ""poof"" you have a Hollywood Cinderella Music story...and mainstream white America going out to purchase tickets for it.<br/><br/>I am sorry, its a sad excuse for a $10.00 theater ticket and my time. I am reminded of many films for music-video artists: Madonna, Brittney Spears, Mandy Moore, etc., and now Eminem. Ya just know in a few years this will keep going and going and going...for that is Hollywood. Good script or bad. Great acting or great acting right now. You just know the scripts will include an alcoholic parent/an abusive parent/a protective streak for a sibling/a black or gay character with a heart of gold and a po' white kid who sold millions of CD's trying to make it in a fictionalized autobiography.<br/><br/>Please. Enough already."
"Agent10","7","0","1","10 November 2002"," Better than what I expected, even with Eminem as the lead
","Eminem stars in a film about a white rapper trying to cut it in a black dominated musical genre and eventually comes out on a top. Hmmm, did Scott Silver really think this was an original idea? Well, beyond that, this film actually proved to be rather satisfying, presenting an image of rap and the hip-hop aesthetic in a cinematic format as opposed to high-gloss exploitation like The Players Club or All About the Benjamins. Eminem's frequent outbursts seemed too many and too quick, but his acting style was fairly consistent with the rather static character he sought to portray. If Rap wants to be taken more seriously for its style and impact, then they should follow the lead of this film. While the film is not without its problems, it is a much better alternative than some of the other hip-hop schlock that has been released in recent years."
"sugarslushie06","Null","0","1","10 November 2002"," Stunning
","This was a good movie! I really loved it, but its not for a lot of people. First off, theres extreme use of profanity. second, you see people having sex three times, which is not good for young ears to see. And lastly, lots of violence. If you are mature and think you can handle it, you should see it because its a story of how you can change and make life a little better. Seeing Eminem being sweet to his little sister was the cutest thing, except for the part where he was in a fight and the little girl had to watch. I reccomend this to you if you are a drop dead Eminem fan and can stand weird scenes. The only flaw I have is... Eminem plays someone almost exactly like him, and I believe thats the only character he CAN play. His acting range can't go too far at this rate. Go see this and be happy!!"
"Tivor X-09137","7","0","1","10 November 2002"," Surprisingly good. Much Kudos to the director Curtis Hanson.
","﻿I am one of those people who dismissed ""8 Mile"" simply because it was an Eminem movie.  I really don't care for Eminem, and I really don't much care for the current hip hop in general either.  But what can I say? All my friends wanted to watch it, so I ended up watching it with them.  And guess what?  I liked it.<br/><br/>All the cast, including Eminem, are uniformly excellent, and I really have to give lots of kudos to the director Curtis Hanson (who has also directed much-acclaimed ""L.A. Confidential"").  He managed to capture the ever-so-subtle glint of defeat from Eminem's eyes in the beginning sequence of the movie, as well as the just-as-subtle glint of triumph near the end. I'm sure Eminem possesses the natural instinct and screen presence to be a good actor (especially in a role that should be familiar to him), but I doubt that he would have been as impressive as he was in ""8 Mile"" without Curtis Hanson guiding him.  And Kim Basinger (who won an Oscar for her performance in Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"") shows us once again that she is as compelling an actress as she is beautiful.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, there really isn't anything new here.  It's a ""boy faces the obstacles in his life, finds his own path, and becomes a man"" story.  It's almost formulaic in a sense.  In fact, I think this movie could have been extremely predictable and boring, if it weren't for Curtis Hanson's wonderful direction and the subsequently excellent performances of the cast.<br/><br/>To sum it up, if you're an Eminem fan, then by all means watch ""8 Mile."" (Like I need to tell them)  Although one of my friend said that he wished there were even more rhymin', I doubt fans would be disappointed.  And if you're not a fan (of Eminem or hip hop in general), I still suggest that you consider watching this movie.  It's a very decent drama, at the very least. Definitely not some movie to be dismissed simply because a rapper is in it. Good stuff."
"janyeap","Null","0","1","6 November 2002"," Rapping to freedom...
","It's a very well told tale of a white rapper's life, his fears, his music, and his ability to conquer his hurdles  in an environment where dreams, hopes and anger could only be embodied in lyrics. It may be seen as a controversial film, but it's honestly portrayed.  It may be propagated with offensive lyrical assaults, but it's definitely sung to Eminem's tune. This film seems to demand an understanding of a rapper's culture that is built around his social and situational circumstances.<br/><br/>Watch how the young white guy struggle, against all odds, to make something out of his inescapable life and surroundings. Raised by a mother, who obviously has need of redemption herself, Eminem's charismatic Jimmy `Rabbit' Smith character is introduced at the beginning of the film as a total loser. Viewers get to see both arenas of his gentle and his raging temperament.  <br/><br/>Jimmy moves back to his mother's trailer-park home in white suburban 8 Mile, Detroit, and yet can't really see it as home'. His financially stricken, trashy mother lugs around the house with a gigolo louse, not much older than Jimmy.  And his little sister, Lily, spends most of her time, cuddled up in some corner, cringed with fear and apprehension. That's what's to be expected of his life at 'home'. <br/><br/>The young man has a meager-paying job, working under a tough and overbearing supervisor in a metal stamping plant. He hangs around his loyal group of friends from a tough and dilapidated inner city. Future (Mekhi Phifer) is Rabbit's fervent admirer, believing that his friend has great potentials to achieve stardom. Evan Jones' Bob, Omar Benson Miller' Sol; and De'Angelo Wilson's DJ Iz linger along with the two, almost like loyal pets. We see them in a club, frequented by young black rappers and their fans. Most likely, it's the only social joint for this inner city folks.  Jimmy meets Brittany Murphy' Alex and she sets the stage for getting Jimmy out of his in-built reservation.  Hey, she and Eminem do have very appealing onscreen chemistry! Truly a fine cast of actors who have definitely brought credibility to their screen characters.  It's these characters, together with Jimmy's mother  her messed-up character is wonderfully crafted out by Kim Basinger  who help in the carving of the gradual on-screen development of Jimmy's maturity. This film makes a good study of a young man trying hard to balance his responsibilities toward his family, his friends and his job.<br/><br/>
There are many great scenes that support Jimmy's determination to conquer his troubling challenges.  The loser' is seen as getting his honky-tonk car to run, bringing his mother to overcome her insecurity, fighting off his shyness, providing comfort for his sister, winning respect from his boss, beating his rival in the hip-hop game, and gaining complete acceptance from the `ghetto' club crowd.  And the manner, in which Jimmy chants out his abusive lyrics, plays an important part in portraying the different levels of his confidence development. The ending is phenomenal. We get to see Jimmy walking away, like a man who is freed from his troubled world and from his dilemma  but more important freed from the bondage of everyone.  He has found his voice to empower his stance over every troubling circumstance! He achieves in bringing out his best in an awkward world.  <br/><br/>
Scott Silvers script, with its unpretentious storyline and characters, is definitely worthy of an Oscar. A well directed film that will definitely please Eminem's fans and the hip-hop loyalists."
