"MovieManMenzel","7","55","73","17 April 2006"," If you liked the trailer, see this movie. If you hated the trailer, avoid this movie. It's that simple.
","""The Benchwarmers"" is about 3 older guys named Gus (Rob Schnieder), Richie (David Spade) and Clark (Jon Heder) who start a baseball league against the bullies in the neighborhood. After a huge crowd comes out to support the team, the guys decide to enter a competition with the bullies. The winner will get a brand new stadium. Lots of immature laughs ensue <br/><br/>After walking out of ""The Benchwarmers"" I realized one thing. That this movie is exactly like the trailer and television spots made it out to be. This means that if you didn't find the trailer funny or amusing avoid this film because the odds are you won't like it. I, however, did enjoy the film. It's not a great masterpiece or anything like that but more of an immature film that you can laugh at and remember what it is like being a kid.<br/><br/>I took three of my little brothers to see the film with me and all of them really enjoyed it. Just hearing them laugh and get such a kick out of it made the film just a tad better for me. This movie is childish by its very nature. All the characters in the film reminded me of watching little kids which in my opinion was amusing seeing grown men act this way. It was funny and amusing not to mention contained a whole slue of memorable quotes that people will be quoting for many days to come.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed most of the movie and I can appreciate it for what it is, a stupid fun comedy, I must admit some jokes were used too much. The fart jokes came by the truckload in this film and while a few were amusing, most of them weren't. Also the amount of gay sexual undertones in this movie was too much as well. When the film first tried a gay joke, it kind of worked but as the movie continued on, the gay jokes just got worse and worse and weren't funny.<br/><br/>Rob Schneider for once plays a different role here. While I have always been a fan of his cheesy and overly stupid roles, I am glad to see him play a different role. He played a more mature character and for once in his career, this role didn't involve him becoming something like a woman, an animal, or a male gigolo. I enjoy Schneider much more than I probably should admit and I am glad to see he expanded his role choice for once. David Spade is really starting to grow on me. After seeing him alongside Chris Farley in ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Black Sheep"" I thought he was someone who I was going to enjoy for many years to come. But then ""8 Heads in a Duffle Bag"" and ""Lost & Found"" came out and I lost interest in him. It wasn't until 2003 when I began to like David Spade again after seeing ""Dickie Roberts"" and ever since then he has been growing on me again. I think it's is whole sarcastic sense of humor that I enjoy. Like his quote from the movie,"" I didn't know athlete had three syllables, that's AAMAAZZINNG"". I kind of feel bad for Jon Heder because I like the guy but after ""Napoleon Dynamite"" I feel he will be playing the same role for the rest of his life. He plays a more talkative ""Napoleon"" in ""Benchwarmers"" and is a lot of fun. He is still amusing and most of his jokes work but I just wonder after a few more films will audiences be tired of him? <br/><br/>""The Benchwarmers"" is a must for those who are fans of Schneider, Spade, or Heder. If you hate these guys or hate stupid immature comedies then avoid this movie. There is a specific target audience of adults this is geared towards and is a film that you will either enjoy (notice I didn't say love) or hate with a passion. Also it's a pretty safe film that many kids between the ages of 7 and 18 will probably enjoy more than anyone else. Every once in a while, I enjoy seeing a stupid childish comedy like ""Benchwarmers"" but I know what to expect when I go into it and I got just what I expected. Movies like this aren't screened to critics because studios know they will not like it. They are not the target audience. But for myself, I can still like art films and enjoy silly comedies that have no substance. If critics loosened up a bit or maybe had kids and took them to see some of these movies with them, they would realize how fun some of these films really are. ""The Benchwarmers"" is a fun hour and a half for those who can appreciate this film for what it is.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Benchwarmers"" is a 7/10."
"Christopher_Reid","5","17","20","13 April 2007"," Enjoyably stupid but not exactly good.
","I was expecting The Benchwarmers to be an overall pretty bad unfunny movie, based on the reviews and average rating it has, with the possibility of occasionally succeeding in fleeting moments as is often the case with stupid comedies. In a sense, that's exactly what it amounted to although somehow the movie managed to be watchable even when many of the jokes were missing - to it's credit it's quite fast-paced (this contributes to the movie making even less sense, not that it matters).<br/><br/>The plot for The Benchwarmers has nothing original to offer - basically it's about three nerds (Rob Schneider, David Spade and Jon Heder) that play a bunch of baseball games against various teams of kids. The movie is never intended to be taken seriously so the abundance of clichés is forgivable. But where the movie fails is in the lack of original humour. Classics of the stupid comedy genre such as Zoolander and Dodgeball explored new ground whereas The Benchwarmers retreats to familiar styles of comedy with the occasional stroke of genius (or perhaps that should be idiocy).<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie quite enjoyable. There were a few little parts I found quite hilarious and probably won't forget for quite some time to come. Even the standard reflective speech(es) near the end came across as sincere and not completely worthless. There are also a number of familiar faces (and cameos) which help move things along. Rob Schneider, David Spade, Nick Swardson and Jon Lovitz are all good in their parts whilst Jon Heder seems to be stuck in his Napolean Dynamite character. But unfortunately these are not enough to change the fact that this is not a good movie. It is decent enough entertainment for its running time though."
"Psycho_N8_Phd","10","119","180","8 April 2006"," You either love these kinds of movies, or you hate them.
","I really think that's the only issue with this film. If you've been a fan of Adam Sandler's work (this is a Happy Madison production), you'll like this movie. Not only was it produced by Sandler, but it was co-written by one of his longtime buddies Allen Covert. If you go into this movie not knowing what to expect, that's your own fault. I know this movie won't be received well by critics, but when has ANYTHING that Sandler's done ever been? Ontop of that it features Jon Heder aka Napoleon Dynamite. To me, this was a huge added bonus. I love Sandler movies, and I loved Napoleon Dynamite. Many people feel Heder's a terrible actor, but I think his delivery is hysterical. I found myself laughing throughout this film, and thought it supplied Heder with more great one-liners that will be quoted for the next year. After saying that, some of you might turn your nose up at me and tell me that I wouldn't know what a good movie is, but I enjoy and cherish Casablanca, The Godfather: Part II, and Good Will Hunting as much as anybody, but forgive me if I like to enjoy a little mindless laughter at times. If you didn't like Billy Madison, The Hot Chick, or Napoleon Dynamite, you'll hate this movie, no doubt. But then why would you even go see it in the first place?"
"mrewel-1","10","101","161","6 April 2006"," better than expected
","I expected a very poor quality comedy, but this was anything but. I am giving this movie a ""10"" because it is a comedy, and it made me laugh almost non-stop, so in my opinion it was an amazing success. This movie does have its share of physical humor and toilet brand jokes, but it is well rounded with quick sharp wit as well, so unless you just hate humor in general, go see this movie. My only regret was seeing it in a packed theater because a lot of the jokes were strung together in such a quick manner that the laughter from the entire theater most likely made me miss some stuff. The actor that played David Spade's brother stole the show completely. Without giving anything away I have to say I laughed almost to the point of crying, as did the entire theater it seemed, and as the credits rolled i actually heard clapping from the audience. I don't want to hype it up to much, but its hard not to, so just go see the damn movie already."
"iamnotafilmmaker","8","62","99","8 April 2006"," It's actually... good??
","I really did not expect the movie to be very good. Don't get me wrong - I thought I'd like it (I love almost every baseball movie ever made) but I had no idea that the film would actually work on multiple levels.<br/><br/>The movie's short, but that's OK as it gets right to the point and never stops. Some of the humor is a bit childish (far jokes), but they actually balance a lot of it out with other childish jokes that make the earlier ones bearable (back to back fart jokes... I don't want to be more specific because it will spoil it when you see it).<br/><br/>I was very pleased with this film and will probably see it again while it's in theaters. If you're somebody who likes any Adam Sandler branded flick then you'll love this one."
"danzinit","9","68","113","10 April 2006"," Really funny movie, the whole theater was cracking up
","This movie had a lot of the typical humor you'd expect from the three leads. May be typecasting John Heder a bit too much but he's good at the part he plays. Actually has a sweet story line. I went with my boyfriend and another couple and both the guys and the girls really enjoyed the movie and neither side was really offended by the humor. Be warned however, there are three different places in the movie where vomiting is involved(just for the funny effect it has on a situation). For anyone with a weak stomach, look away! I actually was pleasantly surprised with the minimal swearing in this movie when you consider who the cast is and who produced it (Happy Madison). Anyway, I thought it was a really good movie and would definitely recommend it."
"NancyLou9","10","59","109","10 April 2006"," One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time!
","I can't figure out why everyone's being so hard on this movie. It isn't often I can go to a comedy at the theater and actually laugh out loud. However, when I saw this movie this weekend, I wasn't the only one who was laughing, and I mean often. There were times the audience was laughing so much I had trouble hearing the dialog.<br/><br/>This is, simply put, a movie about three guys, almost over the hill, who decide to play some baseball against real Little League teams in the state. It's not about some grand scheme, it's not about the glory, it's about standing up for those who were always picked last in gym, always called names for not being athletic, it's about the little guy and standing up for the underdog.<br/><br/>I have seen other critiques of this movie and people are complaining about the plot line, the dialog, you name it, there's something wrong with it. Don't go to the movie expecting to see any Oscar moments, they simply aren't there. If all you really want a good laugh though, go see this movie. Bill Romanowski plays a character who makes fun of his ""roid rage"" while he played football. Jon Heder is ""almost"" Napolean Dynamite, similar voice, but the character is funnier. David Spade has some issues in his personal life that really steal the show (Think Gir in Invader Zim).<br/><br/>I don't want to say too much more about the movie because it would give away something hilarious. As far as being a waste of my money, I plan to go to a matinée this week so I can see it in a less crowded theater and hear the dialog I missed. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it several more times.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, the theater cut off the credits for some reason and the people in the audience fussed until they turned them back on. Not a single person left until the last line had rolled on the credits (also funny, stay and watch them).<br/><br/>This is one hilarious movie and it's ""...freakin' awesome!"""
"twentyfour7","7","42","75","8 April 2006"," Harmless Fun
","This movie was oddly delightful. I found it to be very entertaining, I certainly didn't find myself bored with the movie in any way. Although some of the side characters are contrived and somewhat monotonous in their weirdness factor, overall it does a very good job.<br/><br/>David Spade stole the show however, he did a very good job and needless to say his character was the real barrel of laughs within the film. My biggest complaint would have to be Jon Hedder (Napolean Dynamite guy). I must say he seemed to play the EXACT same character from Napolean Dynamite. All the complaints aside, this movie was entertaining and harmless fun."
"cujo9441","9","46","90","8 April 2006"," More Than Just Comedy:: Moral
","This is the story of three grown men playing internet broad-casted games as The Benchwarmers against 4 or 5 different teams of Bullies.<br/><br/>David Spade (Richie) plays a Smart-mouthed scaredy-cat that plays to impress a lovely lady fan of the Benchwarmers. John Heder (Clark) plays a dorky lovable mama's boy who needs to get out more. & Rob Schneider (Gus) plays a tough guy who carries the team who fights (plays baseball) for all the poor nerds that never got to before, so that his kid will someday be free from bullies.<br/><br/>The movie contains some crude humor so be aware when taking small children, but otherwise this is a Hilarious story of the way that life should be, not that it will change, but still so that adults see how truly cruel children can be.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, I laughed hard but lets not miss the message.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"drewbroughton-1","1","25","50","21 April 2006"," This movie is horrible
","If I could vote '0' I would. Do not go see this unless you have lots of time and lots of money to waste. This movie is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen on the big screen. Very disappointing, because I really dig these casual-humored movies, like Napolean Dynamite and Old School, but this one... The script is utterly moronic and the jokes are like pulled punches. Adam Sandler may have been involved in the production, but I guarantee you he never saw it; if he had he would have pulled out with the quickness. <br/><br/>I actually felt a tiny bit stupider as I walked out of the theater. It was like my IQ was being slowly picked at with the 'stupid' hammer. <br/><br/>I remember distinctly waiting and waiting for something, anything, to laugh at...but the knee-slappers never came. Well, there was one funny part, I'll concede, involving a Dominican Republican, but man, one laugh in 2 hrs is not what I paid for, you know? Anyways, I'm normally not this critical about things, but I just had to send out a warning for all good, free citizens - BEWARE OF THE BENCHWARMERS!!!! <br/><br/>.......horrible<br/><br/>And what's with David Spade's career tanking like it is? That show of his on Comedy Central is almost as bad as this movie...<br/><br/>Oh, well."
"Decafe157","1","17","32","3 July 2006"," Very bad movie...
","Knowing that this movie was produced by Adam Sandler's company, I wasn't expecting much in terms of intelligent humor or a logical plot, but this was the first movie that I ever wanted to walk out on. <br/><br/>It consisted of gross humor such as farting in people's faces and eating buggers. The jokes were predictable and unfunny. Heder reprises his role as Napoleon Dynamite minus the glasses and hair. I hope he has other acting abilities because his whole routine is getting very stale. <br/><br/>There was a guy who gave himself a titty twister, someone in the stands asking for a little person as a pet, a bully coming up with the insult ""Gus Bus"", and the so called plot twist of Snieder's character being a former bully was predictable from the start. <br/><br/>I saw Deuce Bigalow 2 and thought that Rob Sneider could not be in a worse movie. Well, he managed to prove me wrong. If you want to see one of the worse movies ever made, then go see The Benchwarmers. Otherwise, save your money!"
"rinasawyer","1","24","48","8 April 2006"," This movie is a waste of your time and money
","Where do you begin on rating such a lousy movie. This movie is a waste of your time and money. Do not go see this movie. This is not a movie that should even be rated pg13. That rating is too mild for this movie. It was extremely offensive in every way. The humor was purely gross and sets bad examples for kids even 14 and over on what is funny. The scene where they had the bench warmers practicing their batting by riding in a truck whacking mail boxes in a neighborhood, sends a message to teens that this practice is acceptable behavior. ALL of the sexual innuendo throughout the film was unnecessary and crossed the line. There was no reason to introduce any sexual innuendo in this movie. A scene where one of the coaches on the other team opens his front door of his house with his gay male lover barely dressed and then repeatedly showing the continuing saga of this relationship throughout the movie was reprehensible...totally unnecessary to the movie. Besides all this, it was extremely disgusting to watch on several occasions throughout the movie people farting, vomiting in somebody else's face, picking noses (and eating them). Nevermind the fact that in another scene they show an agoraphobic and effeminate man handing a 2 liter bottle of urine to his brother. Another scene in the movie, demonstrates to kids that drinking is OK-----the scene shows a man somewhere around the age of 30-40, masquerading as a 13 year old in order to play ball. The movie producers show this man drinking while waiting to play and while he was playing ball. This was very offensive."

"narcatin","1","18","36","9 April 2006"," my thoughts about this movie (awful&crap)
","This movie was awful and even the ocational funny lines didn't make up for the sappy stupid intended meaning of this movie. Even the pure basis of this movie was completely stunted. there is nothing funny about a bunch of grown men playing baseball with kid's that don't have even half their strength.<br/><br/>or maybe it's just that I hate the intendded steriotypes put through in this movie, and the fact that the whole steriotyping was directly stolen from revenge of the nerds.<br/><br/>also, even though the way this film was directed it was intended that the movie not make much sense, there were no reasons given for anything that happened in the movie... everything was just said to have happened by pure coincidence or some weird type of folly.....<br/><br/>overall, don't see this movie, it is crap, but if you want to see 2 or three funny jokes that are misc. embedded in this film then go see it...."
"Zingbot_9000","7","12","23","17 April 2006"," Is what it is....if you like these kind of movies see it if not please don't complain after you see it.
","I saw this movie the other day. And I was pleasantly surprised. It amazes me that people come on here and complain about these type of movies like it is the worst movie ever. I like Rob Schneider and David Spade. I have liked many of the Adam Sandler movies also. This movie is from the same production companies of Sandlers movies. And I must say it is better than most of their recent offerings. I laughed out loud about 10 times and laughed silently many more times. Laughing out loud is something I generally don't do.<br/><br/>My review is mostly for those of you that have liked some of the Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, or David Spade movies. I think this movie was better than Anger Management, Mr Deeds, The Longest Yard, The Animal among others. It was very funny at times and it was cute also.<br/><br/>Rob Schneider was the man of the group. He played it is the athlete in the group and the leader of the team of misfits. David Spade played a nerd in David Spade style. And Jon Heder was good as a Napolean Dynamite guy with a little more energy.<br/><br/>Sure this movie has it's flows especially in the storyline. Like if Rob Schneider is so much better than Heder or Spade why did the other teams not just walk him.....things like that. But take this movie as it is.....it is better than most Happy Madison productions of late. Schneider, Spade, and Heder fans don't ignore this movie because of comments by people who don't like them to begin with."
"jellyneckr","Null","16","33","22 April 2006"," The best baseball comedy since Major League!
","It all started in 1999. Adam Sandler, at the hieght of his popularity, decided to help old pal Rob Schneider out by producing DEUCE BIGELOW: MALE GIGOLO. That film was surprisingly a hit so Sandler took the next logical step and produced a film for another SNL buddy, David Spade. JOE DIRT, while not the commericial success 'BIGELO' was did great in DVD sales and has since gained cult statuts. Sandler has continued to produce projects for both Schneider and Spade over the years so it seemed inevitable that the two would end up starring in a Sandler produced film together. THE BENCHWARMERS teams Schneider and Spade with Jon Heder, best known for starring in the worst comedy of the 2000s NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. The three play pals who after beating a bunch of little bullies at a baseball game discover that they could make a living doing so while standing up to bullies in the process. The plot and most of the characters are secondary to the rapid-fire slapstick and gross-out gags, 85% of which hit. When the gags do fail, it's due to Heder. He does well in his role for the most part, but at times it seems like he's still in Napoleon Dynamite mode. While some more backstory into his character's life and Ritchie's (David Spade) life would have made the movie more filling, they still aren't the usual one-dimensional characters the audience is used to seeing in most flicks these days, which is ultimately why I recommend it. 8/10"

Never again will I go to see a movie with him in it based on the excellence of his performance in Napoleon Dynamite. He built up credit which he has now thrown away. Oh dear..<br/><br/>Weak jokes, clichéd slapstick, attempts at coarse humor that a 5-year-old child could beat, implausible plot line.

The moral message it was trying to convey was overshadowed by the off-color references to homosexuality and cheap ""kicked in the balls"" type jokes. This is the kind of movie that encourages, instead of discourages, kids to make fun of homosexuals, little people, agoraphobics (or anyone with a social disorder for that matter), virgins, etc. Think long and hard about the behavior you want to teach your children before you take them to a movie like this. <br/><br/>You'd all be better off eating your ten dollar bills... it would be way more entertaining."

","I am not a huge fan of this sort of comedy, admittedly, but I watch quite a few as the parent of 4 teenage boys. I usually rate them in the category of ""kept me occupied, didn't hate it, wouldn't watch it again"" rather than as memorable, or works of comedic genius. For example, I found Wayne's World, Dodgeball, and most Adam Sandler movies to be very reasonable to watch, but thought Kicking and Screaming was not entertaining. This film was much worse than that. The characters are not appealing and not funny. I couldn't sympathize with any of them, nor could I laugh at them or with them. The gags are old and not well executed. The movie failed on every level for me. Junior high boys would find it entertaining, everyone else should rent something else."

","Along with Nacho Libre, this has to be one of the worst movies since Street Fighter The Movie. Benchwarmers must have aimed towards being ""stupid funny"" so much that it lost total contact with what the word stupid and/or funny really means. The actors who took part in this film just took a large drop in their careers. I can understand Napoleon Dynamite (which I thought was equally dumb) has some value in the sense that you can laugh at a loser, but taking it as far as Benchwarmers and just throwing out all respect for yourself is another story. I would never recommend this motion picture to anyone. Instead, I'd give it as a gift to someone I hate, because after watching it, I think you'll lose some sanity.

I would have liked to have seen a cameo by Adam Sandler. I actually spit my drink on my wife one time I laughed so hard. I think the main trio should do some more movies together. There was a chemistry between them that is hard to find(Three Stooges). I'm not saying they could be as good as them but it's hard to find that kind of chemistry between three relatively famous actors.

I believe the reality is that everyone was laughing because they were high on crack and the jokes were missed because there weren't really any jokes in this movie. Was this supposed to be a comedy, or was it simply your neighbor's god-awful home produced movie posted on YouTube? To compare this movie to crap, would be an insult to crap. I have lost intelligence due to watching this movie because the mere act of listening to the stupidest dialog ever written has destroyed more of my brain cells than any night of drinking or hard drugs I might have done in the past.<br/><br/>And who are the moron movie executives that green lit this project??? Why are they even working in Hollywood??? Did someone lose a bet, or does someone have video of them in a compromising position? I've seen better work at a mentally retarded home for children's playhouse than this movie. This movie reminds me of a preschooler's artwork posted on mom and dad's refrigerator and displayed for the world to see, not because it's good, but rather just to boost the poor talentless child's self esteem in an effort to encourage creativity, not to entertain the viewer.<br/><br/>I could throw letters from a Scrabble game on the floor and find a better script than the one that was written for this movie. It is interesting that most of the people who posted comments on this movie and enjoyed it cannot spell and have very bad grammar, it goes to show the intelligence level of fans of this movie.<br/><br/>I am 37 years old today, and I love movies, but only twice in my life have I been so disgusted by a movie, I felt moved enough to comment on it.

","I honestly didn't think there could be anything more lacking in entertainment and humor than ""You Me and Dupree"" until I saw ""The Benchwarmers."" Struggling to produce an over-the-top comedy, this laugh-less comedy only gets by on Stone & Parker (but light)-styled gross out humor as possible to compensate for the stupid story about the nerd population's ultimate revenge over their bullies: a semi-little league baseball championship. Did 13 year-old comic book geeks write this lame material? <br/><br/>In this nonsense story, Rob Schneider takes the lead in a more serious version of his well-meaning Deuce Bigalow role. He is somehow talked into starting up a baseball team called ""The Benchwarmers,"" a trio consisting of him, David Spade, and Jon Heder (repeating once again, in very weak form, his Napoleon Dynamite character). They come to represent the nerds because basically, each of them gets picked on by pre-teen brats and their coaches who challenge them to a game. Soon enough, they mark their fandom among the nerds as heroes, and Jon Lovitz as some multi-billionaire promoter shows up with all his gadgets and promotes the team. The winner of the baseball championship is given a free state-of-the-art stadium. Even I love stupid humor comedy, but a stupid story coupled with terrible acting (way to deliver those lines like you're reading from the script, gang), and dumb jokes, this is, if not the worst movie ever, than certainly the worst movie produced all year."

However, this was just plain awful. I mean, when Rob Schneider is the best element of a movie (which isn't saying much), you know you're in for something really, really stupid.

I usually adore David Spade because of his bratty attitude and caustic humor, but his character in Benchwarmers is completely uninteresting. As for Jon Heder... What happened to the young, promising actor who made audiences laugh with his character of Napoleon Dynamite? It seemed like you had such a beautiful career ahead of you! But now, it's only a matter of time until you hit rock bottom and join the ""Unfunny actors who have lost all credibility because they keep making bad movie choices"" club which your co-star Schneider has been part of for quite some time now. But I have faith in you Jon! I know that you can still redeem yourself! As for the plot, it is a rehash of something we've seen thousands of times, and you'll be lucky if you don't fall asleep.

The other two main characters were equally disappointing/ gross. The plot was incapable of being funny in my opinion. The humor ie boogers (picking and eating), farting on the nose, diarhea..the list goes on. I'll admit these topics can be funny in some context...but not with this plot or these actors.

","After a failed attempt to sneak into an R-rated movie, I landed my self here. ""What is here?"" you may ask. To that I would respond the epitome of bad movies. If you were reading this to find out if you should go to see this movie, then read only the next sentence, because the rest will be spoilers for something way past spoiled, past rotten, to an area that is just sad. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. Do not encourage such material to bee made in the future, because this movie was a disgrace to all who are not blind and deaf. I liked Napoleon Dynamite, Tommy Boy, and Rob Schneider's line in The Water Boy, but this movie is not even close to that. These actors are nothing without other people's talents. Half of the plot revolved around eight year olds getting behind some people who could make a stand against bullying; the other half was a nonsensical attempt at comedy for those already in their teens. The people who could find the sexual terms ""homerun, going all the way, and ovulating"" funny don't want to hear third graders give commentary to a baseball game. This movie has no target audience: it has an old man in his underwear flicking people off, gay guys, Davie Spade talking about a movie with lesbian sex scenes, Bill Romanowski giving himself a titty twister, a midget with a peanut butter statue, an emotional speech about how bullying was bad, and dozens of third graders. This movie also had its fair amount of mess ups. A kid being called out on a dropped third strike when no one ever got him out at first, the fact that the Benchwarmers would never win a baseball game if the opposing team had intentionally walked Rob Schneider, (who was the only one who could hit the ball on the team). You could tell some part of the movie was voiced over, because the person would say something differently when the camera wasn't on him. And on top of all of that I have never seen worse acting in any movie I paid to see. Adam Sandler had no cameo in this movie, and he was producing it. This film was probably a way of Adam Sandler saying, ""You guys can have your own little film over here, now please don't ask to be in mine."" It was so bad that the critics weren't allowed to see it in advance because they knew how bad it was. As the film's final line goes:""This was a complete waste of time wasn't it?"""

The comedy is so cheap that I can't think of a way to describe it. you start to think that it's tongue in cheek or satirical, but then you can't figure out how or why.

It is perplexing, then, why the writer would choose to include scenes where characters talk about ovulation and sex with Rob Schneider (a wholly disturbing prospect in itself). <br/><br/>The whole thing is shoddily written too. None of the dialogue is believable, and the whole premise of it is retarded. Not only is it presumptuous to label every kid who plays Little League a bully, but no horde of kids around the globe would be interested in a bunch of middle-aged losers who used to be nerds competing against school children, and only manage to defeat them because they have some old guy who can both pitch incredibly fast and hit home runs on every swing. Yes, that's right, it's not a tale of how hopeless nerds can be trained to use their brains and heart to defeat bully athletes, it's a tale of some old guy associating himself with some so-called nerds (who are really just losers, there's a difference) and single-handedly beating on little kids.<br/><br/>There's a reason that Jon Lovitz is doing SubWay commercials. He's an obnoxious one-dimensional joke of an actor.

","I remember seeing this movie at a hotel in Portland and afterwords we decided that two of my cats could have written it! Every line and every joke was entirely predictable and easy to do! This kind of humor went from ribald to low-brow to no-brow. This film has since been the punchline of jokes about bad movies in my family. It's hard to imagine movies getting dumber than this! I feel David Spade deserves better and that films with Adam Sandler's name on them should be better than this as well. In short, this was a very lousy movie.

Will you laugh occasionally when watching this movie, yes.<br/><br/>But they will be laughs of pity, at this sorry excuse for a film. <br/><br/>The worst part of it all, is that somehow films like this generate revenue, In fact, ""The Benchwarmers"" opened at the number two position at the Box Office. This then only encourages more and more deplorable Sandler/Dugan collaborations, flooding the market with incessant atrocities. Since this movie, we have had the ultimate displeasure to be bombarded by ""I Now Pronounce you Chuck and Larry"", and ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan.""

This film had a moral; nerds and bullies can get along, like i haven't heard that 1000 times in every other movie of its kind. The protagonist 'Gus' is portrayed as some kind of superhero, while the two dodgy supporting roles just kept up the pathetic nature of the film, and honestly..i did not laugh once. And by the way, the whole pizza hut girl with the video guy....what was that about? what was her motive to get with him? 'wow a creepy guy in a video shop that plays baseball with kids, what a turn on' give me a break, and the character 'Howie' who is afraid of sunlight is completely not needed!

","I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. This has to be one of the best comedies of 2006. The basic plot line revolves around three nerds who wants to play baseball. They team up with a rich manager and his son is a nerd. The three nerds played by Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Heder make up their own team and they play other teams. But, the teams are not nerds and they have a 9-man lineup. Will the make the championships? First of all, I have to say that the nerds were funny because they acted like nerds. I like Nick Swardson and his thing with sunlight. I was also surprised that Reggie Jackson made an appearance. I am a big Yankees fan, so I was happy that Jackson was in the movie. Everything worked well with the film. Adam Sandler, make a sequel for this film! I rate this movie a 9/10."
"moxy787878","3","2","3","16 October 2007"," An EPIC failure!
","""The Bench Warmers"" is about a three man baseball team that challenges every teenage baseball team that bulleys nerds to a pick-up game. The duo consists of a short strong man named Gus (Rob Schneider), which by the way makes no sense considering he's shorter then my seven year old cousin that can't even dunk on a two foot high plastic basketball hoop, let alone even pick up a full sized basketball. The next character is a video store geek named Richie (David Spade), and the third and most stupid member of the group is a mama's boy by the name of Clark (Jon Heder). It all starts when the three witness a few neighborhood boys ganging up on one of the local nerds, the three men decide to take a stand for geeks and weirdos everywhere.<br/><br/>The overall film was held together by nose pickings, flatulence, and sucking at baseball to the extreme. I lost count of the number of times Clark through the bat from his hands and hit a person or a squirrel. Oh and I'm sorry, how many times did Richie nick the ball before he actually hit it? Too many to count, and too many to even laugh at.<br/><br/>Of course everyone was going to think that this movie was hysterical because its staring the ""king"" of comedy, Jon Heder or better known as Napoleon Dynamite. But to me, he is over-dramatic at times when saying his lines, and before he even says his lines, you can tell he is searching through his dull and empty mind for the next line. Not to mention that his performance in this film looks to be the exact same as his previous movie, Napoleon Dynamite; but hey, he fits right in with David Spade and Rob Schneider with my previous statement, so good for you Jon, you guys are three predictable peas in a pod.<br/><br/>This movie was more predictable then watching my grandma eat prunes and then afterwards saying, ""I wonder what's going to happen after I eat these...?"" I could guess every step of the way on what was coming next, and how the movie was going to end. You could also tell that this was a Happy Madison production just at first glimpse. Sandlar then continues to hire director Denis Dugan who hasn't made a good movie since ""Happy Gilmore."" Oh and of course, it wouldn't truly be a Happy Madison production without a dose of homophobia. You get your occasional ""Homo!"" being shouted from the crowd during the movie, and that would have slided by with me; but then of course, they throw in a fairy queen and his lover who wears a speedo during the entire film.<br/><br/>I also loved how they matched up three grown morons to play against a team of toddlers in a baseball game. Obviously the so-called adults will prevail in the end. Maybe they should have had it be that the younger kids kicked the crap out of the only adult morons alive and then somehow they squeezed there way into the championship game. Maybe that would have made them more money then they spent on the film and their terrible actors.<br/><br/>Overall, this was yet another downfall in a Happy Madison production, which is no surprise. Maybe if David Spade and Rob Schneider would act like something other then the same role they've played in every other movie, I would have actually had a laugh during the same parts the immature 28 year old sitting a few rows in front me was cracking up at because Jon Heder was yet again, picking his nose. But hey, at least the movie made some sort of sense and didn't turn out like another ""Grandmas Boy"" movie. Great job in another terribly filmed and scripted movie Happy Madison, you never cease to disappoint me."

I don't know, but the acting in this movie was terrible, especially from Spade, who I've never seen act well. The writing is wretched, and had no intelligence.

","The Benchwarmers is definitely worth a watch if you are interested in some light heated fun. An unlikely trio led by Rob Schneider put a baseball team together and challenge the local bullies. David Spade does a great comedic role as one of the incompetent team mates. The humor effortlessly flows and the film doesn't try too hard to be funny. The look and situations of the characters are a riot. The scene where Spade and Schneider were hitting mailboxes with a bat at the back of a car was easily one of the funniest scenes in the film. Physical and silly comedy when done well is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Despite its humor it also touched on the serious topic of bullying and how its sadly prevalent. It was nice to see the bullies put in their place in the end. <br/><br/>It's an enjoyable experience where you don't have to think too much when watching it and enjoy a good laugh."
"tylermarietatro","8","1","1","4 October 2016"," Benchwarmers is a great movie that differs from your typical sports movie.
","When watching a movie that revolves around a sport, you typically need to have a full understanding of that specific sport to even consider watching the movie. Normally, you are required to have some historical background knowledge of the sport to catch on to references and remain interested without getting lost or confused. Most importantly, you need to have an interest and respect for the sport to even enjoy the movie. The baseball movie ""Benchwarmers"" does an incredible job overcoming all of these obstacles through humor, making it extremely successful and enjoyable for a range of viewers, from baseball fans to people that don't know a single thing about baseball. Although the main event that takes place in this movie is obviously baseball, the plot isn't your typical ""the team you're supposed to cheer for barely takes home the gold after a close, almost game-costing play."" The message is surprisingly focused on the effects of bullying, valuing fun vs. winning, and a compromise between bullies and the victim. But wait! I know what you're thinking. Before you get carried away assuming that this movie is just another lesson on bullying, mean jocks vs. weird nerds, you have to know that it is a comedy with all intentions of a humorous experience instead of directly reflecting the anti-bullying videos you were forced to watch in middle school. Gus, Richie, and Clark compete against the baseball team full of terribly mean jocks to prove that everyone should be able to play baseball. The three nerds become great role models to younger kids until the truth about Gus's past is revealed. The never-ending humor in ""Benchwarmers"" keeps you entertained and holds your attention by catching you off- guard and making you wonder what's going to make you laugh next. This movie is filled with hilarious and catchy one-liners that you'll laugh at every time and continue to quote for weeks. Another aspect that adds to the humor within the movie is the type of characters and their interactions and relationships with each other, along with the respectable acting. The main characters are known as the uncool, age 20-30, losers that never had a shot with girls, sports, or even a social life. Their acting consists of immaturity, isolation, lack of communication skills, and the way they are treated by others definitely creates a strong base for humor, where the rest builds off of. However, the one true main character, Gus, who is what you would call ""normal,"" struggles with an inner-conflict of guilt from his past. This conflict influences his family, his image as a role model, and finally brings on a twist to the movie. This twist completely ties the plot together and clearly wraps up the message you're supposed to take away from the whole experience. Despite all of the genius and wonderful factors to making this movie as enjoyable as it is, there are a few flaws. At times it can be quite vulgar in terms of language, vomiting, and sexual references. Of course all of these factors are meant to be humorous, but they may step on some toes and cross the line for some viewers. However, if you enjoy the humor in ""Billy Madison"" or ""Happy Gilmore"" then ""Benchwarmers"" is perfect for you. Ultimately, the movie is still funny, the value you develop for each character still remains, and your attention and entertainment still come first. A movie that can be enjoyed by a variety of audiences is guaranteed success. Half of the characters in this movie don't even know how to properly swing a bat, allowing connection for non-baseball fans while granting intense humor for viewers that are baseball fans. Targeting a more diverse audience and effectively creating room for this connection through humor definitely separates this movie from your typical sports film, while earning success by doing so."

","If you love baseball and you love immature yet funny movies then this is the perfect movie for you! The Benchwarmers is basically about 3 men who were grew up being bullied and decided to join little league to make up for missed opportunities in their childhood. The actors, Jon Heder, David Spade, and Rob Schneider are the perfect choice of actors for this movie with their incredibly funny skills and acting talent. This movie is also great because it teaches a life lesson; bullying is unnecessary and stupid. I can tell you this, I've seen this movie over ten times and I've never gotten bored of it! I just love how this movie has both adults and young children in it because it creates a perfect blend of stupidity and matureness. This movie might seem unrealistic, but it is definitely not a waste of time! There are so many aspects of this movie that make it so successful and hilarious."

(not all the time obviously) Rob Scheider is a great actor and people don't give him enough credit for what he does. Same with David Spade hes hilarious and deserves more than he gets. The funny thing is that Adam Sandler made this movie and most people do not know that."

The character Clark is however not that far of a stretch from Napoleon Dynamite. Sean Salsibury is hilarious in his part. Several stars from Saturday Night Live past are in this film.

","Entertaining feel-good faire about a landscaper (Rob Schneider) and his two nerd best friends (Jon Heder and David Spade) who take on the bullies of their state in a winner-take-all baseball tournament. The hook is that all the bullies are 12 years old or under. You pretty much get what you expect: stereotypical good guys vs bad guys , fart jokes, large breasted women WAY too hot to be interested in the likes of the downtrodden three, a good 80's-90's Adam Sandler-esquire soundtrack and numerous sight gags that make you squirm in your seat. What was unusual was the movie was actually pretty good. All the actors played their parts reasonably well and Heder was hilarious. (Although I half expected that there was some sort of product placement for a tanning system in this movie as everyone but Heder appeared to be way too healthy looking.) Definitely worth the price of a ticket."

I was not disappointed. He pulled off being an idiot without recreating his Napolean Dynamite character. He was funny.<br/><br/>There were other elements of humor that were random, silly and funny. I found myself laughing out loud, but unembarrassed. Many of the scenes caught me off guard.

"CaptainKill","9","1","1","18 April 2006"," Winning is good
","First of all, I thought that this movie was very funny. I liked all the actors involved and I thought that they were all written well within their acting abilities. I actually LIKED this movie.<br/><br/>However, I am getting a little fed up with all this ""competition is only fun if everybody wins"" crap. This message is irresponsible. In every game there must be a loser. But that is what makes winning so fun; to strive your best and to achieve. Not because anybody GAVE it to you but because you EARNED the victory by your own right. Success in anything is not satisfying unless it is truly earned. Anything worth doing is worth doing right and doing best and worth STRUGGLING. The struggle is the best part! Now don't get me wrong, I do agree with the movie's other primary message that sportsmanship (winning with grace), is what makes the victor a real winner. I am glad for this message. Children can be so cruel to one another. I, myself was ostracized a great deal as a child. I moved around a lot (always the new kid) and was very poor. I smelled bad and other kids made fun of me ruthlessly. However, I stopped feeling sorry for myself and realized that no one was going to shape my destiny better than me.<br/><br/>Why am I saying this? Because the other message this movie is sending out is everybody has just as much right to win as anybody else. If I adopted that attitude I would be bitter and sad today. No. Those who are honest, hard working, and disciplined are the ones who have earned that right. Those are the ones who achieve.<br/><br/>Sure, sports are just games and should be enjoyed by all involved. And those who are more skilled should improve the experience of everyone involved by doing there best to improve the 'game' of the less advanced because 1) It increases the skill of adversaries, thus improving the competition 2) The losers become winners because they overcome themselves.<br/><br/>But the FUN is the honest to goodness competition and the dedication it takes to watch yourself improve over time and eventually come out on top. I'll say it again; the best part is the struggle! Winning is not bad, and all winners are not bullies. I win all the time now. These days I expect to win. I expect to win because I know that I can.<br/><br/>Anybody can win if they are willing to take on the challenge and the JOY of competition. Winning is good. Winning does not bullying.<br/><br/>Okay, maybe I took this movie a little too seriously."

David Spade was good like always but even his jokes could have been funnier. I felt as though I was watching Napoleon Dynamite the sequel. This could have been a lot funnier if the jokes were made to be more crude.

","Spoilers follow...<br/><br/>Since every comment on here so far falls into either the ""absolutely loved it"" or ""my god that was a piece of crap"" categories, I'll throw in my slightly more balanced review of this movie.<br/><br/>Look, it is what it is. Stupid and amusing. Rob Schneider mostly plays it straight here, so most of the laughs come from David Spade and Jon Heder as his two incredibly nerdy, awkward, and uncoordinated friends. Heder unfortunately is doing a rehash of his Napoleon Dynamite character, but he still wrings some laughs out of it. Spade's acting consists mainly of wearing a silly wig and spouting one-liners with perfect comic delivery. My favorite performance in the movie comes from Nick Swardson (who also co-wrote the script) as Spade's agoraphobic, albino-esquire brother. He's really funny. Also, Chipps Cooney as the crazy old guy they ding and ditch is hilarious.<br/><br/>SPOILERS The plot is pretty much inconsequential. The third act drags when it's revealed that Rob Schneider was a terrible bully growing up and he's been trying to assuage his guilty conscience by sticking up for the nerdy kids now. When everyone discovers this, all Rob's friends and admirer's feel betrayed, and he has to face the little person he tormented so badly as children that the guy ended up in a mental hospital and now lives in his mom's basement. Basically, it gets really weird and emotional, with heartfelt speeches of apology and acceptance. None of that's funny.<br/><br/>Also, a little personal commentary on the message I got from the ending (MORE SPOILERS): I found the apparent message of the movie to be a little distressing. What happens is that the adult Benchwarmers don't play in the final game, instead letting the nerdy kids play the tough bullies. By the last inning, the nerds are getting their asses kicked like 27-0. But when the bullies see that the nerds are getting cheered despite the fact that they suck, the bullies become bitter at their own hyper-competitive coach, and decide to let the nerds score a run in the name of fun and friendship. And then all the nerds celebrate and are happy because they scored.<br/><br/>So, the message I got from this ending is, it's perfectly okay to patronize people, and to be patronized. Apparently there's no value in working hard and practicing to get better at something--it's just as good to have the other guys take pity on you and let you win. It's celebrating athletic mediocrity in the same way we celebrate academic mediocrity in schools where teachers don't use red pens to mark mistakes because then the kids' self-esteem might be hurt. That's a bad mentality to be instilling in our society."

","Well, you see the posters and watch the commercials, and from getting that idea, you can only blame yourself in being disappointed by this movie. Aside from the 'brown stew' and the nose pickings, I think the Benchwarmers is a complete miss with kids. I found myself rolling my eyes and cringing at every joke, insult and bug chewing. But you know it's what you're kids want to watch or how you feel like spending your night that really matters.<br/><br/>Three full-grown adults play ball against a full roster of 9-10 yr. old kids to avenge the kids the team bullied. After seeing the men play, a billionaire decides to sponsor a round-robin tournament with the victor winning a stadium in their honor.<br/><br/>Vomit, farting, nose pickings, need I say more? There's plenty more stuff than you really want to know unless you intend to see it. The Benchwarmers is not about acting or story. Really, the three leads cannot be anymore happier that they're still acting. But the movie is frankly somewhat okay for kids, and a total headache for adults. Watch at your own discretion."

","OK, I saw The Benchwarmers with a few friends of mine. I had seen the previews before and it looked pretty good so i thought alright I'll check it out! I have to say i expected a lot after paying $8.50 to get in the theater. So when the movie started playing i was a little anxious. The storyline starts off fast so you have to pay attention to it. All i could say after the movie was WOW I swear it's my favorite movie ever! i was laughing so hard at some parts i seriously could not breathe. i know thats just a figure of speech but i could not breathe. Some of my friends told me that the humor and jokes were all old fashioned but did i care? no way!! This movie had me waiting for the next hilarious part! I may be just a teen with a weird sense of humor, but i know what me and my friends and a whole bunch of other teens like to see! and The Benchwarmers was the best example i could find! 10 out of 10 this movie totally rocks my multicolored spaceship box!"

","The Benchwarmers has always been one of my favorite comedies from Happy Madison. It felt like a good mix of The Bad News Bears, Revenge of the Nerds, and Happy Gilmore. Rob Schneider does probably one of his best performances here. In most other movies I've seen him in. He's either an ethnic stereotype or a complete weirdo.

They're usually so bad I can help myself but enjoy them. The Benchwarmers isn't an exception. These movies usually have a great starting idea (fighting bullies in this case), some good or great jokes and a lot of bad ones and terrible acting. The Benchwarmers adds a few pretty ladies, geek stuff and cool movie cars. Even though I rate these movies around 6/10, this one doesn't deserve more than 5/10 in my opinion. Acting performances are really bad and some of the jokes were a bit more annoying than usual. So there you have it - I like this kind of movies, but Benchwarmers are barely average.

","The Benchwarmers does not star Adam Sandler, but it is a Happy Madison creation starring some of Sandler's best friends. His other best friends were off doing his other creation entitled ""Grandma's Boy"" which as much better than this.<br/><br/>This was back in the days when Sandler films were actually good and funny. This is not great, but it has good morals and truly funny moments.<br/><br/>The Benchwarmers is about the bullying misadventures of three geeky friends: landscaper Gus Matthews (Rob Schneider); video clerk Richie Goodman (David Spade); and paper boy Clark Reede (Jon Heder). All have been subjected to bullying their whole lives and want it all to stop. When the guys witness a group of little league kids harass a nerdy rich boy, it reaffirms Gus' gift for baseball and gives Clark and Richie confidence. The guys meet the kid's billionaire father, Mel (Jon Lovitz), who has an idea to start a baseball tournament with them playing against the little leaguers. Just as the guys are blossoming and doing well in the tournament, a secret about one of them is revealed that changes everybody's perspective of the issue.<br/><br/>Yes, there are flaws. Yes, most of them are forgivable. Mel says to start a round-robin tournament, but it is just regular one-game elimination: completely different from round- robin. Then there's the scene when they meet Mel: it makes no sense. Then there's Schneider's wife being played by Molly Sims: its always odd seeing a a hot chick that's taller than her ugly husband.<br/><br/>Then there are flaws that are unforgivable (two to be exact). The first deals with the status of bullies and the victims. The Benchwarmers themselves--the geeks--have dead-end jobs that's just sad to see 40-year-olds do. Then the guys that bullied them when they were younger, (and still do) are successful business men and own their own stores. This is a very wrong message to send to people--if you bully, you will become a success. That's so wrong! A terrible message! If anything, it is the other way around!<br/><br/>The other flaw is the reveal that I mentioned that changes the fate. It turns out that Gus was the biggest bully in his town at the time who picked on everybody hardcore. He picked so hard on one kid who was a midget so badly that he had to be put in a mental institution. Gus feels tremendous guilt and does not want to have kids because he is afraid of karma. When the story breaks, he gets kicked out of the team and everybody betrays him. I've always hated that aspect. Gus says on TV how bad bullying is. And it is very evident how much he's changed. He's such a great person now. He's not the same person he once was! His eyes are filled up with tears as he tries to hold back his cry of guilt after his friends find out about it. Does that not say something!? It leads to some good talk about bullies and everything, but they could have had that talk if the before part was changed!<br/><br/>Luckily, the comedy makes up for this. Then there's how well the characters were written.<br/><br/>3/4"

Richie (David Spade) is an annoying little video store clerk. Clark (Jon Heder) is the hopelessly idiotic newspaper delivery boy. They come to the rescue of a chubby geek being picked on by a little league baseball team. The three guy challenge and win against the kids team. The chubby kid's billionaire nerd dad Mel (Jon Lovitz) comes up with a tournament idea. The three guys play against all the kids baseball teams for the prize of a real ballpark.<br/><br/>This is a really stupid premise. I'm not saying this is illogical or unrealistic. That goes without saying. This is a problem because the 3 guys aren't actually underdogs. They need to be underdogs in a sports movie sense. I'm not sure it's that much fun watching adults beating little kids. And quite frankly, I would just intentionally walk Gus every time.<br/><br/>The only saving grace is that Rob Schneider is actually likable in this. He's not playing his usual jerk character. When Molly Sims pops up for the first time, I had to roll my eyes. After Rob plays his character for awhile, I can see the marriage happening. He just needs to play this character in a better movie. This is a poor mess that a late night writing session created. I bet somebody had a little much and thought it would be funny to have adults win against little kids baseball.

","Clark (Jon Heder), Gus (Rob Schneider) and Richie (David Spade) are middle-age, hapless geeks who have constantly been belittled and treated like second-class citizens just because they're uncoordinated, socially and athletically inept, and overall anemic and soft. One day, on the baseball diamond, they stand up for a young boy named Nelson, who is similar to the men in the way that he always seems to be a target of embarrassment and the butt of every joke. After defending him and proving worthiness by winning a baseball game, the three men are approached by the boy's father, Mel (Jon Lovitz), who wants to assemble a baseball team called ""The Benchwarmers,"" which consists of one nonathletic soul after another. The men bite and make a bold attempt at trying to live up to Mel's standards, whatever they may be.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, writers Allen Covert and Nick Swardson do not make a bold attempt at making The Benchwarmers a creative, funny comedy. At a paper-thin eighty-five minutes long, I counted two small laughs and maybe a smile, which is far, far too unsubstantial for a comedy in this day and age. It doesn't help that it tries to tackle the incredibly difficult comedy act of slapstick, which I'm beginning to wonder if that form of comedic talent was buried with Chris Farley in the late 1990's.<br/><br/>A large part of the reason that Benchwarmers fails as a farce and as a satire is that, for one, it capitalizes on humor that is monotonous and immature. The second part is it's a failed satire on players that are actual benchwarmers in their own leagues. Instead of presumably giving a film to relate to, the writers find it much easier to sneer at their attempts at succeeding and their earnest passion for a game they may not be good at.<br/><br/>The film was released by Happy Madison, a studio I've long been at odds with when it comes to reviewing their films. Adam Sandler, the company's founder, often makes films where he puts the audience in the unruly position of laughing down at the characters and making them either incredibly unlikable or just not very interesting from a human standpoint. Not even interesting in the sense of being comedy vehicles. The result with Benchwarmers is three popular comedians doing work that should be written and performed by second-rate improv actors. Not these names. And don't get me started on Nick Swardson, playing Richie's brother, a sheltered albino with an uncompromising fear of the sun and the outside.<br/><br/>On a final note, this was directed by Dennis Dugan, the director, or perhaps victim, of many Sandler films in the 2000's. Even though I can't immediately recall a film directed by him and pioneered by Sandler I've liked, I can say that this won't be the first one I think of when I think of his worst pictures. After all, in 2006, I'm sure he couldn't foresee the film he'd later get tangled up in, like Just Go With ItYou Don't Mess With the Zohan.<br/><br/>Starring: Jon Heder, Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Lovitz. Directed by: Dennis Dugan."

","Every 7 minutes a kid in the United States is experiencing some form of bullying. The Benchwarmers fights for the ""little guys"", the ones who get bullied and don't get respect. Bullying can sometimes lead to permanent mental scares and memories that never go away. The movie contains a strong moral message about relieving the pain that bullies can cause, as well as asking forgiveness from other individuals who have caused harm.<br/><br/>Gus (Rob Schneider), a local landscaper, gathers his nerd friends Richie, the lonely nerd recommending sex films (David Spade), and Clark, the local newspaper boy (Jon Heder), to form a baseball team of 3 (Outfielder, Pitcher, and Catcher). Their goal is to beat little league teams consisting of 9 players, so they can inflict revenge upon the bullies, while creating an environment where nerds and jocks would be able to play baseball together. Jon Heder deserves credit for channeling his Napoleon Dynamite character without duplicating him. Rob Schneider takes charge but refrains from dominating, while David Spade provides a perfect mastermind for Heder's foolishness. In The Benchwarmers, the actors do a suburb job at keeping it hilarious and sticking to the moral message even without Adam Sandler in the Happy Madison Production. <br/><br/>Happy Madison Productions is founded by Adam Sandler, and as a result the movies created by the Happy Madison Production Company often contain the same actors. This is because they are friends of Adam Sandler and they receive worthy reviews, but it doesn't matter who the lead actor is for the productions, because they constantly bring out the laughs. The Benchwarmers still feels like a combination of previous efforts, like The Waterboy, where someone unexpected is brilliant at a particular game, while both dealing with dilemmas against bullies. The comedies that are created by Happy Madison Productions link together and come up with amusing dialogue and incidences where the one who gets bullied comes out on top.<br/><br/>The positive elements are laced with amusing humor and foul language. There are some jokes about dwarfs that some may find offensive but the audience will get plenty of good laughs. The dialogue may be immature at times like when Richie says, ""Steroids make your 'peepee' small"" and Clark answers, ""There must be steroids in my mac and cheese"", but it keeps the spectators entertained and laughing throughout the movie, while sticking up for the ones who get bullied in a funny manner. When a bully says, ""Time to make your makers"" and Clark responds, ""Makers of what? POOP?"" The quote shows how the jokes are immature, but also indicates how the ones who are getting bullied are sticking up for themselves.<br/><br/>Anyone who goes to see The Benchwarmers and has liked any previous movies produced by the Happy Madison production will almost certainly enjoy this one as well. The film is impressively done with witty quotes, which makes it oddly funny. The Benchwarmers is not for anyone younger than 13. Fans of the Happy Madison productions will not be let down and it asks people to understand what bullying leads to and it achieves it in a humorous manner."
"sundog-jr","4","0","0","27 September 2012"," What The Hell...
","The Benchwarmers could have been so much better. Probably not good, but much better than it was. First of all, if you're going to watch this, you have to force yourself through the first thirty minutes or so, because it's all about young teens and pre-teens being bullied relentlessly and it's painful to watch at times. Their cruelty is played for humor, and a lot of the time it's not even remotely funny, but appalling and offensive. If you've ever been bullied, which is everyone at some point in time in your childhood, it especially offends you. But, after the thirty minutes of hell, it actually gets better. not much, but better enough to the point where you can actually watch it without cringing. Sadly, this is the best part of the movie. The bullies get their just desserts in the end (how shocking) and it's fun to see them pay, almost comical at times, but once it gets to the end, everything turns completely sappy. The bullies are smiling and pitching balls to the kids they bullied and purposely letting them win, and everyone's happy, and they all go out for pizza (speaking of which, this entire movie is really just a giant advertisement for Pizza Hut) but it feels so preachy and forces niceness upon you that is totally unwanted. the humor is totally crass and crude throughout, so why stop and turn it into a happy little cheese fest at the end?? If you're gonna go the crude route, go all out. that's what made certain movies like Step Brothers and Pineapple Express watchable for me, the humor was awful, but at least it was consistent. overall, The Benchwarmers leaves you with a weird taste in your mouth. Actually, my first thought after the movie was, ""What the hell just happened..."""

","The Benchwarmers follows Gus, Richie and Clark as they play baseball to make up for missed opportunities in grade school due to them being bullied so much. So they form a team with just the three of them to compete against little league teams. <br/><br/>I like Rob Schneider. I think most of his films are quite funny. This one is an exception. I felt it tried too hard to be funny and it just didn't come off. However, there still was a few funny moments. I think if they strayed away from fart, puke and crap jokes, maybe it could have been better. Because the characters were good, and the backbone of the story line could have been utilized more competently. <br/><br/>The film is a usual Schneider film so if you don't like him, you probably won't like this. But if you do like him, you will probably like this. It is just plain, stupid humor. And plain, stupid humor isn't for everybody. Nick Swardson has, somewhat, of a funny role. Every time he was on camera he made me laugh. I was saddened to find he co-wrote the screenplay because he's a lot funnier than this. <br/><br/>If it's coming off that I didn't like the film then let me correct that. I did like it, it was enjoyable to watch. There was just so much more they could have done with it if they had more competent writers."

David Spade is also funny, but not as much as i expected. i was expecting to see something funny to the point where i'd have to hold myself from peeing in my pants. however, i was greatly disappointed. it just goes to show that rob Schneider can't act in a role where he's the straight smart one. he's only good acting like an idiot or an ""animal"" or ""hot chick"" or ""gigalo."" probably because he is an idiot. also, John Lovitz isn't that bad in the movie. he does some pretty funny and crude stuff like show his nipples. other than that....the movie blows a fat one. do not waste money or time on this movie!"

","Not the greatest of movies, but then again Rob never tries to make out that he is the best actor around. Rob Schnieder is witty and clever in most of his movies, basically what you see is what you get with Rob Schnieder movies.<br/><br/>At least in this movie he is not the geek or butt of all jokes, he is almost trying to be serious. Despite the cheesy script and naff jokes the movie survives on Schnieder trying to challenge himself, Lovitz and Spade adding with their comic talents and the other trying to be a geek.<br/><br/>Don't take the movie too seriously but enjoy the comic moments and have a laugh. It is not that bad to be nominated for Razzie, although it will never win an Oscar. Just let your hair down and indulgent in the cheese."

It's not something you should go out of your way to see, but if you watch it without expectations you'll be entertained. Very formulaic plot, but it's still fun despite all the reasons it should be bad. The cast made me laugh consistently. I've always enjoyed Rob Schneider despite myself. He has an easy, pleasant demeanor that makes him easy to watch. I loved the ""class reunion"" of typical Saturday Night Live former cast members. <br/><br/>All in all a very watchable film if you are the type of movie watcher who can just let go of expectations and enjoy some good, mindless entertainment."

John Heder is hilarious. David Spade is funnier than you might expect, and Rob Schnider is in it too. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is sub par, but who cares... it's funny. Is this movie gonna change your life? No. Is it a decent way to kill an hour and half, yes. It's not anything special, but it's pretty alright.

I really did not need to see another Jon Heder reprise of Napoleon Dynamite. Oh well, win some lose some. Overall the humor comes from Jon Lovitz' role in the movie. Probably one of the coolest roles in movie history. He really saves the movie in my eyes. There were other laughable parts in the movie. Mainly crude low brow humor, but funny all the same.

","Dennis Dugan's slapstick comedy, The Benchwarmers is decent, but not the directors best work (Happy Gilmore was much better, Big Daddy was a bit funnier too). But the film is not a total failure, it features Heder in another funny geeky role which is pretty much along the lines of his breakthrough in Napoleon Dynamite. Some of the jokes and plot lines are predictable though i actually liked Schneider here much more than his deuce bigalow flicks. David Spade is wasted in my opinion although he has some funny scenes, overall this is a decent comedy, good for some laughs, but not the best or most original idea.---IMDb Rating: 5.3, my rating: 7/10"

Eventually, they become famous with nerds and blah blah blah. The movie sucked. Jon Heder plays Clark, a retarded paperboy. David Spade plays Ritchie, a 39 year-old virgin who works at a video store. Rob Schneider plays Gus, a guy that's a repairman or something like that. It makes me sick that Jon Heder was in this! Napolean Dynamite was a very funny movie, and this makes NP look like Pulp Fiction, which it is not! The funniest character was Howie. And he's not even a main character! 3/10.

I was afraid to see this movie in the theaters and deemed it not worth my $5.75 but I accidentally watched the first five minutes in Best Buy the other day and before I knew it the credits were rolling. The movie surprisingly kept me wanting to know what happened next which is rare for a Happy/Madison production. I laughed and actually cheered once, i think, for the Benchwarmers and the last five minutes took a rather bizarre twist when the momentum and gist of the movie changed but held your attention. It is a great movie and I would almost recommend it for the Friday night family movie if not for the recessive use of curse words and sexual references that pop up here and there but for 15 and up (especially guys) this is a must see.

","Who could have thunk that Rob Schineider (Deace Bigalow: Male Giggalow), David Spade (Joe Dirt) and Jon Heder (Napolean Dynamite) would star in a movie together about losers who form a three man baseball team to wipe out the competition? I didn't and if you enjoy gross out comedies like the ones mentioned above than you will positively enjoy the fun romp. The plot is simple and tasteless: Three older guys: Gus (Schenieder), the more popular of the three who actually knows how to play the game of baseball, Ritchie (Spade), the dweeb video store employee who enjoys hitting on the women who walk into the store, and Clark (Heder), the slightly dumb but lovable mama's boy who lives at home with his mother and enjoys macaroni. So they hire childhood nerd turned rich guy (Jon Lovitz) to be their team manager and they start playing against all the little league teams across the state and they prove that Dweebs, Geeks, and Nerds are people too with hilarious results. Did you know that before he died Chris Farley would have been one of the three guys in the movie and after his death they stashed the idea away to wait for a more opportune moment, now, I'm not saying that Farley is bad, but this is a good movie all on its own. The cast look great together and look like they had a lot of fun making this movie together. This movie will definitely find its audience so go see it and enjoy it.<br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"

","Gus, Richie, and Clark are three of life's wallflowers. Richie, for example, still works in a video store and has never kissed a girl while Clark has a paper route and thrills to macaroni and cheese dinners from mother. When they spot a baseball team full of bullies doing their thing on a group of sweet nerds, they hatch a plan. The three of them will take on any little league team that has swelled heads and cold hearts. Nevermind that only Gus can hit and pitch, the trio do quite well and create havoc for the bad news bears everywhere. They even get a sponsor who promises a lovely new baseball field to the winner of the benchwarmers vs. bullies season. But, are there secrets that will destroy the benchwarmers noble ideals? This is a funny movie, without a doubt. The three stars, Schneider, Spade, and Heder, are a winning and wacky combination, to say the least. The gentleman who plays Richie's agoraphobic brother is a scene-stealing guffaw machine as well. The movie has top notch production values in costuming, scenery, script and more. The only problem, in-your-face throughout the film, is the bathroom humor that goes too far. Parents should be cautioned about this gross-out material before the family sits down to watch the movie together. Nevertheless, Benchwarmers has some good messages and giggles galore. It should be a hit with older children and fun-loving adults everywhere."

I've seen a lot of movies that try to be as funny as this one and they do not come close. The only thing i would complain about is Jon Heder's role being almost identical to Napoleaon Dynamite. Heder was not given a chance to be as fuuny as he could have been. His amazing performance in Napoleon Dynamite might have type-casted him into playing only these kinds of roles and thats one thing i think he should be careful with. Some of the jokes Heder had to deliver weren't that great, but if you think about it, it is a kids movie and it is not meant to be vulgar and raunchy. The jokes in this movie were aimed at the younger audience, but it doesn't mean that adults will entirely hate this movie. I give it an 8/10."

","OK I know some of you think this is a stupid movie, and it is stupid but its so funny that I laughed the whole way trough. The main reason I liked this movie is that it doesn't give away all the jokes in the trailers you see on TV like in Click where they use all the jokes in the trailer and when you go to the movies and watch it you wont laugh as much because you know most of the jokes. But in Benchwarmers they add inn a bunch of Colorful characters that spice up the movie. And I think Jon Heder is perfect in his role in this movie and he adds a little Napoleon Dynamite feeling to it. The worst thing about this movie though is the child actors there just something about them that makes this movie so childish. But if you like stupid movies with stupid humor(like I do) You will definitely like The Benchwarmers."
"Randy_Marsh","6","0","0","23 June 2006"," I expected less.
","I attended The Benchwarmers yesterday just fresh out of a hot box expecting a movie full of baseballs to the face and lots of ""DERP"" humour. For those of you that aren't familiar with ""DERP"" humour, it's when in a movie a character gets hit in the head over and over again with something just to get cheap laughs. It can also be associated with Rob Schneider and David Spade movies when they just play some half-assed character for 90 minutes every year. But no, this movie was different.<br/><br/>Rob Schneider didn't play the bumbling idiot that we have all grown to hate, instead he played a strong, tough, short guy that has an extremely hot wife that wants to have kids right away. David Spade plays the nerd that thinks he's got a way with the ladies, and the guy from Napoleon Dynamite plays....Napoleon Dynamite, with a helmet on, during the whole freaking movie. Movie had some great long running gags and pranks that made the car ride home an enjoyable one. Of course the movie had kids getting farted on, David Spade getting hit in the head with the ball, Napoleon Dynamite throwing a bat at stuff and the usual elements that make Happy Madison productions pretty useless, but all-in-all it was a decent flick.<br/><br/>On the Wal-mart bargain bin scale of $1.99-19.99, I'd pay $6.88 for it, on VHS."

","I don't think anyone expects these kind of movies to be Oscar worthy by any means, but I was pleasantly surprised how this story was handled. I was expecting something like The Animal, or Deuce Bigalow 2,or even the terrible White Chicks, but instead I was treated to something more than mindless humor. I really enjoyed the trio of Schneider, Spade, and Heder. I thought they worked really well off each other as geeky underdogs with Schneider as the unofficial leader of the group. I also enjoyed the performance by Jon Lovitz, as the uber-rich mega nerd with an unholy obsession of all things Star Wars related (my kind of guy) as well as cameos of the Kit 2000 and the original 66' Bat Mobile created by George Barris. This is one of the better ensembles of the late 80's to early 90's SNL alumnus, rounded out with Tim Meadows, and Chris Farley's younger brother John, as the ambiguous ""pool boy"". Benchwarmers is much more than cheesy humor, it has heart and keeps true to its title with its shear hilarity and heart-warming performances."
"Jay_Exiomo","6","0","0","31 May 2006"," Ain't exactly All-Star material, but good enough for a few minutes off the sidelines
","Right upon seeing the trailers of the film, I have always thought that it would be another one of those Adam Sandler-produced films with Rob Schneider among the leads. It is; although to some extent, I found it entertaining, albeit not hilarious in a roll-on-the carpet sort of thing. As has always been said, it's good for a few laughs and that's far more than I can say for most comedies I've seen this year (although one can argue that it could be just because I was having a pretty bad morning). It's oodles of sophomoric gags and potty humor (as expected) but they managed to pull it off. The material is so ludicrous that on paper it's hard to see how enjoyable it can be, especially since you know how it's going to start, how the plot will be driven, and how's it going to end. But, so help me, I ended up liking the end product.<br/><br/>The movie starts with nerdy Nelson playing baseball with his friends on a diamond when a team of bullies picks on them. Landscape artist Gus (Schneider) and newspaper boy Clark (Jon Heder), who happens to be nearby, chase the bullies away. Together with Richie (David Spade), the three of them play ball but soon, the bullies return demanding that they leave. Gus challenges them for the right to the field, and the three friends win. This impresses Nelson's father Mel (Jon Lovitz), a billionaire, and subsequently holds a single round-robin wherein their team, The Benchwarmers, will battle it out with all the little league teams in the county, for the right to a new multi-million baseball park he's built. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>Granted, pratfalls aren't necessarily a constant source of humor. But somehow I had this perverse pleasure from watching Heder's clumsiness and Spade's deadpan humor during their training with Reggie Jackson himself, and the actual games. Heder's Clark character hits the same spaced-out note as he always does, but he's still pretty funny in a non-irritating way. Schneider is laid-back here, which goes against his usual style.<br/><br/>The real surprise, however, is that a movie with such obviously low intentions would play its cards right with director Dennis Dugan and writers Allen Covert and Nick Swardson managing to keep the film from being a total frenzied hodgepodge of witless humor whose only purpose of being there is to stretch the running time. There's nothing groundbreaking about it nor it is something special that you should rush to see it in theaters. But I found it entertaining and I had no regrets seeing it. Then again, I was having a bad morning so I may be wrong."

As this movie went on it made me put my hand over my face and wait for the movie to be over. This movie starts out with three friends named Gus, Clark, and Richie, three guys pretty much get no respect from anybody. But one day they end up helping a kid who was being bullied, by playing them at a game of baseball. By miracle they beat those jerks, but it soon doesn't end there as they become a target from a bunch of big shots who really want to beat them.

So I was skeptical when i saw that Napoleon was going to be in this movie, but his character was much stronger in Benchwarmers. Rob Schneider was another actor that worried me. I can't say I have ever been a big fan of his movies where he simply plays a girl, or a male prostitute, or something else stupid. In this, however, he has a more believable role yet still succeeds in making you laugh. Because this movie was directed by Adam Sandler you can expect classic comedy much like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison.

","This movie really dismisses comic tradition to revel in fast paced humor and lowbrow situations. There are references to Austin Powers and to The Wedding Singer and Star Wars along the path to the surreal efforts of these supremely oddball adults, two of which have never even played baseball before. The three nerds named the Benchwarmers try to compete with powerful teams of veteran kids having a full set of players for each position. The movie is full of physical gags and gross humor throughout. However, much humor comes from the exaggeration of the awkwardness of its eccentric main characters. These guys, in fact, make the antics of the Three Stooges look like a Nobel Prize award ceremony. The Benchwarmers are the nerds of the ball diamond, who prevail even after falling behind 42 to 0. Then they find a billionaire sponsor who builds them their own baseball stadium, complete with a water park. Finally, the silliness of one gag after another gives way to the theme of the underdog getting his day. Those who are not up to speed overcome obstacles of awkwardness and ignorance and gain pride in learning new skills. It's kind of like life itself."

I found myself torn between a genuine like for this film and a sense of being ripped off. I suppose you would have to see his movie to fully understand what I'm talking about, but I'll try to convey my point as best I can.<br/><br/>Firstly, the movie has funny moments. In fact, it has some really funny moments. The scenes of actual game play are by far the best and funniest scenes in the movie. However, a lot of the dialog is delivered by through such painfully bad acting, you begin to question what exactly the director was trying to achieve. It actually borders on the surreal. It's a lot like watching one of those really strange ""Kids in the Hall"" sketches that makes no sense but is funny because it's so strange.<br/><br/>Rob Schneider does a great job as the guy who first pulls the team together and talks back to the bullies. David Spade plays a fun character too and fans of his sarcastic quips will not be disappointed. Jon Hedner, however, plays a Napolean Dynamite-esquire character that comes off very poorly. There must have been a big pay check involved here, as this movie will do nothing for his career. Jon Lovitz plays a very bizarre billionaire with the same style and delivery he always used on SNL.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a silly movie with no real tension, but with some genuine laughs.

You have Jon Lovitz who is always funny as well as John Heder who is huge right now. David Spade literally has a performance that has audiences beg for more. Why not throw in a Nick Swardson and Adam Sandler input for a movie? Everyone who had they're hands in the creation of this project knows how to make winning movies! The bottom line is, this is going to be a hit. If you think for one moment you will not like this movie than you're a traitor towards America. Baseball is America's past-time.

","Benchwarmers is a Awful movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>It has a Great cast for a comedy, but everything about this movie was just plain dumb.<br/><br/>Watching this movie reminded me of the goofy movies they made in the 70's.<br/><br/>Rob schneider did a OK job, only because his character was normal.<br/><br/>David Spade's worst roll ever.<br/><br/>The 3rd retarded kids roll isn't even worthy of me remembering his name, truly awful.<br/><br/>Jon Lovitz did a good job, i thought he was funny in his part, but again, he was a normal guy The story lines just dumb, 3 middle aged guys who play baseball against 10-13 year olds who people look at as hero's? The kids in this movie, well, they were kids, lol.<br/><br/>I found stupid humor that wasn't even funny. oh well.<br/><br/>Absolute WORST movie in their career in my book.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie if there was no other movie on and they were running my mother the car on very other station.<br/><br/>Stink-a-roo"

","It wasn't actually a GOOD movie if you get what I mean.The dialouge wasn't spectacular and the acting wasn't greatBut it was very enjoyable which in the end, I guess, is what we watch movies for.So the entertainment factor score would be higher than 6. But because it's not a brilliant film it doesn't get the full score.Rob Sneider and other actors starred in this movie, good actors.But something that does really annoy me, or someone should I say, is John Heder. I have only seen him in 2 movies, this and School for Scoundrels but he isn't a brilliant actor so I don't wish him to be in any big movies in the near future.But well done for the movie, very enjoyable :D"

","I love sports movies like Remember the Titans or the sport comedies such as Major League but the Benchwarmers did not give me that feel good feeling I got from watching other movies in the same genre.<br/><br/>The actors were good but I think they were funnier in other things. Rob Schneider played the straight guy this time around and did not have the comedic moments that David Spade or Jon Heder had. My favorite in the movie was John Lovitz with the geeky nerd come good act...... he's got all the cool toys, the huge house and dollars to burn.<br/><br/>For me there were very few laugh out loud moments but my nephew who the saw movie liked it so maybe 'I'm just too old for this'...<br/><br/>I recommend you watch it on video or cable."

","Benchwarmers is where this film belongs, on the bench unless you've got nothing else to see. If you like some of the cast members, this is a film to watch but the script is kind of lame at several points. You have to set reality aside to look for the jokes & even some of those miss the mark. In fact, quite a few of them do. Even David Spade is not as funny in this as he is in other roles. My favorite actor in the whole thing is the house keeping robot. He is the unique idea & quite cool. Too bad the rest of the film isn't as original. They try to elevate ordinary people from the bench to superstars, but in the end the idea is old & falls short of what you'd like to see & short in the punchline department. A fairly talented cast is wasted here & can't overcome the weak script."

","Seriously. Don't even bother to open the box, put the disc in the drawer, and find the remote. You're wasting your time. This movie, if you can call it that, at 1 hour and 20 minutes is a huge waste of your life you'll never get back..and you'll always regret it. Look at it this way. My 10 year old told me straight out he'd rather go to bed early then watch the rest of the movie. It was crap. The dialogue was slow, unfunny, clichÃ©d, and panders only to dim, nose picking autistic children. If you have half a brain in your head, do not watch this movie. I swear, it was written by some studio execs girlfriend, and looks like a cable access program."

Nerds, geeks and Trekkies everywhere unite! Typical underdog dribble that starts off fair enough with silly gags and a likable cast of misfits, but then wears thin pretty quick with more and more ridiculous situations, disgusting jokes, innuendos aplenty and even a super-creepy robotic butler (no kidding). Cameos all over the place by sports people (Reggie Jackson, Sean Salisbury, Bill Romanowski, Dan Patrick and Craig Kilborn) are just as unwanted and out-of-place as this entire awful production.

","Okay. Lets be real. This isn't exactly going to be a Shindlers list. It's an Adam Sandler movie. However, it has an excellent moral behind it. It is a movie for the little guy that didn't get to play ball when that is all they wanted. It is a movie where the underdog is the one you are rooting for. Add this with Adam Sandlers cruel comedy, and you get The Benchwarmers. It's a great movie, with a lot of laughs. The Benchwarmers has some twists in it, and a nerdy zillionair. It is a movie that will have you laughing until the very end, and still leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside at the end. Another A+ movie by Adam Sandler if you ask me!"

","I don't agree with bashing a movie for the sake of bashing. Our society is becoming too quick to judge and less quick to forgive.<br/><br/>Good points of 'The Benchwarmers':<br/><br/>1) Lack of profanity<br/><br/>I'm truly getting weary and tired of the overt profanity in comedies (anyone see '40-Year Old Virgin' uncut?). NO ONE who is mature swears as much as the characters in these 'R' rated comedies. It's as if the writer thought he would make the film 'edgier' with the 'F' word and less with creativity. The Benchwarmers was REFRESHING in that it didn't resort to these idiotic curse words.<br/><br/>Bad points of 'The Benchwarmers'<br/><br/>1) The idea of 3 guys against a bunch of kids didn't sell at all - if only Spade, Heder, and Rob had coached a bunch of geeks, that would have brought everything back to reality and you have had a much better movie;<br/><br/>2) More set up was needed about Rob being a bully - I would have made this film less of a stupid comedy and more of a romantic comedy in the vein of Jerry Maguire - you would have had a much, much better result.<br/><br/>3) The best Happy Madison movies came from guys who are not part of this camp - Anger Management and 50 First Dates were all terrific movies that were bought on spec. Sometimes friendship must take a backstage to the feelings of a million movie-goers who want something more."

There are many kids who are not given the chance to be popular or participate in activities that the most popular kids do just because they are not cool enough for society. This movie is great for kids and adults who just want to have a good time watching a film that is funny and also has an empowering plot.

","I really enjoyed this movie! It has a great storyline and is full of off the wall moments and characters. I can't imagine it not tickling your funny bone! <br/><br/>Some people have said that Jon Heder's character (Clark) is too much like Napoleon Dynamite, but I disagree. To write these characters off as too similar because they are both ""nerds"" is stereotypical and unfortunate. In contrast to Napoleon, Clark is a very happy-go-lucky and gentle spirit who smiles a lot and is very naive and a little slow. Napoleon wasn't any of those things, he didn't see humor in much of anything, never smiled, and came across as angry. There is a vast contrast between these characters, though they are both ""outcasts"", they are nothing alike in personality!! And I think Heder did a wonderful job playing a totally different kind of ""dork"" in this movie.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed Rob Schnieder's performance as a more serious side of a character he played got the spotlight. This movie really showcased his skills as an actor for me.<br/><br/>David Spade and all of the other actors were wonderful as well. See it!"

","You know what? After all of the criticism I had heard surrounding this movie, I fully expected it to be horrible. But once again, it turns out that snobby critics just don't seem to understand Adam Sandlers sense of humor. Regardless of their ignorance, this was the funniest movie of 2006. Jon Heder (Napoleon) proves that he's pretty much going to make people laugh whenever he opens his mouth. Benchwarmers had a lot of the guys from the Longest Yard, which was the last movie to be as funny as this one. I wasn't looking forward to David Spade, who had avoided actually funny movies since Joe Dirt, but he really rocked in this one. You could easily forget who the actor was because he looked so different. His brother, despite being weirder than all get out (eg: eating Sun Screen from the bottle) was hilarious. The movie does have plenty of bathroom humor, groin hits and physical humor, but it's always done just right. In one scene, Heder hits himself three times in a row with his own bat, but it just gets funnier each time. As a movie in general, this was really quite good, but as far as comedies this year, I give it a ten out of ten."
"deeznutz4260","10","1","3","26 April 2006"," A decently funny movie
","After hearing mixed comments about this movie i decided to check it out for myself. Entering the theater I set my expectations low, and I left the theater satisfied. The plot is rather clichÃ© and run-of-the-mill, the laughs are rather low-brow, and there's an abundant amount of potty humor but there is clearly a target audience for that and it succeeds in reaching its demographic. The acting is pretty solid through out the movie. David Spade is especially funny in this movie portraying a sarcastic, insecure little geek. The main star Rob Schneider delivers a kind of boring yet solid performance, but its nothing he hasn't done before. I am disappointed most by the acting of John Hedder. I liked him in Napolean Dynamite, but now he's becoming a one trick pony and his performance in this is poor and makes the character more annoying than anything. All of the supporting cast adds to the mix, especially John Lovitz. The story is simple, some geeks wanting revenge so they form a group of nerds to play a sport ad get recognition. Its complete with predictable plot twists. Importantly, the movie is filled with some big laughs. A lot of it is consistent snickers, some flat jokes, but there are some big laughs. So in conclusion I say grab some friends and go give this movie a shot if your in the target audience like me, but if your not I suggest stay away.<br/><br/>Score:6.5/10"

","this movie was okay. some parts were funny, but i wouldn't go as far as saying that it was absolutely hilarious though. it was from happy madison productions and i am a big fan of adam sandler so i decided to give it a shot even though i was not too enthusiastic in doing so. i feel that some the characters saved the film though. for example, Howie (Nick Swardson) was somewhat funny, but the whole eating sun lotion thing was very gross and the sun is a monster thing was ridiculous. carlos (the drunk pitcher) was also pretty funny and was definitely one of the more memorable characters in this film. carlos's fake birth certificate was the funniest part regarding him. the reward for the most interesting character, however, had to go to the number 7 robot! when comparing this movie to others from happy madison productions, it definitely missed the mark on the comedy factor and its humor was more gross than hilarious although the flying baseball bats from spade's character and his attempt to duct tape his hands to bat so it wouldn't happen again was pretty funny but again not hilarious and was somewhat corny and overdone. was it worth the $15.50 i paid for two tickets? absolutely not!! i went to see the movie because i wanted to take my friend out for his 21st birthday, but he also came out with the ""eh it was okay"" reaction"" as well. my advice (if you haven't seen it yet: wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it if you want to see it and you can wait a few months. it is not worthy enough to pay for a theater ticket, so save your money!!!!!"

Also, Jon Heder seemed to have the same character traits as Naploean Dynamite. He's a slow weird person. OK, so he did Dynamite, but this is a different movie... so why intermingle the two? This movie did offer a few laughs, but the humor grows old and dull..also, its your typical nerds vs. jocks type of movie.... it is not original at all.. the only thing i have to say is that the cast is pretty good.. they did a good job, but the movie itself wasn't very good.. if your into stupid movies... then go spend your money, but i advise that you save your seven dollars, and see something thats worth the money.

I love the salad bowl mullet hair cuts of David spade and his brother, Howie. Jon Heder did a few things reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite and that was a welcome treat. Also, Jon Lovitz was funny as the dork who grew up to be a BIll Gates style rich dude who has all the toys and the last laugh to those that teased him when he was younger. The other hysterical part is the little guy, Marcus Ellwood who plays the bullied little kid who as an adult lives in his mother's basement in a ""peanut butter fortress"" and casts spells on people. Let's also not forget the cameo of Reggie Jackson, who says he is going to train them like he learned....running, catching and hitting which equates to : ding dong ditch, playing hot potato with a real hot potato and taking mailboxes out with a baseball during drive by. At one point the opposing team tries to get an adult on their roster to play against the bench warmers and his ID constitutes a Polaroid picture taped to a piece of paper with green crayon written..""I am 12"".

Rob Schneider severely overacts, Jon Heder is just dull and Jon Lovitz doesn't bring his usual bland of interesting - he's not dull like Heder, but, if you remember him from ""My stepmother is an alien"" or from ""Two and a Half Men"", this is very dissapointing.<br/><br/>Had Erinn and Molly gotten (much) bigger roles, maybe the movie could be recommended on eye-candy alone.

This low intelligent comedy features David Spade ( with about the most ridiculous hair cut I've ever seen him in!

Filled with slurs straight from the third grade, this is nothing more then a comic effort about the bullies vs the dweebs. I was actually rooting for the bullies here, since the dweebs weren't smart enough to stay at home. I guess were suppose to laugh at full grown adults getting teased and picked on by other full grown adults. Then again, this is Happy Madison, intelligence isn't a factor for this neck of the woods.

"Screen_Blitz","3","0","1","8 July 2017"," A slapdash sports comedy where dimwitted fart jokes and slapstick humor triumphs over genuine laughs
","The Benchwarmers is about as dimwitted and sophomoric as you come to expect from a comedy produced by Adam Sandler. This movie marks yet another attempt by a comedic trio trying to garnish laughs through absent-minded humor ranging from fart jokes, to pee jokes, to seemingly nonstop slapstick gags that may have been funny when watching 'The Three Stooges' back in the 60s. Nowadays, those jokes just fall flat. Stepping the foot into the main roles are Rob Schneider and David Spade, allies of the Adam Sandler filmography, and Jon Heder, who gained popularity for his role in 'Napoleon Dynamite'. And if these actors prove anything here, it is that juvenile humor including jokes of the scatological category just aren't funny anymore, unless you are an elementary schooler where that humor is sadly still popular in that demographic. If there are any benefits raised from this slapdash comedic, it is that there are just a few laughs, but they come few and far in between. This film follows Gus (played by Rob Schneider), a man with a low-paying job and a wife named Liz (played by Molly Sims); not much else. After beating a group of kids who he witnesses bullying a poor little boy in a game of baseball, he and his friends Clark (played by Jon Heder), a paperboy, and Richie (played by David Spade), a video store clerk, form a baseball team and play in a tournament against Little League teams, and recruit a millionaire techno geek Mel (played by Jon Lovitz) as their coach. <br/><br/>There are plenty of comedies with sports serving as the narrative core that manage to shower in some clever laughs and charm to invite moviegoers in for a good time. This movie is not one of them. The best time this film has to offer to shooting a few somewhat funny jokes once every fourth time the characters on the baseball field making fools out of themselves. The main problem is that these actors seem to have nothing better to do than to plunge deep into dull sophomore humor to the point where you feel like your brain cells slowly depleting as the movie goes on. It soon becomes a continuous and almost predictable streak of how many times Jon Heder's character bangs his head or whacks himself with the bat from just being plain silly. And for the lowest common denominator, several scenes of characters farting another character's face. Unless you are a child in elementary school, this comedic gimmick is just not funny. Arguably the actor who delivers the most laughs is Rob Schneider, and his delivery of goods come far and few in between. While this is not his worst role, it certainly isn't one to leave you cheering with laughter. The rest of the actors including Jon Heder and David Spade are given nothing valuable to work with other than to spit loads of obnoxious dialogue, while Nick Swardson is tasked with nothing but to act like a goofy man-child who has fear of being out in the sun each time he makes his way on screen. At the end, the story tries to win your heart by sporting a cheesy little message about the consequences of the bullying. It is a good one, but definitely not one many people haven't heard before. <br/><br/>The Benchwarmers is a slapdash sports-themed comedy that suffers from an excess of dimwitted potty humor and dull slapstick gags. This film falls so short of comedic diamonds it willy likely to leave you checking the clock more often than investing your attention to the screen. If one were the edit out this movie and make an online clip consisting of the funny parts, they would be looking at around one minute. Now that is disappointing."

The jokes and acting are cheesy and juvenile, and the main moral of the story is aimed to be inspirational, urging the audience to avoid bullying, help children get a chance to try and win, winning isn't everything, etc., as if it's a family movie. And yet, the movie is littered with mature jokes, crude humor, bad attitudes, and profanityâ€” things no self-respecting parent would want to let their children partake of.

I'm not a fan of the way he balances his entire film on tasteless jokes and dialogue that treats its viewer as unintelligent.

","The Benchwarmers (2006): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Rob Schneider, David Spade, Jon Heder, Jon Lovitz, Nick Swardson: Lame comedy about those who have taken the backseat to the success of others. Rob Schneider, David Spade and Jon Heder form a baseball team to face those who have succeeded or sabotaged the opportunity for others. This story is getting older than time itself. We know the drill and so does director Dennis Dugan who, despite improving his ability, still makes terrible films. His resume includes such embarrassments as Problem Child and Happy Gilmore. He seems caught between an emotional theme and harsh humour and only really skilled directors can pull both off well. Here we are suppose to care but we will care more when the credits roll. Schneider actually tries to play it serious and seriously fails because he is unsympathetic. Spade works at a video store where his co-workers wonder who he is. Heder basically plays Napoleon Dynamite delivering the paper. Jon Lovitz plays a billionaire whose home should appeal more but even it doesn't take away from the fact that the film looks cheap. Nick Swardson plays yet another idiot. To stand out his character dines on sunscreen. Its theme of bullying takes a backseat to total idiocy and bathroom humour. Dugan made a lasting impression making a film that should have been benched long before production. Score: 2 / 10"

","I've always had a soft spot in my heart for these kind of dumb comedies, especially ones by Happy Madison. The Benchwarmers really had the potential to be the kind of movie that you watch with your buddies while having a couple brews late on a Saturday night when you don't have anything better to do. Unfortunately, it ends up just being meh.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is easily it's cast. Everyone does a great job in their roles and are clearly having a lot of fun which makes the film a bit more enjoyable to watch. Even Rob Schneider who I normally don't enjoy in lead roles does a good job here. The great Jon Lovitz also has a supporting role as a millionaire and has many of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is that it's lazy. These films obviously aren't meant to be Oscar contenders, but so many of the jokes go for the lowest forms of juvenile humor that it feels like it was written by 10 yearolds. That's not to say their aren't laughs to be had with The Benchwarmers, but not as many as you'd hoped.<br/><br/>The Benchwarmers isn't terrible like some of Happy Madisons other films such as Bucky Larson. It does have it's moments and the cast does a great job, but it's filled with so much lazy juvenile humor that it never reaches the heights it's underdog heroes reach by the end of the film. It's worth a watch, but don't expect it to have much re-watch value."

","When I first heard about ""The Benchwarmers"", I'll admit part of me was attracted to the premise of the movie. As a child, I was very unathletic, and as a result all too well about not fitting in because of that and the wish to get respect from my peers. Maybe, I thought, they could pull this off.<br/><br/>However, the execution of the premise was a complete failure. The first problem I had was with the depiction of the protagonists. They are more than nerds - they are REPULSIVE nerds. They seem to all be intentionally acting in the most annoying ways they can be. As a result, I had no sympathy for them.<br/><br/>The second problem I had with the movie was the frequent attempts at mining humor from such things as urine, flatulence, spit, and vomit. Hey, I'm no prude - I watch R-rated and unrated movies all the time and enjoy them. But the way this material is written and directed, it is simply disgusting and with no humor at all.<br/><br/>This movie actually did decent business when it was released. Maybe there are more of us nerds out there than I thought. But I'm pretty sure they were turned off this movie as much as I was, and won't want to see it a second time."

","If you love your comedies real stupid, then The Benchwarmers will leave you rolling in the dugout with its screwball humour.

When Gus rescues a kid being bullied by the local little league team, he starts a chain of events which sees the three grown-up losers entering a baseball tournament, representing dorks all over the USA. With the games broadcast over the internet, the three quickly become the idols of geeks everywhere.<br/><br/>But Gus is harbouring a secret which threatens to ruin his friendship with Richie and Clark, and their chance of winning the competition: at high school, he was a bully himself...<br/><br/>Starting off as silly and quickly progressing to outright dumb, this movie managed to keep me laughing for the majority of its running time. Schneider is his usual reliable dopey self, Heder plays a character that is Napolean Dynamite in all but name, and Spader is great as the movie geek who rates a film's success by how many lesbian sex scenes it has. Joining these no-hopers is Jon Lovitz, who plays the ultra-nerdy billionaire who funds the tournament.<br/><br/>The humour isn't very sophisticated (but then neither am I) and if you don't enjoy jokes about farts, bogies and midgets, then you would be best advised to steer clear. But for the rest of us who do, The Benchwarmers definitely hits a home run!<br/><br/>And if the film drops the ball somewhat towards the end with a slightly overly saccharine finale that preaches forgiveness and understanding, it doesn't matter too much; the rest of the film is such dumb fun that it's easy to be a little forgiving yourself (see, even I learnt something from the film's message!)"

A stupid comedy is never a bad thing as long as the viewer doesn't take it too seriously. Unfortunately, The Benchwarmers isn't a funny film. The movie is a weak collection of annoying and unoriginal jokes. I'm not too surprised by this though. The script was handled by one of the writers of 8 Crazy Nights and Malibu's Most Wanted. However even with a generic script and direction, the film still had some potential to be mildly funny. One person completely ruined that chance though.<br/><br/>The Benchwarmers fails because of John Heder. His timing is horrible and his jokes are so lame. He tries way too hard and he just annoyed the hell out of me. Napoleon Dynamite was a one joke comedy that got old fast yet it somehow earned a lot of praise for being ""original"" and ""hilarious"". Since the film stars Jon Heder, it has a very little chance of succeeding. He sinks an already mediocre film with his performance.<br/><br/>Rob Schneider was okay, his performance was really just routine. He still had a few funny lines though. David Spade gave the best performance which is kind of scary. The supporting actors were un-notable and they aren't worth mentioning. Despite the presence of Jon Heder I still gave the film a 5. The reviews were brutal so I was expecting the worse but the film was pretty harmless. I didn't like the film but it did entertain a little so it wasn't too much of a waste.

They certainly didn't waste any time getting to the fart jokes, the first one coming within two minutes of the start of the film. John Heder reprised his ""Napoleon Dynamite"" role which is something I think he'll be doing for the rest of his career. Rob Schnider's character is surprisingly tame. The only laughs came from David Spade's usual dry sense of humor, but even those laughs were few and far between. <br/><br/>Even with Adam Sandler as executive producer, I think I expected too much. A waste of money even at the dollar theater."

","The ending line of the movie was ""that was a waste of time"". And I think that was very very true. I felt really bad for those people who acted in this movie. It might send a message to the bullies, but I am not sure if they would get the message or rather try to bully people more. But overall felt really like I wasted my time and money on it.<br/><br/>I went to this movie because all others were full and dint know what this movie would be like. Someone said its a funny movie so I thought of giving it a go. But it was not that funny and I was bored most of the time. <br/><br/>The acting of the main actor was pretty good. I know he is a good actor and it shows. Except that, I dint see anything else that is good. <br/><br/>3/10 for good acting, 1/10 for the whole movie"
"DICK STEEL","5","0","1","3 June 2006"," A Nutshell Review: The Benchwarmers
","The main reason why I would want to go watch a movie like this, which I'd bet 95% of the movie-going audience would prefer to avoid, is actually to check out what it's done to its premise. You see, a group of friends and I had an idea which we wanted to short-film, and the trailer for The Benchwarmers was so strikingly similar. Not that the story is rocket- science to begin with, but it's sometimes helpful to check out how a treatment ended up with its release.<br/><br/>Telling the story of 3 losers who one day decide to stand up for a little guy, The Benchwarmers established their roots and take one for the Nerds, as they go up against a fistful of Jocks whom they're playing a baseball field for. Needless to say, this is the usual Nerds Vs Jocks type of movie, with a strange setting that all nerds grow up to be rich nerds, while the jocks all end up effeminate and enjoying loads of tittie-twisties.<br/><br/>Why? Don't ask, because this movie earned its cred belonging to one of those politically incorrect gross comedies, making fun of little people (Verne Troyer, better known as Mini- Me, makes an uncredited appearance), the dumb, people who speaks with saliva spewing out from their mouths, and recycling the usual toilet humour like beef-stew farts. But for the fans and geeks of Star Wars, it's a wet dream come true as there are tons of props used from the movie, as well as well-known vehicles making short appearances, like the Batmobile from TV's 60s Batman, and the 1980s KITT from Knight Rider.<br/><br/>While production values isn't exactly great - I thought at some points the movie seemed to be glued together from various separate and distinct scenes (during the outtakes, you realized that there were plenty more scenes shot which did not make the final cut). There are various unnecessary subplots, like Schneider's screen wife wanting to start a family (not that I'm complaining), but these points start to wear off as they're neither funny nor important to the main event.<br/><br/>Themes like friendship and forgiveness make its usual rounds, and there's a little ""mystery"" worked into why Schneider's Gus Bus is the only player amongst the trio who seem to be able to play baseball, and be so good at it too. Other than that, the rest of the characters are stereotypical, bordering on the insane most of the times.<br/><br/>What surprised me was the ending, as the usual good guys triumphing over the evil dudes isn't played out as it's expected to be, which of course, is at least a refreshing change. Again, not that it's a whoa! moment, but it's different enough to let one up for the nerdy kids, which perhaps is the message this movie wants to spread - to let all kids have an equal opportunity to get out there in the sun, and have some fun, never mind their level of competency in the sport."
"scott-1429","2","0","1","30 May 2006"," Boogers, Farts, and minimal laughs
","My wife and I wanted to go see X-Men 3, the kids wanted ""Benchwarmers"". The kids won out and the whole family lost on this one. I like Rob Schneider, Jon Lovitz, and the rest of the cast, and admittedly laughed out loud early on, encouraged by how the movie started out. But cliché' after cliché' set in, mired down in unfunny slapstick, until even my 13 year old son said it was lame.<br/><br/>The whole premise is weak to begin with, and at one point I turned to my wife and said ""This is just Dodgeball all over again."" The big difference? ""Dodgeball"" was at least mostly entertaining. ""Benchwarmers"" has a heartless, mindless script, despite appearing to be full of heart for the nerds, geeks and losers of the world, but it's painfully evident it's merely empty words on the screen. Rob Schneider's ""big revelation"" is no big revelation at all, and the characters are all, for the most part, bad caricatures.<br/><br/>Scene after scene after scene has you groaning over how predictable, unrealistic, and just-not-funny they are. Sorry Hollywood, but grown guys driving down the street hitting mailboxes with a baseball just isn't very funny. Nor is the tired, old wisecracking robot (poorly done at that).<br/><br/>As the movie thankfully neared the end, my wife leaned over and said ""I just want this to END!"" I was in total agreement and could not even recommend this one as a rental."
"Robert_duder","8","0","3","8 May 2006"," Silly, stupid, but you know what?? Fun.
","The Benchwarmers was no more or less of anything I expected from it. If you go in with high expectations I think there is something wrong with you?? It only delivers exactly what it presents...silly, slapstick, dumb, gross out comedy with a bit of a feel good message. I have to say that it almost exceeded what little expectations I had for it because it was more fun than I thought it would be. Wanna know how dumb The Benchwarmers is?? Rob Schneider plays the cool, jock guy of the bunch!! ANNND he's married to Molly Sims!! Uh huh. Need I say more?? <br/><br/>On that note Rob Schneider sort of headlines the cast as Gus, the less nerdy, more cool and together guy of the bunch. The bunch being his less cool best friends. Schneider is actually pretty good in his role. He's good enough to be the team leader and actually pulls off looking like he knows what he's doing on the ball field. He kind of plays a more suave version of Deuce Bigalow because he still makes the under-appreciated feel better about themselves. David Spade tones down his usual over the top performance to play Richie Goodman. Spade still delivers an ample amount of his one liners and insults which is good because he wouldn't be Spade without them. Overall...it's the same role he plays every time. Speaking of which...Napoleon Dynamite makes his 3rd Big screen appearance since the film from which he spawned. Jon Heder returns in Benchwarmers playing the same role he played in Napoleon Dynamite, and making sure to get a Napoleon line in there too. (""Yah cause it's so big""--his brain) I mean Heder is funny and has some really great physical comedy it's just not different that's all. Spade and Schneider are much more toned down for The Benchwarmers but Heder is at full swing. Another toned down comedian who I was pretty impressed with was Jon Lovitz as the billionaire former nerd funding The Benchwarmers. Lovitz usually drives me insane with his incessant yammering and annoying over the top supposed comedy but this time he was good. He has some suaveness to his character, had some good lines and didn't take it too far. Craig Kilborn was good as the preppy former bully who is coaching his son and their teammates against the nerds and losers. Kilborn efficiently makes you dislike him by being rich and snotty and tough on his kid. You'd think the kids would be more of a focus on the film but it's more about the three guys getting retribution for their years of torture from the bullies and inspiring some kids while they do it.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler buddy director Dennis Dugan takes the helm and does what he does. The jokes are one liners and grossly made bodily functions and nose picking and the likes...and of course the must have baseball gags of not being able to hit, catch, throw, run do anything. See what I am saying is that this film is just A-Typical period. It's exactly what it says it will be, it's exactly what you could expect and it's 150% predictable beginning to end and nobody does anything they haven't done 100 times before. So is it a 1/10?? NOOOOO. It's still funny and kinda cute and even slightly heartwarming amidst the fart jokes and such. Kids will probably go head over heels for it and adults will just roll their eyes but sneak a smile. It's not so bad, in fact it's probably even worth seeing. Better than your average dumb film. 8/10"

","Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Heder play Gus, Richie, and Clark. They are 2 guys that didn't get respect. Because Gus was a bully back in his childhood days but he is playing for a team against it. The Benchwarmers are a 3 man team playing against bully teams all over the state. Nelson is the son of billionaire Mel. Nelson is a kid that always gets picked on by bullies. This is the reason that Gus, Richie, and Clark take a stand and play the bullies at baseball games. Reggie Jackson, Jon Lovitz, Nick Swardson, Craig Kilborn, and Tim Meadows from Saturday Night Live co star in the comedy The Benchwarmers. It has a few good laughs in it. For the most part it is a about average film. A usually Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider movie dialog. This is enjoyable and it teaches you that it is not good to pick on people and be a bully and winning isn't everything."

Great slapstick, one-liners and some adult jokes thrown in for the not so low brow. The cast all play their roles well with Jon Heder having some of the best one-liners and physical comedy in a film I have seen for a while. David Spade does his ""David Spade"" thing.

","Every so often you come across a movie so funny that you're not even sure what was the funniest scene in the movie. This movie is one of them. Like a fat man after a mile run I couldn't catch my breath for most of the movie because I was laughing so hard. The all-star cast of Rob Schneider, David Spade, and John Heder did not disappoint. The amazing story is about 3 men who play against young kids in a tournament because they used to be geeks. Rob Schneider does really well in this movie. Benchwarmer is his first staring role in a movie since his critically acclaimed blockbuster Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. David Spade and John Heder perform very well also. This movie is great for any audience and you should see it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Vote Rob Schneider for sexiest performance on the MTV movie Award!!!"
"dbborroughs","5","0","1","19 April 2006"," Not as bad as the reviews this is a crude but funny heartwarming movie that shows signs it could have been great
","The plot of this movie has three ""loser"" adults taking on a series of snotty little league teams in order to prove that nerds can be winners.<br/><br/>With all of the negative publicity I truly expected to hate this film, but surprising I found it an okay way to spend 90 minutes. The idea is somehow clever. Don't ask me why but I found the idea intriguing. More intriguing is the fact that Rob Schneider and David Spade (despite his haircut) manage to turn in real performances (Jon Heder isn't much of anything with much of his performance reduced to picking his nose). I really liked this movie and what it was trying to do.<br/><br/>For me the problem with the movie lies in the fact that some one made the choice to go for big gross laughs. I'm reasonably certain that if they had managed to reign in some of the silliness they might have manged to turn in a movie that both critics and people who like booger jokes could love.<br/><br/>Despite the critics I think this movie is worth a shot, on cable if nothing else."

","""The Benchwarmers"" was a really cute movie. The movie's message was kept light through well timed jokes and the humor helped keep the theme from being too cheesy.<br/><br/>Don't go in expecting art- but if you want a good time and some laughs, this is a great film. The cast worked well together, and for once, Rob Schnider did not look like he just rolled out of bed. Jon Heder, as the helmet-clad paperboy, completely stole the show.<br/><br/>If you liked ""50 First Dates,"" than you will probably also enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Also, for those of you thinking of taking small children, despite the film's image, there was enough adult language to deter you from bringing in those who are very young."

","In my humble opinion, this is one of the best movies of the year. A trio of nerds (Spade, Heder, and Schneider) play against several ""jocks"" in a series of baseball games.<br/><br/>In The Benchwarmers, Gus (Rob Schneider) has a very serious role as The Benchwarmers' team captain. Along with the Mama's boy Clark (John Heder) and the very crude, dorky Richie (David Spade), The Benchwarmers deliver a great message to the nerd in all of us.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for crude and suggestive humor and language, be aware of what you take the youngest kids to see. However, if that does not bother you or them, this is a great movie to let kids see. It teaches if you believe in yourself and your abilities, you can surmount the greatest obstacles in your life.<br/><br/>The Benchwarmers delivers a fast-paced, gut-wrenching 80 minutes of laughs.<br/><br/>This movie does actually have a storyline, so expect to pay attention. Gus, Richie, and Clark are on a roll, helping the nerds when their new stadium. But, wait!!! One of The Benchwarmers may not be who he appears. Will The Benchwarmers be able to overcome this obstacle? Just for the intended message and the humor, I give this movie a 9/10.

","I went to see this movie after finding the previews funny on TV. I expected it to be mildly funny, but not hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a slapstick-type of comedy, but it wasn't the BEST comedy I've seen. Nor was it the WORST. I have read so many negative posts about this movie, and can't understand why. I find it hard to believe that some people were unable to find ""one"" funny part in this movie. I, personally, LOVE Jon Heder, and loved him in Napoleon Dynamite. His character was just as funny in this movie, and I liked all of the other supporting actors' roles. It was funny and entertaining overall. I don't feel that I wasted my money. Against my usual ""rules"", I took my 11 year old daughter to see this. After seeing the PG-13 rating, I was a little hesitant. But she's BIG into softball/baseball, and begged to see it. She LOVED it also, as did the rest of the theater audience. They were laughing equally as hard as we were."

Sure the jokes don't take a lot of thinking to understand, but that's the greatness of it. I didn't know Jon Lovitz was in it - he was great. There are also appearances by some old sports favorites.

","This movie seems like it would be incredibly dumb. For those of you who think that, you're right. The movie itself has an incredibly stupid story line, and people will ask ""what is going on here?"", but it is filled with funny scenes, both subtle and obvious. Rob Schneider plays his part well, as does David Spade as the unathletic likable movie rental store guy, and John Heder, who is the nearly retarded momma's boy. Jon Lovitz also plays a great role in this movie, and his part adds so much more comedy with the way he acts it out. Overall the movie tries to give you a decent moral near the end as it's all starting to come together, but viewers will like it much more for the obvious stupidity present in the entire film."

","The Benchwarmers/2006/**<br/><br/>Main Stars: Rob Schneider David Spade Jon Heder Jon Lovitz<br/><br/>Well, the good news is that this film was actually one star funnier than Jon Heder's feature film Napoleon Dynamite. Congrats! Not as stupid or nonsense and this film actually had a point to it. Yet did I laugh much? Sorry, no. This film had a story but was missing the directing. Where was the acting involved? Why was the slapstick getting so old? Maybe because every scene involved it. I have to tell you this film was probably the film with the most ""comebacks"" I have ever seen. ""Hey, it's Richie (David Spade), the gay video store clerk and Clark (Jon Heder), the retarded newspaper boy."" Gus (Rob Schneider) ""comes back"" with a good one. ""Hey, it's Fairy Jerry (Craig Kilborn)."" Then Jerry ""comes back"" with one of the most horrible ones I've ever heard! ""Hey, it's Gus Bus!"" No laughs. Gus instead sarcastically says that that one was too good. Then here comes Mel (Jon Lovitz) wanting the grown men that act like kids to join his created team ""The Benchwarmers"". This team is a little league team (even though three grown men are on it). Okay then. Then there are the nerds that start the team up putting it on the internet for other nerds to watch. They even get a bus called Gus Bus brought to you by the very odd Mel. The team gets their own baseball cards consisting of not only their name but their stats too. Gus gets all the good stats while Clark and Richie get the fouls and strikeouts and even swinging the bat so hard it flies out of his hand and hits a windshield of a car- that's Clark. Then he gets beat up by the opposing team member. The film continues to impress the audience with many kids laughing at stupid slapstick or nauseating or ""comeback"" scenes. While the teens are either gossiping to their boyfriend or girlfriend or cursing at a scene that just happened which I did hear a stupid teen do. Yawn. The story continues with slapstick and stupid jokes. It also gets involved a little too much in some scenes which was amateurish on the writers' parts. I'm telling ya, the movie has potential; it just doesn't use it. Instead of all these stupid ""comeback"" scenes which got really old, really fast, they could have had some actual funny scenes where I burst out laughing not just sniggering or smiling which I did throughout the entire film. While the audience is going 'HAAAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA!', 'HOLY S**T!', 'AAAAAHHHH, THAT'S NASTY', I'm sitting there with no emotion, wondering when there will be an ""LOL"" (Laugh Out Loud) moment if there will be one at all. I have to admit they tried and succeeded in about two or three scenes. But I didn't just look for the humor. Okay, maybe I did. But there was also meaning in the film. People getting bullied, picked on. How can you improve that? Will you ask for forgiveness, bullies, before it's too late? There was actually a story which is also important. But I mainly looked for the laughs and didn't get much out of it. They had potential and they could have gone a lot further yet they just didn't use it. Too much slapstick and ""comeback"" scenes and also scenes that really did not need to be shown. No, sorry, I do not recommend this film. I will recommend it for people that use ""comebacks"" often or like slapstick. In my opinion, slapstick got really old, really fast, after ""The Three Stooges"". Movie directed by Dennis Dugan."
