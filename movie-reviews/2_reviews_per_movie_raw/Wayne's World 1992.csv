","The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve ""street credibility"" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to ""do your own thing,"" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10"

","Ask most men within a decade of my age in either direction to list the 100 best movie scenes of all time, and the scene from ""Wayne's World"" where they sing/lip sync Bohemian Rhapsody in the car will be on more lists than not. It might even make every list. Not designed for the ""critically acclaimed"" snob set, Wayne's World, the film adaptation of the extremely popular Saturday Night Live skit by the same name, targets its audience perfectly and never even enters the water, let alone jumps any sharks. The movie is true to itself from start to finish.<br/><br/>The bedrock of the film, as well as the skit, is the unbending friendship of Wayne and Garth. Most children have one best friend who stands out above all others, and there's no mistaking that Wayne (SNL alum Mike Myers) and Garth (SNL alum Dana Carvey) have that type of friendship. The best friends host a cable access show in Aurora, Illinois, also sharing the skit's title. Other SNL alums, such as Brian Doyle-Murray (Noah) and Chris Farley (a concert security guard), round out the cast.<br/><br/>The plot centers around an opportunistic television producer named Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe), who, with funding from an arcade owner, turns Wayne's World into a slickly produced national show, causing it to lose touch with its audience, and causing friction between Wayne and Garth, who feel they have sold out their fans and their roots. A love interest is tossed to Wayne in the form of Cassandra (Tia Carerre), in triangular form due to the attention paid to her by Kane as well as Wayne.<br/><br/>The pop-culture cuisinart responsible for most of the SNL skits was working in overdrive in this film, and that's a good thing. Everything from product placements, to gratuitous sex, to lame plot devices were lampooned. Rob Lowe was excellent as the sleazeball junior television executive, while cameos abound from the rock world, including Alice Cooper and Meat Loaf. Though not publicized as much as the other quotables from the movie, my personal favorite scene was when Wayne and Garth were each laying on parked cars, and Garth starts whistling the closing theme from Star Trek.<br/><br/>SNL-based movies have been hit-or-miss since their inception, but this was unquestionably a hit."

","Remember how wildly popular this one was when it came out? ""Wayne's World"" didn't completely live up to all of the hype, but it's not a bad little comedy. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are great as Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar, co-hosts of a basement-based cable access show. The duo seem to have it made when their show hits the commercial airwaves, but there might just be something sinister behind it all with executive Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe) in charge.<br/><br/>""Wayne's World"" is not generally uproarious, but it certainly has its moments (the backstage scene with Alice Cooper, portraying the leather-clad rocker and his bandmates as political sophisticates, is hilarious). Myers' act wears a bit thin as the film proceeds, and the ""serious"" stretch in which Wayne seemingly loses his girlfriend and best friend just doesn't fit. But even when it's not funny, ""Wayne's World"" is usually reasonably entertaining and charming. Carvey's bizarre Garth is one of the highlights, along with some memorable parodies and writing.<br/><br/>Based on the popular ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, ""Wayne's World"" is definite period piece of the early 1990s. Its catchphrases (""... not!"" and ""Schwing!"" among them) were repeated millions of times over by teenagers. It spawned a less-successful sequel, and although there was talk of a third installment, it's almost a certainty we've seen the last of Wayne and Garth. Nevertheless, party on!"

","Penelope Spheeris (also of the Decline of Western Civilization Series and Suburbia) was chosen as the director of Mike Myers and Dana Carvey's SNL creation. This is the film that catapulted both comedians' careers into the stratosphere. 1992 is an interesting time in alternative rock history between the peak of grunge in 1991, and the coming crest of the ""punk revival"" in 1994 with Green Day, Offspring and Rancid. Wayne's World reveled in this new ""alternative rock,"" music a concept which was at the time much more flexible than it is now. Rife with irony, alternative rock was eventually the name given to the music that blended aspects of rock, metal, punk, pop, and eclectic ""weirdness."" While Wayne is the more metal half of the excellent duo, Garth is the grunge/nerd/""punk"" side of the equation. <br/><br/>Heavy metal rock and roll fandom provides the backdrop for a non-stop train wreck of social satire. Only in 1992; and only in Meyer's and Carvey's comedic genius could Aurora, Illinois ever seem so cool. Wayne's World, in the film's plot, is the name of a Cable Access television show (dare I say ""DIY"") hosted by Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. Rob Lowe plays Benjamin, an advertising scout/producer who is looking for talent to promote a chain of video game arcade stores. He finds his muse in the low-brow witticism, promptly signs the boys, and sets them up in a proper television studio. A battle ensues between Ben and Wayne for the affection of one way-hot Cassandra (Tia Carrere) who is easily lured away from Wayne at the first flourish of Benjamin's bountiful extravagance. Wayne and Garth's plans to win back Cassandra culminate in the film's tripartite finale. <br/><br/>""...with an underlying revisionist's conceit that belied the film's emotional attachments to the subject matter..."" the film was truly entertaining, whimsical, and relevant.

","Wayne's World (1992)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Highly entertaining big-screen version of the Saturday Night Live skit has best buds Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) partying and doing their public television show without much stress in their lives. This all changes once they meet up with a crooked producer (Rob Lowe) who decides to exploit their show. WAYNE'S WORLD isn't one of the greatest movies ever made but it's certainly charming and funny enough for what it is. I'd also say it's safe to say that this is one of the better SNL transitions to the movies and a lot of the credit has to go to its two stars. I think both Wayne and Garth would be downright annoying characters had the performances been off in any way but both Myers and Carvey really took these guys and made them, at times, stupid but also very charming and just the type of people you'd want to hang out with. There are all sorts of funny moments throughout the picture but the real highlights deal with the boys and their interactions with other people. Lara Lynn Boyle as Wayne's ex-girlfriend gets all sorts of funny moments as does Brian Doyle-Murray who ends up being a sponsor who gets on the wrong side of Wayne. There's also Ed O'Neill in a small role as well as Meat Loaf and Chris Farley. Also on hand is a terrific bit from Alice Cooper who nearly steals the film with the performance of ""Feed My Frankenstein"" and the hilarious backstage access where he talks about Milwaukee. Lowe also deserves a lot of credit with his comedy here as he's perfect as the snake in the grass. Even Tia Carrere does a nice job. Director Penelope Spheeris does a very good job at keeping the film moving at a very good pace and there's no question that she knows how to stage the various bits of classic rock music throughout. Fans of the SNL material are certainly going to eat this up as its as fresh today as it was when it was first released."

","Back in the early 90's, Saturday Night Live was brought back to life with a great cast. Among them were Mike Myers and Dana Carvey who created some of the most memorable characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. A bunch of Saturday Night Live movies were released, some were gigantic hits like Blues Brothers and some were misses Coneheads(which I loved by the way). Wayne's World was nothing on Saturday Night Live but two stoners who just ragged on things, how could you make it into a full feature length film? Not only did Penelope Spheeris do it, she knocked it out of the ball park with Wayne's World. It's one of the funniest movies that you could ever see with one of the most memorable scenes in comedy history making ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen shoot back up to number one on the charts.<br/><br/>Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are the hosts of Wayne's World in Aurora, Illinois, where they ogle pictures of beautiful celebrity women, play air guitar and drums, and interview local people, indirectly making fun of them over. One day Benjamin, a television station executive, when he finds out how many people watch the show, he instructs his producer Russell Finley to find out where the show is taped, telling him they may have an opportunity for a huge sponsorship. Benjamin shows up next week in Wayne's basement and introduces himself after the show ends. He offers to buy the rights to the show and to keep Wayne and Garth on for what he describes as a ""huge"" salary. Little do they know that they are about to be sold out.<br/><br/>The cast had this absolutely amazing chemistry that made this film work in all the right places adding new characters with Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe, and Kurt Fuller. I love this scene where Wayne and his girlfriend Cassandra go into a music store and he starts the riff on the guitar playing Led Zepplin's song ""Stairway to Heaven"" and the sales associate points to the sign that says ""No Stairway to Heaven"", thank you for that message! I love Wayne's reaction to it as well ""No Stairway? Denied!"", too funny. Also they meet Alice Cooper, who I met as a little girl, and he is one of the most intelligent people you could meet in real life and I loved how they captured it in this movie showing that Alice is a character, in real life he's incredibly intelligent, gentle and cool. He tells Wayne and Garth to hang with them and they just get down on their knees screaming ""We're not worthy!"" and he leans his hand out so they could kiss it! I nearly died laughing at the scene where the T2 pulls Wayne over showing him the picture of John Conner ""Have you seen this boy?"". I loved the multiple endings. There isn't a thing I would change with this movie, it's a great comedy that is just guaranteed to make you laugh till your sides hurt. I highly recommend it, it's party time.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Donatien3","10","9","14","1 July 2010"," Still excellent after nearly twenty years
","While Mike Myers may be better known for Austin Powers and Shrek, 'Wayne's World' was the film that really brought his comedic genius to the mainstream public. Originally a Saturday Night Live sketch about Wayne (Myers) and Garth (the underrated Dana Carvey) about two friends who start a public access cable TV show in their basement, it's one of the best (if not the best) SNL-to-film adaptations ever.<br/><br/>While the plot is fairly simple, where WW really shines is its clever humour. It highlights and subverts the rules of film narrative, something Myers carried over into Austin Powers, a trait which is lacking in the more predictable comedies of today (especially the awful ""parody"" films). Wayne and Garth talk directly to camera (which only they are allowed to do), there's blatant product placement, pop culture parodies, guest appearances, the famous Bohemian Rhapsody headbanging scene and funny alternate endings. Top that off with the slew of silly jokes and endlessly quotable lines (including one of the first uses of the phrase ""that's what she said""), and you have a film which – even nearly twenty years later – still strikes a chord with viewers, regardless of their age. Even towards the end, when the need to wrap up the story cleanly can ruin many comedies, 'Wayne's World' still retains its sense of humour, a prime example being Wayne's ""Oscar winning"" speech to win back Cassandra (Tia Carrere).<br/><br/>If you feel like a laugh or want to relive some memories, then you could do far worse than check out 'Wayne's World'. Excellent."
"tsheridan94","8","9","14","12 February 2010"," Best Mike Myers movie
","Mike Myers has a talent for picking horrible movies to act in. Other than this, Austin Powers, and Shrek, has he been in any good movies? I mean, the Love Guru? Honestly, Mike? Was this a punk? Please tell me Ashton Kutcher was behind that. I can only be glad, I guess, that he started out in SNL, and did stuff that was actually funny. If not for SNL, Wayne's World, and Shrek, I honestly might believe that the Michael Myers from the Halloween movies might have a better sense of humor than this Mike, albeit a twisted and violent one. I have a feeling he would be a dead baby joke type of person. But Im rambling.<br/><br/>Anyway, among all the Mike Myers movies, this easily the best. It is so off the wall and unexpected that you can't help but laugh, if nothing else, and the quirkiness of the film endings. I mean the Scooby-Doo ending? Extremely close up? And of course the shpeel involving corporate advertising. How can this not make you laugh hysterically?<br/><br/>Not of all the movie is that good. But these sub-par elements are so minor in the film's context that they don't detract too much. For instance, the plot is paper thin. The movie seems to follow more of an hour and a half SNL skit (which, granted it was based on in the first place) rather than an actual movie format. And while some SNL skits have been turned into pictures on the silver screen, very very few of them are successful. (truthfully, how many of you could figure out a way to expand the Schweddy Balls concept to 90 minutes. Thankfully, this funniest of all SNL skits hasn't been desecrated by an extended storyline.) This stupid analogy was simply to explain how some skits, while side-splitting in six minute micro-doses would drag on and on if they tried to be expanded beyond their parameters.<br/><br/>Again, these severely restricted plots work better with this sketch than they would with almost any other, because the sketch itself is just so incredibly random. It has no problem going outside the parameters, because there weren't really any parameters or limitations to contain it. So while the plot is very limited, by no means is it fatally so. I also have the sinking feeling that any big plot added to the script would have dragged it down. It has an eclectic feel. Nothing is focused, and it leaves the jokes (and there are plenty) even more funny, because they come out of nowhere and are just so off the wall.<br/><br/>Mike Myers has a lot to do with this. The other characters don't add much of anything, except for Garth, but hey this is about Wayne, right? Mike Myers takes absolute control of the script, comically driving it on and on, in a flurry of hilarious relentlessness. (Did that sound really stupid, or was it just me?)<br/><br/>So, while it's not perfect, Wayne's Workd is much funnier than most other comedies. It is also one of the few movies where factors that so often worsen a film actually improve the comedic aspect, at least. And with that being the point of a comedy, I am certain it is absolutely true to say that Wayne's World is a genuine success."

","As a middle-aged lover of world and art-house cinema, the lovably goofy Waynes World might seem an odd one for me to like and enjoy.<br/><br/>I've never owned it myself but as it's just been on Channel 4, I thought I'd see it once again, to see how it still fares. Though it's far from being my favourite movie of all time, it still hits the targets its designed to and manages to smell sweet when compared to the more recent torrent of comparative sewage that is hailed as gross-out 'comedy'.<br/><br/>Oddly, perhaps, it's impossible to dislike or find the two (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) super-geeks annoying. The film is bright and breezy and rolls along like a continual Friday night out and the rock music references, including the famous Bohemian Rhapsody sung in their tiny car, always welcome.<br/><br/>The dream women in their lives are indeed good-looking girls and their portrayal are a fair balance between teenage male hormonal fantasy and real people with substance and character.<br/><br/>Considering Waynes World is supposed to be a Cult Movie, I'm surprised how few reviews there are here, on Amazon. Whether new audiences will ever warm to WW is a different matter altogether but for of us who's seen it come, go and now hang around, it still offers many pleasures."

","Acting:
Of course the classic characters for some of mike Myers and Dana carvey playing two goofballs. They do well at making these characters who they are. They're similar to that of dumb and dumber and I really can't complain.<br/><br/>Story:
Here's where I find it not that great. It's a movie that has 0 seriousness and breaks the 4th wall constantly. That's fine except the story is just really bad, cheesy and being funny is no excuse for bad writing. There are funny moments here and there. Some are a bit too goofy and unfunny but overall that's not the main issue. The issue is that it's hard to enjoy and expierence a movie when the story is pretty boring. This would of been great if the story was just as good as the characters.<br/><br/>Summary:
Now overall I think this movie is only for a particular group of people. Otherwise I can see someone hating this or someone loving this. If you like stoner films or just goofy comedies than you should enjoy this. If not i would give this one a skip."

","Amazingly, 'Wayne's World' accomplished 2 huge feats: every joke's funny and it's the only SNL skit that actually works. (Note: every other 5 minute sketch stretched to 1.5 hours either falls flat or is mediocre, at best.) From the ""excellent"" cameos (Alice Cooper was downright hilarious) to the music segments that ""rock"" to the talk-to-the-camera and spoofs that produce some of the funniest moments, 'Wayne's World' really does work. Too many great quotes to reprint, I found myself saying out loud half the movie. It helped that, when in theaters (1992) I saw it 3x. I took a date who coincidentally was the same person I took to only my second concert: Alice Cooper. She didn't understand most of the humor, while I was rolling with laughter. Furthermore, I remember her wondering why Cooper talked the way he did backstage as opposed to on stage. If you don't follow that, or a lot of the inside jokes, this movie may not be for you. However, anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s should very much appreciate the quality of jokes and references. I.E. 'Laverne & Shirley in Scooby Doo's Mystery of Noah's Ark.' Basic plot involves the late night cable access (long before internet) show 'Wayne's World' is being targeted to a wider audience by a suspicious Rob Lowe. Everything else is just 1 skit after another, that was actually original and consistent. The entire cast was great, including Carrere, Carvey, O'Neill and Boyle. The soundtrack was wonderful. Even the chemistry between Carrere/Myers rang true (and on the other side, the relationship between Myers and his ex also showed honesty.) The only thing that did not fare well was 'Wayne's World 2.' But that's another movie all together. Watch the original & avoid the sequel at all costs."

The jokes are lame and far and few between and the acting is only marginally better. There is a touching and thoughtful scene on a car bonnet but that is the only other best bit in the film. I have given it two stars because although the awful script was written by Mike Myers who has thankfully gone on to do MUCH better with the Austin Powers films the acting of the leads was almost makes the film watchable. If it were not for the fact that they somehow managed to get loads of famous people into the film including Aerosmith then it would get just one star from me.

","Once upon a time in Aurora (Illinois), in a modest basement : <br/><br/>""Wayne's World! Wayne's World! Party On! Excellent!"" <br/><br/>""Extreme close up""<br/><br/>""Waaaaaaah""  <br/><br/>Ahhh,.. ""Wayne's World"", as one of its several number-one fans, I have so many things to say that I really don't know how to handle it. Well, how about the mega-pompous over-insightfully wannabe Ebert approach, with a nostalgic and teary eye: <br/><br/>THE MEGA-POMPOUS OVER-INSIGHTFULLY WANNABE-EBERT APPROACH, WITH A NOSTALGIC AND TEARY EYE: <br/><br/>To assert my cinematic knowledge; I would say that ""Wayne's World"" is probably to the 90's what ""Car Wash"" was to the 70's, the comedic encapsulation of a spirit that today prevails  not, with Rock'n'Roll and Heavy Metal replacing Funk and Disco as the two musical pillars conveying the nostalgic feeling of the early 90's. ""Wayne's World"" is so dedicated to music, to the very spirit that made music indispensable in those excessive post-Berlin wall consumerist days, that not only it rocked on that level, but rolled, too.<br/><br/>But more than a film about music, ""Wayne's World"" is the ode for a whole generation that grew up with 'Scooby Doo' and 'Sesame Street' and was still sucking the thumbs of the eighties at the dawn of the electronic era. Those were the times were the net was still synonym of fishing, and when Zuckerberg was still watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". In a nutshell, ""Wayne's World"" is to Cinema what ""Smell Like Teen Spirit"" was to Rock.<br/><br/>But I guess if Mike Myers was told that his film was the best that ever captured the spirit of the X-generation, he would modestly answer with a suave and solemn voice: ""I was not aware of that!"". Indeed, twenty years later, many viewers look at the film with a nostalgic eye and say 'hey, this is how it used to be' but that's only one (and probably unintentional) secondary level, in fact, when you watch ""Wayne's World"", it's a whole other dimension that cuts straight to you.<br/><br/>THE EMOTIONAL INTROSPECTION INTO WAYNE AND GARTH'S INSPIRINGLY SELF-REFLEXIVE INTERACTION: <br/><br/>Watching ""Wayne's World"" is an excellent antidote against bad mood, you're simply having a great time following the crazy adventures of Wayne Campbell, the host of a (feeble according to Benjamin) TV public-access cable show of the same name, with his sidekick and best friend Garth Algar. Mike Meyers (in his film debut) and Dana Carvey play one of the most recognizable duos of the 90's and probably the funnier and gentler, as nothing is more exhilarating than watching them making fun of their host, playing road-hockey, lying on the Mirthmobile waiting for planes to land, elaborating the most philosophical statements about girls, music and life, and last but not least, visiting Milwaukee.<br/><br/>The film sets the tone very quickly when Wayne starts talking to the camera, the fourth-wall-breaking is one of the film's greatest delights as if it was aware of its own cleverness enough to push the self-derision button, making fun of its own ending, plot devices, and getting away with one of the most blatant cases of product placements... that actually worked and became an instant classic. The talking-to-the-camera is also a perfect invitation to join this group and its communicative fun  <br/><br/>ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN  <br/><br/>It's irreverent but never vulgar, intelligent but not inaccessible, childish but not annoying, the humor displayed in ""Wayne's World"" shares the same goofiness than some Zucker or Brooks' parodies, but it defines something new, beyond the jokes and the inventive vocabulary how 'shall' I put it? Well, many lines can lead to cringe-worthy silences or awkward 'What the hell does that mean?' pauses but in ""Wayne's World"", for some reason, the weirdest lines work. Garth might sound a bit too one-dimensional but the way he delivers his ""Hi!"" and ""Thank you"" is a no-cringe guarantee, and don't even get me started on Mike Myers who can make people laugh with lines as stupid as ""Esquueze me? A baking powder?"" just as Jim Carrey can afford to play an obnoxious character like 'Ace Ventura' and keep it funny. When you got talent, you can get away with everything.<br/><br/>The film features one classic or priceless line every 30 seconds and in fact, let me rewrite this chapter's title, it's : <br/><br/>ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN, ON THE MEMORABILITY, TO TWELVE !<br/><br/>The great Howard Hawks said it himself: ""a good movie is three good scenes and zero bad scene"", then Wayne's World is a triumph on the field of comedic film-making. Penelope Spheeris directed one of the funniest American comedies, opening it with the emblematic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lip-synching scene. And till now, whenever the instrumental part starts, I feel like frenetically banging my head.<br/><br/>The film also includes a great cast, Rob Lowe as the antagonistic slick small TV exec and womanizer, and Tia ""Schwing!"" Cassandra, a beautiful Chinese singer. Good thing they avoided the obvious stereotype of a pretty blonde chick, and made her more exotic if only for the Cantonese quotes' gags, that lead to one of the most obscure and hilarious line when they order Cantonese food. The film features many great cameos, among them, a notable performance from Alice Cooper, Alice Cooper who'll help me to conclude this expose by paraphrasing one of the film's most brilliant exchanges : <br/><br/>""In fact, is it ""Wayne's World"" one of the all-time funniest movies?""<br/><br/>""Yes, Pete it is""<br/><br/>(PS1: the film made it in Gene Siskel's Top 10 movies from 1992, so believe me, it IS worthy! it IS worthy!)<br/><br/>(PS2: this review contains 10 superlatives and too many adverbs, it is so incredibly badly written)<br/><br/>(PS3: have you noticed that the review's title is a haiku?)"

","This film is about two friends who make their own local TV show. They prove to be wildly popular, until a producer buys their show and make it a national program.<br/><br/>""Wayne's World"" is a silly movie about two ultra silly man. Wayne is stupid and annoying, while Garth is neurotic and weird. Watching the two being juvenile and retarded brings me no pleasure at all. The lack of respect for others, and their lack of self respect frustrates me. If hilarity means humiliating others on national TV, being retarded and disrespectful; then I wonder what kind of world we are living in.<br/><br/>Though ""Wayne's World"" did make me giggle once or twice, but this movie is hardly entertaining."

","Where do I even start? It's difficult to rate this movie since I have so many nostalgic memories of watching it. I grew up on this crap. I don't know if I can be a truly objective viewer, but I can try.<br/><br/>How is this movie? It's fantastic, as long as you understand what kind of comedy it is? It's not a film that is going to work for everyone, but those that do enjoy it are going to not just mildly. casually enjoy it...they are going to love it, quote it, and BS about their favorite scenes with other people who love it.<br/><br/>This film is all about its meta humor. They are constantly poking jokes at the audience themselves. Without getting to into details, Many of the jokes in the movie are self-referential and break the fourth wall, and not just when Wayne himself actually breaks the fourth wall. The film is filled with pop culture references and adolescent humor. Just think of it as Beavis and Butthead if Beavis and Butthead were older and lived lives of actual consequences.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's hard to be fully objective of this film as it was one of the first ""adult"" comedies I ever saw and we had it on VHS (so I watched it a lot). If I had to criticize it in any way, I'd say that there isn't really a story/plot to the movie, the movie more works like a series of scenes put together to set up a series of jokes. For example, what is the point of the public access show that they do? Wayne's World? The title of the movie? Well...it gets scrapped halfway through the movie and thats it. They don't really address the idea of doing the show for a large audience again. Even though that's how Wayne himself set up the plot to the movie in the first scene. It's a plot line that doesn't really go anywhere. It has one big payoff laugh and that's it.<br/><br/>So that's what I mean by the movie is more a series of scenes to setup jokes...like a sketch. Funny considering the movie is based on a reoccuring sketch.<br/><br/>All that being said, this movie is funny for those willing to look past the point that they aren't telling a full story. The characters of Wayne and Garth have become iconic. And all of the supporting characters are funny as well.<br/><br/>8/10"
"lesleyharris30","9","2","3","26 April 2014"," Filled with Many Very Quotable Lines,
","Wayne's World is a brilliant movie with a well written storyline that is filled with one laugh out loud scene after another and a great comedic cast.Mike Myers clearly loved playing this character that he created as a series of sketches on Saturday Night Live,and it shows as he delivers a ton of ridiculous but hilarious lines with such enjoyment.I also really love the movies constant use of breaking the fourth wall,it only happens with Wayne and Garth,where they both know their in a movie,and I find it hilarious,especially the scene towards the end where they keep changing the ending.Waynes World is a short but sweet comedy filled with so many memorable scenes and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.<br/><br/>Two best friends become a huge deal when a TV show they film in their basement gets a deal with a real television studio,but it myth not be as great as they think. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Mike Myers"

","This shows what a great comedy film-writer and actor Mike Myers is. This is his first movie ever written and performed. It also shows how an easy idea can lead to one of the greatest movies ever made. It started with Wayne's Power Minute on Canadian television. After that Mike Myers used the same Wayne on Wayne's World as part of Saturday Night Live, the rest is history. The movie gives a great impression of how life as a teenager in the '90s was like. Very television and music based lifes who love to party and are trying to make ends meet. The movie has a nice plot with lots of other movie parodies next to it. Non stop comedy! The only times they use the same jokes is to make those jokes even more funnier. I really can't stop watching while it's on television! This movie is for sure my favorite movie ever and I think everybody will love it too! And it has an excellent soundtrack!"

","It does seem like an audacious gamble, taking a sketch that previously only existed as a short take on public access TV and getting the director of The Decline of Western Civilization to make a full-length story, but hey - Wayne's World is the most successful of all the Saturday Night Live movies. It gets by on heart, on weirdness and on the likeability of its leads.<br/><br/>Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) are on the cusp of making it, if making it is selling the rights to their public access show for $10,000. Wayne is trying to escape his last girlfriend Stacy (Lara Flynn Boyle) and has fallen for Crucial Taunt lead singer Cassandra Wong (Tia Carrere), a knockout who learned English from the Police Academy movies.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is basically a collection of great small scenes strung together with put the tiniest of plots, including a moment where Alice Cooper explains that Milwaukee is Algonquin for the good land. Ed O'Neil also has a great cameo as the manager of Stan Mikita's Donuts, with several asides to how death and murder have entered his life.<br/><br/>Wayne's World is the second film that Coleen Camp appears in that has three endings. She's also Yvette the maid in Clue. Please enjoy my trivial knowledge that will help no one."

","SNL's first spinoff since The Blues Brothers, a dozen years earlier, is very much a product of its time. It's a loving snapshot of the end of an era; a time when a roving car full of scruffy-looking dudes could stumble upon a partied-out buddy, stuff him in the back seat and revive him through the power of prog rock and timely, enthusiastic headbanging.<br/><br/>Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, still so fresh-faced that they were expected back in Studio 8H after a mere forty days of filming, clearly live for their roles. As twin emcees, they're the joyful, easygoing masters of an itty bitty sphere of influence, but quickly turn wide-eyed and innocent when a suave corporate opportunist (Rob Lowe, in a perfectly-cast turn) comes knocking with a TV deal. That whole plot is as telegraphed as they come, an unmistakably simple blueprint, and the cast isn't above cracking a few meta jokes at its expense.<br/><br/>Really, we aren't here for the story anyway. It's all about the gags, quotes, skits and one-liners, which are scattered abundantly throughout. A continuous playground in that respect, fertile grounds for a hungry crew looking to stretch their wings. I've referenced this movie, exhaustively, for almost thirty years now. And, while all the old familiar bits still draw a big reaction, this is the first time I've noticed how culturally dated they're beginning to feel. In that sense, too, it's forever stuck in the early '90s."
"MGPT80","6","1","1","13 April 2020"," Good clean nineties fun
","I've always found Mike Myers to be something of an acquired taste and struggle to warm to his work. Wayne's World is the one exception, and surely the highlight of his career. The film is fairly novel in its design and has a lot of very witty moments. Dana Carvey is arguably the star of the show, playing the uniquely amusing Garth to perfection. Tia Carrere and Rob Lowe round out a pretty strong cast with decent, if slightly cheesy, performances.<br/><br/>I would agree that the film has aged a lot since its release, but it serves as a cultural reference point and will remain a very nostalgic and enjoyable viewing experience for people of a certain age. The subversive takes on mainstream films become a bit tiresome and the love triangle story is a little corny but this is not a film that needs analysing in great detail. A fun movie, with its own unique vibe and styling."

","I never saw the bit that led to this movie. It's my belief that a movie should work for someone, even if they are not familiar with the source material. For instance, we shouldn't have to read ""Pride and Prejudice"" to enjoy a film based on it. I do like Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. The use of local cable was an opportunity for those with some creative energy to get time to put their ideas out there. Now it's You Tube or streaming. There are several bits in this movie that are hilarious in and by themselves. But without a true center and a ""script"" it is just a compilation. There is no real story here. I know that some of the previous reviewers call those that don't like this ""snobby."" I believe what they are saying is that they don't like anyone really seeing what's there and putting an intelligent set of criteria on it. This is a silly movie and very funny in places.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","1","8 November 2011"," Nearly 20 years later, Wayne and Garth still party on
","Despite being supremely silly and immature, the timeless duo of Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar manage to make ""Wayne's World"" and later its sequel two of the only redeeming movies based on ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches. Their lack of street smarts and schoolyard antics play with a lovable innocence and, more importantly, a self-awareness. It's clear that although the film is basically about two guys horsing around, the talents behind it were doing anything but.<br/><br/>The '90s had a very tough time shaking the '80s, at least as played in the movies, and ""Wayne's World"" captures this awkward transition whether intentionally or not. Mike Myers and then-""SNL"" writers Bonnie and Terry Turner wrote a movie that operated in a very forward-thinking fashion at the time but was trapped in a sea of '80s clichés and long-haired metal rockers. If the point was in fact to poke fun at those still clinging to the age of ""excellence,"" consider it received.<br/><br/>Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) are two dudes living with their respective parents who host a public-access television show in Wayne's basement called ""Wayne's World."" When Benjamin, a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe), flashes money and promises of fame their way, they sell out without realizing it, and when Benjamin starts making a play for Wayne's new babe, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), he and Garth must learn how to stand up for themselves.<br/><br/>Myers and Carvey are held responsible for making this unexciting premise entertaining. Their ability to both convincingly play and make fun of their characters, sometimes simultaneously, has few rivals. Carvey in particular makes Garth one of the most lovable characters in a comedy of this kind. Garth's intelligence is matched only by his naivete and you can see both in Carvey's performance at all times. Wayne and Garth's fondness of innuendo also captures that hybrid of witty word play and complete immaturity that makes the humor tick.<br/><br/>The magic of ""Wanye's World"" stems from being an everyman's comedy. The way Wayne and Garth (especially Garth) talk to the camera as if they've simply taken a camcorder to their insignificant but fun-filled lives makes them relatable dudes and establishes that the movie's humor is not manufactured to make us laugh, rather it invites us in for a shared comedy experience that is not above any viewer. Few comedies have done anything similar and been funny; 90 percent of them rely on contrived jokes and situations. The breaking of the fourth wall (to use the professional term not fitting of a movie like this) and the awareness of Myers and Carvey really sell us on this idea.<br/><br/>In truth, only a few moments of ""Wayne's World"" have laugh-out-loud potential, but that's fine. It doesn't need it and it doesn't ask for it. And for a movie with a completely bare plot that does enough to give its characters something to do, it still works somehow thanks to the way it takes jabs at those very conventions. That's probably why 20 years later, it's just as easy to watch this movie and enjoy it even if you didn't sit down with the intent of really watching it.

","Penelope Spheeris ""Wayne's World"" is a true classic. I first saw this film around its release in 1992, and for me it's never aged, it a film I've grown up with, from the days where I didn't quite understand the grown up jokes but laughed anyway, to the last time I watched it a few weeks ago (and yes, I got the jokes this time...). The jokes are still as witty, the sheer stupidity but yet genius of the characters are fantastic. Garth will go down as greatest geek to grace the earth, with his amazing cow prodelling skills, but yet still possesses the power to make me laugh till I wanna ""spew"". This film seems to be a starting point for Mike Myers, a playground for him to develop the comedy style that will eventually lead to Austin Powers, and being a fan of all Myers work I have loved watching the progression to his latest release taking place. Being from England, although I am aware of Saturday Night Live and what it entails, I am unaware of how Wayne's World came across on the small screen, however from previous experience of television to film leaps I don't think this one has faired badly at all. As im sure you have probably gathered by now, I am a fan of this film, however I am aware that it doesn't appeal to all tastes, it is outlandish and absolutely ridiculous at times, but for me it all adds to the charm. I don't think this film ever set out to be taken seriously, or indeed to be hailed a master piece by critics, but for the simple purpose of creating a film that made people laugh, and I feel through its sheer naivety it has become one of the most hilarious and age-less classic for me."

Two friends who own and run a public access TV show in the basement of Wayne's basement. They spend the time on Wayne's World talking about babes and interview people on the show. Outside of the show, they spend their time going to heavy metal clubs and partying in general.<br/><br/>One day, while recording their latest episode of the show, a sleazy advertiser by the name of Benjamin, played by Rob lowe, sees a potential for a show they could sell to Noah Vanderhoff, played by Brian Doyle-Murray, owner of Noah arcades. They try to persuade Wayne and Garth to do their show professionally, while at the same time take over the show.<br/><br/>Wayne also falls for bass guitarist and lead singer of crucial taunt Cassandra Wong, played by Tia Carrere. Benjamin also tries to take Cassandra away from Wayne, and Wayne has to prevent her from doing this.<br/><br/>Despite having a plot like that, the beauty is not from the story, but from the dialogue and character's interactions. First, Wayne and Garth. These two are irreplaceable, and work flawlessly together. They are by far my favorite on screen duo in any film. The other characters work extremely well together as well.<br/><br/>The dialogue, though, is where this film comes together beautifully. Examples of quotes include: 'Garth, marriage is punishment for shoplifting in some countries'.<br/><br/>The whole film also spoofs famous movies, shows and also advertisements and clichés. one scene involves Wayne and Garth eating food like domino's and wearing Reebok outfits.

","But who says a movie has to be that smart for it to be funny?  Actually, for a ""stupid but fun"" comedy, it was also fairly intelligent, considering the brilliant parodies and the clever yet stupid jokes.<br/><br/>I knew I missed out when I didn't see this movie back in '92, but seeing as how I was 8, I probably wouldn't have had as much fun.  Now that I'm approaching the ""party time"" of my life, I can appreciate the chemistry of Dana Carvey and Mike Myers.  They completely disappear into their respective characters and manage to carry the film well, as a pair of fairly stupid, yet extremely charming cable TV hosts.<br/><br/>The jokes are often unpredictable.  You just never know who's going to get a cameo, or what's going to be made fun of next.  There's a LITTLE gross-out humor in this, but I've seen more than my fair share of gross-out comedies, and Wayne's World doesn't come close to being sick.  It's just plain funny. Many movie conventions are poked fun of, including gratuitous sex scenes, painfully obvious product placements, and melodramatic Oscar-worthy scenes. Alice Cooper makes a very memorable cameo as himself, waxing intellectual with Wayne and Garth while still in full shock-rock gear.<br/><br/>Then there's the two stars themselves.  Wayne is certainly the more confident of the pair, but he's never overbearing.  Garth is adorable, as he is often extremely shy and keeps wanting to get together with a girl at the donut shop, but doesn't know how to approach her, leading to a hilarious Jimi Hendrix-inspired dream sequence.  The leads are endearing, though fortunatly, this film never tries to take itself seriously.  The ending sequenece is a perfect example, though I refuse to ruin the hilarity of Wayne's World's final scenes.<br/><br/>I like my fair share of movies where I can turn off my brain and enjoy, but I also hate movies that are stupid to the point of insulting me.  Wayne's World is never stupidly insulting.  It's just stupidly fun.  I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!"

","Wayne Campbell lives in his parents' basement from where he broadcasts a show on public access TV with his friend Garth Algar. It is low budget, unrehearsed and most importantly they have total control over the show. That is until TV producer Benjamin Oliver, who is looking for something new that is popular with the kids, offers them $10,000 for rights to the show. Wayne doesn't want to sell out but having signed a contract he is asked to do things he doesn't want to do; most notably give air time to the show's new sponsor. While this is going on Wayne gets together with Cassandra Wong, the lead singer of a local band. Soon Oliver is offering her a contract and Wayne is sure that he has ulterior motives.<br/><br/>I recall watching this in the '90s and thinking it was funny enough but a bit too silly so I was surprised to rewatch it and find myself rather enjoying it sometimes silly is just what is required. The plot is pretty basic and there are few real surprises. There are plenty of funny moments though and as the gags come thick and fast if one misses the mark there is a good chance the next will be better. Some of the gags are connected to the plot but plenty are completely random. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are good as Wayne and Garth; providing most of the laughs, often while directly addressing the camera. Tia Carrere is suitable sexy as love interest Cassandra and Rob Lowe is delightfully sleazy as Oliver. Overall I think this has aged pretty well if you want some good silly fun you could do a lot worse."

","Like Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler, Mike Myers has unfortunately became a forgotten star over the years, which I think is a pity for while he may not be the world's greatest actor, he has given us some memorable comedy gems over the course of his career such as 'So I Married An Axe Murderer', 'Austin Powers', 'Shrek' and, of course, 'Wayne's World', the greatest rock 'n' roll com of all time.<br/><br/>Wayne Campbell and his buddy Garth Algar are two of the geekiest yet somehow coolest guys in New York. They have their own public access TV show ( which is broadcast from the basement of Wayne's parents' house ). The show is so popular that corrupt producer Benjamin Oliver offers a large sum of money to buy the rights for the show, in the face of opposition from Garth.<br/><br/>I want to say more about the film but I really do not feel I should spoil it too much for those who have not yet discovered it, but suffice it to say that it is a comedy classic, wonderfully performed by both Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. Myers' script, written with Bonnie & Terry Turner, is full of many great lines and situations, such as ( sorry, massive spoilers ahead ) the 'Scooby Doo' spoof at the end or an advertisement featuring Garth painstakingly using a new hair styling device called the 'Suck Kut' ( it cuts as it sucks ). Also hilarious is the performance of Queen's 1975 chart hit 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ( my favourite Queen song ) by Wayne and co.<br/><br/>Also in the film are Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe, Lara Flynn Boyle, Michael DeLuise, Lee Tergesen, Dan Bell and Sean Gregory Sullivan. Making surprise cameo appearances are Meat Loaf and Alice Cooper.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, a lot of commemorative 'Wayne's World' merchandise came available as a result of the film's success, such as hats, T-shirts, mugs etc. Even a video game version was released for both the Sega and Nintendo consoles in 1993, the same year the film's sequel, 'Wayne's World 2' came out. The second film was not as good in my opinion.<br/><br/>I'm out of anything else to say on this movie that I haven't already said. The only other thing I can say about this classic is this, watch it! <br/><br/>Funniest moment - whilst loading their hungover friend Phil into his and Wayne's car, Garth tells him, whilst holding out a battered Dixie cup: ''If you're going to spew, spew into this!''"

","""Wayne Campbell"" (Mike Myers) and ""Garth Algar"" (Dana Carvey) are two friends who share the same interests in life and host their own public-access television show which typically involves great humor at the expense of a guest. Then one day an advertising agent by the name of ""Benjamin Oliver"" (Rob Lowe) convinces a local arcade owner named ""Noah Vanderhoff"" (Brian Doyle-Murray) to sponsor the show on local television. Although Wayne and Garth like the initial money offered by Benjamin they fail to fully grasp the details of the contract and soon realize that they have surrendered all artistic control to him. If that wasn't bad enough, Wayne also discovers that Benjamin is very interested in his new girlfriend ""Cassandra"" (Tia Carrere) as well--and he has no qualms about stealing her from him either. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had good portions of enjoyable humor throughout the entire course of the movie. Unfortunately, there were also some less successful pieces of humor here and there as well. Additionally, although this film was quite refreshing when it first came out, I don't believe it has aged very well and because of that I have adjusted the rating of this movie to reflect that fact. Slightly above average."

","Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) are best friends who host their own show called Wayne's World from the basement of Wayne's parents home. Wayne and Garth enjoy hosting Wayne's World and are pleased when they are approached by TV executive Benjamin Oliver (Rob Lowe) who promises the 2 men fortune and fame in exchange for a TV company buying the rights to Wayne's World. This new set-up initially works well, but it quickly causes friction in the friendship between Wayne and Garth as well as the relationship between Wayne and his new girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere) when Wayne suspects that Benjamin has ulterior motives when he tries to promote Cassandra's band whilst simultaneously promoting Wayne's World.<br/><br/>It's been quite some time since I've seen Wayne's World and my memories of it were much fonder than my opinion of it now. It's clear when watching Wayne's World that the plot and story never really feel that important; there is a story here but it always feels like its hovering in the background rather than being front and centre in the film. To me, this never really mattered that much because outside of the story it contained many things that made me laugh (the scene where the gang are singing Bohemian Rhapsody together is probably one of the most memorable scenes and did make me laugh). Wayne's World also has a wonderful sense of self-awareness about it (the whole parody on advertising and product placement was actually pretty clever and shows that the film is more than just a string of dumb-ass sketches). The chemistry between Myers and Carvey is also top-notch and whether they are bickering or mucking around together they are always a joy to behold. The film is also endlessly quotable and is probably responsible for popularising several things (the likes of 'We're not worthy' and 'Schwing' have been re-quoted multiple times since this film has been released).<br/><br/>Although there are quite a few positives to this film it does have some negatives to it; the humour is very hit and miss and there are also aspects of the film that don't really work too well - Wayne's barmy ex-girlfriend and Garth's obsession with some hot woman are aspects of the film that aren't funny and don't particularly serve any purpose in the story. It's fair to say that there are lots of things that happen in Wayne's World that don't serve much purpose, but when the pointless stuff is funny then it's fine, but if something's pointless and unfunny then that's when you've got yourself a problem.<br/><br/>Wayne's World won't be for everyone and I suspect that those in the younger demographic will probably enjoy it more than the older demographic, but for me its self-awareness, the fact it doesn't take itself seriously and it's silly tone made it a hard film for me not to like."

One has to believe that Mike Myers had a thing for her as she was to much of a focal point of both movies. She was attractive, but she could not sing or act worth a crap. Still, there are funny bits here and there like their speech on how they would never bow down to sponsors and the ending which had multiple parts to it. Also rather funny, a scene where they get pulled over by a cop looking for someone. Though for all the funny stuff that was in the movie there were also a lot of cringe worthy jokes that did not work at all, much like your typical SNL skit that has gone on to long. Saturday Night Live may have made some of the better comedic actors, but most of the films based on their skits suck, while this is an exception as it does not really suck, it is just a mild comedy that is just a longer skit that has flashes of being rather funny, but in the end rather forgettable."

I can't really remember anything from that viewing other than the suck-cut part. It wasn't until about three years ago when I finally watched the whole thing for the first time, and while it may not have been as entertaining as I had hoped, it was still fairly amusing. I watched the entire movie for the second time just last night, and I think it was pretty much the same this time.<br/><br/>Wayne Campbell is a headbanger who still lives with his parents in Aurora, Illinois and has a whole collection of name tags and hair nets, obviously from previous jobs he has failed to keep. However, he does host a popular public access TV show called ""Wayne's World"" from his basement with his best friend, Garth Algar. Their show has been seen by Ben Oliver, a TV executive, who knows how popular it is, and wants to have it on his network. So, Wayne and Garth soon find themselves doing ""Wayne's World"" professionally, now on a basement set in a TV station, and it looks like they'll be making a lot of money doing this. However, the two headbanger friends are headed for trouble! They don't realize how sleazy Oliver is at first, and conflict between Wayne and Garth soon arises. In addition to that, Wayne has trouble with his girlfriend, Cassandra (lead singer and bass player of a local band), who may end up with Oliver instead of him if he's not the one who gets her musical career off the ground! <br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a very silly and rather juvenile movie, but silly and juvenile certainly doesn't necessarily mean not funny. Personally, I can't remember exactly how much I laughed the first time, but the second time, I definitely got a good number of laughs, even though it stumbles a bit at times. Wayne and Garth (played by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) may have trouble staying consistently funny throughout the film's entire runtime (it's obviously harder in a movie than in brief sketches), but for the most part, they succeed, sometimes reasonably funny and sometimes VERY funny, saying some bizarre things. If lines like ""Turn it off man, turn it off! It's sucking my will to live! Oh, the humanity!"" amuse you, this could be your kind of movie. Certain minor characters sometimes add humour to the film as well, such as the freaky doughnut shop manager, Glen, played by Ed O'Neill. I also can't forget the beautiful Tia Carrere as Cassandra. With this role, she got to show both her acting and singing skills. Overall, this 1992 hit comedy's highlights are not exactly enough to make it a classic, but if you want silliness and rock music, you'll find plenty of that here."

He intends on destroying Wayne and Garth's reputation and careers by exposing them as frauds, and to make his life a misery even dates Wayne's crush:lead singer Cassandra in the process. Meanwhile, in addition to falling in love with Cassandra, Wayne agrees to promote her band's talent and help enhance her chances in furthering her career.<br/><br/>The humour is adolescent and at times childish and daft, but this is all in the name of fun with this movie. The cast ensemble are great and they all looked like they had fun making the film.<br/><br/>Unlike the Austin Powers movies, it relies heavily on pop cultural references and mickey takes on various TV shows and films. And although Mike Myers is a very funny comedian, it seems as if in film terms people associate him more with the Austin powers franchise, rather than with Wayne's World. Which is a shame because I prefer Wayne's World to Austin Powers; the humour wasn't as smutty and as it was utilised in a somewhat clever way- even if some of the scenes came across as childish or silly looking.<br/><br/>Highlights of the movie include the Scooby Doo ending- one of three endings that is-, the product endorsements of Pepsi- the taste of a new generation LMAO!!- and Adidas, and a memorable rendition of Queen's Boheminan Rhapsoday, with Wayne, Garth and company rocking along to the track.<br/><br/>Overall, Wayne's World is an entertaining- yet highly amusing farce, which should've got a much higher profile than Mike Myers' other hit,'Austin Powers', which went on to spawn three other sequels.<br/><br/>As Wayne and Garth would say: 'Excellent!'"

","I'm now 16 almost 17, and it's been a year since I bought the Wayne's World double DVD pack. Since that day, Wayne's World has become one of, if not my favourite movie (not just comedy) of all time. I've always heard on TV movie countdowns of the greatness of this movie as a comedy, and yet when I watched it, it was more significant to me than I could've ever imagined. Myers and Carvey play the role of 'alternate' music fans well and as I would consider my alternate to the norm myself (mostly with music) I can completely relate to their opinions (ie. Led Zeppelin being great even though they didn't write tunes everybody liked) and their view on selling out, HA!<br/><br/>This movie is most definitely an essential piece of comedy viewing for people from all walks of life. When watching this movie, you can't watch it in a high brow state of mind, as most of the movie is made up of stupid jokes yet it's clear that great minds worked on them <br/><br/>10/10 <br/><br/>Party On!"

I kept thinking that no movie could still be so funny. Then just yesterday i wanted to watch a comedy to give me laugh after a long week. And i saw wayne's world sitting on my shelf. So i put it in saying that i had nothing else and i didn't feel like renting. And i found out that some movies never get old and wayne's world may be one of them. I laughed hysterically at some of the same things that i laughed at many times. Proving that mike myers and dana carvey made a movie that will always be hilarious for our time. If you have never seen this then you don't know what your missing. This is dumb comedy at its best. It made fun of a lot of things. And its a really good comedy that i would recommend to people who liked such movies like austin powers, dumb and dumber and ace ventura and all movies with comedy like that."

I won't tell you any more as you really must watch this film hilarious film.<br/><br/>The plot is strong enough to keep you interested and the jokes come think and fast.

It is by far the greatest SNL skit turned movie, dwarfing even The Blues Brothers. And it is considerably better then the recent Austin Powers series. Mike Meyers plays the most excellent host of a cable access show. Dana Carvey is quirky nerd, uncomfortable in front of a camera, but dedicated to the show. Tia Carrere plays the total babe Cassandra, lead singer of Crucial Taunt, and the love of Wayne's life. Rounding out the cast is Rob Lowe, the shifty babe magnet with a perfect profile and no visible scars.<br/><br/>The cameos are notable as well, Alice Cooper being the most memorable. Chris Farley is not to be forgotten as the security guard that knows more then can be reasonably assumed. And Ed ""Al Bundy"" O'Neil as a creepy diner operator. This movie may very well be perfect."

They look at the light side of life and take it as it comes. Garth has that childlike innocence about him and Wayne is just funny. Also, it brings back memories of my college days when we would say ""NOT"", ""We're not worthy"", ""Extreme Close-up"" and ""EXCEELEEENNNTTT"".....a really good movie, one of the best even after 10 years!"

View this all the way through for the first time, and you'll laugh, and you'll cry, and you'll hurl (as the tagline suggests). The funny jokes and gags are too weird enough to make you learn the entire script. Other than trying to understand Cantonese, ""babe"" Tia Carrere performs some rock tunes down to her lungs for your ""excellent"" pleasure. After that, it quickly becomes stale, and soon you'll forget it until another ten years pass by when you want to relive those precious memories. To me, this has never been my kind of movie to take seriously because it's downright obnoxious. For the benefit of some who have not had the chance to see it during high school, better give it a swing...er, I mean SCHWING! It'll be great fun.

","Both characters were first seen on Saturday Night Live, and their film is a fantastic teen comedy. I didn't realise that this was the first big film for Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell (three years before Austin Powers), and along with Dana Carvey as Garth Algar they are just fantastic. Wayne is the heavy metal fanatic, and Garth is his eccentric best friend, and both host a public cable network TV show filmed in Wayne's basement, called Wayne's World. The show catches the attention of Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe) who wants it on his TV network, sponsored by billionaire and large arcade business owner Noah Vanderhoff (Brian Doyle-Murray). When they go Prime Time, Wayne and Garth get used to the big time, and Wayne falls in love with Chinese lead singer of a heavy metal band, Cassandra (True Lies' Tia Carrere). But Ben plans to ruin the show and steal Cassandra from Wayne if they do not get good ratings for their first episode, but they do not find it as fun as their original show. Also starring Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick as T-1000 (spoof) and Alice Cooper. The highlights of the film are the commercial imitations of products, e.g. Pepsi, Adidas and others, and the opening scene of the four friends singing Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian, and the film was number 15 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"

","On one hand, it's all been done before (see: Excellent Adventure, Bill and Ted's) but on the other hand, great writing by Mike Myers and hilarious skit acting by both Myers and Dana Carvey make this film really funny. It has its ups and downs, but in the end it's a tongue-in-cheek, often satirical laugh-fest. And it gets done without a need for overly juvenile humour (although it is there;)<br/><br/>What really bothers me is Tia Carrere's acting. What bothers me more is Tia Carrere's (?) singing (if it's her) And Rob Lowe's wooden acting doesn't help much either. If Myers and Carvey weren't so good, Carrere and Lowe would bring this film much deeper into comedy hell.<br/><br/>This film spawned classic scenes; the Bohemian Rhapsody scene, the hockey scene, the studio' show scene (great product placement;). But overall it lacks something that even humour can't pull past. It simply works better in skit-form, one thing that Bill and Ted's definitely surpasses Wayne and Garth in is that it flowed more smoothly from beginning to end without lapses. Still, there are enough laughs to keep this one out of the gutter, and most of the other SNL based movies can't claim that (most shouldn't even *exist*)<br/><br/>Look for great cameos by Meat Loaf, Alice Cooper, Donna Dixon, Ed Al Bundy' O'Neil, Blackhawks great Stan Mikita and Ione Skye, plus a hilarious and different role from starlet Lara Flynn Boyle.<br/><br/>Overall: well worth watching, and has so far stood the test of time.

The story isn't important, as its focus is on self-aware and sarcastic humor that parodies tropes from the 90s, which I adore. However this is where my problems with the movie surface. It has great jokes, but getting to them requires you to sit through at least 4 music scenes and a lot of pointless banter. There's payoff to a lot of the jokes, which they do hit, but the setup to most of these jokes is waiting through the mundane or misguided to the point, where I think that's a joke, but it doesn't feel like it. Aside from Wayne, Garth and Satcy, it's hard to recognize any of the other characters.<br/><br/>If you're into watching weird stuff, you might get a kick out of it.

","In Penelope Spheeris's film, Wayne's World, she composes one of the greatest comedic masterpieces in Hollywood history through her use of comical dialogues, ironic casting choices, and clever screen writing. Putting matters into perspective, I would need more than two hands to count how many times I've viewed this movie since I've started college; every time I watch it, I get a different outcome, which always trumps the last time. Oftentimes, the greatest comedies are also the most quotable. When two fans discuss Monty Python & the Holy Grail, for example, you may expect to hear one of them laugh and quote: ""We are the Knights who say, 'NIIII!'"" or ""You must bring us a shrubbery!"" Perhaps the most intriguing and entertaining aspects of the movie are the hilarious dialogues exchanged between the dynamic duo Wayne and Garth. Hysterical comedic dialogues fill Wayne's World, making it enjoyable to watch over and over again. IMDb.com, user ""MisterWhiplash"" quotes: ""Many sight gags, many good lines, and probably all quotable, this movie (like Myers' Austin Powers) belongs in a place in comedy film history. A++."" In a scene where Wayne and Garth discuss Cassandra's enticing beauty, Wayne exclaims: ""She's a fox! In French, she would be called 'la renarde' and she would be hunted with only her cunning to protect her"". ""She's a babe!"" – Garth replies. ""She's a Robo-babe. In Latin she would be called Babia Majora!"" ""If she was a president, she would be called 'Babe-raham Lincoln'!"" (""Wayne's World""). Although the dialogue's humor is silly and childish, there is no doubt that the jokes made in this dialogue are indeed original, clever and intelligently crafted. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Spheeris devises this hilarious film through the use of ironic casting. When Wayne's World was first created, it was intended to be a skit on a late night television show called ""Saturday Night Live""; well it was, and it was so successful that the writers took a chance by making it into a movie, which was also successful. One of the reasons for its success was because of the clever casting. Garth Algar, played by Dana Carvey, is supposed to be Wayne Campbell's best friend and drummer for their show. What took a lot of fans a while to realize was that Dana Carvey actually shreds on the drums in real life too. In one scene, Wayne and Garth head over to the local music shop to check out instruments; while Wayne is checking out a Fender Stratocaster, Garth heads over to the percussion section of the store and begins playing on a drum set (""Wayne's World""). When he begins playing, the scene comically changes; the lights dim, a spotlight comes down over Garth, and the generic ""rock and roll concert"" fog begins to accumulate around the stage (""Wayne's World""). The drum solo was absolutely amazing; too good to be true even. Many viewers believed that it was a simple comedic act and that the solo was a pre-recorded by a professional drummer, but it wasn't. Dana Carvey actually plays drums really well and has been playing for many years on a proficient level; who would've expected that?<br/><br/>One of the greatest aspects of Wayne's World would certainly be Spheeris's clever screen writing abilities. Many anticipating viewers were pleasantly surprised at the clever scenes included in the movie; many of the fans were former viewers of the SNL's version of Wayne's World and they expected something a little more ridiculous and a little less brilliant. Don't get me wrong, this movie has plenty of quirks and ridiculousness, but the way Spheeris delivers the humor is incredibly witty. In the scene where sleazy producer Benjamin attempts to coax Wayne and Garth to sign with a potential sponsor, Wayne resists to bow to any sponsor. ""Contract or no, I will not bow to any sponsor"", Wayne declares while blatantly opening up a box of Pizza Hut pizza and smiling directly at the camera before taking a bite. ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but that's just the nature of the beast"", Benjamin replies. ""Maybe I'm wrong on this one, but for me the beast doesn't include selling out"", Wayne refutes while opening up a bag of Dorito's and eating them directly in front of the camera (""Wayne's World""). The screenplay in this scene succeeds in poking fun and satirizing our pop culture. ""The jokes hit almost every time throughout this film, due to its genus writing, ripping on the Hollywood stereotypes and product placement laws"" (Proulx).<br/><br/>Although this movie may not be as well-developed as other comedy movies, I believe that this film does a stellar job at telling a hilarious story in about an hour and a half. The comedy is a little childish at times; but to be fair, the movie appeals to a more teenage crowd. Despite the ridiculousness of Wayne's World, it is still a brilliant masterpiece that is meant for viewing multiple times for maximum satisfaction. So what are you waiting for? Party on!"

","The second in list of movies were based on ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, and not one of their best, since I don't think that there was a movie that outclassed their first movie (The Blues Brothers - 1980) yet.<br/><br/>Of course forget about any plot, drama, or even action. It's a chain of separate jokes, not real sketches, created by (Mike Myers) in not one of his finest days, noticing that it was his first as a screenwriter, so as a lead actor. The best ""joke"" was the sequence of ""we don't make commercials, or do anything for money!"". But unfortunately the rest is too sluggish, so the movie's pace is slow. And don't wait for witty parody, or real guest stars. For instance, (Robert Patrick) reprised his role as the evil Terminator swiftly and tastelessly!<br/><br/>Overall, the whole thing looked really average or lower, comparing to (Myers)'s next movies or not. The performance is as weak as you can get. (Ed O'Neill) is unbearable as usual with so unfunny lines. (Rob Lowe) delivers feebly and frigidly, not trying to be even slightly droll. The survivors could be (Myers) with few of his own spontaneous moments (Camera 1, Camera 2!), and (Tia Carrere)'s performance.<br/><br/>There is restful feel and innocent spirit all over it (the tripartite endings a la' Scooby-Doo style). At least it didn't resort to be the easy filthy comedy, with tons of dirty sexual material, or bad taste stuff, the way (Myers) himself would do badly 10 years later in (Austin Powers in Goldmember). It's not bad, it's short fun, lovably childish but languid. Anyhow, (Mike Myers) had to have a point to start from anyway. It's so clear that he wasn't aware of the movies' capacities well at the time.<br/><br/>Finally, how this one succeeded superbly, grossing over 100 million dollar (!) to an extent that made a sequel--is such beyond me. It proved that (Myers) had certain something that the people loved, and it gives me hope that well meaning work with simple efforts can work big time.. Sometimes."

","Directed by Penelope Spheeris because she works before in films about rock music, ""Wayne's World"" is that, a total funny and very original entertainment with rock music as a style for two memorable characters. The film is about two very good friends: Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey); they host a local cable-access show called Wayne's World made in Wayne's basement and they are very populars with local people. When Benjamin Caine (Rob Lowe), a TV executive, buy the show Wayne and Garth must deal with the differences between their little show where they can do everything and their new big show where they are exploited.<br/><br/>The script of this film was based upon the characters created by Mike Myers for the show Saturday Night Live and for me the characters of Wayne and Garth are nothing but memorable just like all the original scenes of the film like the sponsor's commercials, the scenes with the camera following the characters, the scene with Jimi Hendrix's song ""Foxy Lady"" and the different endings including a great spoof of Scooby-Doo.<br/><br/>The cast: is really funny with Mike Myers in one of his first films and still one of his most memorable works. Dana Carvey is just the perfect partner of Myers and is really funny too. The cast also include the lovely Tia Carrere as Cassandra, her most known role and the cameo of Alice Cooper as himself, according to the film, a very boring rock star.<br/><br/>And as i said the music of the film is terrific, including songs of great bands like Queen (Bohemian Rhapsody), The Jimi Hendrix Experience (Fire and Foxy Lady), Soundgarden (Loud Love), Red Hot Chili Peppers (Sikamikanico), Temple of the Dog (All Night Thing) and some other great songs.<br/><br/>Conclusion: this is an excellent comedy with two great characters and with a very original style, always with rock music in the heart. 9 out of 10<br/><br/>DVD: i recently get this DVD in a very low price and is excellent too.

","It's not at all hard to see why this early nineties comedy quickly became a huge cult hit with teenagers across the globe.

Meanwhile Wayne has fallen for the lead singer of a local heavy metal band (she's a Robo-babe). and Garth fantasises of one day getting up the nerve to talk to his dream woman, or perhaps even sing to her! Bursts of absolute hilarity (look for Wayne's ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"") and segments of sheer stupidity leaves ""Wayne's World"" inconsistent, but there's enough on going nutty humour to keep the viewer amused. Clever, tongue-in-cheek performances from the two leads and the supporting cast really help set the mood, while the whole movie's 'no set guidelines' tack allows director Penelope Spheeris to do anything she pleases, and she does just that.<br/><br/>""Laverne and Shirley"" get the royal treatment, as do many other telly and picture shows, and even Alice Cooper manages to send himself up.

","This might be one of the most quotable movies of all time. Every scene has a gem to carry away from the film and laugh about later. Mike Myers and Dana Carvy are a dynamic duo of hilariousness. The mirth-mobile is such a great car. Anyone who didn't get a licorice dispenser put into their car after that is pretty much crazy! One of my favorite scenes, though it is a little hard since they are all so amazing, is when they are looking at the set of Wayne's World and Garth says a hi coo. Also the foxy lady scene is one of my fav's. I think this is the most successful Saturday night live movie of all time. The alternate endings are amazing. The whole plot of the story works well and all the acting is great each actor really does their role well. I can't say enough great things about this movie! Party on and watch it!!!"

","""Wayne's World,"" based on the Saturday Night Live skit of the same name, is the quintessential hilarious party movie. Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), in addition to narrating the movie, host their own cable access television show that they film in their basement. The plot, which never gets in the way of the multitude of jokes, thickens when a sleazy TV programming director named Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe) offers Wayne and Garth a huge contract for Wayne's World to be taped on big-network TV. Problem is, Wayne and Garth are not aware until much later of various stipulations in this contract that ultimately hamper their show. Besides, the slick Benjamin becomes Wayne's rival for the affections of Cassandra (Tia Carrere), the electric bassist/lead singer for a rock band known as Crucial Taunt. (If you haven't yet seen this movie, please DO NOT read any further.)<br/><br/>Highlights: The original ending of this movie does not appeal to Wayne or Garth, so they provide their own ""Scooby Doo"" ending. On the opening Wayne's World show, Garth becomes a victim of the Suck Cut. Wayne, Garth, and their few cronies go cruising in their ""mirthmobile"" to the accompaniment of Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody""; later, they pull up next to a Rolls Royce and ask for some Grey Poupon. Garth takes a fantastic drum solo at a music store. Wayne's ex-girlfriend Stacy (Lara Flynn Boyle) rides past Wayne and Garth on her bicycle during their game of street hockey, but she doesn't pay attention to where she's going and rams into a parked car. When they arrive in Milwaukee, Wayne and Garth pose as Laverne and Shirley. As Benjamin discusses with Wayne and Garth the idea of giving their sponsor, video arcade owner Noah Vanderhoff (Brian Doyle-Murray), a weekly spot on their show, Wayne and Garth make abrupt segues into commercial advertising. When Wayne and Garth visit Alice Cooper backstage following his concert, Cooper unexpectedly gives them a history lesson. When Garth sees his ""dream woman"" (Donna Dixon) at the donut shop, Tchaikovsky's famous ""Romeo and Juliet"" Overture can be heard, after which the camera zooms in on Garth and bangs him on the head! As Wayne watches Cassandra perform with Crucial Taunt, he is smitten by her as ""Dream Weaver"" accompanies his bliss. Wayne humiliates Vanderhoff by writing some hilarious statements on the back of some index cards and showing them to the television audience. And finally, Wayne and Garth poke fun at the state of Delaware, where I am originally from.<br/><br/>""Wayne's World"" was released in 1992, the year I graduated from high school. I didn't see the film when it was first released to the theaters, but I did obtain a copy of it on videotape that summer. At the end of the film, Garth declares, ""I just hope you didn't think it sucked,"" and I certainly didn't. ""Wayne's World"" provides many great laughs throughout, and it is just as funny today as it was back in 1992."

Whether that is because the movie's ten years older or because I am I'm not sure (but it's not like I suddenly became mature or anything). I think that many of the gags have aged badly so, whilst there are still highlights (the James Bond style training camp gag is genius, and I always like the Oscar clip) there are too many bits which just don't work anymore (schwing! etc). However, you still have the Scooby Doo ending, Lara Flynn Boyle's scary mentalist and the scene with the cue cards, which make the whole endeavour worthwhile. And, of course, Alice Cooper."

","Based on the outrageously popular SNL skit, 'Waynes World', comes the movie of the same name. Wildely credited as the best SNL movie yet, it has remained popular since it release, where it grossed $121 million, making it the eighth highest grossing movie of 1992, even though it bears striking resemblances to an earlier 'slacker' film (Bill and Teds's excellent adventure). Waynes World is an excellent (if not silly) comedy focusing on the wacky life of Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers), a metal head slacker who is still trying to keep cool while living in his parents house. He hosts a cable access T.V show, 'Waynes World', with his best friend Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), who also lives with his parents (which they both admit is bogus and sad). They frequent their local donut shop which is managed by a slightly psychopathic man (Ed O'Neil) who gives out wacky advice and shares deep insights into his messed up psyche. Trust me it is funny. <br/><br/>They also visit 'Gas Works', a local place where heavy metal bands play ('and it's got a pool table too!' Garth ads). Here Wayne meets and falls in love with Cassandra (Tia Carrere), a Honhongese singer/bass player whom he says can 'really wail'. Wayne has a 'schwing!' moment, a move he and Garth share where he moves his pelvis in recognition of a hot girl,accompanied with a comment on how good she is (e.g. 'Tent Pole!', 'She's magically babelicious', 'If she were a president she'd be Baberaham Lincoln'). They end up going out and everything is great except when her sleazy manager (Rob Lowe) seems to be getting in with her and Wayne gets suspicious, which ends up ruining their relationship. Waynes life is going down the plug hole when his show gets taken over with cheesy advertisements, and then he has a falling out with Garth ans has to put up with a psychopathic ex who still believes they're together. Everything is going bad for Wayne until he realizes how to get back with Cassandra, makes friends with Garth, and enlists all his friends to help get things back to how they were, and nab Cassandra a recording contract with 'Mr Big'. <br/><br/>As well as having THREE alternative endings ('let's try the scuba doo ending!')Waynes Wolrd brought some sayings into popular use, like 'Esqueeze me... baking powder', 'Not!, 'Party on!' and 'Excellent!'. It also managed to get the Queen song Bohemian Rhapsody into #2 spot on the billboard charts nearly 20 years after it came out. All in all, it is an entertaining and funny film that widely contributed to popular culture and has amused audiences for 13 years. It remains my favorite Mike Myers film, and by far the best SNL movie."

It's got that ""dumb teen"" attitude, but it doesn't get annoying unlike more recent teen movies. Mike Myers' and Dana Carvey's characters get you in the mood, it's a fun movie to watch. The soundtrack is also EXCELLENT, an Tia really nails it as a rocker! I also like that throughout the movie, Wayne Campbell turns to the camera to comment on things. The movie has got no real moral to it, but I'd like to think that it tells us that if you want something so bad, there's a way to get to it. Definitely a 10 for me, and I've never met anyone that disliked Wayne's World."

","As Mike Myers is now best known as Austin Powers, it's easy to forget that he started out as Aurora, Illinois, goof-ball Wayne Campbell. ""Wayne's World"" is just as funny today as it was back in 1992.

How he comes up with some of those things I'll never know. Maybe Cassandra (Tia Carrere) and Benjamin (Rob Lowe) weren't totally necessary, but even they had their moments. But the best scene is definitely when they're filming and Wayne is reading the questions off of the cards; it's quite possible that you'll die laughing when that scene comes up.<br/><br/>But the point is, this flick is a modern comedy classic.

Needless to say, in the following weeks and months, much of our conversation involved the words ""Excellent"", an untrue statement, followed by the word ""not"", and such.<br/><br/>It's because of Waynes World that I, along with the majority of the earth's population Moshe's when the guitar bit at the end of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" comes on. There is so much fresh stuff in this movie, that still seems fresh today. The simple concept of saying ""way"" instead of ""yes way"" is something so simple and obvious, but so eluding, that its funny because its interesting. The notion of the girl buying Wayne a ""gunrack"" leaves the audience almost as perplexed as Wayne. And the icing on the cake for me has to be the scene where Garth is left on his own to present the show and all he can say is ""Im having a good time...not"". The hilarity of that one moment is simply off the scale.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Wayne's world was and still is way ahead of its time and remains timeless and for a lot of people in my generation it has a special place in their heart."

","Wayne and Gath (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey respectively) make the jump from Saturerday Night Live recurring skit to do my third favorite SNL-based film (the two ahead of it are ""Office Space"" and ""the Blues Brothers). In this hilarious film, Wayne and Garth are doing their lowly public access show, when they're discovered by Ben Kane (Rob Lowe of ""the Outsiders"" and ""St. Elmos Fire), who proceeds to get them to sign a contract to take there small show and produce a national version of it. Wayne uses the deal to get his new love interest, Cassandra Wong (Tia Carrere, who now seemed to fall into oblivion. This is a warning to all aspiring actresses to NEVER say no to nude scenes or fall by the wayside) and her band to play on his show. But Ben isn't as benevolent as he first seems to be. With non-stop humor, as well as great memorable cameos by Ed O'Neill, Meatloaf, Chris Farley, and the amazingly great Alice Cooper, what's NOT to love?? Plus ANY time Brian Doyle-Murray gets to be in a film is greatness. Oh and be sure to stay through the credits.<br/><br/>My Grade: A <br/><br/>DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Penelope Spheeris; 23 minutes,15 seconds of cast and crew interviews; Clips from ""the Brady Bunch"", ""Solid Gold Workout"" & 1979's ""Sundown"";and Theatrical Trailer<br/><br/>DVD Gripes: Led Zeppelin suck ass for screwing up a part of this classic movie, they can shove ""Stairway to Heaven"" up you know what.

","This comedy is definitely hilarious. I'll admit, it's a bit unconventional, but I think that's what makes it such a successful comedy. It remains in pure comical status from beginning to end. This is apparent in the choice of having three endings at the close of the movie. It seems that in doing this, the movie was almost reassuring me that I don't have to actually FEEL for any of the characters. I can just finish the movie thinking, ""Wow, this was funny,"" and nothing more. I actually liked knowing that for once it would be acceptable for me to just laugh at a movie without taking it seriously as so many people often do. I don't think comedies are always meant to make perfect sense, and laughter is always more important than the idea of everything fitting together in the end.<br/><br/>I also love how this movie is made so that the audience gets to see what is going on from the beginning and we are allowed to know that Wayne and Garth are obviously being manipulated by their producer, but they don't completely realize it themselves.<br/><br/>Also this movie shows us that two nerdy grunge guys can in fact get chicks and I guess that's a good thing, right? LOL!"

","This has to be the best Saturday Night Live sketch turned movie ever, unless you count Waynes World 2. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey have a great on screen chemistry together and they both bring life to their wacky characters. Watch for cameos by great actors including Ed O'Neil, Chris Farley, and on. This film doesn't really have a plot, it's more like a longer version of the original sketch with a pompous t.v. producer wanting the two dudes to put their show on cable. Wayne has fallen over heels for a band girl while he is being annoyed by a girl he broke up with long ago and Garth is in love with a drum set, stair way to heaven! No matter how much you try not to laugh, you can't stop yourself from at least giggling from this film. The whole idea of Wayne and Garth talking to the camera, genius! The Bohemain Rhapsody sequence, the best scene in the whole movie with the best band in the whole world is great while you can't help yourself but jam to the song as well as the actors, the scene where Garth talks to the audience about an episode of the Twilight Zone... cool huh? This movie has reached great heights about sketch comedies. This blasts Blue Brothers out of the water, so do yourself a favor and check out this totally awesome video!

"malkane316","9","0","2","18 February 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","One of my all-time favourite comedy's, and one of those films that, when i was younger, i would continually watch. Funny and charming, i'd rather have one of these than a million American Pie clones. Being a rock and Beavis and Butthead fan from an early age, this seemed like essential viewing. Yeah, it may be stupid, and give the idea that rock music and fans lack intelligence, but it is a comedy and would hardly be funny if Wayne and Garth were geniuses. Wayne has a TV show on cable where he and his best friend Garth mess about, play guitar, take about music and women etc. Wayne has recently split from his odd girlfriend who keeps stalking him, and their lives seem to be going nowhere. A local TV station decides to let their show air professionally, and they agree. Meanwhile, Wayne has fallen for a singer called Cassandra. The TV guys try to change the show, and when Wayne rebels, he is fired. Garth falls out with him, and sleaze guy Benjamin moves in on Cassandra, whose band are gaining recognition. Wayne must try to win pack his friend and girlfriend, while trying to secure his show.<br/><br/>There are many movie in-jokes here, many music references and sight gags, most of which i find funny, but many others will not. The dialogue has since become cheesy, but that was always the desired effect, and the two lead performances are very good. Garth will have you laughing just by looking at him, while Myers is clearly a smart comedian. The rest of the cast are good, Lowe moving away from his Brat pack days, and Carrera gives a better performance than many would expect. The smaller characters provide many laughs, ('why do they come to me to die?') and we will be rooting for Wayne as the film approaches its conclusions. Better than any of the Austin Powers films, though less successful, Wayne's World is simply a funny, light-hearted film which tries to give you the belief that you can overcome any obstacle and still get the girl.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"ajb073","Null","0","2","17 January 2005"," Wayne's World: A Classic to America's Youth
","WAYNE'S WORLD has evolved to classic status among the youth of America. Wayne (MIKE MYERS) and Garth (DANA CARVEY) are the heroes that carry this film to greatness. WAYNE'S WORLD is a film that will always be remembered. If one was to make a time capsule in the early 1990s, WAYNE's WORLD would most definitely be included. The style, music, and expressions of WAYNE'S WORLD represent the youth of the early 90s, that are still looked up to, by the youth of today.<br/><br/>WAYNE'S WORLD is the story of two men, Wayne and Garth, who appear to be in their twenties, and their public access TV show, entitled Wayne's World. Their show includes heavy metal, sexy girls, crude humor, and language and phrases such as, ""party on"" and ""rock out,"" characteristic of the early 90s youth. Although the typical teenager of the early 90s may not have modeled his/her behavior directly from the characters of WAYNE'S WORLD, WAYNE'S WORLD has significantly influenced many teenagers' attitudes, expressions, and perception of what it means to be ""cool."" <br/><br/>WAYNE'S WORLD is unique on several fronts. For one, the director, PENELOPE SPHEERIS and writer, MIKE MEYERS use many innovative techniques to express the plot and tell the story. Wayne and Garth walk of screen or under tables on several occasions to whisper to the camera and the viewer, what they are thinking or something that they wish to expose to the viewer but not other characters. This filming technique enhances the viewers connection and appreciation for the characters. It allows for viewers to become more involved in the film and its characters and enter ""Wayne's World"" for the 95 minutes of this film.<br/><br/>WAYNE'S WORLD, despite what rating it gets on IMDb or from other critics, will always remain a classic among teenagers. Wayne and Garth are the admiral heroes who refused to sell out and be induced by the pressures of the real business and marketing world. Instead they created Wayne's World, where teenagers, partying and heavy metal reign supreme. WAYNE'S WORLD will be remembered as the story of two losers who succeed, and make the big time, without selling out their ideas, and original inspiration. As every genre and generation has its classics to relate other films to, WAYNE'S WORLD is a classic among the youth of America."

I live on the south side of Chicago and can tell you that it is very well portrayed in the film. Also after you see this movie you will never listen to Bohemian Rhapsody the same way again. The movie is basically about these two guys who have a cable access TV show and they are trying to get it on a real network. The movie is just hilarious and that is it.

It was funny the very first time I heard it (back when it was brand new), and proceeded to be funny the next few GAZILLION times I've had it piped into my ears from various situations around me, but I simply don't laugh at it any more--it annoys me. Plus, ""Saturday Night Live"" is a show that, in my opinion, should be called ""The Show-Nobody-Thinks-Is-Funny Show"" (as ""TV Guide"" suggested back when this movie was released).<br/><br/>First of all, the skit always struck me as a lame ""Bill and Ted"" ripp-off. And I didn't see this movie until a friend invited me over in 1993 and showed it to me. Oh well, at least I didn't have to pay to see it if nothing else.<br/><br/>And maaaaaan, was this movie ever a snooze. It was easily the most unfunny movie I have seen in years to the point of nearly (and I mean literally) putting me to sleep.<br/><br/>Snore.<br/><br/>Out of the whole bit, there was only one quick routine that genuinely made me laugh: a scene which involved a girl suddenly stepping on to the screen while announcing in an exaggerated tone, ""Hi, Wayne! I'm pregnant! That's why I've been so moody!""<br/><br/>Other than that... well, hey, what can I say? The ""Bill and Ted"" movies, both of which I avoided in the theatres out of fear of them being this bad but both loved by me when I later saw them on home video, knock this one black and blue.

Michael Myers, not the guy from Halloween, has written many comical hits, and if he leaves acting will probably keep on writing.  This movie is made from a recurring SNL skit. The skit can be funny, but like the hosers of The Great White North Fame, it has trouble keeping a few minutes comedy skit into a full length comedy. Making something funny is the hardest form of entertainment, and this movie has more hits than misses in its antics.

And I always knew Mike Myers would become successful, because his humor is new and not cliche. And Dana Carvey is funny as well. One of those movies you can watch again and again and they will never become boring.   9/10"
"courty61","10","0","1","3 February 2002"," LIVE IN THE NOW!
","This film is an absolute classic! I can't believe that its got a small average, it should be at least 7.6 or in my view 10.0!!! The lines are absolutly 'excellent' or 'sang!'. Like a classic one ""asphinctersayswhat"" or ""If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor, he'd be pralines and dick."".<br/><br/>Myers and Carvey are brilliant and very funny, from the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" scene to the guitar seen ""it will be mine, oh yes, it will be mine"" with Garth answering ""you'll never afford it! LIVE IN THE NOW!"".<br/><br/>I could quote all day here but there is a quotes page ""exsqueeze me? a baking powder?"" yes there is! This site is cool by the way!<br/><br/>Anway back to the film, Tia Carrere is brilliant and SeXy ""swinggg"", plus Rob Lowe is great as the high flyer Benjamin. The cameos from Alice Cooper, Chris Farley (R.I.P), Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick (in a very very funny T2 skit)and of course the very weird but funny Ed O'Neil ""I'd never done a crazy thing in my life before that night. Why is it that if a man kills another man in battle it's called heroic, yet if he kills a man in the heat of passion it's called murder.""! Classic!<br/><br/>But of course the MAJOR stars are Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and you can see why this film was a hit and why the sequel is a good film for a sequel. I would love to see a Wayne's World 3 but Ive been wanting that for nearly 9 years now! i dont think it will happen. Many people say Myers is funnier in Austin Powers ""Way"" but hes not, this is fresh and great with great wit and great lines, with a great story which Austin 2 did lack.<br/><br/>Finally i would like to end with my favorite Wayne quotes ""cha! and monkey's will fly out of my butt"", and after receiving his gun-rack from his 'girlfriend' Stacy ""I don't even own *a* gun, let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack. What am I gonna do with a gun rack?... (which is followed by)... ""We broke up! Are you mental?"" Absolute genius comedy.<br/><br/>So as you guessed I LOVE this film -way and I give it a 10/10!!!"

","Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are the two very funny stars of this good film. Both of them have fun making this movie and and they will bring you in giggles but the advice I'm giving you is don't watch it too many times or the jokes will run out on you.<br/><br/>A fair movie that makes it into my classic collection but it really should be watched once every two years. 4 out of 5."

","Great Movie! Mike Myers is funny in every thing he does. If you like SNL you'll love this.  Great cast, directed well, the scenes  between Wayne and the camera are some of the best. The 3 endings are good too. Party on Wayne & Garth! By the way the brownies are good (see the credits)!"

","I am a major ROB LOWE fan!! I loved him in The Outsiders and I LOVED him in Wayne's World!! But I also loved the movie. It was really hilarious...Garth is sooo cute,..(not cute, but like, pathetic enough to look cute) he looks so helpless! The end part with all the retakes n stuff was like..confusing but hey! I got to see more of Rob Lowe! Rob Lowe is like an evil dude in this movie, and so that's why I liked him better in The Outsiders. I gave this movie a 10 cuz it always cheers me up on rainy days...ROCK ON!!"
"bazwilkinson_2000","8","0","1","25 March 2001"," Waynes World! Party Time! Excellent!
","Ok, when I bought this for my little brother for xmas 2000, I said I would watch it with him, xpecting it to be a crap comedy. I've watched it three times since then! I guess what I'm trying to say is that this movie is really good. From the first minute to the last, you will be laughing along and feeling like you know the characters well. Memorable scenes will stay in your head such as Wayne and Garth on top of a car at the end of a runway watching planes fly feet above their heads, daring each other to 'KEEP LOOKING UP!' Garths brilliant strut to the song 'Foxy' will have you laughing, along with Wayne's learning of 'Cantonesse', in which they are subtitled, and sometimes have to wait for a few minutes before the words catch up with what they are saying. Overall, this is one of the best comedy films I've seen! 9/10  or  4/5"
"DMP-2","7","0","1","2 December 2000"," Wayne & Garth's Excellent Adventure
","Wayne & Garth's Excellent Adventure could have worked as the title for this movie. It plays of the same vibe as Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. 2 Cool guys, that caught up in an Excellent Adventure. Except instead of Bill & Ted's Phone Booth they have the Murfmobile.     This film has to be the best Saturday Night Live based film, just barely beating Blues Brothers (1980), and beating A Night At The Roxbury (1998) by a long shot. But its definitely evident that takes Buddy Picture to make a SNL based work and this film embellishes it so well.     If your smart enough person to believe me in this film is so good, you gotta check out Wayne's World 2."
"tfrizzell","Null","0","4","5 August 2000"," The Best Film Based on ""Saturday Night Live"" Material (Not Saying Much)
","""Wayne's World"" is not a very good film, but when compared to other ""Saturday Night Live""-based ventures it looks like a masterpiece.  The moronic Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) have the opportunity to make a lot of money with their public-access television show and jump at the opportunity, in spite of numerous consequences.  Not a total mess, but far from being a cinematic classic.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","Wayne's World ! Wayne's World ! Party time ! Excellent !<br/><br/>This very funny movie that makes us laugh all the time is about party (betwen Wayne and Garth) and love (between Wayne and Casandra) ! I think the first is better than the second . If you want to laugh see Wayne's World !"

","I remember watching this movie when I was eleven, and I still love it today. Myers and Carvey are very witty and funny.  There's great cameos by Meatloaf, Chris Farley, ""Al Bundy"", and Alice Cooper.  A movie for 90's teenagers."

"sit down and smile","Null","0","1","17 February 2000"," I'm not much of a partier, but if YOU are, here's your film.
","Metropolitan Chicago is turned into a wild party scene in the king of the early 90's slacker films, and one of the pioneers of the teen movie onslaught.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Live duo Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are untouchable in their roles as wild partiers, with some music and entertainment in the mix.<br/><br/>Look for great cameos by MeatLoaf, Ed O' Neill, and Tia Carrere's best role in her career.  Unfortunately, you'll have to bear Rob Lowe as his old, tired, patented snobby self, a mix of his we are tired of seeing.  What lasts longest in this movie are the memorable quotes and scenes that have always endured......those quotes being along the lines of ""schhwing!!"" ""Party time, excellent, and ""a sphincktersayswhat..."" If you've outgrown these quotes, we all have certainly not outgrown the famous car maching scene with ""Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.""<br/><br/>In fact, on that note, this movie was released right after the lead singer of Queen's untimely death from AIDS (Freddie Mercury).  Queens success in America was increased immeasurably, and it wasn't because of Mercury's death....it was because of the success of the movie!<br/><br/>In all, this memorable comedy is good for a fun Friday night, but more for friends than for family.  Right on.<br/><br/>My rating out of 10:   8.5"
"jellyneckr","Null","0","3","16 June 2004"," PARTY TIME! EXCELLENT!
","Although not nearly as funny now as it was when it was first released in 1992, WAYNE'S WORLD is a definite classic and is one of the funniest movies of the 1990's. The comedic performances by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are brilliant. Dana Carvery is one of the wittiest stand-up comedians ever, and that is shown in his ad-lib in the scene when they are on top of the car watching the airplane overhead, which is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. WAYNE'S WORLD is a party-hard movie filled with memorable lines. It may not be the best movie based on a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch (that would be THE LADIES MAN), but it still is one of the better comedies to come out in the past fifteen years. ***"

","Love this film.  Instant classic.  Great acting, great soundtrack, great cast, no film like this one!  #3 favourite movie of all time.  I particularly liked Garth, because he reminds me of myself at times (i.e. when he was trying to talk to the beautiful blonde).  Excellent movie, party on!"
"nutz4n64","10","0","2","20 December 1999"," Myers and Carvey are gnarly dude
","The first time I saw this one was when I got it as a gift from my parents when it was on sale at McDonalds.  I was relatively young and wanted it because my friends said to get it.  So basically, I hated it on the first viewing and hadn't watched it for a long time.  Recently, I saw the best of Mike Myers on SNL (who I now knew from Austin Powers).  There were clips of Wayne's World, which marks the very first time I've seen that skit on SNL. Also, about a month ago, I saw the sequel on USA.  OK, I can understand it now, so I decided to dig the original out of the box in my closet and watch it again.  It is now what I consider to be one of the best comedies ever. Myers and Carvey are perfect, the one-liners are awesome, and the Scooby-Doo ending is classic.  Like Austin Powers, see this movie and party on."
"kim99","10","0","1","2 January 1999"," THE BEST MOVIE EVER!
","Wayne's World is my favorite movie! It came out when i was in 5th grade, and i must have seen it 12 times in the theatre. 7 years later it is STILL my favorite movie, along with Austin Powers (also staring Mike Meyers) and Cant Hardly wait. I still watch it AT LEAST once a week. i am currently making a webpage about Wayne's World. This movie is awesome! Hahaha..if you think that this movie sucked, haha, you'd better take it up with me, cause i will argue with you until i am blue in the face."

","""Wayne's World"" is just one awesome movie, especially when you see it with your friends. This has to be one of Mike Myers best movies ever it is absolutely hilarious and filled with great scenes like when they are listening to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhaspody"" in the ""Mirth Mobile"" or even the Scooby-Doo Ending my most favorite scene though is the one with Brian Doyle Murray(Bill's brother)as the Arcade mogul on the re-newed ""Wayne's World"" you'll know what I mean when you see the movie. Everything about this movie shines and the comic timing is just perfect."

","Wayne's World.  Party time.  Excellent.<br/><br/>These words inspired a generation of suburban metal heads, simply because they could relate.<br/><br/>I remember seeing the advertisements for Wayne's World as a young middle school tyke and getting very excited about it; I had yet to see the SNL skit on which the movie was based until I knew about the existance of the movie, but I made it my duty to see it soon after.  Once I saw my first skit, I was addicted.  I saw the MTV special, and then, the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, the movie.<br/><br/>Full of hilarious one-liners like ""Hey, Mr. Donut-head man, who's trying to kill you?"" And, ""We fear change."", this movie is classic from beginning to end.  I saw it for the first time in years a year ago, and I feared that it couldn't possibly be as good as I remembered it; it was so juvenile, so purile.  But when I saw it again, it was even better.  I now try to watch it at least once every few months so I can remember how good it really is. (Asfinktersezwut? What? Exactly.)<br/><br/>Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are comic genii, plain and simple. Tia Carrere is cute and sassy as Cassandra (and I mean that in the most non-demeaning and infantile way possible), Rob Lowe was just spiffy as the evil Benjamin, and hey, who can say no to a Scooby Doo Ending?<br/><br/>Full of great tunes, fine comedy, and cameos and stars out the wazoo, Wayne's World is the quintessential comedy for the slacker burnout metalhead in us all.  It also works for grownups. *grin*"

","Wayne's World is a classic! It went straight over my head the first time i saw it, because i wasn't really paying attention. Oh sure, i laughed at the time...it was still funny...but i didn't appreciate its true glory! The more i see this film, the more subtle jokes, delightful obscurity, and wonderfully inane references to popular culture seem to spring out at me. And much to its credit, not only does it feed on the 'pop-culture' of the social drop-out (60s sci-fi, heavy metal, and obscure british comedy), but it has managed, in return, to insinuate itself into popular culture throughout the world. I love it!!! Just take that scene in the music store... 'i like to play'....how can 4 words be so hilarious....and why did i suddenly think of that scene when i saw lars ulrich step out from behind his drumkit at a metallica concert, wearing geeky shorts and a T-shirt...to say 'i guess that's about that' Damn...its so difficult to explain why this film rocks....but it does. i guess you'd best just go watch it!!! You won't feel robbed."
