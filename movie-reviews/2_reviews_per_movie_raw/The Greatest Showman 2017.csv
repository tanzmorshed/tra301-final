"Brandon-Donlon","8","138","154","25 February 2019"," Initially avoided this movie, but when I watched it I felt like an idiot.
","To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.<br/><br/>When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again."

","I have never written a movie review but I couldn't let this jewel of a movie be slammed by the cynical critics without saying how much I loved it. This was the perfect movie for our family on Christmas Day. Don't pay attention to the ""professional"" reviews; judge by the moviegoers who are praising the movie. It was moving, upbeat, and romantic. Can't say enough good things about it. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, and Zendaya are all so talented. Go see it in the theater to really appreciate how magical this movie is."

","I love the circus. I love quality cinema. Not since Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) has a motion picture so successfully combined these two elements. I wouldn't be surprised if it won the same awards as Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece."

","As usual, the critics fail to grasp the obvious. Does the movie entertain? Yes, it does. Absolutely. Sure, it may not match the real story, and many things are not based in reality, but that's the point! It's a movie! It is a fun musical, very well done and enjoyable.If it was a made up story about John G. Pigglestack, then the critics would have nothing to complain about. I actually likes this much better than La La Land. Guess it's more upbeat. Musicals are a rare breed. Enjoy them while you can."

","This is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense. Everything about this film had perfect timing. Editing was seamless. Attention to detail was mind blowing, costumes outstanding. Special effects... whoa. Acting was flawless. I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment."

This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC! Everything from the incredible, toe-tapping, music to the heartfelt, dream-filled, story-line! I was so immersed in the movie that at some point I totally forgot I was sitting in a packed theater on Christmas Night! I'll even admit that I broke the cardinal rule and actually turned on my cell phone to download the the ENTIRE soundtrack while still in the theater...and I was only two songs in!! I will also admit that I am a 42yr old who left that theater feeling like a little kid again, wishing that I can twirl my way to the car without being looked at as crazy! LOL!! I've already seen it twice in as many days, and I plan on seeing it TONS more until I can own it for myself!

"Her-Excellency","8","135","186","7 April 2018"," Hugh Jackman Singing and Dancing. Need I say more?
","I have watched this film approximately twenty or more times. That is in no way an exaggeration and I may be low-calling it. Sometimes, I just have it on in the background while I work out or in the morning or while getting ready for work or I play it while cooking in the evening. <br/><br/>On a couple of occasions, I've even caught my boyfriend humming the tunes. To say the songs stick with you, is an understatement. <br/><br/>In fact, we've listened and watched it so much, that on every 20th Century Fox Movie ""opening"" sequence on any and all other subsequent 20th Century Fox movies we've watched, I automatically think of this one, and I am half expecting to see and hear the ""Ah, ah, ahhh, ahh ..."" and Hugh Jackman with his low ""Ladies and Gents . . . "". 
 
Besides having a catchy and moving soundtrack, the film itself is a wonder to look at. The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes are well-done, and again, come on: HUGH JACKMAN singing and dancing. What could be better? <br/><br/>Well, for one, not better, but almost as great, is Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lind. The lady is gorgeous, and while she actually doesn't sing her rendition of ""Never Enough"" (Loren Allred does), the passion and zeal she brings to her onstage performance, is one for the books. I could literally (and have) replay that one scene over and over. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman also have a duet which is fun and witty and very creatively done. <br/><br/>The only reason I did not give it a ""10"", is probably an unpopular view, and I know I will amass a hugh (not a typo :)) number of thumbs down, but oh well: I did not care for Zendaya AT ALL. I think she was so very miscast. I do not think she looked pretty in the film (although after filming, I saw her giving a couple of interviews and she looked beautiful); I thought she had absolutely zero chemistry with Zac Efron; and lastly, both her acting and her voice are like chalk grating on a blackboard to me. I think Logan Browning would have been cuter in the role. That's just me though, although it did affect my thoughts on the film and my score.<br/><br/>All in all, WATCH IT if you have not yet done so. It is beautiful to look at and a (modern) masterpiece to the ears."
"bullyfx","10","252","374","25 December 2017"," A Wonderful Holiday Present
","As is evidenced on this site, critical reviews of ""The Greatest Showman"" have been lackluster - at best. Sadly, it seems that unless a film features mind-numbing special effects, anguished characters and/or ""a real thinker"" of an ending, the critical community doesn't feel the film is worth your time. This time, they got it wrong...<br/><br/>""The Greatest Showman"" is an uplifting, joyous experience that we all need, now more than ever. The musical numbers are glorious and the plot, while not historically accurate (if you want a history lesson, rent ""Dunkirk"",) is heartfelt and engrossing. It is a film that families can enjoy together, devoid of the sappiness and goofy grownups that infest most family fare. And, the greatest present of all: you feel wonderful at the end!<br/><br/>Within the film, an entertainment critic who describes Mr. Barnum's offerings as ""a circus of humbug"" asks whether it bothers him that all he offers is fake. Barnum, referring to his customers, replies, ""Do their smiles look fake?"" No, they don't - nor do the ones in the theater. And those smiles are reaffirmed through the round of applause that many audiences bestow upon the film at its conclusion.<br/><br/>Gather the family, enjoy the music and leave the theater feeling better than when you came in. Happy Holidays."

","I loved this movie. I have already pre-ordered the blue ray and I am planning to see the movie again in the theatre. I am writing a review mainly because I am so annoyed by all of the negative reviews by the critics. One point was that it is not completely accurate to how P. T. Barnum was. Well it is a musical, not a documentary. It still was a well written story. One critic complained that the movie turned Barnum into a saint. Not true! He was flawed in the movie, at times uncaring or selfish. The scenes of the circus were just amazing. The choreography was very well done. The songs also are excellent and performed by very talented singers. Listen to the songs on youtube. Try ""Never Enough"" and ""The Greatest Showman."" The movie also shows the importance of having compassion for those who are different, and the effects of racism, and standing up to racism. The songs are very catchy, and will stay in your head, and the movie is uplifting. This movie was Hugh Jackman's dream, it took 7.5 years to make. Each actor held their own and fit well into their role. This movie has so much talent and effort put into it and deserves to become a classic."

They had something to say. Makes me sad to see so many missed the message of this very important movie, just because it was wrapped up in a fun experience.

","Sunday was my niece's birthday. 16. I invited her and two of her friends to do whatever they wanted. They chose to stay home, eat cake and watch The Greatest Showman on HBO and I thought Oh no. But, I had cake with them and sat to watch this Michael Gracy, who? Michael Gracy to see the story of PT Barnum with Hugh Jackman. Sentimental and pretty, yes but also, engrossing, moving, beautiful and structured in such a way that doesn't fall into the usual biopic traps. It moves at a breathless pace with smart and unexpected transitions. Hugh Jackman is great and Michelle Williams truthful to a fault. She's never less than that. What a wonderful actress. Zac Effron gives, what it may very well be, his most convincing performance and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson was a revelation to me. The script by Jenny Bicks and the remarkable Bill Condon tells a classic tale with contemporary rhythms and contemporary pace. Needless to say, I enjoyed it much more that I could possibly had imagine. So, thank you Lilli, happy 16!"

"harrisonlundy","10","203","321","25 December 2017"," Another Musical Classic: Don't Mind the Critics!
","I think critics are missing the whole premise of the film. I never really saw this as a biography to begin with, but a fun, upbeat historical fiction musical. Each musical number had a fitting mood for the scene, especially the opening number where it was especially satisfying to see the visual aspects of the film. I saw this film as a mixture of the pop-style mood of Hamilton, mixed with the visual joyride that was Pippin. It works for me perfectly. I never really felt the runtime at all because the musical parts of the show were enough to keep me satisfied. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman definitely brought my favorite performances, with Waitress actress Keala Settle delivering some satisfying vocal delivery. You can definitely feel the La La Land levels of genius lyrics here. As for story, I found myself telling the characters ""NO DON'T DO THAT"" or ""YESSS"" very softly in the theater. There were even a few moments where I smiled and laughed out loud.
In the words of Rachel Bloom, ""the modern musical is an American invention, and it is still alive and well."" It's rare that we get to see wonderfully crafted theatrical musicals such as this and La La Land. This is also something I think many critics fail to see. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time."

","Critics these days, pssshhhh. It's the public reviews that seem to get things spot on. This movie was upbeat, fast moving (which I love) and completely dazzling. The talent was top notch and the story line was appealing to all ages. Sure this is a clean family film, but it doesn't make it any less artsy or enjoyable than those with an adult rating. I looked up the actual history of P.T. Barnum, and this movie wasn't far off from the basic story of his life. Sure they added drama to the story, but I don't even care. It's not like this was a pivotal story in World History. He was an entertainer, and guess what, a movie in his name just got made that was completely entertaining. I'm sure he'd be pleased with the end result. I am not one to see movies twice, but I'm sure I will. My husband and I went to the late showing last night and I will likely go again this week with my daughters and their friends. Is there anything Hugh Jackman can't do? Clearly there is not!!

"ccamp89","5","174","338","26 February 2018"," A sugar rush
","Quite a frustrating film. The musical numbers are far and away its strongest attribute, which is obviously what any good musical should strive for. Although they aren't all showstoppers, there are some genuinely excellent sequences with tight, kinetic editing, great rhythmic camera movements, and vibrant choreography. The first proper musical number that acts as a prologue to Barnum's life was quite impressive with its fluid execution and ability to convey a large amount of information in a short period of time (which ironically is a quality that ends up being to the film's detriment when viewed as a whole... more on that later). Jackman's and Efron's bar duet is another fun and energetic sequence with a lot of cool camerawork and infectious energy. Essentially all of the songs are pleasant, catchy, and memorable as well, if a bit vanilla.<br/><br/>The strength of these musical sequences is enough to save the film from being bad, and is even almost enough to outweigh the many, many flaws... but not quite. Firstly, the film is attractive to look at to be sure, but it is at times so incredibly glossy that it feels like you're watching a shampoo or jewelry commercial. Sure, it's going for that fairy tale feel, but at times the sheen and shimmer is a little too blinding. And that high-gloss polish is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the incredibly superficial quality of the story and its characters. It's disappointing because this story is genuinely interesting and has the potential for a lot of moral exploration that is completely passed over. Again, I get that this is a musical and a family film, but that doesn't mean it has to be vapid and stupid (see: La La Land). I found it extremely troubling that the film completely ignored the moral quandary of whether Barnum was helping these ""unique"" people, or exploiting them for his own fame and fortune. These characters never even question his intent, viewing the situation as Barnum helping to ""put them out there"", gain them social acceptance, and create a ""family"", where in reality they're quite clearly being taken advantage of in a way that is arguably more reprehensible morally than the protesters who mock them. It's a truly glaring omission from the film that saps so much potential substance from the story.<br/><br/>Contributing to the superficial feeling of the film is another all-to common problem that modern American family films suffer from: the pacing is way too fast. It's like the studios are afraid people will be bored by their films, and thus they design them to speed through plot points and character development in a way that ends up suffocating the life from it. Sure this approach makes the film feel lively and exciting, but it also robs it of actual, meaningful character interactions and development. The result is a film that feels like all dessert and no main course - a bowl of chocolate ice cream sure tastes great but it's no substitute for a satiating meal.<br/><br/>Another nitpick that bothered me enough that I have to mention it: why is a renowned 19th Century opera singer belting out a Celine Dion-esque pop tune for an adoring ""high brow"" audience in a classic theater? That scene was almost laughable in its absurdity. And although it was by far the worst offender, I would say in general the music in the film, while catchy, did clash somewhat with the period.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really should be giving this film a lower score. Somehow I enjoyed it quite a bit even in the face of the many fundamental issues, which is a testament to the strength of the best sequences. Still this is a deeply flawed film that, for all its visual splendor and admittedly intoxicating energy, amounts to little more than a sugar rush.<br/><br/>Strong 2.5/5"
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","99","192","24 December 2017"," Good Choreography but Sloppy Story
","A musical movie about P.T. Barnum told with all great reverence to P.T. Barnum, featuring P.T. Barnum's Museum of Curiosities...so why not just make ""Barnum"" the stage musical? The answer to that question seems to be because then they couldn't get the guys from La La Land to do the music; fair enough. But if director Michael Gracey and screenwriter Jenny Bicks were set on custom making this celebration of glitz, chicanery and humbug they could have at least opted for a little more connective tissue.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is a movie in moments, many of them great many more of them flaccid and empty. We're whisked through P.T.'s (Jackman) impoverished childhood in a single bound before settling on his happy marriage with wife Charity (Williams), and his two daughters (Johnson and Seely) who have grown to see their father as a hero. Tired of working to scrounge up a meager living, Barnum embarks on a risky entertainment venture and in due time, recruits his circus of curiosities and freaks.<br/><br/>From that point on, the film's narrative relies heavily on its skin-deep celebration of acceptance and diversity. This is while it chugs along through Barnum's life from his start as a full-time huckster, to his falling out with Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (Ferguson). And while it would have been nice to say that the movie does a good job of linking theme with plot, I'm sorry to say none of it becomes a cohesive whole.<br/><br/>This is not entirely the fault of the filmmakers. I mean turning P.T. Barnum's life into a celebration of kindness and humanity is like using William 'Boss' Tweed as a symbol for New York pride. This film being a musical, I was not expecting something exacting, but I was expecting at the very least a keen acknowledgement that the legacy of P.T. Barnum isn't all razzle-dazzle. Yet this film makes him out to look like a saint; a man of untold potential who uses ""truthful hyperbole"" to provide for his loving family - A man of conviction, of love and of just wanting to put a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Framed in virtually any other way, Barnum would be the villain - enticing his young protégé Phillip (Efron) to ""live a little,"" and abandon his family to come join the circus. Belittling a theater critic with insults masquerading as flaccid, fortune cookie, self-help wisdom and enticing circus ""freaks"" to stand out and express themselves while closing the door on them the moment he's among the rich and famous. The film's show-stopping tune ""This is Me"" takes place at this moment but because the film is too scared to make its hero anything more complicated than a fancily folded cocktail napkin, the moment feels like the side characters are just letting off steam.<br/><br/>What ultimately saves this movie from being a complete waste of a Saturday night is the choreography. Every poppy show tune and love ballad brings with it entire body shots of twirling, leaping perfection, conjuring memories of the physical feats of the cast of West Side Story (1961). Not satisfied with the traditional, the film continues to build its momentum with incredibly fancy footwork and some truly death defying trapeze choreography on the part of Zendaya and Zac Efron.<br/><br/>There's imagination in the frame and a lot of it, but largely due to the film's complete inability to marry subject with tone, The Greatest Showman is far from great. Rather than being a worthy successor to Moulin Rouge! (2001) this picture winds up feeling like Newsies (1992) without a Crutchy. And let's face it; the only thing we really remember about that movie was there was a character named Crutchy."

","I truly feel that there was a missed opportunity here with the greatest showman, it had great talent, music, costume design and an overall aura that feels like an extravaganza yet somehow it still falls short.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer you have likely already seen the film, there were brilliant songs and likeable characters for sure but at the end of the day the storytelling was horrendously lacking. Which is as I have said a terrible shame seeing as there was a brilliant story about acceptance and prejudice right there yet the film never seems to fully capitalize. Much like Barnum's circus was described by the characters in this film this film is definitely likeable but at the end of the day, a cheesy, popcorn shoving flick. <br/><br/>This film can also be described as a series of single moments of brilliance, when the film really utilized the musical aspects it really presents these visually stunning scenes yet, outside of those moments this is a very spotty film with an incoherent narrative. Indeed, the film seems to jump from scene to scene, moment to moment without any worthwhile character development or motive and without establishing much story points. <br/><br/>While the movie had characters that were physically fleshed out and unique they weren't given much time for characterization except for few individual characters, as a result many of the characters seem more like caricatures then characters with personality and heart, which is something that the film truly needs. It almost seems like because the characters were so individually stylized physically they didn't see a need to narratively build their characters.<br/><br/>Then again, those moments and bursts of energy in the film were just so well done that makes the film something that cannot be simply dismissed, a true shame. The greatest showman thrives at depicting the human spirit and tenacity yet fails to deliver a story with a coherent story and focus. But in there somewhere is a great film that sadly was not what the end result was. If the greatest showman could better build to character revelations and the main romance story with meatier character motives that truly connects those individually great moments I believe we do have something great here."

decided to watch a movie in the evening and my kids said, 'Please please please can we watch the Greatest Showman?'(my husband and kids had watched it when I was out one night) and I agreed. I don't know what I was expecting, but that movie was AMAZING! The songs were catchy, and we have been blasting the soundtrack in our car all the time.

","I love musicals, and went to The Greatest Showman on the strong recommendation of my girlfriend, who'd seen it and loved every bit of it. She was shocked that my reaction was so negative. <br/><br/>The sins of this movie are numerous, but to begin with, as a musical, you have to consider the music above all else. If you like generic, bland, pop mixes, you'll probably like the music in this. If on the other hand, you like thematically appropriate, well-timed, plot-based, interesting compositions like those in Chicago or Moulin Rouge, give this a pass. Choreography was similarly uninspiring, from opening scene to closing credits. Literally not a single memorable number. <br/><br/>Character development: there is none. Prepare for the most cursory archetypes that aren't explored or developed in any real way. In no way did I ever care about a single character in this film.<br/><br/>Overall direction: I'm sorry, but this was godawful. People do not SMILE like this all the time. They don't LAUGH at pedestrian dialogue. Whenever the pacing seemed to grind to a halt, hey, why not liven it up with a song? Truly painful. <br/><br/>Even from a technical perspective, this one flopped: costumes were lackluster, makeup was shockingly uneven (you could see the glue lines of the bearded woman), CGI (thankfully sparse) was flat and not composited very well (eg, most shots with elephants). Early on, it seemed as though the filmmaker was shooting for a Moulin Rouge-style fantasy world. That didn't succeed, and then was dropped abruptly for more conventional presentation.<br/><br/>Do I sound angry? Well, I am; I was prepared to love this movie. I wanted to love this movie. My girlfriend and I discussed for hours afterwards, as it seriously affected her - several scenes caused her to tear up, she loved the music and dance, she thought Hugh Jackman was fabulous. I was flabbergasted, as I was merely trying to get to the end so I could escape and do something more entertaining. We're not often on such different pages, but wow, was this one polarizing."

Perhaps it's due to my age...perhaps I am a curmudgeon...all I know is that the film was too intense, too brash and too loud for me. Now it's NOT because I dislike musicals...far from it.

","The Greatest Showman is fast-moving, well-paced, colorful, and easy to follow. It's worth seeing, but its faults are significant. The songs are all in just one musical style, and it's the same style as in La La Land, and I found the lack of variety tiring. (OTOH, if you like the breathy style of current pop music, you will like the movie a lot more than I did.)<br/><br/>I knew it was a fictional takeoff on Barnum's life, so I didn't mind hearing Jenny Lind singing songs composed for the movie. But giving her a weak and breathy voice, instead of the clear and brilliant voice that helped make her so famous, was a step too far. Over 300 credits in Special Effects speaks to an over-reliance on FX at the expense of performance, and that fits my overall impression."

"jaezander","2","91","196","9 February 2018"," A Strange Attempt at Inclusivity
","I don't mean to discourage anyone from finding joy or meaning in The Greatest Showman, but as someone who values truthful screen adaptations and authentic intersectional representation in the media, I have some fundamental issues with this film. <br/><br/>The Greatest Showman--even with its big budget, great cast, and good intentions on the surface--fails to come across as genuine to me. If I have to put aside the historical inaccuracies, I will, but not before saying that it was incredibly pointless to have this based on a real person. This film has nothing to do with P.T. Barnum--a man who grossly exploited the ""oddities"" of marginalized people to make himself rich--and I think it's in extremely poor taste to make a sensationalized, sugar-coated version of his story.<br/><br/>But even after putting all of that aside, on its own, the film is generic and lacking a genuine commitment to it's message of acceptance and inclusivity. This has everything to do with its framing. At it's core, the film frames the white male protagonist as the hero of marginalized people, using the diverse cast of ""freak"" characters as a collective plot device to further Barnum's development. This is a problem for me because Barnum is framed to be without the prejudice others are so filled with towards the ""freaks,"" but never in the story does he actually defend their humanity or say anything to prove that he sees them as more than meal tickets. This is even more apparent by the fact that he never apologizes for having ignored and abandoned them. Furthermore, the majority of the ""freaks"" are lumped together as a whole, giving me no impression of their individual characters, their individual motivations, or any real impression that they have a working relationship with Barnum at all. <br/><br/>Because of this, I can't help but feel that the ultimately inclusive message of ""be proud of who you are"" stems from a purely systematic view of the audience. Or, they wanted to make money, and so they hopped on the ""diversity is good"" train without really caring about writing a deeper, more meaningful story. <br/><br/>Which begs the question, does this family film have to be more deep and meaningful? I guess not, it could be seen as harmless, but I, for one, have little tolerance for films that glorify reckless men like Barnum. I know its a simple rags-to-riches story, but if we're going to play around with empowering those who feel othered by society, I'd like something that doesn't revolve around a simplistic version of a historically problematic man that does the absolute minimum amount of work to represent people of various minorities. <br/><br/>I think the people who were helming this project thought--maybe even subconsciously--that generic would be fine, relatable, and free of controversy. If you don't think about it too hard, it's a fun movie for the whole family, but I personally find this kind of storytelling irresponsible and in poor taste, especially today."
"fletcherc21","5","94","206","22 December 2017"," A Showy, Forgettable CG Musical
","The Greatest Showman is a flashy biopic of circus pioneer PT Barnum. Unfortunately, PT Barnum gets the Hollywood treatment and it is a shallow movie that portrays Barnum as a champion of the downtrodden just as much as the profiteer that he was. Hugh Jackman's version of Barnum would never say ""There's a sucker born every minute.""<br/><br/>Of even greater disappointment was the music. The writers of La La Land's incredible soundtrack follow it up with a disappointing set of songs that all sound the same. If you shuffled the songs around in this movie, I'm not sure anyone would really notice. The only song I can remember much of is The Greatest Show, and that's just because they repeatedly come back to it. Even Golden Globe nominated This Is Me sounds like the rest of them. It was also clear that for the most part the actors are not the ones singing, and those that are recorded in a studio and then lip synced, which while understandable, should not be noticeable. <br/><br/>There is a solid cast and they all do fine, particularly Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson. The dance numbers definitely feel like they are from a 60s musical like West Side Story or Mary Poppins rather than a modern musical. It is also shot and constructed reasonably well, but it just not gripping."

"jonathancruano","3","104","232","28 December 2017"," A Truly Horrible Night at the Movies
","I decided for a lark to pick a movie at random with my buddy Chijindu and we decided to go see ""The Greatest Showman."" What a mistake!<br/><br/>""The Greatest Showman"" was obviously intended as wholesome entertainment, but that only makes it a well-intended mess. The main problem with the film is that hardly any imagination went into creating a good story. The film largely replaces plot, dialogue, and character development with wall-to-wall special effects and loud and yet forgettable songs. Moreover, I can understand why the studio heads decided to jam in as many special effects and jarring songs into this picture as possible: the screenplay was rubbish and borrowed shamelessly from the plot formulas of a dozen other films. The scene where P.T. Barnum as a boy meets Charity comes straight out of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, which covers the subject of young love far more competently. Then midway through the movie, me and Chijindu called out the three plot formulas that determined the course of the rest of the film:<br/><br/>(1) The cliche of whether P.T. Barnum was going to embrace the snobbish aristocrats or stay true to the circus performers who made him famous.<br/><br/>(2) The conflict between an interracial romance and society's prejudices.<br/><br/>(3) The love triangle involving P.T. Barnum, an opera singer, and his wife. <br/><br/>As a result, this movie amounted to three half-baked plot formulas that were covered more capably in other movies. The screenplay also represents missed opportunities to explore some truly interesting areas. For instance, I would like to learn something about how P.T. Barnum and Phillip Carlyle ran their circus and managed costs. And maybe P.T. Barnum's circus could have gone on a number of extraordinary adventures all over the United States. But alas no, this film did not want to take advantage of any of these opportunities even though its ambitious budget certainly could have afforded it. The other problem with this movie is that while bigotry is one of its central themes, it is not handled in an intelligent and honest way. One of the film's unexplained conceits is that P.T. Barnum and Phillip Carlyle are virtually immune from any of the prejudices of their time and can see their world through 21st century eyes. By depicting Barnum and Carlyle in this post-modern light, the studio heads avoid the difficulties of explaining how these two characters dealt with the internal conflict between their prejudices and being exposed to the humanity of the circus performers. <br/><br/>To be sure, these reservations about the plot might not have weighed as heavily as they did if the wall-to-wall songs were any good. Unfortunately, the songs in ""The Greatest Showman"" do not belong to the tradition of great musicals. In Disney's ""Little Mermaid,"" there was close collaboration between the people who wrote the lyrics and the people who set those lyrics to music. As a result, we still fondly remember Little Mermaid's songs like ""Under the Sea."" But no such collaboration took place here. Instead, what appears to have happened was that truly horrible lyrics were written and the composer had the thankless job of trying and failing miserably to set these lyrics to music. These songs are memorable only for how loud and embarrassing they are and I challenge anyone to be able to remember the tune to any of these songs -- and I bet they could not do it. <br/><br/>As a result, ""The Greatest Showman"" is a film with good character actors trapped in formulaic plot with terrible musical numbers. There are some brief moments of wonder, including some rare quiet moments where P.T. Barnum and Charity are talking with their daughters Helen and Caroline. But unfortunately those moments are completely overwhelmed by the awful musical numbers (which were clearly prerecorded and then lip synched on screen) and the absence of a great storyline. ""The Great Showman,"" in a phrase, is anything but a great show."

","I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy strictly Taylor Swift/Megan Trainor and Disney's Shake it Up. The music and choreography leave much to be desired. I spent the first 4 songs trying to figure out if they hired ""stunt doubles"" for all of the singing or if strong auto tune was the only button they knew how to press. There was no creativity whatsoever. If you were you listen to the songs back to back, you couldn't tell the difference. All used the same 4 chords, all used the same cheesy ""we can fix it!"" *fist bump the sky* chorus. I expected so much more out of this cast. With the lineup they paid for, they had to seriously try to mess it up this bad."
"reubenmark","4","98","220","1 January 2018"," Listen to the critics, they know what they're talking about
","First off, I feel I need to preface this by saying I am not some heartless jockish type who violently hates musicals or spectacular movies. I am a great lover of musicals because of their potential to strengthen the emotional beats of any story through the majesty of song. Moments like ""City of Stars"" in La La Land, which beautifully depicts Seb's resignation in falling for Mia. Or Les Miserables ""I dreamed a dreamed"" that could melt even the coldest heart due to the plight of the completely defeated Flautine. My all time favorite musical, Fiddler on the Roof, is jammed packed with these moments, right from the start and the incredibly delicate yet spectacular world building opening of ""TRADITION!"" These musical moments were God damn earned by their story's plots and that is what is surely missing from The Great Showman.<br/><br/>I honestly do not think it is possible to tell the back story of your protagonist as quickly as this movie does! It is a troubling trend nowadays to gloss over the set up of a films hero's life as quickly as possible just to get to the explosive dramatic action of the story, but telling us who and why we should care about a character is absolutely vital for the problems faced by that character to fully hit home. From the little I know about P.T Barnum he seemed to be this incredibly complex and interesting historical figure, so why not explore this in-depth? Do the film makers expect me to do my own deep dive into research into the man, inspired by their superficial exploration of him? I'm not out here looking to get homework after watching a movie, YOU DO THE HOMEWORK! And give me an authentic recollection of his life. It really is not hard and there will still be time for the musical numbers. <br/><br/>And this is not only true for Barnum but so so many characters in this movie. You know you are lying to yourself if you did not feel like you wanted to know more about Zendaya's character? Where in the universe did this this incredible trapezes brother-sister duo come from? Indeed all the performers in Barnums circus were such wasted opportunities to help drive the message of the film home. At the very least they could have homed in on one, the bearded lady perhaps? I know those among you who love this movie are going to say that that would have slowed the ""hip and happening"" spectacle of this movie down but for the love of God its not hard work to script in same pieces of dialogue (or I don't know even possibly A SONG perhaps?) That gave us a feel for who these damn people are. But no f-that right? Who cares who they were, I mean its pretty obvious the type of life a bearded lady had, right?<br/><br/>Now, you reading this may perceive me of being completely full of shit and some sort of film student, and you would be right! I am still very early on in my studies but the little I have learnt on crafting a story has taught me that every story needs to have an underlying meaning, a lesson the filmmaker wants to teach their audience and indeed themselves through a journey in the lives of characters. As my lecturer says to us, ""Tell the audience that two plus two equals eleven, then prove it to them!"" Writing stories that can inspire change in the world takes a ton of introspection, research, and diving deep into your own understanding and consciousness of a topic and then presenting your findings to the world and this is what annoys me the most with The Great Showman! If you were to take out the songs in this film it would honestly be the filmic equivalent of reading a Wikipedia page and that is such a shame because of the possibilities presented by the topic it was trying to explore. They could have explored race, the entertainment industry, exploitation, ambition, and presented us with an honest and educational finding on these universal issues, but instead they gave us a series of beautiful music videos. <br/><br/>I am not making my point well here, but if you want to have a look at what true artistry in storytelling can lead to, check out this ""Lessons from a screenplay"" video about ""UP"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulm7bcB2xvY<br/><br/>But I am done complaining about this movie and I didn't mean to rain on all your parades but as a hopefully future filmmaker is worries me that such an artificial story-line can fly under the radar so easily by just adding heaps and heaps of spectacle. If you truly are a lover of films, you should demand with all you have that the men and woman who are charges to creating the scripts are forced to be as accountable as the incredible work done by cinematographers, sound designers, editors, colourists, visual effects artists, production and costume designers, music composers, and ofcourse the actors; all of whom completely and utterly killed the game in The Great Showman, it just a shame the writer put in such a shitty effort. <br/><br/>And go easy on the critics, they love movies just as much as you do..."

Colourful and bright with some big songs, the movi is actually just a conflicted mess. Whilst they see it fit to use language of the time to describe the ""freaks"" drafted to PT Barnum's show (all done in a quaint medley so we barely get any depth or interesting story), the music utilises a far more modern tone. There's be no issue with this (look how incredibly Lin-Manuel Miranda's 'Hamilton' mixes up historical period & musical style) but here the intention is totally unclear. <br/><br/>Returning to the story, the main rags-to-riches-story of PT Barnum is poorly told. It's wholly unoriginal with huge story elements missed out (when he's told that his family is to be evicted from their home, we've had no proper indication as to how or why. His interest in 'incredible' singer Jenny Lind (she most certainly is not an 'incredible' singer) is dull and obvious, even though she proves a highly unlikeable character. <br/><br/>As for Zac Efron's part in this big mess, it's hard to understand what his character's even doing there. Again, unlikeable and 2-dimentional, there's no originality in the telling of his and Anne Wheeler's mixed-race relationship story. <br/><br/>This is a terrible movie which fails to tell an interesting story (a true story!). Entertaining only due to Jackman and Keala Settle's talent and some bright colours. Don't let the smiles and music deceive you - this is a poor film."

","It could just be me and according to the reviews on this, it pretty much is. That makes so suspicious. It's literally 8's and 10's. And I'll be honest with you, it feels faked. Ya think there'd be a six somewhere around, maybe a seven. No. Just 8s and 10s, like nobody's business. I don't get it. <br/><br/>I loved Moulin Rouge. I love serious, musical movies. But I hated this. The songs absolutely sucked. It was like they were trying to push 21st ideals and narratives in the 19th Century, which is okay when it is in small doses, but this was like, you could replace the scenario with another character in like the 2010s. <br/><br/>They had the same fucking songs about ""loving and believing in yourself"", it made me want to clamp my ears shut and hope for sleep. <br/><br/>You'll like this movie, if you enjoy turning you brain completely off and look at Hugh Jackman. He was brilliant in this. He is a brilliant actor this is not unexpected for him to shine. The acting wasn't awful. It was the writing. The writing was pure garbage. <br/><br/>There was also the fact that this didn't feel serious at all. <br/><br/>Like, at all. <br/><br/>If you're like me, I want a serious film. <br/><br/>And I'll be honest, I went in here with only the crappy ads Pandora gave me which is the whole Zendaya and Zac Efron duo (by the way, Efron really shined in this movie). He did. You go Zac Efron. It turned me away from the movie at first hearing, but I took my cousin and went with my aunt to go watch this film.<br/><br/>This is the 18th Century with circus freaks! I wanted something more than just dances and songs, I wanted magical-feeling scenery. I didn't get that. Honestly, I didn't need a Zendaya/Efron duo. If I could just watch her ri-ribbon dance (idk what it's called) and perform more circus tricks, I would have loved it. <br/><br/>This movie could have really taken a darker, more serious approach with beautiful imagery and really showed a P.T. Barnum circus show. Which I don't believe is already accurate considering how different P.T. Barnum is in this film. He's supposed to be in his sixties, if you just wanted his circus career, he had a much different life than what was revealed to us.<br/><br/>You wouldn't know that he had four daughters and through-out his career, grew up. His wife dies in real life and he marries someone within a year! <br/><br/>So yeah 3 Stars: For not just mild historical inaccuracy (but extreme), crappy songs that sound very autotuned and very pop-esque, very cheesy plot that didn't seem to have a focus, and was just all over the place. <br/><br/>Take your kids to see it. They'll enjoy it and maybe you can convince yourself that you like it because of the three main stars, but it really isn't anything special."
"isaacglover_05","2","70","157","27 December 2017"," An empty candy-wrapper
","This movie, to me, was like an empty candy wrapper. Before watching the movie and after seeing the trailer, it looked like it was going to be something magnificent! It had:
Academy award winning lyricists - Benj Pasek and Justin Paul
Academy award nominated actor - Hugh Jackman
Academy Award nominated actress - Michelle Williams
An inspiring true story about acceptance, love, relationships, family and sticking with what you value most. The cinematography looked absolutely astounding in the trailer, the acting looked amazing, the directing looked amazing, just EVERYTHING looked amazing in the trailer. It gave me goosebumps I must admit. So, it's a small wonder that I was excited to go see this movie as soon as I could.<br/><br/>However, that was just the wrapping of this promisingly sweet and delicious candy that I was looking forward to indulging. So when you open the wrapper and seeing that there's nothing inside it, you would feel quite disappointed wouldn't you?
Well that feeling was similar to how I felt when walking out of the cinema. <br/><br/>The cast and the characters are probably this movie's strongest point:
Zac Efron really came to his own in this film. Not being a big fan, I must say I ended up finding myself quite excited when seeing him on screen, His character was intelligent, classy, knew what was best for him and had his moral compass set straight (though a little bit crooked at the start of the film). 
Hugh and Michelle were great of course. Rachael Ferguson was absolutely stunning, Zendaya was extremely impressive, and the circus ensemble were great in each of their own way. 
The cinematography was extremely impressive, the first shot of the film already reeling me in in what I thought was going to be the movie of the year. <br/><br/>But that's where it ended. 
I understand where the lyricists and the composers of this film were aiming for a more modern feel with their music as a way to express Barnum's ahead-of-time ideas. But the 1800's setting mixed with 2000's music was definitely not the way to go, especially when each song started to sound the same: the structure being too similar to the point where you could predict when the chorus was coming up, when the beat was going to drop, when the texture was going to thicken. Hell, you could almost sing the lyrics before it was even sung! The messages with each song were very similar. Although they were inspiring messages, it didn't shy away from the fact that they ended up being quite redundant. Michelle Williams' solo was impressive, though, and was definitely a standout from the rest of the music. <br/><br/>The story was predictable - a man coming from a troubled life, yearning to make something of himself. He eventually gets there, getting married and having a couple of kids along the way, but of course let's the fame get to his head and therefore slowly strains the relationships he has built around him. He of course eventually picks himself back up after a few reminiscing pieces of music as well as inspiring ""Nothing will bring me down"" scores, and lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>It's been done before time and time again, and setting it in the 1800's and making it a musical will not shy away from the fact that the formula is getting really old. <br/><br/>So this is my humble opinion on ""The Greatest Showman"" and what I had to say on the matter. It's not the worst movie of 2017 but it definitely isn't the best movie of the year either. It will be forgotten once it gets out of cinemas I believe."

Seriously the music was like seven words just changed around throughout the entire movie. It was two hours of looping of a really bad song with a few lines of horrible dialogue sprinkled in there. The dancing was lots of spinning and arm-waving. <br/><br/>You get to know NO characters in the movie other than Barnum. Every other character is just filler, fodder, empty actors with no story development, who are just there to wave their arms in garish makeup. <br/><br/>I feel like a lot of people were just maybe fooled by the poppy, upbeat tune and the constant spinning and swirling going on that they failed to notice how bad this movie is!<br/><br/>The slap in the face here is that I LOVE musicals. And I hated this one."

I did appreciate how much they showed how selfish the main guy was, but there was no sense of him involved with the troup of freaks for more than just money. At times they tried to imply but they really were just a side character that he also happened to exploit. Also, what circus only has dancing and singing?

","Much of the criticism of this film centres around the historical inaccuracies.

Add in the fact that the storyline is totally twee and sugary sweet and you are left with 100 minutes of candy floss.

"leonblackwood","5","6","9","14 May 2018"," Looked spectacular but the music was annoying!
","Review:
Just like the remake of the Great Gatsby, the music in this movie really doesn't suit the time period, which is set during the late 1800's but they are catchy tunes. Personally the music did get on my nerves after a while, because I just wanted them to get on with the story but it is a musical so I should have known what I was getting myself into. Anyway at the beginning of the movie, you see a young, penniless Phineas Taylor Barnum (Hugh Jackman), who has a wild imagination and sadly loses his father at an early age. Whilst living with is foster parents, he falls in love with his childhood sweetheart, even though her father thinks that he is not right for her but after writing many letters to each other, they end up getting married. At an older age, he ends up in a dead end job, and when he gets laid off, he decides to open a wax museum to make ends meet. Due to bad ticket sales from the museum, he changes the attraction to a circus, with ""never seen before"" live acts, full of a collection of oddities and music. After a while, Barnum gambles everything on a opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson), which takes him away from the family home and puts a strain on his family life. Jenny expects more from there relationship, which Barnum declines and soon realises that he misses his family. On Jenny's last performance, she is pictured giving Barnum a kiss, which gets in the papers and makes his wife Charity (Michelle Williams) leave him, even though it was an innocent kiss. Meanwhile, his circus gets burnt down by the locals who think that it's a travelling freak show, so his partner, Phillip Carlyle agrees to help him to build the circus again, even though they don't have any money. Barnum then concentrates on sorting out his family life, and once that's back on track, he gathers the troops and they put on the best performance of there lives. It's quite a touching story which does have some emotional moments but I really couldn't take the singing. The costumes and the cinematography did make it unique and pretty spectacular but there wasn't much depth to the various characters, who all had strange oddities. I appreciate the amount of work that went into making the final product, and the fact that it had taken nearly 10 years to make but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I'm sure there are many people who will disagree with my point of view, especially after seeing the amount of money that it made at the box office but I've never been a big lover of musicals, so let's just put it down to personal choice. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This is the first movie directed by Michael Gracey but he has made music videos for Natasha Bedingfield, the Sugababes and Will Young. For his first movie, he really took on a big task, and judging by the reviews, he certainly done a good job. With movies like The Muppet Man, Daughter of Smoke and Bone and Naruto in development, I'm sure that people will be anxious to see what he will be coming up with next but I personally doubt that he will smash the box office like he did with this movie. Although this wasn't my type of film, all of the actors put in a top performance, especially as most of them sung the numbers themselves. I can't see them making a sequel but I'm sure this film will be remembered for some time, especially as the soundtrack has become a best seller.<br/><br/>Budget: $84million
Worldwide Gross: $431million<br/><br/>Genre: Biography, Drama, Musical
Cast: Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Keala Settle, Eric Anderson, Will Swenson, Paul Sparks, Austyn Johnson and Cameron Seely. 5/10"

"zachanders","3","13","24","5 September 2019"," It's Wildly Overrated
","I had low expectations before watching this film, and walking out I realized my prior expectations were completely accurate. It was absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>It's been awhile since I've seen a movie with so many flaws - some including the cringe/ cliche dialogue, over dramatic songs, and horrifically bad CGI. It's so incredibly hard to be entertained by this movie when the flaws are so noticeable. The CGI backdrops don't blend in well enough with the real sets. When musical moments come, most of the actors fail at lip-dubbing and it's so painfully obvious that it's lip-dub. (A good example of this is the ""opera"" scene) A note to add is that the songs are simply unlikable. Everyone of them have the same beat and tempo, and despite being set in the 1800s, the musical pieces resemble those of modern pop songs. It's honestly disgusting.<br/><br/>Another flaw is the dialogue. It comes off as any other cliche musical. The characters are written terribly, as they seem to be written by one person - there are not enough obvious features to dignify each circus character. They're all mad-tempered weirdos, who somehow all want ""acceptance"", and following this we get the cliche retaliation from the citizens. This sort of theme seems to be overplayed in today's film industry.<br/><br/>I'll put credit where it's due - Hugh Jackman is great as always, and despite the fact that I hate this film, I do admire the work and dedication put behind the production.
In conclusion, though this film is in fact original, nothing actual feels original about it."

","I went into this one expecting something special. Hugh Jackman sure does like his musicals. And I had heard Zendaya was in it, so how bad could it possibly be?<br/><br/>Still pretty bad. <br/><br/>I'm giving this 3 stars, not less, because:<br/><br/><ul><li>There's some pretty great choreography in this one, I have to admit. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Zendaya and Zac Efron are in this, and their song is particularly well done.

He might be pulling that weird half-grin face the entire time, but you can tell how much he's loving being in another musical. </li></ul><br/><br/>I'm certainly not giving this more than 3 stars, because:<br/><br/><ul><li>It's an entire movie romanticizing the life and legacy of P T Barnum, who is in absolutely no way someone who I can root for. Mr. Barnum's first 'freak' that he put on display was a 70 year old black slave. He first began putting her on display when he was in his early 20s. He claimed she was the 200-year-old nanny of George Washington. When she died a few years later, he charged tickets for people to watch her autopsy. Wonder why the movie didn't cover this aspect of his life?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The songs are all vastly different, and the lyrics are vague enough that they seem to have been designed so that they can be blasted on the radio and soundtracks will be bought. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jenny Lind. All of Jenny Lind. Once again, Ms. Lind was a real person - a Swedish opera singer who donated a small fortune to charity. The movie has portrayed her as wanting nothing but to seduce P T Barnum and ruin his marriage. When he turns her down, she attempts to destroy his life, and cancels the tour. What really happened is that Barnum's marketing strategies began to make her uncomfortable, so she stepped down from going on tour with him. As if this portrayal wasn't inaccurate enough, her one song in the film is some kind of Adele-style pop ballad. Not exactly what I was expecting from an 'opera singer'.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters are in love, and the movie attempts to portray an interracial relationship in a time where black people in London were still being kept as slaves, their lives endangered. P T Barnum even hires Zendaya and her brother, telling them that he wants the crowds to be outraged to see black trapeze artists performing. This attempt at an interracial relationship portrayal could have been good, but they boil it down to Zendaya going ""No,,, we can't be together,,,"" and Zac Efron going ""Why are you so afraid of what people think?"" This is after he is ashamed to be seen with her in public earlier in the film, too. Honestly, this was the laziest sub-storyline I've ever seen. Zac and Zendaya are gorgeous but this was honestly one of the aspects of the film that irritated me the most.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some real bad child actor singing. Really, really bad singing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>That scene where Hugh Jackman rides a CGI elephant through the streets of London to meet his family, then dismounts the elephant and runs off, leaving it randomly standing in the middle of the city. P T Barnum is a dick to elephants. </li></ul><br/><br/>If they had just made a musical about a man who starts a circus, this could have been alright. Trying to root this in history then massively failing to accurately portray Barnum and Jenny Lind just made this even more of a flop."
"hamilton-3","4","15","29","9 September 2018"," Ambitious intentions fall short
","The movie starts out with good energy, which drew me in. This is not really a movie about Barnum, but a musical based (very loosely) on Barnum's life. Accepting that, what can we hope for? The best musical theater will give you the pleasures of music, choreography, and production design. Exceptional musicals like ""Hamilton"" and ""My Fair Lady"" will incorporate great storytelling. Unfortunately, ""The Greatest Showman"" falls short. The production design is truly wonderful, and the choreography is okay up to a point. The songs, however, are pretty generic. Not a single memorable melody. They only serve the purpose to push the story along. And alas, the storytelling devolves into soapy fiction. There is an underlying theme, represented by Barnum's crew of freaks, of diversity and opposition to racism. Admirable, but weakly executed. Hugh Jackman does a great job of carrying this movie, but he is ultimately crushed by its burden of glossy shallowness."
"katajanokanpyorat","1","31","68","27 January 2018"," The Most Unambitious Show
","As a great fan of circus and musicals I expected a lot from this film. None of my expectations were met. Every second scene is made with CGI - and a fast camera run doesn't make it look any better. Every time that a interesting twist was about to bring the story or a character some depth, they broke into an forced song and everything was forgotten. I was stunned by their ability to underestimate the audience. My only consolation for time and money wasted was that this will for sure be the last drop for passive consumers and we will start to demand better entertainment."

","So, I have never written a review before, but I felt so cheated after seeing this movie that I find myself here to warn all of you to listen to critics for once and ignore users positive reviews. <br/><br/>I started watching it with great expectations. I'm a great lover of musicals and if everyone was talking about it there must be some really good reason, right? If there is, I couldn't find it despite my great efforts. Leaving Hugh Jackman's performance aside (it's impossible not to love the man), the whole thing is an assault on the senses that tries to drive the focus away from its bland and uninteresting story. Really, despite some very bad business decisions Jackman's character makes and his complete lack of financial responsibility, there isn't much more to it. Characters are two-dimensional and underdeveloped. All the musical numbers are just forgettable sugary-autotuned-pop songs. There is no real commitment to any meaningful issue (discrimination, racism, animal cruelty, social gap). Why viewers seem to be so thrilled about the whole thing is beyond me.<br/><br/>So I strongly advice you: don't waste your time. Or if you decide to do so, at least be warned."
"mike48128","10","2","2","29 April 2020"," Zendaya is amazing!
","She is, as also noted by other critics, a true scene-stealer. The camera can't get enough of her! Incredibly beautiful and very talented. (Yes, Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron are excellent too.) Absolutely inaccurate as a biography of the true life of P.T. Barnum. He had 4 girls, not two. His museum was never called a ""circus"". His fortune was lost in a clock company venture, not by Jenny Lyn's concert tour, which made him a half-a-million dollars in profit. His first tent show was not in New York (city or state). A spellbinding-powerhouse of a musical from start to finish with incredible songs, production numbers, locations, set decorations, costumes, etc. Also a very financially-successful movie. Great family entertainment.<br/><br/>A great majority of the film is carried by the music. (If you dislike musicals as being ""unrealistic"" then this extravaganza is not for you. Everyone ""bursts"" into song.) For everyone else it is pure joy. The depiction of the oddities and performers is quite accurate and very well documented."
"councilmist","6","2","2","16 April 2020"," Madagascar 3 was better.
","I wanted to watch this movie after the great hype for it a while ago and finally got around to it.
First things first, I am disappointed and I somehow endured the strength to watch the entirety of the film.
The film jumps too quickly from event to event making it difficult to get invested into the story and characters. Within the first 20 minutes of the film we had watched Hugh Jackmans character fall in love, his dad pass away, grow into an adult, get married, have kids and buy a wax museum which turned into an extremely successful circus. Literally, all in a matter of minutes! This would have been so much more intriguing and feel more relatable if we were given a deep dive into the characters inner thoughts. This would've been a masterful idea if the entirety of the movie was of Hugh Jackmans characters struggle and the growth of his circus. Along with the growth of more characters where the audience can relate and feel empathy for them. This brings me to my next point:<br/><br/>While the focus was definitely on Hugh Jackmans character, we are given many other great characters who are just brushed over. We meet the wife, Zac Efrons character, Hugh Jackmans 'kids', the critic and all of the many interesting freaks. For example. For Zendayas character, all we really know about her is that she is a talented trapeze artist, she performs with her brother and she's black. Her relationship with Zac Efrons character takes a rather large portion in the film being a cause of difficulty for them both as their traditional society despises their love. This story concept was fantastic, yet wildly overdone. This could've been great though if we had learnt about each character in more detail and if the movie didn't have so many other plots overlaying!<br/><br/>Although, the film did have its downsides. The visuals were absolutely breathtaking and gave me goosebumps multiple occasions. Along with the brilliant performances by the stellar cast! Not just their acting, but the dancing, the singing. They nailed it all without a doubt.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is a high budget film and mainly directed towards children and their short attention span. They definitely win the competition for 'how many songs can we fit in 105 minutes.' I believe the film had definitely been overhyped, even by people my own age!
Considering that this is also based off a true historical figure, P T Barnum and his circus accomplishments (which I am now quite intrigued to look into I must say). They did do a really great job which I applaud them for.<br/><br/>Also, the end circus performance gave me Madagascar 3 vibes which I love!!! Lol"

","There's a scene in this movie where the ""theatre critic"" confronts Barnum and claims his ""circus"" lacks intelligence and class, and Barnum's response is ""Have you seriously forgotten how to have FUN at the theater? A theater critic who can't have fun at the theater is very sad.""<br/><br/>...or something along those lines. You really can't get any more on the nose than that - the critics who are panning this movie seem to have that exact problem. Sure it's not the smartest movie in the world, but it's a hell of a ride with some amazing performances across the board, the choreography is absolutely spectacular and if you have a beating heart you'll be smiling all the way through.

A musical is a story with musical interludes and this film had the musical interludes but no real story- you know- I didn't care about a single character, least of all Barnham.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, this may have come across better on stage, with real, live performances rather than a whole lot of auto-tune- the songs are ok but they all sound the same, like they are all different sections of the same song; crappy pop-tunes in falsetto- no substance, no 'real' voices like Moulin Rouge for example- at least that was actually Kidman and McGregor's singing voices.<br/><br/>Not great, won't stick in my memory at all- could have been so much more. I will most likely never watch again."

"cvizclanton","1","32","71","23 January 2018"," Let's be fair, mature and objective.
","People are calling this film a masterpiece, it's not. Let's break down this film's flaws objectively. <br/><br/>The hyperactive cinematography/film editing prevents us from getting any good looks at the choreography.<br/><br/>The CGI and visual effects are laughable (especially when compared to other 2017 releases such as Blade Runner 2049, War for the Planet of the Apes, The Shape of Water, and Wonder Woman).<br/><br/>The backdrops are never consistent, they sporadically change from sets, to painted backdrops, to obvious CGI backdrops. This choice is extremely distracting and looks unprofessional.<br/><br/>People are blatantly overlooking Barnum's many unlikable traits. He makes fun of his employees. He neglects his family. He lies to his family and friends. He has no respect for others. He's a conman. All of these traits are openly shown in the film, and to make it worse, none of the characters call him out on it. No lesson is learned, the audience is just manipulated by the pretty colors, and uplifting sounds of the soundtrack.<br/><br/>While the lyrical content is well written, the music does not match the time period, nor does the musical style line up with Jackman's usual singing style.<br/><br/>All of what I just wrote above is non refutable fact. Now, with all of that said, everyone is allowed to have their own opinion. If you love the movie, then great. Just don't call it a masterpiece because it's not. A more accurate statement would be ""It's one of my favorite films of all time."" Don't bash critics and other viewers, claiming that they don't know how to ""have fun"". This is giving into a horrible (and manipulative) message in the film to ostracize critics if they don't like what you like. That's childish. Simply disagree with the critics if you want and be mature about it."
"tcountry","4","14","27","12 August 2018"," Ehhhh.....could've been alot better if.....
","I'm going to make this review short and sweet. The actors here did their best to tell the story and sing the story of PT Barnum. My problem with this production is they used music from our time now (the style) for times that were happening in the late 1800's and early 1900's. Why not use period music? Totally didn't get that. Even when Jenny Lind sang... she was supposed to sing opera music...she sang a pop flavored ditty. The music did not work...at all.

"sideegg","2","14","27","11 April 2018"," Pretty Bad
","Saying that this movie is a terrible representation of the real P.T. Barnum is a huge understatement. It would be like if they made a movie about Robert E Lee treating his slaves like family. However, setting that aside, this movie is just bad. It's filled with tons of unintentionally funny moments that are supposed to be taken seriously. It fails to make me feel anything for these characters. I'd say the best scenes in this movie are the musical ones, and even then I only enjoyed one of these scenes out of the multiple the movie offers. The scenes themselves aren't that bad, but the music is such cold, calculated, paint-by-numbers garbage that I really can't fully enjoy any of them. The acting is pretty bad, mainly from the children and side characters. This movie did NOT ""bring back the musical"" and I wouldn't pay to see it again(or even at all, but I did so oh well)."
"lavatch","Null","10","18","26 April 2018"," Phineas Taylor Barnum and the Horatio Alger Myth
","In the bonus track of the DVD of ""The Greatest Showman,"" the director, who is a specialist in music videos, asserted that the music was ""the heart and soul of the film."" At the same time, he continued, ""we wanted it to feel classical."" Unfortunately, the musical score for this film did not have any sort of classical feel. It was purely contemporary music and rather uninspiring. In fact, all of the musical numbers tended to sound the same.<br/><br/>With Hugh Jackman, supported by a fine ensemble cast, the character interpretation of the promoter P. T. Barnum was engaging. The screenplay sought to unfold the nineteenth-century Horatio Alger myth of a little street urchin's rise to riches through industry and perseverance. But the self-made man theme became caught up in a personal drama of Barnum's insecurity as the son of the tailor, who never overcame his feeling of social inferiority.<br/><br/>The film took Barnum through various stages in his entrepreneurial career. <br/><br/>Stage #1 was the Barnum Museum of natural history that was a flop. Even Barnum's young daughter recognized that his museum was lifeless.<br/><br/>Stage #2 was his attempt at creating a ""curiosity"" show with a conglomeration of human ""oddities"" that he recruited. The filmmakers sought unconvincingly to turn Barnum's creative idea into the theme of diversity and the universal brotherhood of man.<br/><br/>Stage #3 included the legitimate acts that Barnum developed in his circus. It is not clear what the fictional playwright character Philip Carlyle contributed to this stage, other than to fall in love with the trapeze artist and give the film a romantic subplot.<br/><br/>Stage #4 was the time when Barnum sought to become ""artistic"" in producing a prestigious touring show starring Miss Jenny Lind (""The Swedish Nightingale""). This subplot was strained when Miss Lind, who felt a kinship with the insecure Barnum, implausibly cancelled her tour because, apparently, Barnum would not sleep with her. <br/><br/>Stage #5: The famed Barnum & Bailey tent show. <br/><br/>The film was unsuccessful in attempting to turn Barnum into a kind of Citizen Kane, wherein we are instructed into his lost ""Rosebud"" from his youth. The Barnum of this film is depicted as a kid with a dream, driven by the creative impulse that ""men suffer more from imagining too little than too much."" <br/><br/>The story of the historical P.T. Barnum is much more prosaic than the one depicted in this film. Barnum said famously that ""the noblest heart is that of making others happy."" Barnum's story was a uniquely American saga of a hustler, who tapped into the desires of Americans for entertainment and, more than anything, was motivated to make money....just like the hustlers who made this schlock film entitled ""The Greatest Showman""!"

","I originally had no desire to see this film. I mean, Zac Efron flailing around in a circus? Not my cup of tea. But absolutely everyone I talked to that had seen it told me it was ""sensational!"" So, I tried it...<br/><br/>One thing everyone agreed on was that it had amazing choreography. Let me tell you, Disney Channel films have better dance sequences! They try to create the illusion that the choreography is epic by hiding the truly simple dance moves behind elaborate set pieces and dozens of extras. The singing is also nothing special. The main problem is that although the film takes place in the 1800's, most of the musical numbers are worthy of recordings by Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber! That's part of the ""Magic of the Movies."" When a film is set in another time era, you get to be transported there and experience it. Also, Jenny Lind's catchy tune 'Never Enough' is masked as inspirational; it is actually about a spoiled brat that is basically never content.<br/><br/>Another flaw is that pretty much nothing in the movie happened in real life. But, if you are going to make it unrealistic, you might as well give it a heartfelt story. The writers almost achieved this in the very beginning, creating a blossoming friendship/romance between P.T. and his future wife, Charity. But as soon as the circus came along, their relationship was practically forgotten and it was all about Zac Efron. The movie would have been better if it focused more on Barnum's family life and the circus was a side story.<br/><br/>The only mildly talented cast member was Hugh Jackman, whose singing voice actually didn't make me want to scramble for earplugs, although my father kept asking when he would use his claws.<br/><br/>So, if you're wanting to see a truly beautiful and moving musical, I recommend 2012's 'Les Miserables.' As far as 'The Greatest Showman' is concerned, spare your eardrums from Keala Settle."

","I am not into musicals, it's not my favorite genre but i can find one enjoyable if it's not full singing and resembles a movie and not just theater.
The Greatest Showman is a combination of the two and it delivers exactly what it's supposed to. Entertainment. It entertains the audience in the movie and at the same time it entertains us.<br/><br/>The birth of the world of Showmanship appears difficult with high risk but also high reward. The struggles of visionary and ambitious mister Barnum seem pretty realistic. He does everything he can and goes all in to fullfill his dreams 
against all obstacles allong the way. The enemies are there, and they come in the shape of Fame, Envy, and most importantly Acceptance. As most people he would fall into the trap of fame getting in his head but as soon as he learns his 
lesson he will get out a bigger man. The Circus will bring together all kinds of people for the audience's pleasure. Sure, money and fame are involved but it's larger than that. It's a new kind of show that would only continue to grow in 
the future. <br/><br/>Jackman is passionate, Williams is emotional and Effron is cheerfull but also serious in a way we are not used to see him, without relying on his abs and obvious comedy. A great cast and total result in general by everyone involved, and a theme 
that pairs nicely with the music and singing.<br/><br/>A nice and positive-mood-bringing watch. ✍8/10"

","I went to see this film without having read anything about it. It's hard to do, but I like to, when possible, as it gives me no expectations towards it. Not such a good idea this time.
Loosely based on a real story, P. T. Barnum is someone who would describe himself as doing profitable philanthropy (spoiler n.1: this is absolutely not a thing). This shouldn't matter so much, as the movie does not claim to be telling his true story, but it goes on to present a freak show as a the greatest thing that has ever happened to those ""freaks"". Honestly people, how can you enjoy this?
One of the main actresses, Barnum's wife, feels like she came right out of an old movie. She only wants the love of Barnum (she literally says that!). Has no agency, very little lines or objectives beyond his love; that's how far her character is developed in the movie. The only black actor has maybe one line (kept waiting for it and it came almost at the end of the movie). Oh, and they use (an awful) CGI for general Tom thumbs (just needed to get this one out). I could go on, as I found myself cringing at more scenes than I thought possible, but I guess I'll leave some surprises for when you see the movie...
I know this is supposed to portray an ""older time"", but this was made in a very distasteful way, only repeating stereotypes and the same old mistakes, being borderline ridiculous. It only makes the movie feel dated and offensive. It was, personally, a very hard movie to sit through.
My surprise comes at the amount of good reviews this movies has received. I'm not here to tell you not to watch it, but it is beyond me to understand how some of the issues in this movie could have been overlooked by so many people.
The 2 stars go for the photography, which reminded me of a cheap version of moulin rouge in a couple of scenes, and because, although all the songs sound the same (and a lot like wrecking ball), they can be enjoyable, I guess."

What I should have seen was Zac Efron and thought ""Bad Neighbors"" and ""Baywatch"" and instantly walked in the opposite direction of the cinema. To say that I was disappointed with the film would be an understatement. I can name at least seven adjacent stories that take place during the film - each one on their own would be an interesting movie to watch - but to see such a string of storylines played out (each of them are literally wrapped up in minutes) mostly feels like I'm bingewatching any Disney Channel live action series. This is definitely where the film goes wrong. As the title of this review implies, it felt like a big-budget ""High School Musical"" on steroids. To be fair, I didn't expect this to be a big piece of art but I expected a beautiful film with proper entertainment value. It wasn't even that. If you don't believe me, watch the movie yourself - but you were warned! That's 2 h 19 mins you won't get back...

"The_Dman313","8","12","24","14 January 2018"," The Essence of P. T. Barnum
","From the beginning, cinema has always been about the magic of entertainment. Telling living stories, they are able portray events, moments, people, and show so many things that can never be seen anywhere else. This in essence was everything P.T. Barnum could have wished for.<br/><br/>Now, I'm writing this review mainly do to the recent divisiveness this movie created among critics (Look no further than the 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) with the main critique among them all being the portrayal of the main character himself P.T. Barnum. They claim the showman to be a watered down version of the real Barnum and say even more so that the film glosses over much of the real life events that show him to be a much more complicated figure, than seen in the movie. Now this is a fair critique, character is portrayal is one of the key aspects when making a biographical picture, but in this case I think a more cheerful watered down version may have benefited it. Now I hate to sound condensing, knowing that I am not a professional critic myself, but I feel many of whom have missed the point. Barnum would not have wanted a serious, 60 year old, dialogue heavy portrayal of himself, if anything he would have loved Hugh Jackman's performance. He's excitable, happy, energetic and just like his ideas you could even call him magical. Same with the rest of the characters (Many of whom did not exist in real life) like the Anne Wheeler, the trapeze artist played by Zendaya, who has to deal with racism along with bigotry do to a romance. She too is in love with performance and has the same magical quality to her. Characters like these capture the scope of Barnum's ideas along with the imagination. If portraying real life versions of some the characters the movie (As Barnum would have hated) would have become grounded in realism taking away much of the wonder that Barnum thought was necessary for entertainment. <br/><br/>
The movie also goes for a stylistic choreographed style seen in many musicals. This style is especially apparent during the musical numbers, full of lights, stunts dancing and complex camera movement. The movie looks great during these scenes and even when there isn't music or dancing it's still present by having great set design and mesmerizing colors. Everybody behind the scenes must have worked incredibly hard and it it really shows. This is movie reliant on these set pieces in which it definitely holds up. There is a part in the movie where someone tries to convince him that drama/plays are a definitive form of entertainment, in which (From what I remember) Barnum says something along the lines of ""Who would want to watch people talk for 2 hours"". Views such of these from Barnum is why I believe the filmmakers decided to make the movie such a flashy, cinematic, musical instead of a drama it could have easily been. This I believe captures what his shows meant and exactly the way Barnum would have wanted a adaptation such as this to be.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie did a great a great job capturing Barnum, not in sense of character, but more of sense of spirit and gives a grand cinematic retelling of his life. The movie is not perfect, it can be cliche at time and it's fast pacing can seem a bit sudden many times. However, this movie entertained me and memorized me many time and I would recommend a viewing (Especially while it still is in theaters). But be warned if you don't like musicals I doubt you'll like this."

","Watch watch watch... if you want to be fed with the pop music formula that doesn't provide any kind of art or subtlety. It's for those who love the predictable. Every song sounds the same. The film has been made for the masses that lack attention span and need to be spoon fed with musical diarrhoea."
"mukava991","Null","14","29","4 February 2018"," They meant well
","The creators of ""The Greatest Showman"" meant well - to give us an uplifting film about inclusiveness, loyalty, true love, high principles, spreading happiness and making dreams come true. They chose to flesh out these notions by distilling the multifaceted life of P.T. Barnum into a 105-minute musical, sort of an ""essence of Barnum"" or, as it turns out, ""Barnum Syrup."" Sometimes their abridgments work splendidly as cinema, as in the early song-and-dance sequence that takes us from Barnum's childhood in rags to shipping clerk in business suit. At other times they asphyxiate us with musically inert anthems of victimhood or declarations of pride. Not one song is memorable. Some are okay while they're being sung, helped by swooping camera movement, acrobatic choreography and some excellent vocals, but you won't be humming them on the way home. Some are cringe-inducing, particularly the weirdly misconceived presentation of the famous Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, whom Barnum famously made even more famous by bringing her to America. For one thing, she is played by Rebecca Ferguson who despite being half Swedish speaks with a British accent even though the script clearly points out that she is Swedish. For another thing, the song she sings to an enraptured crowd of New York society swells is dreary, monotonous early 21st-century power-pop. If you're going to ignore historical context, even musically (as did the execrable ""Moulin Rouge"" in 2001), at least give the audience some indication of Lind's actual appeal (a vocal purity, as legend has it, but definitely not belting and other pyrotechnics). <br/><br/>Regarding historical context, it goes without saying that the scenario ignores every 19th century reality except, to some degree, sets, costumes and of course the social and racial prejudices of the time, but only to score identity politics points. Of course, with writers like Jenny Bicks (very much at home in the 1990's world of ""Sex and the City"") and Bill Condon (whose uneven depiction of James Whale in ""Gods and Monsters"" was made bearable by Ian MacKellan's inspired acting and whose ""Kinsey"" was a bore) you're not going to get much of a feel for past eras.<br/><br/>The score by the ""La La Land"" team of Justin Paul and Benj Pasek is almost entirely forgettable. The previous film had one catchy tune (""City of Stars""). The music here is boilerplate, the lyrics only very occasionally above banal (if you can hear them; most of the songs begin clearly and softly and intimately but quickly expand into heavily orchestrated extravaganzas which mask the paltry musical and lyrical substance).<br/><br/>As for casting, you can hardly miss with the charismatic and multi-talented Hugh Jackman. Michelle Williams as his wife is largely wasted and gets stuck with some of the most embarrassingly obvious dialogue. Zac Ephron, who seems to be thickening in his middle age, plays an invented character, a high-society playwright who is miserable and empty until he teams up with Barnum, exchanges the pen for the emcee's baton and falls in love with an African-American trapeze artist (Zendaya).<br/><br/>The film is reminiscent of some of the low-budget, episodic but energetic biopics that rolled off the Hollywood assembly line in the 1930s except here the spending is lavish and the song-and-dance sequences, which at their best advance the narrative rather than overstate the obvious, are eye-poppingly elaborate. There seems to be a deliberate attempt to recapture the sentimentalism and syrupiness that was commonplace in many old-time movies, but mixed with the 21st century mindset of the writers and director, it becomes self-parody.<br/><br/>The main message seems to be the old reliable one: love is the most important thing of all, even more important than material success and it's better to put love first, and that we all, no matter what we look like or where we come from, are valuable individuals worthy of respect."

","The Greatest Showman is a celebrative film about P. T.

Along the way, as a side line to the story he tackles and crosses the boundary of social and cultural snobbery with himself becoming victimized for a brief moment in his chase to social climbing. The film comes as an upbeat musical that never dwells too deeply into the sociology of class distinction and the acceptance of society's outcasts by the norm. Instead it brings together in my mind the best evocation of ""Moulin Rouge"" in terms of its music which is footstompingly good. The music is boisterous, melodic, assertive and full of life that makes you want to stand up and join the dancing chorus on screen. The other thing it evokes is cirque du soleil. This association is more personal because they both excites me with imagination and beyond of what an ordinary circus is about."

","Where do I even start. I'm not even a movie critic, but this is the first time I've left a cinema feeling insulted at how frustratingly terrible a movie is. I was so excited to see this, especially after seeing La La Land, I honestly thought this would be better, since I liked some of the songs and the cast of this movie are much more musically talented. But this movie is nothing. There are too many clashing plot lines, the choreography is either too distracting from the music or CGI-altered and sped up, the cinematography was OK but did not tie into the structure of the movie one bit, making it seem extremely pretentious. The characters were so inconsitent that Tommy Wiseau could have done a better job at writing them up. I fail to understand how this is a biographical movie. I know nothing about P.T. Barnum at all and everybody was moaning about historical inaccuracies, which I haven't researched at all, but the conflict was some of the most cliched and forced I have ever seen, so even then I could see right through this aspect and agree with the critics on, as it was reminiscent more of Eastenders than Evita. The music was OK, nothing special but I'd probably put the soundtrack on whilst in the kitchen or something and hum along. The movie kept doing the hack musical movie thing where it alluded to classic musicals to try and get nostalgic tingles or something, which La La Land mastered perfectly, but the difference here wasthat it had no point or connection to the story, and was so blatantly obvious that I just kept rolling my eyes. The performers were all very talented, but their talents were just wasted through lack of direction and characterisation. I still don't know anybody's name, except for P.T. Barnum and Charity (and that was only because my friend laughed at how stupid that name was the minute it was mentioned). I mean don't get me wrong, I can see why people enjoy this film and I really have no problem if people do. But I'm actually baffled, and seeing so many people defending this trash is seriously starting to do my head in. It's not revolutionary at all. In terms of movie-making there are countless modern musical movies such as Chicago, La La Land, Moulin Rouge and Hairspray that will offer you everything this movie does and more - a consistent story, believable characters, comedy, charm, a variety of structured and well-performed songs that don't all sound the same, incredible choreography and stunning cinematography. Cult musicals like Mamma Mia, Rocky Horror and High School Musical offer you a feel-good time, more so than this. At least they can be ironically appreciated. This movie is just terrible, and I don't even care enough to conclude this review because I'm so fed up of talking about it."

So now comes a chance where P.T. can finally prove that he's more than just some dirt kid from the street, he opens up a circus spectacle that became a big sensation but his ambitions and his desperate need for approval makes him unable to see the joy and happiness that are already there right in front of him.<br/><br/>First of all, what you need to know is that this is not a straight up biopic of the actual P.T. Barnum because the actual P.T. Barnum had his controversies. So what THE GREATEST SHOWMAN basically does is take the character P.T. Barnum and put a spin on his story, including his touring with opera singer, Jenny Lind. Zac Efron and Zendaya's roles are that of a young love but their subplot also ties nicely with the drama of Hugh Jackman and Michelle William's characters. <br/><br/>And I freakin 'love all the songs featured in this film, I have the soundtrack by the way and I kept listening to it for hours on end, put them on repeat and listen to them again the next day. So addictive. Written by the same songwriting team behind ""La La Land"" but I must say that ""The Greatest Showman"" songs are way better, they stay in your head for days. Kudos on the dance choreographies too, everything about this film's music is so in sync harmoniously, the songs match what is going on at that moment in the story, they compliment the characters' emotions. Another thing that you need to know is that even though the story is set in the '1800s, the music is not meant to sound like it comes from that era, the style is more contemporary or hip-hop, it's meant to give you that grand majestic impression, more like Las Vegas rather than Broadway, if that comparison helps.<br/><br/>This of course is not Hugh Jackman's first rodeo in the world of musical, Zac Efron and Zendaya are talented in that department too, so what you have here is a group of talents that are highly skilled at dazzling you with their moves and vocal chords, it helps that easy on the eyes as well. Jackman in particular has that bravado presence about him. But don't be mistaken, this is not some Oscar worthy achievement ala Les Miserables, although.. if it does get nominated, it deserves to be recognized for at least the costumes and the production design, but THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is all about entertaining you with bright colors and it's all about making your foot tap while at the same time celebrating entrepreneurial spirit and celebrating diversity which are something I can definitely relate to. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is charming, it's uplifting, it makes you smile, it's a great way to end the year on a high note.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"

"2001ASOfan","10","16","35","21 December 2017"," If you love musicals like I do, this is Heaven--UPDATED 12/23/17
","Just got home from seeing an opening night showing of ""The Greatest Showman,"" perfectly presented on a big, bright, sharply-focused CinemaScope-masked screen with a great sound system, and this is one of those breathtaking films that uses every wide-screen inch in a glorious way, for the full running time of the film. I've not been this completely, instantly smitten with a film musical since Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" all those years ago--it's that inventive and, thankfully, as exhilarating and as much, or maybe even more, fun (hmm...guess I'll have to go see it again this week just to see whether it is more fun than ""Rouge"" was--that will be my excuse for seeing this at least one more time while it's still on the big screen!). Frankly, I'd put ""Greatest Showman"" not only up there with ""Rouge""--it was also as fun, touching, and downright unabashedly sentimental (in a very good way) as my favorite musical of all time, ""Singin' in the Rain."" And I don't say that lightly. There is unrestrained, uplifting passion and joy in this film, and we as the audience are heartily invited to join in. It has been a long (long!) time since I have enjoyed every song in a new, original musical score on first listen, and the energy and sheer magic of how the choreography was filmed for this production will be a fascinating study all to itself. I actually involuntarily gasped a few times from the inventiveness of the camera work and just how well it captured the swirling, dizzying flow of the dancing--and I am very aware of just how difficult filming great choreography can be. One quick example: There is a song and dance number that takes place in a bar (featuring Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron and one very nimble bartender) which had me holding my breath without realizing it until it was over, when I suddenly realized my mouth was hanging open and it was time for me to breathe again. While that was a highlight, it's genuinely just one of many. At film's end, my best friend and I broke into spontaneous applause, and we were thrilled to hear the audience around us doing the same. There will no doubt be some cranky, joyless critics who will hate it (which is actually an amusing subplot in the film itself), and those who don't like musicals because ""people just aren't supposed to break out into song in a movie"" will likely not be fans, either, but wow, for those of us that feel like there are way too few great musicals onscreen anymore, this is Heaven on Earth. I truly cannot wait to see it again. / UPDATE 12/23/17: Saw it again last night, only two days after my opening-day viewing, again with my best friend, and we both agreed it was even better the second time around. We noticed subtleties and touches we hadn't noticed in the first dazzling (and overwhelming) viewing, and are both now even more hooked on the soundtrack as well--I just bought it for that same best friend as a Christmas gift, along with a book about the making of the film. I truly am, well, unabashedly in love with this film, and will be seeing it yet again as soon as I can. What a perfect Holiday-time gift from the filmmakers and performers for musical fans and moviegoers!"

","There is a lot this movie could have been. It could have been a revealing commentary on acceptance of those outcast from society. It could have shown us how a society's obsession with the strange and different keeps us from seeing people's actual humanity and autonomy. It could have been a strong criticism of the desire to profit off of other's misfortunes. It also could have been something other than boring, mindless entertainment.<br/><br/>Yes, this is boring, mindless entertainment during which you could be gossiping on your phones without having to worry about missing anything at all. After all, once you've heard one song, you've pretty much heard all of them. And there's so many of them. To estimate, this movie is 75% (at least) contemporary pop anthems. I was often left wondering, as I sat through another awful song that I sometimes muted, why there was a story at all. Why not just turn it into a youtube music video playlist instead?<br/><br/>What little story there was in this movie is barely worth mentioning. I suppose it tried, emphasis on the word 'tried', to contain a moral about how you shouldn't ignore the people who matter a lot to you. But I was never convinced that the Barnum of the story (let alone the actual, historical Barnum!) ever cared about the members of his show to begin with. It was all about making money and elevating his own status in society. Any display of care towards his show people seemed fake and manipulative at best. <br/><br/>If you want mindless, boring entertainment that won't distract you from writing emails, making dinner, or doing doctoral level theoretical math while playing hopscotch, this movie could very well be for you. If, however, you want to pay attention to something, I recommend not paying attention to this. Sitting in an empty room with white walls might be more worthwhile.<br/><br/>(And really? You have a famous opera singer of the time singing a song that sounds like an awful, awful imitation of something by Adele? And the 19th century cultural elite of NYC just happens to jump up in applause to this?)"

On leaving I said 'this time next week we see that one again'. That movie is the best movie I have ever seen and believe me I have seen a lot. Interesting the movies the critics love are absolute snoozefests and they criticize this one? Its not meant to be accurate to the real story or the opera singer would have been singing opera and the songs wouldn't be modern. What an absolute delight this movie was.

","The story of PT Barnum, famous for founding Barnum and Bailey Circus and revolutionising entertainment.<br/><br/>Much style, little substance. Some of this is to be expected, as you can't have a movie on a showman extraordinaire and one of the most significant figures in entertainment history without a large amount of pizzazz.<br/><br/>However, the movie doesn't really give us much of Barnum's history or motivations. The main focus seems to be on cramming as many song and dance numbers into the movie as possible, at the expense of any plot. For every minute of plot or character development you have four minutes of musical numbers.<br/><br/>To crown it all, the music is poor and irritating. Every musical number sounds like something from a made-for-kids animated Disney movie, rather than a biopic. The movie is set in the mid-1800s yet we have ultra-contemporary numbers. It is quite jarring and negates any semblance of historical accuracy, credibility or substance."

"zkonedog","7","3","4","21 September 2018"," A Unique Presentation Befitting Barnum Himself
","The success of ""La La Land"" opened Hollywood up to the musical again, and ""The Greatest Showman"" is able to take full advantage. While traditionally the story of P.T. Barnum would be told as a biopic, here it is given a flourish that perhaps the old ringmaster himself would appreciate.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Greatest Showman"" tells the story of how P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) built his circus empire. This was largely accomplished by using ""freaks"" (bearded lady, dog-faced boy, etc.) to draw curiosity to his museum and later shows. Though initially deemed as catering to the ""lowest common denominator"", Barnum's shows eventually won over the hearts of people (especially children) around the world. Also focused on in this flick is Barnum's marriage to Charity (Michelle Williams) and partnership with Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron).<br/><br/>By positioning itself in the way that it does, ""Greatest Showman"" only deflects any criticism that can be thrown at it. Not entirely indicative of Barnum's life? The man himself would revel in the drama! Too over-the-top or schmaltzy? Have you ever been to the circus?! In this sense, the film is practically immune to harsh takes.<br/><br/>In terms of execution, the music is wonderful and the visuals are stunning and always offering something new. The tone is a good mix between relentless energy, but also being able to slow down and appreciate the softer moments when needed. The ability to accomplish this makes for high emotion with every song.<br/><br/>The cast is about as diverse as a circus show itself, what with the eclectic mix of Jackman, Williams Efron, Zendaya, & Rebecca Ferguson. They all perform very well and create a great chemistry on the screen.<br/><br/>Personally, ""Greatest Showman"" will never be among my favorite films of all-time. I actually prefer a more straightforward, character-drama biopic approach. However, I can very easily see the appeal of the musical tact here, and enjoyed it enjoy to be thoroughly entertained. If you are more open to this crazier approach than I, the star ranking will likely tick even higher."
"sleemon","2","12","25","22 January 2018"," The Critics are Right! Quelle Dreck!
","I see about a hundred movies a year, and this is the first one I have walked out on in recent memory. Rather than ""magical"" I found the songs to be mediocre and so repetitive that I wanted to tear my hair out. Singing ""A million dreams is all it's gonna take"" over and over and over again is no substitute for a plot. I left the second time I saw the same collection of ""human oddities"" performing what seemed to be the exact same out-of-place modern song and dance routine for the second time in a circus ring, to the delight of an audience dressed in period costume, but rocking out like no 19th century audience ever had.<br/><br/>It's not that I'm not totally averse to modern song and dance in a story that takes place in the 19th century. I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, a movie whose anachronistic music seemed jarring in 2001. But although that movie wasn't exactly ""Citizen Kane"", at least it had Nicole Kidman to look at. <br/><br/>It may be that I know a bit too much about American history to let all the absurd inaccuracies past. Maybe the audience that loved this movie had no idea that Jenny Lind was an opera singer, not a contestant on ""The Voice."" Maybe they had no idea that she was a philanthropist who gave away the vast sums she earned to her favorite charities, not a hootchie momma homewrecker. Maybe they have no idea that Barnum lured his ""human oddities"" to his shows with the promise of steady pay and not human dignity. Or maybe they just have never seen any of the classic movie musicals with songs with witty, memorable lyrics."

","""Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature, and best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed."" Phineas Taylor Barnum, best known today as simply P.T. Barnum, was born in 1810 in Bethel, Connecticut. In his early 20s, Barnum was a small business owner and founder of a weekly newspaper. He moved to New York in 1934 where his entertainment career began when he purchased Scudder's American Museum that he renamed after himself and transformed into a ""freak show"" playing on human curiosity with features like the Feejee mermaid and General Tom Thumb. Later in life, Barnum returned to Connecticut where he served as Mayor in 1875. He was an author, publisher, politician, businessman, and philanthropist, but is best remembered for his showmanship. It is that achievement that has inspired the new musical The Greatest Showman starring Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum.<br/><br/>If you have read any of my previous Previews or Reviews for films based on actual events or people, I have given up on doing too much research beforehand as the movies often take many creative liberties with regards to the timeline of events, the location of events, characters involved, roles they played, and more. And they have every right to do so as the films make no claims to be historically accurate or documentaries. The Greatest Showman is based on the life of P.T. Barnum, specifically in regards to his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus dubbed The Greatest Show on Earth.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman tackles the title role of Barnum and he is no stranger to singing on stage or in film. Jackman grew up a theatre performer in Australia including musicals. The world was exposed to his singing abilities in 2012 with his role as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables, a performance that earned him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. Jackman received both praise and criticism for his vocal performance. I was one of the critics asking the question ""Were you impressed with the performances in Les Miserables because you wouldn't expect Wolverine and Gladiator to be able to sing like that, or did you really think they gave the performances you would expect if you had paid $500 to watch this on Broadway?"" Jackman has already been nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in The Greatest Showman and I enjoyed his singing as Barnum more than I liked his Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.<br/><br/>Zac Efron's leading man roles in his career to date have been campy, goofy and sophomoric starring in such movies as Neighbors 1 and 2, Dirty Grandpa, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, and Baywatch. He is slated to play a completely opposite role as Ted Bundy in a film titled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile that could really reshape his career and propel him to a much higher platform possibly opening many more ""meaty"" roles for the young actor. His performance in The Greatest Showman was definitely a huge step in the right direction to separate him as more than just the goofball in crude comedies.<br/><br/>Last year, when La La Land came out, I said we were long overdue for a new musical and La La Land was hopefully the first of many. Songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul took home the Oscar for Original Song with their creation of ""City of Stars"" from La La Land. They're back and have written the original music for The Greatest Showman and I would be surprised if they didn't get at least one more Oscar nomination this year as it was the music that really stole the show. The Greatest Showman features a modern pop feel as team Pasek and Paul did not confine themselves to the 1830's when the film is set. It was a risk, but a risk that paid off. If they tried to fit the songs to the era of the film, I don't think this movie would have worked at all.<br/><br/>I was excited for The Greatest Showman and had high expectations. I gave a 4.5 Star Prediction as I anticipated thoroughly enjoying Jackman and Efron's performances along with co-stars Michelle Williams and Zendaya, the music, and the spectacle from director Michael Gracey who literally made his big screen debut. He's so green, he doesn't even have a completed biography on IMDB. I had a feeling this would just the beginning for Gracey after a hugely successful Greatest Showman. I thought this movie was sweet, charming, electric, exciting, fun, and sensitive. However, I felt it should have been about 20 minutes longer than its 1 hour and 44 minute running time. Barnum didn't come from anything at all and swept his wife away from a lavish, wealthy lifestyle. She didn't care about the money. Their apartment had a leaky roof and no frills at all, but she and their two daughters were happy. After losing another job, Barnum took a risk and convinced a bank to loan him $10,000 so he could purchase a macabre wax museum figuring that human's morbid curiosity would draw them in. His daughters pointed out that it wasn't enough. He needed live spectacles. He agreed and searched for the outcasts, the freaks. He found his Tom Thumb, a bearded lady, the World's Fattest Man, the Irish Giant, the acrobat brother and sister, and many more. And it worked. People lined up and shows were sold out to see something no one had ever seen before.<br/><br/>Barnum teamed up with the legitimate theatre producer Phillip Carlyle (Efron) to raise their show to the next level. It takes some convincing but Carlyle gets on board and it isn't long before their entire troop gets an audience with the British Queen. It's there that I feel the movie started rushing things. Providing a better life, a bigger home, ballet lessons, fancy clothes soon wasn't enough for Barnum. He became obsessed with people's opinions about how he obtained his wealth. In England, they meet famed European opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) and convince her to tour the United States as promoted by Barnum. At her first performance, Barnum became infatuated with the ""legitimate"" adulation she received and started hiding his band of freaks to the shadows. It is Carlyle who first questioned Barnum, though he himself wasn't ready to be fully associated with them. His inner conflict was growing, however, as he had fallen in love with acrobat Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). <br/><br/>Barnum quite abruptly abandoned his circus as Carlyle abruptly became an outcast to his family and his upper crust associates as he fully embraced his new family in Barnum's absence. Almost as quickly as Barnum threw the origins of his success aside, he flipped a 180 and left Lind to finish her American tour without him so he could return to his wife, his children and his circus family. Local protestors threatened to permanently end their dream, but Carlyle's investments saved the day and the show went on. <br/><br/>I really only had two big issues with The Greatest Showman. As described above, the flip-flopping of allegiance of both Barnum and Carlyle could have used a little more time in the film to develop and transition. The second was the character of Tom Thumb as played by actor Sam Humphrey, an Australian actor with a skeletal disorder that keeps the 22-year-old actor at a height of 4'3"" tall. But that wasn't short enough for the film as they digitally shortened his legs by what appears to be 6 to 8 inches. The problem is that you can tell he was digitally altered in every full-body shot he is in. He is also obviously missing from some wider shot scenes, when he should be in them. During the number ""This is me"", the cast of freaks are out in the public streets all performing together. He is there during close-up scenes, but when the camera pulls out, he is noticeably absent.<br/><br/>Other than that, the songs really made this show a spectacle and truly entertaining. It starts with an anthemic performance by Hugh Jackman of the show's opening song ""The Greatest Show"" that has a similar feel to Queen's ""We Will Rock You"". Efron and Jackman were the perfect pair in their duet in the bar as they sang ""The Other Side"". Efron had a very heart-felt, sweet, sincere, beautiful duet with Zendaya as they battled with their feelings for each other as they sang ""Rewrite the Stars"". And the Bearded Lady Lettie Lutz (Keala Settle) led the cast of the circus in a triumphant singing of ""This is Me"". While the movie sold itself short in it's character and story execution, a shortcoming that really could have been fixed easily with about 20 minutes more, it more than redeemed those downfalls with some amazing original music that should get a couple Oscar nominations and probably one of them taking home the trophy. So, I predicted 4.5 stars for The Greatest Showman, I'm going to lower it just slightly to 4.0 Stars. It was definitely worth the money in the theatre, I'd see it again, and I'll be owning this once it comes out."

","Even after seeing the overblown mess that is THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, I still can't believe they bother to make this. Dawning the promotional tagline ""from the same lyricists of LA LA LAND"", this years hot new musical feels slap-dashed, scrambled, and razzle-dazzled together in order to cynically profit off its success with embarrassing results. It's the type of year-end crowd-pleaser that talks your ear out about following your dreams and forget the haters, yet is also so obnoxiously over-the-top yet thoroughly forgettable it almost tunes itself out. It's like if HAMILTON was remade for the Disney Channel.<br/><br/>It stars Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum as he goes through the ""Started From The Bottom"" routine and turn from a poor apprentice into the worlds most famous entertainers. He falls in love with Charity to her fathers disapproval, but prevails because true love. He then gets stuck in a low-end job that gets bankrupt, to which he gets inspired to create a museum full of larger-than-life characters. He then gets the extra endorsement from Zac Efron as a playwright who falls in love with one of the performers played by Zendaya. Then he suddenly gets bitter after a dispute with his troupe and his wife after he discovers that he wants more, which suddenly leads to big consequences. Then they get back together through a sing and dance number. <br/><br/>Jumping Jesus, that's a lot of story. The whole thing has too much both onscreen and on paper that it suddenly became nauseating. Penned by Bill Condon in his second forgettable musical this year, it has the usual crap pacing, wasted opportunities, at least half a dozen arcs and cliches, and subplots left on the cutting room floor. It constantly blows over predictable storybeats through break-neck speed that you start to wonder what the fuck is going on. On top of that, commercial director Michael Gracey adds a whole bunch of calculated splendor - even in scenes where they're just talking - to this garbage screenplay in order to fool you into its supposed majesty. To me, I just got tuned out after the third time they sing.<br/><br/>Speaking of things overproduced, I've never heard anything so needlessly bombastic as that soundtrack. Along with the aforementioned visual eye rape, each music number sounds like it really thinks the movie is some transporting adventure. It really just sounds like they took that opening song from HAMILTON and copied the same swooning violin and blaring percussion in every goddamn song. Even in scenes where it calls for a moody, somber treatment instead feels like we're fighting in the Battle in Narnia. I just wanted to tell these guys to dial it the fuck down. <br/><br/>And then there's Barnum himself. It's admittedly nice to see Jackman shine in a happier role after LOGAN, but this is just a thinly written character. Glossing over the more nitty-gritty aspects of the historical figure, Barnum trudges along the same familiar beats of first being a starry-eyed optimistic to flat-out dickhead in the end. Even the shambling script leaves him no real footing to his arcs, leaving Jackman all dewey-eyed through numerous pitfalls and successes that mean nothing.<br/><br/>If the film offered me a glimmer of hope, it's when we're introduced to the ""acts"" themselves. Even at first seems exploitative to their appearances, these larger-than-life misfits look like they're packed with hidden stories and aspirations of their own. During one scene in which they sing in defiance against their oppressors, I almost leaped with joy... until it suddenly cuts to the same damn music template, in which I felt pissed again. For a movie about finding humanity in unusual places and finding your place, it's saddening to see these characters pushed aside for butthole Barnum and his stupid white people problems. I'd rather watch these guys again.<br/><br/>A common criticism about last years rapturous LA LA LAND was that it was all glam but no depth. Even if I'd agree that most people - like me admittedly - overrate this movie to kingdom come, there's a certain charm, effort, and specificity to LA LA LAND that made it sing more clearly than this movie ever can. Imagine if LA LA LAND was like a smooth, adventurous melody while SHOWMAN was like what if your 5-year-old son fumbles with your keyboard set.<br/><br/>Like any crummy movie, though, it tries to excuse itself by being for the fans and not the dreary critics. In one scene, a critic meets Barnum and states that the show is little more than smoke and mirrors, to which Jackman remarks by highlighting how much smiles he makes by the audience. As glib as that sounds, I couldn't help but agree. In many ways, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is like the latest pop music that the current generation won't shut up over; its loud, repetitive, incomprehensible, and packed with a heavy-handed message to make you think it's more important that it really is. <br/><br/> But hey! Give it a month, and you'll get tired of it and forget it even exists."

","This movie is pretty good. The storytelling is mediocre at best, but where this movie shines is the visuals and music. With the talented songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dear Evan Hansen, La La Land) and Alex Lacamoire (Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen) behind the wheel on the musical front, every single song in the movie is a blast to listen to. The visuals are also well thought out, and while a lot of it is obviously computer generated, it doesn't detract from thee viewing experience too much. This may not be a great movie, but it sure is an entertaining one. Some of the most fun I've had in the theater all year."
"Mike_Devine","7","10","21","8 April 2018"," A show for the ages - and all ages
","As cinematic musicals experience a sort of renaissance, it can't be expected that every film will be equally beloved by critics and audiences alike. 'The Greatest Showman' is a prime example of this.<br/><br/>The conflicted, unorthodox life story of one of this country's most prolific entertainers - P.T. Barnum - is set against a full soundtrack of rising numbers featuring full choruses and classic-meets-new age music. While the public - including families - more or less fell in love with this ensemble, leading to an over-performance at the box office, the Rotten Tomatoes crowd were less impressed.<br/><br/>For one, 'Showman' features an identifiable pop culture icon (Barnum), bankable stars (Jackman, Efron, Williams, Zendaya) and catchy songs written by the same cast of characters responsible for the music in another crowd-pleaser, 'La La Land.' All of these elements make a film that can connect with audiences unlike more sophisticated, elaborate films. Sure, it can be argued that Barnum's life is simplified to the point that it almost feels as trivial as the beard on Keala Settle's bearded woman. But this isn't intended to be a biographical drama.<br/><br/>Again, it's the music the is the glue that holds 'Showman' together. Kicking off with the energetic 'The Greatest Show' and ending on the rousing finale of 'From Now On,' there are plenty of hits in here that are enough to keep audiences humming along long after the curtains close. Perhaps the standout, though, is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of the operatic vocalist Jenny Lind, who's voiced by Loren Allred on the power ballad ""Never Enough,"" which is sure to become a classic to be sung in singing competitions all over the world.<br/><br/>Sure, 'The Greatest Showman' is a bit cheesy at times, and would be a shell of itself if it was not a musical. But the final result stands on its own as an impressive, memorable entry in the 20th Century Fox catalogue."

","I laughed, I cried, I smiled the entire time, and I haven't stopped listening to the soundtrack since then. I was excited about this movie since I first saw the trailer, but after reading the reviews, I was worried it would be a waste. NOPE. It's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time. Within the first ten seconds of the opening scene, I knew I had a new favorite movie. It's definitely a musical, and my undying love for all things Hugh Jackman of course made me enjoy it even more. The cast is so talented. There is so much chemistry between Zac Efron and Zendaya. The music was so catchy, modern, and just GOOD. Most of the negative reviews focus on it's disparity with the real story of PT Barnum. Granted, he was the worst, but this is not ""based on a true story"" but ""based on the imagination of PT Barnum"". They also complain about it lacking depth or realism. Come on, guys. Can we not enjoy happy entertainment now? The movie's message is about acceptance and embracing what makes you unique. I encourage you to do the same for the movie: accept it for what it is, let it carry you away for two hours, and then let the songs get stuck in your head for DAYS."

Some of the scenes could be the best with dancing and special sounds created by the glass, wood and chairs - which is rarely found in other musicals.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies that can make me so impressed and sit on the chair to watch the entire credit scene because I just don't want to leave the cinema so early.<br/><br/>The box office may be a bit disappointed due to reputation or the film type. But I am sure a good product will have good results. This movie is perfect for children and family to watch and enjoy.

It seemed to take a long time for their to be any major conflict in the film, and the ultimate problem never occurred until the last act. I related the film very much to a stage musical, both in structure and content, it was build build build positively for more than half the film, then a brief problem was quickly resolved towards the ending. <br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film, as I said I couldn't stop smiling.

I kept waiting for the introduction of ""Bailey"" which never happened. It was just impossible to follow.<br/><br/>The little colonel, the bearded lady, the fat person, and all added some color, but holy mackerel Sapphire, so *hard* to follow with all the earsplitting dance moves. <br/><br/>I have to admit that musicals are not my favorite genre (actually, if I had know this was a musical I would have passed). Does this review contain a spoiler? What's to spoil?"
"abbiekline","9","18","44","21 December 2017"," The Greatest Movie
","This film was almost indescribable. This is a movie that raises your pulse and leads you to tap your feet, bob your head, mouth your new favorite song and even silently clap at the end of a Broadway-worthy performance. From the first few seconds of the opening scene, I was hooked. Hugh Jackman is a true star, and this film does not let the audience forget it. The taps of his foot and the ease of his movements, combined with his charismatic voice and dapper appearance, are almost mesmerizing. Zac Efron has the same effect on the audience, appealing especially to viewers under 30, and adds a likeability Bring in the rest of the circus squad, as well as the fun dancing of, yes, even Barnum's young daughters, and the film makes a viewer want to get up and dance. If I am being honest, I came home from the showing, found ""The Greatest Show"" and ""This is Me"" on Spotify, and attempted to recreate the dance pieces in my room. The music runs through your body and gives rhythm to the rhythmless. 
The music and dance are not the only parts of the show to be applauded; the storyline and delivery are gripping and memorable. Based on a true story, this film transports the audience into a time that is so distant and almost forgotten, but pulls on the heart and reminds viewers of the hardships of our predecessors and the ingenuity required to rise up from the bottom. This film is inspiring, aggravating, tear-jerking, passionate, and full of wonder. 
I could not help but have a smile on my face during most of the performances, sit on the edge of my seat during many scenes, and route for the good guys through it all. 
If you are looking to end your year with a BANG and find a new favorite movie for the next year, go out and watch The Greatest Movie. It is quite a show."

","""The Greatest Showman"" is a highly entertaining musical based on highlights of the life of the American entertainer P.T. Barnum, but never in his biography. The dramatization, art direction, cast and the choreography are excellent and the result may be not what the ""professional critics"" expect to see (like the snobbish character in the film), but certainly will be very pleasant for the audiences where I include myself.

Hugh Jackman shook free of his ""Wolverine"" association with his breathtaking performance with such ease, it'd make both Daniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood green with envy.
Best known for angrily shouting and tearing people limb from limb, Hugh Jackman proved he's far more than a single character actor, emitting such a joyful smile onscreen that it was impossible NOT to smile back at him. 
While the critics poke at the historical accuracy and attempt to pick apart the plot and choreography, I for one was enthralled with this excellent production. 
This movie was designed to entertain, dazzle, and bring smiles to the viewers, and that's EXACTLY what this movie did."

(Note: I've NEVER seen a movie more than once in theaters before!) My 23 year old brother said this was one of top 3 movies he's seen in his life and he's not a huge fan of musicals, and one of only two movies he's gotten a tear from. It's a beautiful movie in every way and extremely well made! The choreography is great, the dancing is phenomenal, everyone's voices were incredible and the story was extremely inspirational!<br/><br/>Yes, there were some things I didn't like about the movie, like how they twisted the story of the Swedish nightingale Jenny Lind (maybe I got offended by that because I'm from Sweden, haha) but even though it wasn't all true it did make for good screen time and that's also important in movies, so I'm OK with them changing certain things from the real story to make a good movie and musical on screen!<br/><br/>After having had really high expectations for only to get really disappointed by La La Land last year, it was amazing to be able to see a truly good musical on screen again!

I did not go to this film because I thought it would be oscar worthy. I went to be entertained. 
I was more than entertained. I became entangled. I was involved. I was enthralled. I will watch this move again and again. I loved the journey it took me on. It also had several great lessons to it along the way. Lessons that society would do well to grasp themselves.

","The Greatest Showman is one of the worst movies of 2017, it sloppy, and stupid. The movie takes no time to develop the characters, it thinks it's so grand and heartwarming when really it's just plain bad. The visuals are terrible as well. The songs are catchy, but get annoying after a while because they all say the same thing. The songs feel so fake though, they feel like they've gone through a billion machines to make the voices sound better. The dance scenes are cool, but it's nothing compared to La La Land. La La Land takes it's time with the characters, the romance and the story, it moves along perfectly, not too fast, not too slow. This movie skips over everything important just so it can make you feel good about yourself. I understand how typical movie goers can enjoy this, if you haven't seen a lot of movies and don't go to the movies as often as I do I can see why you can like it.

","Hugh Jackman is as complete a package as you can get in Hollywood. Not only can he dance, sing and act, but he also possesses levels of nice-guy charisma most A-listers can only dream of. It's no shock then that this glitzy musical employs him to play the eponymous circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, an ambitious dreamer who pushes social boundaries to deliver a theatrical extravaganza others couldn't even imagine. Centring around Barnum's use of outcasts and ""oddities"" to draw in crowds, the film has a quirky edge to its otherwise mainstream appeal; the traditional song-and-dance numbers are smattered with colourful characters (and a smidge of offbeat humour) to keep it fresh. The musical sequences are impressively choreographed and often very affecting, the most memorable being the show stopping ""This Is Me"" led by Keala Settle as Bearded Lady Lettie Lutz, closely followed by ""The Other Side"", a clever two-hander between Jackman and Zac Efron. Jackman is clearly in his element belting out tunes and dancing up a storm, but he's also given wonderful support from all involved, including Efron as his plucky apprentice, Michelle Williams as his super-patient wife, and Zendaya as a racially vilified trapeze artist. The movie succeeds a lot less as a biography though; Barnum's rise amidst risky business ventures and family sacrifices is touched upon but never explored, missing an opportunity to delve deep into the life of a clearly intriguing person. It might be a little too conventional to convert those who aren't fans of the genre, but with a charming cast, splendid set pieces and sweet-natured vibe, The Greatest Showman is a pleasingly fun and accessible musical."
"ILoveCNF","10","7","14","13 October 2018"," Perception of the Different
","In society today, those who are different are tossed aside and immediately labeled as so. Those people who are labeled as different are treated like objects as opposed to people. It is because of that difference that they are shunned from society and kept out of the public eye. No matter how much they try to fit in to society's culture, it is very tough to do so. In Michael Gracey's ""The Greatest Showman,"" P.T. Barnum, played by Hugh Jackman, sees the oddities not as people who are different but rather as people with unique qualities and talents. He rallies them together in order to showcase their unique qualities and talents to put on a show. However, as Barnum's show gains popularity and eventually becomes famous, he becomes caught up in the glory and the fame. Thus, his perception of his fellow showman changes. Therefore, Michael Gracey's ""The Greatest Showman"" combats society's fear of people who are different through the change in Barnum's perception of the oddities throughout the movie.
Barnum's initial perception of the oddities combats society's fear of people who are different. Being labeled as an oddity due to his financial situation, as a child, his perceptions of oddities were different from everyone else's. Barnum's perception of oddities were shaped from his first encounter with an oddity after attempting to steal food and from his treatment by Mr. Hallett. Despite living in the shadows to avoid ridicule from the public, the oddity appeared in public in order to help Barnum by giving him an apple. Even as the oddity left, people stared at him/her. When society saw Barnum, they only saw him as poor trash and treated him like so. Not only did the bread owner do so, but also Mr. Hallett after Barnum made Charity laugh and spit out her tea. Barnum made Charity laugh and even admitted to doing so. Barnum had done nothing to deserve his punishment. Yet, because Barnum was poor, contrasting sharply with the Hallett's riches, from society's eyes he was trash and got punished by Mr. Hallett. On the other hand, when the oddities saw Barnum, they saw him not as the poor but as a person.
While Barnum initially accepted the oddities as people, he began to change as he became more famous, however, the faltering in his view of oddities strengthens the message of the movie. As Barnum got caught up in the fame, he began to view the oddities as things just as society did. When Barnum denies the oddities from joining a party due to his newborn fame and ego, the oddities do not let that bother them as they join the party singing ""This is Me."" Despite Barnum's arrogance towards the oddities, after his theater is burnt down and his family leaves him, the oddities find Barnum in the bar and comfort him. The oddities remind Barnum that he was the one who saw them as people instead of judging them based on their unique qualities. While Barnum, who embodied the message of respecting those who are different, may have faltered in his views of the oddities, his mistake only strengthened the message of the story because his faltering makes the message of combating society's fear against those who are different more realistic. 
Although this movie excels at combating society's fear of those who are different, what makes this movie amazing is the way that they approach the message. While other movies may take straight-forward approach in addressing their message, Michael Gracey's ""The Greatest Showman"" takes an unique approach. While it could have been easy to have P.T. Barnum view the oddities in a positive way throughout the entire movie, Barnum's change in view of the oddities due to fame built a stronger message because it shows that it's not easy for one to maintain an opinion that differs from the rest of society. Because Barnum eventually realizes his mistake and reverts his opinions, the message of the movie is changed slightly and becomes realistic, but is still strengthened. Thus, due to the realisticness and strength of the message created by P.T. Barnum's change in view of the oddities, Michael Gracey's ""The Greatest Showman"" effectively combats society's fear of people who are different. Therefore, while it may be difficult, one must view those who are different as people despite their unique qualities."

","This movie does what it's meant to do - tells the story of the creation of the circus through song. It does do this and works as a concept quite well. It is a success to the extent that it is obviously very entertaining for many people. <br/><br/>However, for me the film starts to fall apart in the rushed ending of production of the film. From the obvious editing of the voices during singing moments - which was really hard to get used to - to the animation chucked in very clearly to give the film a very rushed look. <br/><br/>The editing in this film was very good. Especially in the scene with Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron in the bar. The coreography and persona of both actors made this scene the best scene in the film. However both of their voices were changed through some sort of auto tune. This is particularly annoying as both actors are famed for their work in musicals and this editing isn't necessary. <br/><br/>The story moved a bit too quickly for me and the songs weren't particularly good. Their lyrics didn't mean much for the final performance. If these lyrics are compared to other modern day musicals like Moana, you can see how the songs don't add to the film as much as they should in a musical. <br/><br/>The characters were incredible. They worked perfectly and each had enough screen time to make the whole film work. Zendaya seemed like an after thought at bits but she played her role well.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm not used to these kind of fast moving poppy musical but it didn't tick all the boxes for me."

","I also don't see movies at the theater more than once, but will be seeing this one again and perhaps again! This movie gains from a big screen and a great sound system.<br/><br/>Don't think of this as a movie and certainly not a period historical piece, but rather as a very entertaining and well done Broadway Show with songs that will happily stick in your head that just happens to be at your local theater.<br/><br/>The choreography was amazing! From the glass tapping bar scene to the utterly amazing high wire duet, this has unique moments.<br/><br/>This is also a great film for all ages which can't often be said these days, and I do mean all ages.<br/><br/>I usually like the independent style films with good critic and user reviews and this one I almost skipped because of that 50 percent critic rating. But sometimes when the critics either hate it or love it and the users mostly love it, we get to the sad situation, much like the critic portrayed in this film that the critic has lost the ability to just go have fun at a movie!<br/><br/>To have so much visual effect all beating to the same music and almost magically meshing and with all the directional sounds of a good theater sound system being put to good use speaks to suburb post movie editing and crafting.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of history hear but a message of joy, acceptance, imagine, and achieve your own dream.<br/><br/>I loved it!"
"wbowen-00599","10","11","25","25 December 2017"," It's not just a movie but a fine story.
","Yes this doesn't follow the Negatives with P.T Barnum as people will be ready to tell you. However this movie needs to be focused on the story it tells and it's powerful vocals. The Tony nominated song ""This Is Me"" is one of my favorite musical pieces in the film where the choreography to ""The Other Side"" is a fun watching experience. This film highlights the high and some of the low points of Barnum's career, but like most things in Hollywood the tale should be taken with a grain of salt. <br/><br/>I might get flack for saying this but because of the imagination, music score, and overall unique feel to the movie it is probably my favorite film of the year. <br/><br/>If you, like me, are tired of Super Hero movies, Star Wars movies (I said it), or feeling overall let down by lack of imagination, and feeling like movies just want to focus on showing off technology. This movie is your saving grace. I am making plans to see it at least 1 more time while it's in theaters because it did an amazing job of catching my emotions and holding on. <br/><br/>I have seen musicals dating back to the 1930's and this ranks up in the top 10 of that list, and it's a big damn list. Loren Allred (singing voice of Jenny Lind), Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron and Zendaya have amazing vocals. However, personally I think Keala Settle who plays the Bearded Lady deserves as much praise as the others. I would like to hear more of this Broadway talents vocals. Like LaLa Land, The Greatest Showman feels like it takes you back in time to when Musicals dominated the market. The two in charge are going to greatly usher in a new age of amazing music composition for musicals. This is just my opinion but you will do yourself a disservice if you don't find a chance to see this movie, and it is after it releases on blu-ray i'd say still do it."

Barnum, infamously known for the phrase ""There's a sucker born every minute,"" lacks any edge in this musical. You'd think anything could be saved by the lyricists (who did La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen) but everything hits a sour note. Auto tune is obviously used, the editing of this film is awful, and the camera movies are choppy and uninspired. Just when you think the original musical is making a comeback you get a piece of crap like this. Not worth the money or the time, unless you like heavy handed messages being shoved down your throat.

","Hugh Jackman is one of the most charismatic performers in existence, and he proves it again as P.T. Barnum in ""The Greatest Showman."" The film also stars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson.<br/><br/>The film is a 98 percent fictionalized story of the rise of P.T. Barnum. Barnum was a fascinating and somewhat controversial character. He was part of the government of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and made many improvements there. The film touches on few of his accomplishments, concentrating on his circus.<br/><br/>I've heard the music described as having ""High School Musical"" type tunes. Were they awful? No. Pleasant and well-sung? Definitely. The film is a huge spectacle and intended to be seen on the big screen. The choreography is wonderful, too.<br/><br/>My only gripe in this otherwise enjoyable film is that Jenny Lind sang pop songs. I realize that was done because it would have been too jarring with the other music in the film, but at the very least, she should have sung something in a soprano voice, even if it was Carry Me Back to Old Virginny. <br/><br/>I've seen Hugh Jackman on stage three times - he's always sensational.

"ironhorse_iv","8","6","12","12 January 2018"," For the most part, 'the Greatest Showman' was truly a great watch. A feel-good whimsical movie.
","Ladies and Gentlemen and Children of All Ages! 'The Greatest Showman' has arrived. Directed by Michael Gracey, the film showcase, the visionary of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman) who rose from nothing to create one of the greatest shows on Earth. Without spoiling the movie, too much, much like the real-life, promoter, this movie is here to entertains, and it completely succeeds in doing so. Nevertheless, it came without a few criticism from groups whom felt outrage & revulsion for what they deem as somewhat offensive overly exploitative of the physical impaired. Much like 1932's 'Freaks', a similar film before this, they're overlooking the positive incentives on showing people with impairments. Stories with characters with physical difficulties can help build understanding, compassion, and tolerance among viewers who don't face those challenges -- as well as give those who do a chance to see relatable people on screen. As a man of many physical challenges, I champion this portrayal, even if some of the disabled characters are played by able-bodied performers like Keala Settle, as the bearded lady, Lettie Lutz. As for the film portrayal of race. I also welcome the mostly positive portrayal of it, even if parts of it can be seemed as scientific racism, due to the fact that color of the skin, was group as an 'oddity', by Barnum's way of showmanship. Nevertheless, it's not as offensive as it could had been. After all, the film doesn't bring up, the fact that the real-life, Barnum bought slaves for blackface minstrel show, despite possessed, many anti-slavery convictions. Nevertheless, some of the artistic liberties about him, in this film, is still, a bit jarring, such as not, portraying any of his significantly involvement in politics, leading up to the American Civil War. It would had made, the reasons, why some people want to burn his museum, more convincing than the surface-level negative public attitudes about the theater as ""dens of evil'. While, I would had wish the movie was a little more open in exploring, more of the complexity social issues of the time. I didn't mind, for the most part, the film playing it safe with a water down version to make it more family-friendly. After all, it's supposed to be, musical escapism, not a historic accuracy biography film. However, there are two things, I didn't like about this portrayal of history. One is the villainess disservice to Swedish singer, Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) by painting her as the evil jilted lover of Barnum. In real-life, they broke up, not due to a botch romantic relationship, but over marketing. Nothing really sinister. Secondary, Barnum's company nearly went out of business, due to bad property investments, not Lind's tour. In truth, Lind made Barnum, a lot amount of cash. The other thing, I didn't like about this movie was the idea, it was saying that Barnum invented the modern circus, which is highly misleading. In fact, the first modern circus was introduce to the public, 100 years earlier, by performer Philip Astley in 1770 & the first circus tent was introduce in 1838 by Thomas Cooke. Barnum didn't really start his show business until much later, after his lottery business went under. Honestly, it wasn't until his most well-known partnership with James A. Bailey that his museum show started to look like, 'the Greatest Show on Earth' of today. Despite that, the high-energy, upbeat, choreography dance & acrobatic action, throughout this movie very effectively evoke the ambiance of the circus's reckless, but daring persona, even it's not historical accuracy. While, the fake-looking CGI effects that went along with it, is kinda jolting to look at. It didn't really bother me, as much as it should had. Maybe, it's because all the musical numbers written by songwriters, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who also wrote the songs for the acclaim, 2016's musical, 'La La Land', were pretty memorable. No wonder, why the songs are winning awards. Catchy songs like 'This is Me', 'A Million Dreams', 'Never Enough' & others is the heart of this film. It had me, singing along in my seat. I don't care, if the music choice does not match the time period. They were catchy & enjoyable. As for singing. It's a mixed bag for me. Most of the singing from the cast was great; Ferguson as Lind, & Michelle Williams as Barnum's wife, Charity, were the only ones that were disappointing, as they had to be vocal-over. As for the acting, Jackman's performance, is a joy to watch, in spite of looking nothing like the real-life partially bald, promoter. As for supporting actors like Zac Efron; this is one of the few roles, I like him in, even if his character, Phillip Carlyle is highly fictional version of Bailey. Even, Zendaya was good in her role, as Anne Wheeler doing all of her own trapeze stunts. Yet, I just the film had more subtlety with the character's story between the musical numbers, a little more. The film does seem a bit rushed, with the focus going from one song and dance number to the next. It cause a lot of befuddling. Some confusing areas are with Barnum's career, grown. The film doesn't showcase enough. After all, some of Barnum's major attractions are either gloss over, left out or only hinted at, such as the infamous ""mermaid"". Even Barnum's relationship with the 'freaks' & the circus animals get very little screen-time. Perhaps in order, not to get the audience to dig too deep into the controversies of the circus' history. Nevertheless, their out of the blue, appearance, once in the while, were really perplexing at times. Another one that came out of nowhere, is the relationship subplot between co-owner, Carlyle & Wheeler. When did it started and how!? Nevertheless, things like that, could had been work better. Despite that, overall: while this crowd-pleasing movie a bit campy and hokey with old-timey surface-level sentiment at times. 'The Greatest Showman' is a show still worth watching. Highly recommended."

","I strongly dislike this film. First of all, the story is.. Bad. It bored me half to death. The Characters are bland and uninteresting. The main character, PT Barnum is nothing more than a generic serious fellow who the writers try to make seem flawed and interesting, but fail and make him seem like a bad person. The rest of characters I don't even remember the name of, so let's not mention them, as such boringness and lack of effort put into a supporting cast deserves no mention.

"mikezexcel","10","7","15","2 April 2018"," here's why the critics are wrong !
","I've seen TGS six times - about every 2 weeks since it opened. To me the film was an imaginative take on the man who created one of the most enduring forms of entertainment the world has ever seen. But the critical comments were not part of my experience. The following points seem to be the most repeated among the critics:<br/><br/>HISTORICAL ACCURACY: This criticism is easy to dismiss. Unless the film is a documentary, the ""facts"" are subject to interpretation. A long list of movies based on real people or events bears this out. Consider this: If a film (non-documentary) were made about Donald Trump, wouldn't there be very different versions, depending on who's telling the story?<br/><br/>THE REAL PT BARNUM: This can be addressed with my comment above. But I'll go ahead and answer those who feel that the man who was famous for having said ""There's a sucker born every minute"" had his character sugar-coated in the film. Those critics say he was portrayed as a saintly family man who championed inclusiveness. I don't know how they didn't see the same film I did. At a young age PT learns that honesty may not be the best policy when he is punished for admitting he made young Charity laugh. He subsequently steals, obtains a loan with false collateral, and embellishes his ""circus freaks"" to his liking. He even admits to being a fraud to the highbrow theater critic. And when he gains entry to high society via his partner Phillip Carlyle, he has hesitations about appearing in public with his human menagerie. I'm leaving out a few, but how many more character flaws do the critics need to see in a 2-hour film?<br/><br/>NO BACKSTORY: A few critics lamented that the secondary characters (the circus crew) were not given full backgrounds. I can only shake my head and wonder how they could expect to pull this off with a dozen or so characters. Would they have liked a 3-hour movie better?<br/><br/>THE SONGS ARE TRITE: Simple answer - one of the most revered songs in a film musical is about rainbows and bluebirds.<br/><br/>NO REAL DRAMA: Sure, it wasn't APOCALYPSE NOW, but PT faced enough challenges in the film to dismiss that criticism.<br/><br/>WEAK SCRIPT: Always a matter of taste, but I found it intelligent, engaging and very often humorous. I've laughed every time, particularly at the exchanges between PT and Phillip as they are trying to make the acquaintance of Jenny Lind in London. And the audiences I've been with laughed along with Queen V at the ""reaching the top shelf"" retort by Tom Thumb!<br/><br/>SUB-PAR CHOREOGRAPHY/MUSICAL STAGING: Again a matter of taste, but after 6 times seeing the film, the musical numbers still give me goose bumps. The Other Side number, staged in a bar, is no less impressive than anything from a Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly film. <br/><br/>TOO LITTLE/TOO MUCH: The Village Voice critic wrote that it was boring and exhausting - in the same sentence! So which one was it?!<br/><br/>I personally feel that a clinical dissection of the movie misses the point. Maya Angelou said something to the effect that people don't always remember what you do or say, but they will remember how you make them feel. I'm glad I'm one of the many viewers who got such an incredibly wonderful feeling from THE GREATEST SHOWMAN."

The Greatest Showman is the one movie where I feel that it truly deserves an Emmy for best musical of 2017! The story is carried through the songs more-so than the thin plot. Perfectly fine for me. I normally prefer story heavy musicals, but The Greatest Showman somehow did it in such a way that I really didn't mind. <br/><br/>Funny how, in the movie, it's about inclusion (in society) and going against criticism/norm. It's also about how making so much money may lead you astray and to lose sight of what's truly important. In RL, this movie is ironically getting lots of pro criticism, but the audience really loves this movie. I love this movie. <br/><br/>The movie should hopefully make back its 80 million $$ budget, but, as long as the entire cast had so much fun/passion making it, that's what truly counts to me. Even if you don't make so much money, what's more important, huh? Happiness or a film devoid of it? <br/><br/>To sum this up, I borrowed the lyrics from this film's ""This is Me"" sung by the wonderful Keala Settle, and twisted it a little. <br/><br/>// Minor spoilerage if you didn't hear the song, or watched the movie yet. //<br/><br/>*

The alterations that have been made to Barnum's actual tale make this movie very refreshing.

Hugh Jackman plays Barnum , a poor man , who gets the opportunity of getting married to the love of his life - Charity (Michelle Williams).<br/><br/> Charity comes from a privileged family , and Barnum finally gets the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove his talents by opening a circus that soon becomes a huge sensation. However, due to his over-ambitious nature and personality, he fails to recognize the happiness that has been provided to him in the present ; he attempts to focus too much on the future. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has given one of the finest (and perhaps sweetest) performances of his career. Michelle Williams also gives a good performance as his wife. The supporting cast have also given effective performances ; Zac Efron and Zendaya portray a young couple in love.

"timbov-70391","1","8","18","16 September 2018"," What did I just watch?
","I had high hopes for this film. What I got instead was whipped cream on a turd. A disjointed and whitewashed story of a man with questionable morals. An assault on the ears by an appalling musical cacophony. Shrieking, not singing. This film was marketed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Judging by the 10 rating reviews on here, the marketers certainly achieved this. The critics were spot on with and I wish I'd taken heed before parting with my cash."
"tcartin01","6","8","18","18 March 2018"," The Greatest Showman promises a lot, but ultimately disappoints in many areas.
","I walked out of this film disappointed. What was advertised as a brilliant musical with unforgettable performances and catchy tunes with lyrics written by none other than the academy award winning lyricists for La La Land, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, did not feel as 'great' as it was clearly intended to be. This is due to a number of reasons that I felt prevented this film from being one of the best of 2017, one of which being the overuse of CGI in some places, particulary with Sam Humphrey's character, Tom Thumb. Sam Humphrey is 4'2"" according to his IMDb page, and so naturally is very small, however the geniuses behind this movie thought it a great idea to add CGI to make him even smaller. To add to this point, the CGI in this movie is atrocious, leading to an unnecessarily strange, unpleasant looking character which the audience is forced to spend a good it of time with in the movie. In my opinion, this was very distracting and really impacted some of his scenes in the movie, making them very hard to take as seriously as they were meant to be.<br/><br/>Another problem this movie faced was it's development, or lack thereof, of many of it's characters. All of the 'oddities' in PT Barnums' troupe are criminally underdeveloped, which made their arc in the film far less compelling, as there are given no personalities or defining features apart from what made them 'odd'. PT Barnum and Zac Efron's character feel like the only developed characters in the film, and have some really great scenes together, including a musical number in a bar, in which I felt they bounced off each other very well. If this same level of development had been spread throughout all of the main character's we were supposed to care for, and not just the two main characters, the movie would have fared a lot better.<br/><br/>While the beginning and end of this movie are very fast paced and interesting, with lots of great songs that I really did enjoy, including the aforementioned bar scene, the middle felt quite lacklustre, with many forgettable songs all jammed in together, and a romantic subplot between Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters, which I felt was very unnecessary and forced. The music in this section, and throughout the entire movie, is very different from the music heard in La La Land, which was a film I very much enjoyed for it's jazzy soundtrack. The music in the greatest showman is a lot more modern and poppy, which, while some people may enjoy it, I felt was a huge step down from the music in La La Land, and really let down the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Aside from the many negatives I have mentioned, there are quite a few positive aspects that really save this movie from being bad by my standards. As I have mentioned before, the beginning and end are fantastic with regards to their visuals, and really give the movie a broadway musical feel, which I really loved. Again, Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron really shine here, and bounce off each other penomanally, especially in the previously mentioned bar scene. Performance-wise, this movie is solid, with some great singing, dancing and acting, which really adds to the movie's showy atmosphere. If you enjoy musicals, you will probably enjoy this movie for what it is.<br/><br/>With regards to improvements, I feel that this movie would have worked much better if it was told from the perspective of the 'oddities', giving them the spotlight and letting PT Barnum take a backseat as a villainous but sympathetic character. This would have avoided a lot of controversy as it would have shown PT Barnum for who he was, and would have offered a slightly different take on his legacy, which I believe would have been very interesting to see. It would also have reinforced the film's message of acceptance, which I feel wasn't done as good as it could have been.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Greatest Showman promises a lot in it's opening number, with stunning visuals and incredible performances, however it ultimately fails to deliver in many areas, making it feel like a mediocre stage show written by an far too ambitious amateur composer, which is a shame, as the concepts shown in the film are quite unique and, if properly executed, could have ended up being a landmark achievement within the film industry.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Well it took nearly til the end of the year for it to happen but I found my least favourite movie of 2017. The name of this horrendous garbage dump? The Greatest Showman. Now, I like musicals so of course I was intrigued to see this. And yet, I cringed every time someone opened their mouths to sing. Its like this movie wanted so hard to be seen as an inspirational tale. Every song shoves this down your throat. I get it movie...we're all special...be who you're meant to be...blah blah blah move on. Now, its by the same guys who did La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen, so I know they can write other stuff. Also, having every song as a pop song felt kind of distracting. But for the most part I could get somewhat past that choice of music....up until the Opera singer showed up. This would have been the point to show an ACTUAL operatic song. But no......another pop ballad. And Rebecca Ferguson, is not a bad singer by any means...but I wasnt exactly wowed by her voice and yet shes being marketed in this movie as like ""the best opera singer in the world"". Like mmmkay...if you're at least going to go down the pop route Im sure there would have been better choices to make. Someone like Adele, maybe? It also felt very paint by numbers...very safe. I mean, they try to make a point about racism in this movie...and they dont even have the balls to truly explore that. The romance between Zendaya and Zac Efron's characters felt forced. They didnt have any chemistry with each other. I have some other small nitpicks....but boy oh boy....for a movie that kept talking about bringing joy to the audience I sure wasn't feeling it. If I had to say something positive, the costumes are beautiful. And I think the actors were fine. I think PT Barnum is an interesting person to make a movie about, just not in this movie. I think it would have worked slightly better if they hadnt tried to make it a musical."

A good musical has a song to fit every mood. Loss, Sorrow, Wonder, Yearning, Love, Betrayal, Introspection, Rebellion, Triumphant, etc. But every number has to start slow & end in a big cluttered Bill Board Crescendo of ""Happy Happy Jo Joy"". The way everyone relies on portamento.. gliding from note to note in order to avoid landing on correct notes is distracting & run of the mill.<br/><br/>Their structures are conventional, as are the 4 chords they tend to use over & over.. just like pop music. All in simple time.<br/><br/>The shaky cam, frenetic editing, & acrobatic cinematography deliberately divests us of witnessing any choreography. The CGI backdrops & other random assets shows where they glued the scenes together in their spare time on Sunday afternoons. And as for the sound? Everyone sings mute; obviously, as the pitch-corrected & over-compressed Mic-crisp breaths never sound real. But what is real in this god awful film?<br/><br/>Maybe everything & everyone are just CGI props, polygons, with platitudes of one over-privileged prig in the film itself? And it created itself?

"oliver_batchelor","4","5","10","28 April 2018"," Disappointing, poorly made, lazy Moulin Rouge inspired musical mess
","To start I LOVE musicals and have done for as long as I can think of (Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserable and Moulin Rouge are some of my favourite films) and I really wanted to like this film but it was a massive let down overall. 
STORY: The plot of this film was just bland and uninspired clearly taking a lot from better musicals that have come before, the main thing for me is Moulin Rouge; so, there's an entertainment building owned by a charismatic man in a red coat and top hat, a young, conventionally attractive man who moves away from his disproving family to come and help at the theater/circus where he falls in love with the dancer and they then have to hide their love from everyone else. 
DIRECTION: The fact that this is the director's first film stands out like a sore thumb. Now I don't claim to be an expert on the topic but the whole film is so garish and in your face that it becomes really hard to look at for an extended period of time let alone the 105 minute run time.
SONGS: The songs are what have got most attention and even the most negative reviews on here have said that they don't mind the songs but I honestly don't know what they see in them. Every song is just a generic 2017 pop song rather than period appropriate sounding songs like those in Phantom of the Opera or re-worked to fit the theme and environment of Moulin Rouge. What makes it worse that they are written by the people behind La La Land which, after a few watches, has started to become a favourite of mine. The choreography to these songs was also very boring and un-original. 
VFX: Given that the director comes from a visual effects background the CGI in this film was offensively bad. There were things done in CG that clearly have just been done for real and the animals are just dreadful. 
POSITIVES: Despite these things I did find myself somewhat enjoying some parts of the film but I couldn't for the life of me remember what they were now. The central performance from Hugh Jackman was likable and you can tell he really wanted to make this film the best could and you can't fault him for that. The editing was also relatively well done and accurately fitted the pace of the film.
Overall, the film does contain some well done, enjoyable moments but these alone don't redeem it from its forgettable songs, questionable CGI, amateur direction and story that 'borrows' more from better films than it gives anything new to the genre."

"mkouta","2","8","19","14 February 2018"," The Greatest Con Man
","This review can be summarised by the following contending title ideas I had: 'Children's movie dressed up as something greater', and 'The Prestige meets La La Land... in the toilet'.<br/><br/>All right, I don't usually succumb to the hype machine against my better judgement, but I had nothing to do and wound up being escorted by my 16 year old sister to the movies (or escorting her I should say), and so I resolved to give the film a fair shot and prepared to enjoy myself.<br/><br/>Now, it' not possible to avoid comparisons with The Prestige, so let's start there. Both films have a similar setting, share a major actor, have similar protagonist roles, and, both start with an achronological scene. In the case of The Prestige, the viewer's curiosity is whetted by the questions the opening scene raises, and is rewarded by moments of comprehension later on as the puzzle pieces slot into place. In The Greatest Showman, I was left with my mouth gaping open after having watched a bunch of comical misfits dancing around to thinned down k-pop in what was supposed to be a Victorian setting, all rounded off by the dulcet tones of notable singer Hugh Jackman, of all people, taking the lead vocals.<br/><br/>The next scenes involved such a quick succession of goofs, bad child acting and far fetched hasty story telling so as to prevent me from wiping the wide eyed gawk from my countenance, to the extent that my sister noticed and asked if I was okay. For example, in one shot a girl forcefully spits tea out of her mouth onto the table, in the next shot it all magically relocated to the front of her dress.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film involved a very forgettable and cliche plot, that sort of everything's going well, oh no everything's gone wrong, no wait woohoo everything just rectified itself by an improbably lucky streak of flukes. That's not to mention the numerous plot holes, if you bothered to engage your cognitive powers at all.<br/><br/>I'm no historian, and even I was acutely aware that historical accuracy had clearly been defenestrated in the movie-making process; for example, in one scene a couple put on a public display of passion, which wouldn't have gone down well in Victorian society, but in the scene the surrounding public all gaze as though affected by the couple's love.<br/><br/>The music was themeless, failed to get me grooving even through the veritable cinema sound system, and it clashed with the Victorian setting. People didn't sing like Beyonce in the 1800's. This is in contrast to the oft compared and far superior La La Land, in which the musical pieces meld flawlessly with the film.
I could go on and on about how every aspect of the film was thoroughly uncaptivating, and I came out feeling as though I'd been conned into watching a children's film. I really can't see anyone over the age of 16 genuinely enjoying it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the acting was generally alright; heartthrob Zac Effron did enough to justify his presence, and some of the dancing choreography was, in my inexpert eyes, quite impressive."

I found the songs tedious, samey and saccharine. Generic dross, totally un-listenable to anyone over the age of 11 or with a modicum of musical taste.<br/><br/>Period wise the costumes were all over the place and I hated the juxtaposition of modern pop songs and contemporary dance in a period setting. <br/><br/>The bar scene towards the end with the stompy song and dance, was the only part of the film I found enjoyable and it did momentarily stop me thinking ""make it STOP!"". The choreography was excellent and the song was the best in the whole film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was actually very good, but every time a ghastly new song started I inwardly groaned and instantly disengaged. I've never considered leaving a cinema more frequently than I did whilst watching The Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>I loved Moulin Rouge which is the closest film I can think to compare it with, but hated almost every second of this as the terrible music got in the way of me enjoying the film. <br/><br/>Despite having an alright enough story line, ultimately even the fantastical sets and strong choreography couldn't work their magic as everything was overpowered by the dreadful songs."

","I went to see this movie with very high expectations...I was expecting something in the line of La La Land, or even better..what a drama! <br/><br/>First of all, the music was totally mainstream and every single song sounds the same..same beat, same rhythm, same cheesy-ness..the movie lacks a storyline and the characters are outright flat! Not to mention all the cliches..this movie is packed with them.. Where is the unique feel that this movie was supposed to have? With La La Land for example, you have the jazzy sounds and the brilliant orchestra backing up the great camera work..here, you have some Justin Bieber type, studio mixed beat to go with every scene that's packed with slimey, cliche songs that never really seem to touch you..and honestly, the songs and the sounds just don't go at all with the 19th century setting of the movie. Maybe they did it that to make it unique or whatever..but in my opinion, that totally failed. You can't just make something hip and trendy by adding some beats to it and hoping it will all work out in the end.<br/><br/>Overall, I really don't understand all the excited reviews.

The cinematography, acting & singing are all incredible!<br/><br/>And though some of the plot was a bit wonky... like how everyone forgave Barnum just like that and how the girls don't age (and some other things I don't really remember because I liked the movie a lot). And although I hate(d) the part with Jenny Lind indeed (though the actress and the song are amazing), the fact that he's ashamed of his employees and I do think some of it (like Rewrite The Stars, though it displays a shedload of talent, sorry not sorry) was really cheesy, it's still an 8/10.<br/><br/>And I love how much it means to people, that's honestly worth more than anything else in the universe.<br/><br/>The concept/theme of the circus and helping people believe in themselves instead of living in shame, did remind me a bit of the Butterfly Circus, (which is a brilliant film, please watch it if you haven't yet),

"alexk-67067","4","3","5","15 April 2018"," Good, but many flaws
","I watched this move tonight, with high expectations with what I would get. I walked out feeling upset about what I saw. Let me start off by pointing out everything good I saw from this film. <br/><br/>I believe Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron played their parts magnificently. They both put their heart and soul into these parts, portraying their roles masterfully. The part of Lind was played well, as was the wife and children. The music was phenomenal. I almost have the guts to possibly watch La La Land. The camera angles were placed perfectly, changing from one angle to the next simply without error. But besides those points, I do have many negatives to point out.<br/><br/>I feel that the major flaw to this movie was its pacing. The viewer only has about 10 minutes to take in his childhood, and then you are seeing him as an adult. They move to quickly from what is supposed to be from one point in time to the next. The speed at which the story was told became too fast for me, but that's just my opinion. Another problem I had with the movie was that it became too easy to predict. I would think throughout the movie, ""this is going to happen."" Almost every time I was correct. The last comment I will make talks about how the songs were introduced. I didn't understand the point to why one line would just end, with no music, and all of the sudden, you hear singing from one of the characters just burst from nowhere. I feel there should have been a better introduction to every song. With ""This is Me,"" I feel the circus members should have shared ideas about how they felt about Barnum leaving them out of the party before the song was introduced. This would help build character depth and create a better way for a character's struggles to be shown. <br/><br/>Because of these pros and cons, I give this movie a 6/10. It showed to be promising, but when the movie closes, you feel that there could have been more to the movie."

","The Greatest Showman is visually eventful and very entertaining movie. Music scenes are big and well done.

All the other musical numbers are superior, especially freaks This is me is outstanding. Over all everything seems to be in right place in this movie, but... Dramaturgy of movie is too straightforward. Everything seems to happen too easy. From rags to riches, getting arrogant, back to the bottom and get up again just happen, without any drama. Movie could be little longer and added more drama to feel more realistic. <br/><br/>After all it is not a bad movie at all. It is visual, speedy and rhythmical movie. It sounds and looks great.

","A lot of the critics doesn't like this film, and I get it. From a pure film critic point of view, the dialogue, cinematography, and maybe even the acting in this film is not good enough for this award season. I try not to compare this with La La Land because one is romantic and the other realistic. <br/><br/>It is important to know that not everything will be like a fairy tale, but The Greatest Showman has something in its story that can sympathize with every scared soul who is still trying to achieve his/her dream. I don't cry a lot when I watch a movie, but when I heard This Is Me, it made me realize everything is possible. And before I know it, tears are all over my face. <br/><br/>Movies, TVs, theater productions, they should all be ""celebrations of humanity"".

","This review won't stop anyone seeing this movie but I'm gonna put it on here anyway. I'd read a lot of hype for this movie, mostly on IMDb and from friends, and really wanted to enjoy this. I did not. Minus points: The plot is so predictable I don't even have to spoil it for you: just watch the first ten minutes. I didn't care about any of the characters at all, and the director decided to give the (actually interesting and engaging) romance between two characters 1 out of the 11 songs and about 5 minutes of screen time. Most of the lines didn't make a shred of sense or were interrupted by random songs (which all sounded like trashy 2013 Top 40 chart fodder - absolutely insufferable) and the direction was awful.

On a personal note I found myself smiling for the entire duration of the film, which is almost unheard of as I zone out after only a short period of watching most other movies. The Greatest Showman capitvated me (and many others by the sounds of things) to such an extent that the 95 minute running time went by in the blink of an eye. The soundtrack is brilliant in its originality and use of mood/sentimentaility which neatly fits in with the movie itself. As the theatre/show critic says in the film itself, this movie can be a considered 'a celebration of humanity' due to its innovative approach/casting. If the critics cannot find joy in this movie, then maybe they should be doing something else with their lives."

"joluke-97735","10","4","8","12 October 2018"," THE MOVIE THAT INSPIRES ITS AUDIENCE
","If you have ever wanted to hear the Wolverine sing, ""The Greatest Showman"" is the movie to watch. ""The Greatest Showman"", directed by Michael Gracey, won the hearts of millions around the world when it was released in December of 2017, just five days before Christmas. During its first week in theaters, it earned a total of almost nine million dollars worldwide, being ranked fourth for the amount of money earned during its first week in theaters. ""The Greatest Showman"" has just about everything one could hope for in a movie. It has a strong story line, great music, superb acting, and something else is thrown in there: life lessons. The movie is more of a musical that is based off of real events that P. T. Barnum, played by Hugh Jackman, experienced as he tries to make a name for himself in America. It takes place during the 1850s and 60s, but even though it is an ""older"" movie, it still captured the attentions of many people today. Even though ""The Greatest Showman"" takes place a little under two centuries ago, it is an American favorite today because of the music and lessons established in the movie.
 Right off the bat, the first scene of the movie already gets the audience at the edge of their seats. It opens with a fast forward to what is to come later on in the movie. It gets the audience excited to see what leads up to that event. There are lessons within the songs, but they are also found just in the dialogue itself. In the opening scene, Hugh Jackman sings about how the impossible comes true and nothing will be able to stop him or his ""circus"" members. Even though there is a lot going on in that one scene, the words alone are mesmerizing. As the song progresses, ""We light it up, we won't come down, and the sun can't stop us now. Watching it come true, it's taking over you... it's everything you ever want. It's everything you ever need, and it's here right in front of you..."" transitions into a scene of a young P. T. Barnum, looking through a glass window at what he wants to be when he grows up. That shows the audience that his dream eventually comes true, no matter what he faced in his life. 
 As the movie continues, the audience sees all the adversity Barnum goes through in the process of becoming a well-known figure around the world. One of the life lessons the movie offers throughout its entirety is that you will face criticism, but you must persevere through it. Barnum's ""freaks"" brought in a lot of money because people wanted to see these ""monstrosities."" Philip Carlyle, played by Zac Efron, was practically disowned by his family when he decided to join Barnum as partners. The circus and its associates received so much hate and criticism from the public, but that did not stop any of them. Even when times became tough, they got through it all together. In the song ""Come Alive"", Barnum sings, ""'Cause you're just a dead man walking, thinking that's your only option, but you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day"". Keala Settle, who plays Lettie Lutz, a bearded woman, sings ""When the sharpest words wanna cut me down, I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out. I am brave, I am bruised, I am who I'm meant to be, this is me"" after Barnum made it evident that he saw them not as friends, but as subjects. He made it seem like he did not want to be associated with them outside of the circus, but Lutz does not let that stop her or her peers from speaking out and having everyone know that they accept their differences. This lets the audience know that they can get through just about anything if they set their mind to it. They cannot let what others think get to the best of them. 
 ""The Greatest Showman"" is one of the most loved movies in America today. It is not only entertaining, but it is also inspirational to watch and listen to the ideas being conveyed in the movie. ""The Greatest Showman"" offers many life lessons through its catchy songs that are memorable for all its viewers and listeners. Even if something is not going how you planned it to be, just keep pushing through and you will eventually come out better than ever."

His story goes off the rails a bit when he brings Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind to the USA - I have no idea how accurate the almost-affair is, followed by the consequences of anti-freak action, but all ends well as the Big Top is erected. <br/><br/>Jackman and the rest of the cast look to be having a whale of a time, and understandably so, given the gusto with which the musical numbers are presented. There were times when the lyrics were hard to make out, especially early on, but the melodies were all catchy and hummable and the lyrics (when clearly heard) were inspirational. <br/><br/>The dancing was never technically challenging in terms of intricate footwork but the musical numbers, without exception, were exhilarating and emotional.<br/><br/>I gather the critics haven't given this an easy ride.

","The Greatest Showman is a musical drama film loosely based on the life of circus showman P. T. Barnum. Starring Hugh Jackman in the lead role, it is a dazzling and fun showcase of Jackman's talents as an actor and an interesting look into the life of its main subject.<br/><br/>In New York City, P. T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) lives with his wife Charity (Michelle Williams) and two daughters in a basic house working a menial office job. Despite their relatively simple life, Barnum has ambitions for greater things and after losing his job, he takes out a huge loan from the bank to start his own wax museum of oddities and freaks. After slow business, Barnum's daughters suggest showcasing ""living"" exhibits and so decides to recruit real life performers for his museum, eventually leading to a high number of attendance from curious spectators.<br/><br/>There's no denying The Greatest Showman has irresistible dance numbers, memorable songs, and an interesting plot, but unfortunately the story does feel predictable at times and some of Barnum's circus performers feel annoyingly underdeveloped. It's a shame the film does not focus enough on personalities of the other performers, outside of the fact that they're human beings rather than ""freaks of nature"". Despite this, the acting from its cast is solid, particularly Hugh Jackman in the title role, who is a delight to watch from his energetic presence to his dramatic sincerity.

","I really wanted to see The Greatest Showman because of Hugh Jackman. He is more than a ""triple threat"" since he is at home in not only musicals, but also drama, comedy, and fantasy. He displayed all of these attributes in The Greatest Showman, but was shortchanged in a movie that sacrificed depth for glitz.<br/><br/>I felt breathless by the end of the movie, not because I was overwhelmed with the film but because the book of the movie tried too hard to juggle multiple story lines and cover too great a period of time - while mounting lavish production numbers.<br/><br/>I was underwhelmed by the plotline involving Zac Efron and Zendaya - although I guess they were inserted to provide teenagers and twenty-somethings with a romantic pair with which they could relate. Much more interesting was the relationship of Barnum and his wife - and the threat posed to it by Jenny Lind. <br/><br/>This movie should have focused on the most interesting characters, the Barnum family and P.T.'s performers - especially the Bearded Lady, played to perfection by Keala Settle.<br/><br/>Well worth the time investment to see this movie, but the script needed a good editor."

"abdullahkhanpathan","6","4","8","29 March 2018"," A mediocre, forgettable film!
","The Greatest Showman, directed by Michael Gracey, is a star-studded musical which blesses our eyes with Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Zendaya
The movie starts with the character of Hugh Jackman, P.T Barnum, as a poor child who dreams of making it big to marry the girl of his dreams, Charity - the daughter of the man that he works for
As it progresses, we see P.T marry Charity and have two wonderful daughters all the while trying to make it big to prove Charity's father that he's a husband worthy of having. P.T has an idea of opening a museum, which fails but her daughters suggest that his museum needs more life and ""alive"" things. So, P.T auditions for people with unique characteristics that will attract audiences and sees his museum transform into a circus. 
Now there are some technical and narrative problems in the overall film. To begin with, there is a clear lack of depth in plot and story. For instance, the film ditches exploring various characters' lives. For instance, it barely skims over the main plot points to give us a summarised, not to mention historically inaccurate, view of P.T Barnum's life. So what could have been an adventure of a film, the writers instead chose to make it appeal to a mass-audience and in the process gave us a hardly memoriable story. 
Secondly, I can't help but say it, that the movie uses its songs only to tighten it grip on the audiences' attention. The musical numbers were forgettable, loud and for the most part glossy. Although, the choreography was decent if not brilliant. 
The fact that most of the acting performances were too sweet-mouthed and cringy also never helped TGS's cause. Zac Efron managed to shine, Zendaya as well, but Hugh Jackman gave a very ordinary performance and relied on his star power for the most part. Most dialogues were melodramatic and the presence of the extras struggled to contribute to the feel-goody nature of the film. The screenplay had some cliched plot points: a love triangle; the rise, fall and eventual rise of P.T Barnum. The predictability created disinterest and caused the film to fall flat on its wheels by the time the painfully long third act even began."
"Prismark10","6","4","8","25 March 2018"," The circus comes to town
","The Greatest Showman gives Hugh Jackman another chance to do a movie musical in a somewhat sanitised story of P T Barnum who conceived a circus of freaks, the bizarre and misfits. More importantly he was driven by self promotion and making money. <br/><br/>First time director Michael Gracey does well with the musical sequences, giving it a modern sensibility. However his lack of experience shows in the dramatic moments and with the narrative. The songs are rather bland apart from the Oscar nominated, This is Me that has a barnstorming performance from Keala Settle.<br/><br/>The story is a little thin but zips along in an entertaining fashion. It is dazzling yet curiously empty, Maybe a bit like Barnum's showmanship. The best performances are from Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron."
"carolrmag","6","4","8","21 March 2018"," Filled with good intentions, could be a lot better
","I love musicals and this movie is a handful of good characters, actors and songs. Can't really grasp were it when wrong. The story shares very good values for our society. It brings light and hope. But it failed to bring me along. I think it may have to do with too many characters worth exploring, and failing to explore deep enough the two main characters. Should it had been longer? Maybe that would have made it better. Or maybe cutdown some scenes that don't bring that much and take too long."
"Avwillfan89","7","4","8","16 March 2018"," With a soundtrack like that, you can't really go wrong.
","This film is not a biopic, it's a musical based on P.T Barnum ideas and fantasies.<br/><br/>Although the story itself is rather messily cut together and feels more like a music video than anything else - the film's intention is not to create something heavy, complex and gritty. It is what Barnum wanted to do with his shows: just to entertain, thrill and just be enjoyable.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what this film does and more. The soundtrack is an absolute revelation and makes me feel happy every time I listen to it in the bus or go out for a walk. <br/><br/>It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just there to entertain and help you let go. And I find too few of movies these days who can truly do that for me."

"davidgee","7","4","8","17 February 2018"," 19th-century X-Factor
","This musical extravaganza on the life of P.T. Barnum is pitched at the X-Factor audience, much as MOULIN ROUGE was a few years ago. Don't expect to hear Hugh Jackman singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning' (which he has sung on-stage). It's not that kind of show. The songs are loud, with repetitious lyrics, staged like pop videos. P.T. Barnum was a 19th-century showman, but this is a decidedly 21st-century show.<br/><br/>Zac Efron provides eye-candy for teenage viewers, but the movie totally belongs to Jackman, sounding better than he did in LES MIS and dancing like an Olympic athlete. Political correctness has diluted the 'freak show' with which Barnum begins his circus career - there's a bearded lady (with a fine belting voice), Tom Thumb and dancing Siamese twins, even a 'Wolf Boy', but nothing as grotesque as the Elephant Man, who, with other tragically deformed people, provided the 'lure' for punters into Barnum's circus.
;
This is not my idea of what a musical should be, but it's dazzlingly staged and performed with great exuberance and - somewhat against my better judgement - I enjoyed it!"
"lasttimeisaw","7","4","8","31 December 2017"," Is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence
","To accord validation to a biopic of the American showman P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), the creator of he Barnum & Bailey Circus (which was closed in May 2017 after 146 years), one cannot bypass its subject's money-seeking avarice and unethical modus operandi, above all, the exploitation of his dysmorphia-scourged menagerie from which he made fame and fortune in the first place, by that yardstick, Australian Visual Effect craftsman Michael Gracey's directorial feature debut is a deep-fried shirker, whitewashing contentions and generalizing conflicts in servile service of a dazzling holiday fare, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, its star Hugh Jackman's passion project for years, is still a spectacular crowdpleaser even crippled by its craven artistic slant. <br/><br/>Gliding smoothly through its slavish rags-to-riches template, the film wallows in its old-fashioned flair and punctuated by eleven anachronistic music numbers fashioned by the songwriting team behind LA LA LAND (2016), as a result they are robustly modern, infectiously hooky and choreographed with a modish MV-style sleekness. <br/><br/>Jackman is a real trouper as Barnum and simply amazing to behold and listen to with his virtuoso showmanship (alas, this couldn't be his career-crowning achievement), Michelle Williams is magnanimously given a solo piece to belt out as the benign, perspicacious but neglected wife Charity, yet for my money, the goosebumps-inducing earworms are Efron and Zendaya's trapeze-enhanced REWRITE THE STARS, the impact is more visual than aural though, and the belter NEVER ENOUGH (a pop standard instead of the usual opera piece treatment), from the Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind (Ferguson), voice provided by Loren Allred. Ferguson, again certifies herself as the most stunning star today who is still endowed with the rarefied classical glamor and poise, we almost immediately forgive Barnum's infatuation with her just because she is that irresistible, who wouldn't capitulate under her spell, which conversely, makes Barnum's resolution to go back to his family nigh on apropos of nothing. <br/><br/>That said, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence, last but not the least, as a picture whose protagonist is patently heralded as a man who promulgates diversity and pluralism, the glaring remiss is that none of the members of Barnum's freak show is vouchsafed even a subplot of their own (the sensational Keala Settle as the bearded lady for instance, deserves her own tale of woe before triumphantly lead the center piece THIS IS ME), a lip service well paid thanks very much!"

"boywonder-35420","1","6","14","11 September 2018"," Historically inaccurate, way too cheesy
","I'm a huge history buff, and I also enjoy the occasional musical, but this film was extremely painful to watch. Throughout the film, Barnum( Hugh Jackman) is portrayed as a good person. But that is far from the truth. In fact, P.T. Barnum was a prolific racist and he abused his performers. Painting over the dark history of P.T. Barnum's circus with a happy go lucky let's all learn a valuable life lesson vibe is quite frankly very insulting to the memory of his victims."

","PT Barnum (Hugh Jackman) , as a poor child, lived near a wealthy mansion, for his father worked at the ""big house"". Unhappily, Phinneas Taylor is left an orphan while his best friend, Charity (Michelle Williams), the daughter of the landowner, is sent away to boarding school. Nevertheless, the two continue to write to each other consistently, for the young love turns into mature love. Bringing himself up by his bootstraps, PT finally convinces Charity's father to give him her hand but no money is bestowed on the couple. Dad thinks Charity will realize her mistake and come running back. NOT SO! PT has dreams of opening a museum of odd things even as the couple has two daughters. The museum soons evolves into a circus, with Tom Thumb, a midget, riding a horse, a bearded lady and other bizarre attractions. Its a big success, even though some of the folks in NYC object to what they call the exploitation of the deformed. Hooking up with a talented promoter, Phillip (Zac Efron) the enterprise becomes even bigger. Making things complicated is Phillips admiration and affection for the principal trapeze artist, Anne (Zendaya), for she is a mixed-race gal in a time when prejudices are front and center. Then, PT gets the notion to put Europe's greatest opera singer, Jenny Lind (Rebecca Fergueson) on a tour of many cities. Will the distance between PT and Charity and the girls bring strain? Ms. Lind, after all, is very beautiful. Then, another tragedy occurs. Can the Greatest Show on Earth continue? This biography of Barnum is an old-fashioned tale of love, endurance, hard-work and gumption. What rare values in today's society! Yet, the very fine music and songs are contemporary, making one doubt whether the two will mesh...they do! Days after I saw it I was still humming the music. Kudos to the composers. Also fine is the cast, with Jackman's handsome face and voice leading the way. Naturally, the period costumes are fabulous while the script and direction keep the tale moving along nicely. Folks, are you looking for a movie in the vein of of classic musicals but with a modern twist? You will find it here!"

Watching it, I instantly recalled the dreams that I had, childhood dreams I had forgotten, those that I grew to forget as time passes. It was a very amazing experience, to once again be reminded of the wonderful feeling of having dreams, not the ones you have when you're an adult, where you unknowingly limit yourself. I'm talking about childhood dreams, the ones where we naively believed that we could be anything, anyone, we wanted to be. The dreams that we had when we didn't know the burdens of life. The ones we thought of when we were younger, happier, when everyday we think of the future not as something monotonous, repetitive, but as the intriguing unknown where we would discover something new when it becomes the present."

I only wish they had stayed historically accurate and not shown Barnum romantically infatuated with Jenny Lind. History says it was never more than business and I hate they disgraced their marriage in the movie. Barnum deeply loved his wife and I wish that had been celebrated the entire movie. I can handle the other unfactual adds, but this one makes a false statement about something that did exist, a beautiful marriage portrayed as troubled. That's the only con though.

"gornasa","5","5","11","22 March 2018"," Easy on the eye and the brain
","I don't know what the critics are saying, but I know why so many people disagree with them. It is surely a pretty production with great attention to detail, and if you liked High School Musical 3, you're going to love this. In order to like this movie, you have to go in with a certain mindset because this movie doesn't aspire to be anything more than light-hearted entertainment. It instantly made me think of 'Sing', the animated feature with animals singing in a musical, and that one was way above this in terms of music and storyline. Here, the plot is as straight as a piece of stick, there is zero actual drama and character development of any sort. The only thing that happens is that P.T. Barnum loses his job and buys a museum, that's all the story summarized for you (without any spoilers).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the music but yes, it's very pop and silly and for kids. Dancing is unoriginal and repetitive. And if you want to see how NOT to introduce the main characters' life stories in a movie, watch the first five minutes of this thing. Basically, it's a fast-forward version sung by the main character as a child - and the screenwriter didn't think you need more. Actually, the whole movie is like that - there is hardly anything to it, it's just a collection of beautiful images but there's nothing to make you care for the characters. All dramas are resolved with an imaginary flick of the fingers - one moment there's no drama, flick your fingers and you have a potentially dramatic situation, then flick them again and the problem is gone, and because the characters sing their problems away, you hardly notice anything happened anyway. What's the point of this? Hell, I have no idea.<br/><br/>I didn't expect this to be some seriously ambitious musical, but from the start I was wondering, why a musical at all? I would've loved to see the story of P.T. Barnum as a proper movie with a plot. With all the money that went into it, it could've been something truly spectacular. As it is now, we don't get to see who P.T. Barmum was, and what he did, all we see is a bunch of weird people singing and dancing, and even that is an exaggeration because most of those people are just kind of filling in, they have no actual place in the storyline, they're just dressed funny but other than that they have no reason to be in P.T. Barnum's circus. If P.T. Barnum's show looked anything like what they show here, nobody would go to see it.<br/><br/>Why did they use Barnum at all? Why not simply do a movie about SOME showman and his band of singing dancers? It actually doesn't matter that those people are freaks because that bit isn't explored at all. In the 21st century you'd imagine that this would be the perfect opportunity to squeeze in every controversial topic if you have a fat bearded woman here and an interracial couple, and a few other misfits. And yet, a circus that bases its feeling of family on the fact that they're all freaks, surprisingly avoids any real treatment of those various issues.There was more social commentary in 'Three billboards' - and that one wasn't impressive either.<br/><br/>Honestly, the worst thing about this movie is that they involved the actual greatest showman and didn't tell his story AT ALL. The only thing in common he has with the main character is the name and his circus. I didn't expect a historically accurate movie detailing all the turns of the man's life but come on, at least if you're setting the whole thing in the times when he lived, then show what life was like then? The British queen that he meets is probably the single thing that tells you that oh, this is the 19th century. <br/><br/>And what's with the computer-generated elephants twice the size of the actual animal in real life? Seriously, they couldn't get a live elephant to walk a few steps on the set? <br/><br/>This movie is best described, in my opinion, as rainbow cotton candy - it is that colorful and sweet, and it has just as much depth in any way whatsoever.
I would've given it fewer stars but it does have beautiful sets, the costumes are amazing, the acting is good, and you'll probably feel a little bit happier after watching this."

When they reached adulthood, Charity leaves the comforts of her family home for his love. He lies to a banker for the money to buy a wax museum. Eventually, he turns it into a circus of oddities. He recruits successful black sheep playwright Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) who falls in love with trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). He is desperate for high society approval and promotes high class singing sensation Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson).<br/><br/>This is a brash and broadest of Broadway musical. It is big and melodramatic. Obviously, Hugh is the perfect man for the job. This is a movie that knows what it is and is happy to play it to the fullest. Coming into this, my biggest fear is an easy lackadaisical treatment of historical facts. How big and broad this is actually helps to alleviating that fear. Nobody will mistake this for a documentary. It is to be taken as the lightest of entertainment with the broadest of emotions. I would have liked a reference to ""There's a sucker born every minute"" even if it's not from P.T.'s mouth. Maybe I missed that in the movie. I like all the actors especially Jackman. It hits some great notes. I especially like the trapeze dance between Anne and Phillip. Mostly, I'm disappointed with the wooden acting from Ferguson. The most compelling part of her role is the on stage singing. I wonder if an actual singer would be infinitely more fitting. I simply don't believe her singing and the role doesn't ask much in terms of acting. Overall, it's a big musical and it doesn't want to be anything else."

The Greatest Showman evoked a sense of euphoria, especially in the musical numbers. I appreciated how they chose Hugh Jackman as the protagonist; it displays Jackman's flexibility and abilities as an actor. Additionally, it was refreshing that the film included non-mainstream actors for the majority of the cast. I love seeing non-familiar faces in successful films such as the Greatest Showman. I cannot express enough how much I adore this movie! I'm in love with musicals that have eloquent stories. I praise the cast for their passionate performance and their ability to evoke the same emotions in me, as an audience member."

"rebeccalucy","7","5","11","14 February 2018"," Pure fun...
","A fun musical with some great songs. It also uses unique editing and cinematography quite well. <br/><br/>The cast were definitely the best part of the film, with Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron giving very believable performances. The supporting cast were quite good as well, particularly Keala Settle's amazing voice! The editing is quite good for the musical genre, the first scene being the best example of this. Furthermore, the sets and costumes are beautiful. Truly capturing the style of the film. <br/><br/>However, sometimes I feel the moral is quite heavy handed. It can be too much and the audience understand it from the beginning. Sometimes the CGI was a little distracting also, but can be forgotten with the practical effects. Definitely worth a watch for musical fans!"

","I saw this movie twice, the first one with my husband and the second time with my kids ages 5 and 8. We all loved it. The story and songs are wonderful, truly entertaining. It's a feel-good movie and you should take the entire family to see it. Everyone who goes to see it are just raving and it's one of those movies you really gotta see on the big screen.

No bad moments.
Go, watch and enjoy. :)
I will challenge you to keep your feet on the floor without thumping to the rhythm.
You will leave the theater wanting to immediately download the songs - which is what I did. ""This is me"" - but You can do it too!"

I watched Jumanji recently after that (which I really wanted to see) and It wasn't as remembering as this movie. It's perfect in story, you don't get bored. Music is wonderful, honestly, you WILL listen to it again and again. Choreography was just amazing, If you love musicals or movies with great music.

","I love Star Wars, enjoyed Jumanji and am basically a guy who likes a good PG-13 action movie that makes you think. When I hear that a movie is a musical, I usually avoid it. However, my wife and kids talked me into watching this one (kids saw it a second time with me) and I was pleasantly surprised. It is so much more than a movie about a guy and his circus dreams. It lifts your spirits and tells a story about people overcoming hardships. The music is above and beyond anything that I've experienced in a single movie. My kids keep listening to it over and over and its been a week since they saw it the first time and I still enjoy hearing the songs. Looking forward to seeing it again. Yes, the critics got it wrong on this one."

","This film had me hooked from the opening scene. I was truly lost in the story (which is what a movie is supposed to do). I can't understand why the reviews were so bad. It is so entertaining. Who doesn't want a film you can take your kids to that isn't animated! The music and choreography are both great. I immediately downloaded the soundtrack because the music is great too. Totally worth spending your entertainment dollars on this film. See it in the theater. You won't be disappointed."
"coastdaze","10","5","11","2 January 2018"," WHAT A SURPRISE!
","I start off by saying I'm not much into the newer musicals, I like a good drama but don't like characters breaking out into song at crucial moments! That's just too corny for my tastes.<br/><br/>So on 12/30/17 in the early evening I had a couple of hours to kill...I decided to see Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman. I sat down prepared to see a great drama about PT Barnum when all of a sudden a song breaks out. I was bummed at first but then like the song and it ""fit"" into the scene. I was disappointed that it was a musical but oh well. OH WELL NOTHING! This is one of the most entertaining, happy, great acting movies I've seen in a long, long time. (And I see a lot of movies). <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is a great song/dance man. He's right up there with the likes of one of my favs, Gene Kelly, imo. His timing, his acting is spot on. To the point of I may like him better in musicals than dramas...not sure yet.<br/><br/>And what can I say about Zac Efron? This man was made for song/dance. That is where he shines. The stupid comedies he's made should be the very, very last resort, if at all. They are a waste of his time and talent. I was entertained by his acting and singing all through the movie. I found a new love for Zac.<br/><br/>The MUSIC is FABULOUS. I love every song...the melodies and lyrics were really good and totally fit the scenes they were in. I can't say that about any other musical that comes to mind. The choreographing was spot on, too. Every kind of body type got a good chance to shine, it wasn't just the tall or slim or pretty. Good job on that point.<br/><br/>I loved this movie...the colors, the costumes, the songs, the dance sequences all were perfect and exciting. I left the theater feeling happy and excited about musicals again."

I don't understand why critics hate it so much ( which is ironic because that's actually a part of the story.) 2 days later and i'm still listening to the music, and the songs are still stuck in my head. Yeah, it might have softened the original story a bit, but if you can look past that (and i can't see how you wouldn't) then it's just a great movie with great original songs and a great story, and also a great message. so my conclusion is: please watch this movie, at least give it a try, I guarantee that you'll like it!"

I had no expectations going in to this movie and I only chose to go because my wife really wanted to see it. Within 2 minutes I was drawn in and hooked. I loved every second of it. I walked out of the theater and bought the complete soundtrack on iTunes so I could listen to it on the way home. Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron were freaking amazing. The cinematography and directing was crazy good and I was just so impressed by everything about this movie. I could only imagine the challenge given to the director...you have 30 seconds to get people to really buy into a love story (twice by the way) and you need to use whatever creative tools you can to pull that off. Wow! That's the only word I can come up with. I love this movie."

","This movie is everything, it's joyful, it's emotional, it's a classic. This movie definitely passed the test for me, usually when I watch a movie I can sit there and point out details that are wrong with it, but with this movie I was enjoying myself so much that i just couldn't point out a single mistake. The songs are so upbeat and catching you will feel goosebumps on your arms as you hear them. And Musicals are rare as there is so this movie being such a great musical is a work of art and should be appreciated for years to come, this movie comes as on of my favorite movies of all time. and im sure it will to everyone else who watches it."
"rikvanagt","3","2","3","18 May 2020"," Too much and too shallow
","The Greatest Showman isn't really a movie since movies have character arcs and a plot. This is just hysterically flat characters being hysterical, whether its their acting or singing. And I know it's a musical and musicals are usually more extravagant. I don't mind that, but not in this extreme overdrive, please. The pacing is at lightning speed. Not a moment passes by where a character reflects on what's happening or takes time to make a choice. I seriously had no clue at times what I was watching because of the rushed pacing.
This reflects in the production design, costumes and visual effects as well. Its all too bright, glamourous and above all superficial and flat. The movie has no second or third layer in it's message. It's all in your face ""look at this and feel like this"". That doesn't work for me. A film is supossed to be influential on a subtle level. This isn't. The message of the movie is a great one, inclusion of all types of people, but presented in such a bombastic way that it completely surpasses its goal. Not a single character is relatable since there is no history or further explanation. The characters are flat and don't react naturally to the events happening to them. You might think that I'm just not a fan of extravagant musical-movies but I absolutely adored La La Land for its characters and subtle use of music. This is quite the opposite."
"Offworld_Colony","5","2","3","7 February 2020"," A very well shot and choreographed piece of utterly useless lint.
","Excellent scenes and sets and costumes strung together with lies and boring cliche nonsense.<br/><br/>A couple of nice moments try and alter the generic material, but the end result is the same, the same broad beats you always get in one of these feel-good poppy modern musicals.<br/><br/>The music is excellent and the lyrics are solid and memorable, it's just all in service of a complete lie about the fraudulent PT Barnum and the utterly rote story; I mean there's literally a song called From Now On where Barnum agrees to change his ways in the most cloying and obvious and awkward way, at least other films have the good sense to make the third act turn a little more subtle."

","This could've been a great movie, if not for concept. With all due respect to anyone loving musicals, and overly romanticized stories: This could've been a movie about struggle, about being human, about flaws and rising above them, about success and failure, about... So many things. But what it is - it's some producer's idea that ""we didn't have a musical in ages, this would be cool to produce as a musical"". And I don't care about people fainting over ""though guy can sing"" - everywhere where there could've been great writing, great acting and great character development - there's a song. And not a very good one. This is below mediocre, and it's 4/10 because camera, costumes and few other things are decent. Otherwise it'd be 1. Acting is found in traces here. This is not a movie, this is not a musical, this is waste of money."

"freshshow","Null","2","3","7 August 2019"," I loved The Greatest Showman
","My birthday was this week and one of the things my wife gave me was a copy of The Greatest Showman. I've heard many of the songs but I've never seen the movie. Is this the greatest show?<br/><br/>First off, the music is amazing. They got a great cast with a lot of musical talent. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Zendaya really knock it out of the park. I've heard most of the songs already. (They come up a lot on one of my Pandora stations.) They are great there but seeing them in context takes them to the next level. ""This is Me"", in particular gave me chills when it came up.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman tells a highly fictionalized story of the life of P. T. Barnum and the creation of his famous circus. The story isn't particularly deep but it's well told. Most of the depth comes through the music. To be fair, that's pretty much par for the course with a musical. That's not to say the rest is bad. Far from it. The music just so amazing that the time between songs becomes a nice break before we're hit with the next powerhouse musical number. It's kinda like an action movie except of epic car chases and explosions, we get epic music.<br/><br/>Zendaya's non-singing performance really stood out to me. She can portray so much emotion with out saying anything. She practically stole every scene she was in.<br/><br/>There are a couple of weaknesses. The effects were serviceable but not amazing. Nearly every animal in the movie looked fake. They don't show up often but they pulled me out of the movie just a bit every time they showed up.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman also glossed over the more ""colorful"" parts of Barnum. For example, one of his most famous quotes is ""There's a sucker born every minute."" He was a conman and a hustler who frequently played on the ignorance of his audience. (Not unlike politicians today. 😉) While he is frequently called a conman and worse by his detractors, you never really see it.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved The Greatest Showman. As soon as it ended, I wanted to watch it again. My youngest daughters (who are in their early teens) both really enjoyed it, too. I can wholeheartedly recommend The Greatest Showman to one and all."
"mnshark12","10","2","3","28 July 2019"," Just Amazing
","I originally was not overly excited about this movie. After hearing some strong recommendations from friends, I went to check it out and was so happy I made the trip. It is absolutely amazing. You feel such joy watching the quality and care that goes into every scene. I do have to say I am a huge fan of Broadway shows, if you are not or do not enjoy musicals, this is most likely not the movie for you. If you are, it is a must see."
"makolina","6","2","3","15 April 2019"," Should never have had biography as a description
","This movie was entertaining and reminded me of the circus. The dancing, the animals, the costumes and of course Hugh Jackman singing his heart out. Unfortunately him singing his heart out isn't on good songs. There are some positive lyrics, but overall the music doesn't even remotely fit with the movie if they're going to call it a biography. How it could be called a biography amazes me. Using a couple historical figures doesn't mean biography. On top of that I don't think they could make an historically accurate movie about P.T. Barnum in these pc over charged days anyway.<br/><br/>
Other than the entirely false misrepresentation of how P.T. Barnum became P.T. Barnum.<br/><br/>
The other biggest lie is Jenny Lind. Why they would want to tarnish the name of an actual iconic historical figure who was a champion of charity is beyond me. She donated the equivalent of millions to charity in part because of the tour with P.T. Barnum. She never broke contract, leaving of her own accord due to her uncomfortableness with his aggressive promotional techniques. She didn't bring financial ruin to him, he did that several bad investments. But most importantly, she neither loved nor had any romantic feelings for him, never causing the photo that nearly ruined his marriage. She was a hero for charities, basically funding public schooling in Sweden amongst other things and they cheapen her while making him seem even more heroic. All for the sake of a story. Don't use her name then if you're going to fabricate everything else.<br/><br/>
What this movie should have strove for is not what it tried for. It should have just stuck with a fun movie based on circus life circa now. But wait that's all gone now. So now we just have a sub par circus ""biography."""
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","2","3","8 March 2019"," An entertaining musical that hits all the Hollywood clichés.
","I can honestly say there aren't nearly enough musicals in Hollywood anymore. The Greatest Showman (2017) certainly helps to fill in the gaps between these occurrences, and with a subject that easily lends itself to the musical format. I really enjoyed the songs and choreography, as well as its message of inclusion and being unashamed of who we are. All that being said, there was still something a little off when infusing pop music and modern dance moves with the 1800's. It kind of works, but it also doesn't immerse the audience in the historical aesthetic.<br/><br/>While the story of P.T. Barnum's (Hugh Jackman) rise to wealth and fame (or infamy, depending on the viewpoint) was entertaining enough, so much of its presentation seemed to have the ""Hollywood coincidence"" to it. Events lined up in such a way that I wondered if they really happened or if it was artistic license. This is also not to mention the number of clichés present in the film as well, most of which I can't get into without spoiling the plot. At the very least, Barnum's story seemed realistic due to his motivations, and not necessarily due to his humanitarianism.<br/><br/>It might seem like I'm bashing this movie for being too ""Hollywood,"" but by that same mark, it is an entertaining film. There are enough humor and heartfelt moments to keep the proceedings lighthearted. If anything, the fact that it's entertaining is merely linked to Barnum's rise as an entertainer and showman. The songs are catchy enough to get stuck in your head, and the dancing (especially the bit in the bar) was dazzling to watch and would be fun to imitate. The Greatest Showman isn't your traditional biopic, but it is good for a brief escape from reality.<br/><br/>An entertaining musical that hits all the Hollywood clichés, I give The Greatest Showman 4.0 stars out of 5."

It's all about the story, not the history. Somehow that seems fitting for a movie about the great PT Barnum. What James Cagney did for George M Cohan, Hugh Jackman has done for Phineas Taylor Barnum. Taken an already larger than life person and made them even more spectacular. Do yourself a favor and watch the opening scene. I would better dollars to donuts (or maybe in this case peanuts) that you're hooked by the end of the first number. Come this way, 2 bits for adults and a nickel for the kiddies."

","Critics miss the point so often with movies. Luckily I learned long ago to not pay any attention to their self righteous diatribe. This movie was brilliant. Beautifully filmed and directed, with catchy sugar popped songs that stick with you hours later. Another user review was quite correct it will leave you singing and wanting to twirl your way across a room.<br/><br/>I myself cringed inwardly when I saw the trailer and thought this is going to be a trainwreck. To my delight I found out how wrong I was when I finally watched this movie. It truly hits the mark of a great movie musical. It makes one smile, raises goosebumps, and even causes a small does of the teary eyes. Pure joyful entertainment. Quickly becoming one of my more favorite movies. And certainly worth the two hour investment of ones time. Watch and enjoy the movie for what it is, a beautiful and pure form of escapism, not for what critics think it should be. (Hell they don't even write movies, just complain about them hahaha)<br/><br/>So I am in agreement, the critics definitely got it all wrong, along with the handful of wanna be critics.<br/><br/>Side note: Clearly even the description says loosely based on Barmuns life. Meaning the mans life was inspiration for this musical, not meant to be historically accurate. Also hearing people who think they know something sputter about what a horrible exploiting man Barnum was as reason for not liking the movie is ridiculous as well. Yes he exploited people, but he also was a huge advocate for the 13th Amendment and a tireless philanthropist. He worked to bring beauty, joy and innovation into peoples lives. And the people that you're angry over him exploiting were able to live a better life, to eat, have a home and families even. Quite a lot of them went and toured on their own without him, making a far better living for their self then they would have otherwise been able to have."

","I feel special each time I watch it!
Jackman gives all and so does all the cast which would not have worked without the other.
The Director and all others mold a new version I cannot get enough of.
The cast all reached for the stars and nailed it I really never felt I was watching a musical.
The mix of period and modern just WORKS.
So modern but holds to circa perfectly."

"rachelmcbride-85068","10","2","3","14 October 2018"," Definitely one of my all time favorite movies.
","There were two questions I had to ask myself after watching The Greatest Showman: was is accurate to the real story and was it entertaining? First, this movie is definitely not completely true to the original story of P.T. Barnum, there were multiple details that were either left out, changed or added to the film. However, as for my second question, is it entertaining? Personally, I thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch and I was completely entranced the whole time. Contrary to what critics say about it, that is not entertaining because it is not historically accurate, I completely disagree. I thought that even though it was not one hundred percent true to what actually happened, it was still one of the best movies I've ever seen; I would even go as far to say that this is now my favorite movie I have ever seen because of how enjoyable and captivating it was.
 Reviews from professional critics for this movie have been quite disappointing. A lot of them talk about how it was not accurate to the actual story of P.T. Barnum and his circus. Even though this is true, I think they focused way too much on the accuracy of the film and did not focus enough on the movie itself. Unfortunately, it seems like unless a film has an enormous amount of computer generated effects then it is seen as rather lackluster compared to other movies. I do not think this is fair because everyone involved in The Greatest Showman, cast and crew alike, worked so incredibly hard on this film to make it what it was; the actors portrayed the story well enough they did not need that much CGI anyway. 
 I absolutely loved this movie and everything that went in to making it. The dancing, singing, and acting in this film were absolutely amazing and you could tell how hard the actors worked to make this story seem real. I really felt the emotions they were emitting and loved how many feelings they were able to make me feel myself. I have to give credit to the actors for doing such a good job on the physical aspect too. The singing and dancing were so impressive that it makes you think they are all professional dancers and singers to begin with. 
 Normally I don't even like musicals, I find them hard to follow along with and sometimes I do not even like the music and constant singing. However, I think this film did such a wonderful job of balancing regular dialog and the musical numbers. On top of that, the music itself was very enjoyable and makes you want to sing along (If I am being completely honest, I could probably sing the words to every song in this movie). In addition to the songs, the dances were also very nicely choreographed. They looked fun and were very entertaining, yet there was not too much going on where I could not focus on anything else. Overall, the people who composed the music, choreographed the dances, and helped direct/produce the movie deserve just as much praise as the actors who put it all on screen. 
 In the end, The Greatest Showman has now become one of, if not my absolute, favorite movies; it may not be completely accurate, but it is still and amazingly enjoyable movie. This movie is so versatile that people from all ages can relish in it together. It does an incredible job of making you feel like you are experiencing the story yourself and captivating you until the very last scene."

"AlsExGal","9","2","3","8 October 2018"," I just loved watching Hugh Jackman sing and dance
","I thought this was an incredible movie, so I was also curious about the overload of criticism. I understand viewers having frustrations about the ""historical accuracy"" of the movie. I knew nothing about PT Barnum's life when I saw this, so I was able to enjoy it as an independent creative piece--which, to me, is what it was meant to be.<br/><br/> In it of itself, the movie was altogether captivating from the filming aesthetic, to the music, to the creative dialogue, to the storyline. I finished the film feeling inspired and motivated. It hit the nail on the head, for me, to motivate adults and children's' imagination--reminding humanity of what's most important: love, hope, family, friends, spreading joy, fighting for what you believe in amidst criticism, etc. It shines a light on flawed societal standards of happiness (the American dream) by using unexpected people, methods, and situations to open others' minds, and break them away from fixed, mainstream thinking patterns of materialistic success. Its message sparks excitement and enthusiasm, especially towards those of us who feel inadequate, or ""in the shadows"". It's a motivating and inspiring breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>I would hope that all movie makers' of this genre have the goal is to create a story/artwork that invigorates a similar kind of audience response to the one that I had to The Greatest Showman. If I were looking for a biographical movie, expecting a completely accurate historical recounting, I'd go see a documentary."
"takubasketses","10","2","3","6 October 2018"," It is worth watching.

"scb_coldsteel","6","2","3","1 October 2018"," Eh not the most memorable film
","So I finally watched Greatest Showman last night. I've been putting it off as I was immensely underwhelmed by the early reviews. Overall I think my suspicions were right in this is a very average movie.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying I love musicals, so this is in no way an attack against all musicals. Greatest Showman as a whole just was not a very good musical. Yes there were some immensely talented performers. And yes there were one or two really good songs, but the rest were very lackluster. Most of the performances were just completely forgettable.<br/><br/> I really wasn't a fan of the story of the movie either. Hugh Jackman did his best but PT Barnum was just not a sympathetic protagonist. I really found myself not liking the character as the film went along.<br/><br/>Singing wise Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron did a solid job all around. Those two men are great actors and it's easy to forget that they are also excellent musicians. Unfortunately neither were working with the greatest material.<br/><br/>I really think in a more skilled directors hands this could have been a better movie. As it stands it is a relatively forgettable lighthearted popcorn flick. A 6.5 out of 10."

"michael-young-585","8","2","3","22 September 2018"," The Music is Wonderful
","What a pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting this movie to be very good. With a metascore in the mid-forties, the critical reviews are really pretty bad. But audience reaction is nearly 80% positive. In fact, The Greatest Showman is a lot of fun. If you like a good musical, then this movie should be in your watchlist.<br/><br/>The songs are written by the same Oscar winning team that wrote the music for La La Land and many of the crew members on that successful movie worked on this one. The songs are terrific and will keep your knee tapping all through the movie. This is Me, nominated for original Song Oscar, is sung, initially, by the fat lady (with a beard no less) and really brings together the ultimate message of the movie - that all people matter, regardless of what they look like. Another terrific song (Never Enough) is sung by the Voice's Loren Allred, dubbing for the actress Rebecca Ferguson. And finally, Zac Ephron and Zendaya have a beautiful duet involving a lot of aerial trapeze and rope tricks as they play a young couple in love. Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams, as Mr. and Mrs. P. T. Barnum, have several songs of their own. The music is clearly not from the time of the movie (mid-1800s), but is still powerful and uplifting. The music is all just feel-good.<br/><br/>And It pretty much has to be, because the movie, as a movie, leaves a lot to be desired. This is the feature film directing debut of Michael Gracey who is mostly known for doing commercials. He's done a couple of other movies, but none of them are recognizable. Jenny Bicks is one of the writers, mostly known for her Sex and the City TV scripts. Bill Condon, who won an Oscar for his adapted screenplay Gods and Monsters, also worked on the script. But try as these three might, the story does not carry this movie. There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a circus elephant through and although Jackman and Williams do credible jobs, these are not their most outstanding performances. (Jackman was nearly perfect in Les Miserables and Williams had an outstanding performance in All the Money in the World, also in this year's Oscar movies.)<br/><br/>The film tries to make up for sloppy directing and an inadequate script with dazzling visual effects (there are 406 people credited for visual effects alone) employing CGI enhancements to many of the musical numbers. I'm sure that a good chunk of the $84 million budget went to the visual effects work. I do give the team credit for making it difficult to tell what is natural and what is computer generated. The movie also has a team of six editors, several of whom have won previous Oscars in editing, who had the unenviable job of trying to piece together a movie from all the musical scenes. And, for the most part, they do a good job. But an editor can only work with what has been filmed!<br/><br/>So, basically, the critics are right - this movie is sort of a mess, lacking a coherent vision and a carefully written script. And yet, the movie does manage to convey a positive and entertaining message. It does that from its musical performances which, by themselves, manage to captivate the audience and inspire us to feel good about being human (which is all-to-difficult to do these days.). Sit back, turn the volume up, and just absorb the songs - just don't spend a lot of time trying to put them together into a story."
"amabell","10","2","3","22 September 2018"," Favorite Movie!
","I wasn't really sure what to expect the first time I saw this movie and oh boy was I in for a ride! This movie has everything I love in movies. It has singing, dancing, adventure, love, and loss. All of the songs are so good. They all pull you in. The movements and dances are stunning. When I left the theater, I felt like I had to watch it again. And the next day, I did. This has replaced any other movie as my favorite movie of all times by far. I also got my husband, Mom, stepdaughter, aunts, and friends to watch it with me. My husband has almost watched it as many times as I have, including multiple times in one day. It is by far his favorite movie of all time, too. You have to see this movie!!

","Once again and gain it proves that IMDB users' reviews can never be put to one side.
If you cannot stand musical comedies this is bad luck. If you only love them to death only once in a decade you're in luck. And then if you're unsure: plenty of songs, dancing and a seriously predictable scenario development with pet talks, heartbreaks and ultimately an end that won't make you wonder ""what if"". 
But just made in a brilliant way."

","Well what an interesting premise: he had what I believed would be a failry in depth look at both the genius capitalist that was P.T.B. whilst also knowingly casting a glance upon his epic disregard for human dignity and fair treatment.
The movie was not completely accurate, as few things done in hollywood are, yet casting Hugh Jackman was...far too tasteless a choice for a movie that was supposedly in the works for 7 years!. It had a few cameos here and there, but nothing sterling even. The performances were not breathtaking in the least, nor believable, the acting was mild and far too feminine in its goal for my tastes. And even my mother saw the film and was of the same mind roflolmfao.
 This was basically Dumbo meets La La Land; Okay, but nothing grand. Except one pretty and fetching red head/ auburn hair songstress. *shrugs *"
"vkjer","5","2","3","6 July 2018"," Entertaining, Hugh Jackman saves the movie.
","Entertaining if you are the right public. It is a mix between a romanced biopic of Barnum circus founder, High School Musical and Frozen, with some Glee features too. Vanessa Hudgens has been replaced by Zendaya, whereas Zac Efron is still around.
Question: why on earth are Hollywood celebrating such a con artist who got rich fraudulently? Or is it just a reflection of our times?"

","With the first beats that movie grabbed me and pulled me forward close to the screen.
More than one time I felt I should have stood up and danced (but at the age of 50, you´re not sooooo enthusiastic anymore).
It promises Entertainment - and by god - you´ll get it.
With a message plastered over it, that seems not very subtle.
But what the heck....
The cast was top notch from Hugh (one of his career best, so I believe) to nearly every supporting actress/actor.<br/><br/>The day I saw it at the movies found me walking into the next CD-Store to grab a copy of the Soundtrack. That is one of my favorites of my life.<br/><br/>I count this one to the best Muscial-Experiences I ever had - ""Singin´in the rain""/""The little shop of horrors""/""Sweeney Todd""/""""Team America - World Police""/""South Park - Bigger, longer and uncut""/""Disneys ""Aladdin""/""""Lion King"" (the animated, not the cgi-ones) - and can´t accept the cash-in they did when they let prominent singers redo the original songs. Absolutley unnecessary."

The songs were really good. The Repetition of some songs is ok, but the the repetition of the same select lines of a repeated song over and over and over and over and over and over and over again is sad and worth stopping watching it. Thankful it was at the end of the movie before the credits. Personal a can stand a song doing some repeat but when you have My Birds who love repetitive song get mad at it then there's a problem.
Not likely to rewatch. If I want to watch something with repetitive songs I watch ""Dora the Explorer"" or another kids show."

The ""show"" itself is amazingly choreographed and the songs are beautiful and memorable. I've been told that this movie is not the truth of who P.T. Barnum was, but I don't really care.

","The Greatest Showman really surprised movie. Back in 2017, I was quite pumped for I was one of the minimal people who actually knew about this movie before its release. After its mixed reviews, alike to this years Cats, I decided not to see it until a matinee in January. Over time, this film has become one of my favourite films of all time. Although it is filled with historical inaccuracies, it really creates a out of this world experience where you feel overcommed with joy on a pretty sad topic.<br/><br/>The film opens to a mysterious Circusman doing an introduction to his circus (we know its hugh jackman, we just do not know his character name yet) (The Greatest Show). The film then flashbacks to several years prior, where a boy works with his father inside of a rich family's home. The young boy falls in love with a girl named Charity, however she is being sent to Boarding School elsewhere. The two write letters to each other over the years. The boy's father dies as he is left in poverty. Now older, the boy, named PT Barnum (Hugh Jackman) asks the girls fathers hand in marriage before he elopes with his new wife, Charity (Michelle Williams) (A Million Dreams).<br/><br/>PT works for a shipping facility, which goes bankrupt. That night, PT returns home to Charity and his daughters: Caroline and Helen. As it is Caroline's birthday, PT creates a makeshift toy viewed as a wishing machine. The two children wish and dream vividly using their imaginations (A Million Dreams (Reprise)). PT sees a vision through the shadows of the machine and takes out a loan to create Barnum's American Museum: A wax museum for the unbelievable. Sales are minimal. PT realizes that he needs something alive to perform. He meets various figures including Lettie Lutz, The Bearded Lady (Keala Settle) (Come Alive).<br/><br/>The show is a massive hit. Due to a word used in a rather pessimistic review, Barnum changes it to be called Barnum's Circus. Searching for further financial success, Barnum asks Phillip Carlye (Zac Efron), a theatre producer, to join his team in exchange for ten percent of the company (The Other Side). Immediately, Carlyle is taken in a trance by Anne Wheeler's (Zendaya) beauty and talent. On a trip to England, Carlyle arranges for Barnum and the troupe to meet Queen Victoria. Victoria laughs maniachly at one of the jokes made by one of the circus freaks, Tiny Tom. Barnum then meets Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson), where he invites her to perform back in manhattan under his name. She accepts (Never Enough).<br/><br/>At the afterparty, Barnum bickers with Charity's parents, much to Charity's dismay. Barnum is praised for his works with Jenny, and forces his troupe performers into segregation from the other party guests. The troupe, led by Lettie, shows no mercy to social barriers (This Is Me). Carlyle attempts to go on a date with Anne, but is berated for his actions by his parents. Carlyle chases Anne back to the circus, where they announce their love for each other (Rewrite The Stars). Barnum decides to go on tour with Jenny, leaving Carlyle in charge of the circus. At the same time, Charity feels isolated and forgotten by Barnum (Tightrope).<br/><br/>On her tour, Jenny feels a rising sexual tension between her and Barnum. He informs her that he could never love her. There, Jenny cancells the rest of her tour and kisses Barnum in front of the press (Never Enough (Reprise)). Barnum returns home to Manhattan only to find the circus in flames after protestors set it aflame after that nights performance. Carlyle runs into the circus, thinking Anne is still trapped inside, but is saved by Barnum. The next morning, the press release the picture of Jenny and Barnum kissing and Charity leaves Barnum alone. At a bar, Barnum talks to Tiny Tom as the troupe enter the bar and celebrate the fun they had (From Now On). Barnum realizes he must rekindle his relationships and apologizes to Charity, which she accepts. Carlyle concieves the idea of putting the circus inside a tent, for the world to see. Barnum leaves the circus to Carlyle, while he enjoys life at home with Charity and his daughters (The Greatest Show (Reprise)).<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is nothing short of a masterpiece. It is intriguing and will leave you going through all of the motions. Now saying you wont leave the film singing ""This Is Me"" or ""Rewrite The Stars"" at the top of your lungs is a stretch, but there is no dud in the soundtrack composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Although Barnum was not a good man in anyway, we see an optimistic side of him in this film. Every performance is well acted and the voices are superb. It is nothing short of a musical masterpiece. It is unfortunate it will probably never transfer to broadway, for there is already a PT Barnum musical named Barnum.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman gets a 10."

","The Greatest Showman entails a perspective man whose name is P.T. Barnum. This original film is based on a real story in the century XIX about an ingenious man who went far with trick and dodges.
It narrates the story of a man who had a boring bank job, he forfeited it and decided to buy a museum. He wanted to gain more money and therefore he took advantage of odd people: a bearded woman, diminutive young boy...
This entertaining movie, you could find out a talented actor: Hug Jackman is one of the stars that appears in the film. He plays the main character, concretely the role of P.T. Barnum. Particularly, I think he's an outstanding actor, he can do anything he wants.
In conclusion, from my point of view this kind of movie could enjoy people love musicals. It's a story where you could learn about humility and do not judge people phisically, but as they really are."

","The Greatest Showman is a lovly directed movie about P.T. Barnums life and his shows in New York. This movie has a great story, not too long or too short. When the movie was over I wanted to see more, for many reasons. First to mention is the perfect cast with Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams and Zendaya. Especially Zac Efron as Phillip Carlyle shows that he can act really good. The wonderful scenes and the camera work is the next outstanding reason for this movie. The wonderful New York scenes are my personal favorites, but I also love all the others. Does my expression show that there are no unnecessary scenes? I would instantly answer it with a huge YES! The most breathtaking reason for you to watch this movie are the songs with the choreographies. They continue to tell the story and it's so much fun to see and during the movie time you just wait for the next song. Every song is a highlight of the movie! Just watch the phenomenal opening scene of the movie and you will remember my words, I promise. I recommend this colorful movie to literally everyone. Go ahead and enjoy the greatest show. You will come alive just take the ride to the other side.
Have a nice day!"

","There are a host of production numbers and scenes that are pure spectacle, and one can't say enough about the incredibly talented cast. Hugh Jackman shows a side I've never seen before in terms of athleticism and singing ability, and it's always a pleasant surprise to discover such talent in an actor who's not particularly known for it. The scene that really popped for me was when Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) and Anne Wheeler (Zendaya) performed their flying trapeze-like choreography during the 'Rewrite the Stars' sequence. It was way beyond magical and for me was the most entertaining segment in a picture filled with them. Though the depiction of Phineas T. Barnum (Jackman) here was almost entirely fictional, there's no question that the story, in the words of New York Herald writer W.D. Wheeler (Eric Anderson), was in the truest sense, a 'celebration of humanity'. I'm not big on movie musicals, and wasn't aware that this was one when I picked it up, but it left me spirited and enthusiastic with it's vibrant energy. It was as much fun as a three ring circus."

","I have enjoyed Hugh Jackman's acting ever since I first saw him in X-Men. When I learned that he was a song and dance man, I was even more impressed with him. He also seems like a stand-up guy in general. He must have been very passionate about this project to have worked so hard and so tirelessly on it for so long. The very first scene pulled me right in, and the film is full of color and catchy songs for sure. To quote the character Phillip Carlyle, ""Really, it's something.""<br/><br/>So why only 4 stars? Because Jackman's passion didn't translate to the screen, in my opinion. For me, this movie was like a confection for which they forgot to add the filling. They laid it on thick with the spectacle; and there's plenty of the popular ""stand up to the establishment"" chest-thumping from more than one character, but I didn't feel any true emotional payoff at any point.<br/><br/>I'll gladly watch musicals like The Sound of Music, Fiddler on the Roof (with their long runtimes), and The King and I over and over again, start to finish. But I've only been replaying a few of The Greatest Showman's scenes, and they're all musical numbers. Once the catchy tunes are out of my head, I'll probably forget about this movie altogether--because there's really nothing to it.<br/><br/>Knowing what I know about the making of this film, I would hardly call it a cold and shameless money grab. But I do feel it has no heart. All the computer generated animals that appeared seemed to highlight the point: ""Move along, folks. Nothing to see here."""

I gave this movie a 7/10 because of some minor inaccuracies in the life of P.T Barnum, but of course, its a movie so that's to be expected. I also feel, while this is a musical, yes, I know... its a little too, musical? If that makes sense... Sometimes in a rather serious moment of the film I find the quick occurrence of them just starting to sing can hinder my view of the movie slightly, but it doesn't disturb the overall film.<br/><br/>In conclusion: It's a good, family, friendly, film about the life of P.T Barnum with a good message.

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>""The Greatest Showman"" is one of the few newer musicals that actually lives up to its hype - it's heartwarming, grand entertainment. It's movie magic! I was never really big on musicals, which is funny coming from a guy who loves music. And I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>The problem with musicals today is that the songs aren't memorable. They may sound well produced, but either they don't fit the story, or they're generic. The other problem with musicals today is the opposite ... the songs may be fantastic, but the story surrounding the songs is lackluster or plain. A good example of that one is actually an older musical ... ""Xanadu"". The songs from that movie were awesome - the rest of the movie however was lame, especially the acting.<br/><br/>That, however, is not the case with ""The Greatest Showman"". Everything about this movie resonates well. The songs were very good. The story strong, and the acting above par. Every part of this movie supports the other. By the end of the film, I was actually humming along with the tunes during the end credits. The camera work and visuals stand out with excellent cinematography, choreography, and the pacing was right on.<br/><br/>This is a high recommend. I was invested in the characters and completely swept away for nearly two hours of fun movie making. Yes, the story is very loosely based on aspects of P.T. Barnum's life - a glorified account of his Circus years. But, I wasn't looking for a good historical biopic. I got what I wanted - a great musical movie experience and I'll be certain to watch this one again."

","First things first this movie is extremely entertaining as a family friendly musical but I have the same problem with it that I've had since its inception, casting P. T. Barnum as an underdog hero undermines the horrors of the true story. Leave the real accounts of these characters to one side however and I don't have all too much of an issue with the greatest showman. The musical numbers are all pretty good and are accompanied by fantastic choreography. The cast are also great, Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams turn in performances you would expect from actors of their talent and Zendaya and Zac Efron really hold their own in challenging roles. I think there is a more interesting P. T. Barnum biopic to be made but this works fine as a family movie with a good message. With a string of lazy and annoying kids movies in recent years this is a film I would highly recommend to any parent. It Doesn't fully sugarcoat it's source martial but it also still wants you to route for Barnum, depending on how that makes you feel, this movie ain't half bad."

"Magow-Intermean","10","1","1","24 March 2019"," The Greatest Showman Review
","The legendary ringmaster and huckster P.T. Barnum probably never even uttered the phrase he's most famous for, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Though he did say a lot of other things - including ""The bigger humbug, the better people will like it."" And that's one dictum The Greatest Showman takes on faith, delivering a lavish candybox musical bursting with broad strokes, bright colors, and bearded ladies.
Born a poor tailor's son, Barnum is a scrappy kid with brass-ring dreams and an enduring crush on the unattainably rich and lovely Charity (Michelle Williams) to match. Somehow, in a setup so brief it hardly pauses for puberty, their childhood friendship blossoms into a grownup passion deep enough to make her leave her cushioned life behind and bear him two daughters, Caroline and Helen (Austyn Johnson and Cameron Seely, respectively). Life is rough and laundry is hard, but P.T. is determined to give his girls the world he promised them, see? Which begins, misguidedly, with a sort of DIY museum (a vintage guillotine, a dusty stuffed giraffe) before evolving into the circus as we know it today. Or did for decades, at least: A wild cavalcade of sword swallowers and contortionists, trained elephants and human curiosities (Dog Boy, Tiny Napoleon, Guy With All the Face Tattoos).
First-time director Michael Gracey, working from a script by Jenny Bicks (Sex & the City) and Bill Condon (Chicago, Gods and Monsters, Dreamgirls), plunges ahead in a giddy rush, carving out ample opportunities for his stars to sing the soaring rock-opera compositions penned by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the gifted musical duo behind La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen. What he doesn't make much room for is subtlety; every emotion is signaled to the peanut gallery, every story beat landed with a foot stomp and a handclap.
The movie never quite stops feeling like Moulin Rouge! written in extra-large block font, or Broadway projected straight onto a big screen, which certainly isn't bad news if that's exactly what you love. Though it doesn't help that the 49-year-old Jackman, one of the most charming men in two hemispheres, is asked to play roughly half his age for nearly half the movie-or that Williams isn't given much to do besides twirl and nod and smile sweetly, unless she's frowning sweetly. There must have been real collateral damage from the kind of single-minded ambition that drove a man like Barnum, but there's nothing here that a tip of his top hat and a step-ball-change can't seem to smooth over by the next scene.
Zac Efron, as a high-society swain with a secret affinity for circus folk, and Zendaya, as a trapeze artist with a swirl of cotton-candy hair and a fine-tuned sense of social justice, bring a gentler, more life-size sensibility to the story (as well as the requisite Millennial romance). And Rebecca Ferguson and Keala Settle, playing songbirds of distinctly different class strata and mustache capacity, make the most of their supporting roles; in two of the movie's best scenes, each explores the psychic pain of a lifetime spent feeling like the Other in almost every room they enter. But The Greatest Showman hasn't come to linger on that kind of self-reflection; it's too busy delivering great spectacle, and a lot of swirly, shiny humbug."

","P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) is a near-penniless dreamer determined to build a better life for himself and wife Charity (Michelle Williams). A circus brings profit but not respectability - so he gambles it all on a tour for opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson).
A year ago, La La Land was hailed as the saviour of the movie musical, but it only went so far, aping the look but not the tone of the old classics. The Greatest Showman, on the other hand, is an unabashed throwback, consciously modelling itself on the likes of Carousel and The Greatest Show On Earth, but adding modern pop tunes and a whole heap of CGI. It races along at a breakneck pace and occasionally stumbles into mawkishness, but is carried along by Hugh Jackman's total commitment and some appallingly catchy songs.
Our hero is Phineas Taylor Barnum (Jackman), who we glimpse at the height of his circus fame before flashing back to a tough childhood on the streets - though he still manages to win the heart and hand of rich girl Charity (Williams). Dreaming of better times for them both, he cons his way into a bank loan and opens a wax museum, but when that threatens to go under he adds a collection of ""unique individuals"": a bearded lady (the stunning Keala Settle), the diminutive Tom Thumb (Sam Humphrey) and more. Success follows, but Barnum is still confined to the fringes of high society. So he gambles all he's built on the ""Swedish nightingale"", opera singer Jenny Lind (Ferguson), who hypnotises him and threatens his marriage, and a high-class tour of the country's opera houses.
The film races through its plot so there's more time to lavish on its big-production numbers, and it's here that director Michael Gracey's comfort with tech is both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, his meticulously planned dazzle really does glimmer with colour and flash, but he leans a little too heavily on the CG to stitch together impossible camera angles, create trapeze wires that don't obey the laws of physics at all and add in animal accompaniment, in a way that sometimes amplifies artificiality in an already tall tale. Perhaps that's in keeping with his subject - Barnum did, after all, put his giant on stilts and stuff the shirt of the ""world's fattest man"", so perhaps too much seemed like just enough.
Still, the story's more or less just a hook for, firstly, a succession of songs by Dear Evan Hansen's Pasek and Paul, and they largely deliver. There are four or five absolute bangers here, and you can count on at least one sticking in your head for a week or more. And secondly, it allows us to watch a brash, big-hearted, blindly optimistic turn from Hugh Jackman as the unsinkable Barnum himself. It's ultimately about that hoariest of clichés - learning what's really important in life - but it's delivered with such sincerity and heart that it's hard to mind."

","From the moment the first song kicks off you are pulled into the story. Hugh Jackman accompanied by zach effron make this work of art entrancing. The songs are very well written to the story, and the characters are easily related too. I had my hesitation buying this movie, but couldn't be more pleased I believe this movie is a diamond."

","It was an amazing film! Right down to the music, sound and the sound effects. But I feel this doesn't tell the full story, such as some parts where after jenny kissed Barnum. What happen to her after she quits? And some parts were made to let us think (Which I loved!). Like the scene where Hugh Jackman was not there on the table, some people can tell what it means some can't. But still Honestly a great film! Just need a little more stories in between some scenes!"
"Vic_max","Null","1","1","17 March 2019"," I was happily surprised ... a gem of a movie
","When I heard there was a movie about P.T. Barnum, I was immediately interested. Hugh Jackson's involvement made it further interesting. However, when I heard it was a musical ... ugh ... I lost all interest. I didn't see it in the theater.<br/><br/>But - I did finally watch it and the music was actually quite good. It wasn't exactly a watered down movie built on dancing and signing ... it was lavish, tuneful, quick-paced and engaging. While it wasn't a dramatic ""inspired by true events"" type move, that's ok. The end product was enjoyable and it was time well spent.<br/><br/>If you're interested in the subject matter, don't be turned off by it being a musical - it's still fun to watch."

","Absolutely amazing. We've watched this movie over 20 times so far and it's our favorite movie. In the years as a member of IMDB and the countless movies I've watched there is less than a handful of movies I've rated a ""10"". This is one of them. Soundtrack is also amazing."
"harlowjo","9","1","1","13 March 2019"," Life Lessons From The Greatest Showman
","The Greatest Showman is a story following the life of P.T. Barnum as he goes through his childhood, pursuing his wife, having kids, his time as an entrepreneur, museum owner, and eventually a circus and entertainment producer. He creates the first circus ever and is still considered the greatest showman today. The movie demonstrates how he pulls together a group of different and exotic people to create an entertaining show and how they work through multiple challenges and problems throughout the process.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is a unique story that shows us the creation of the circus business through a musical. The story focuses on the importance of being different and having creativity. It displays the idea of accepting differences when it comes to our talents and being ourselves. This story could be eye opening to someone of any age, presented through an entertaining and enjoyable musical. The music sung by the different characters brings in powerful emotion that I believe wouldn't be there without it.<br/><br/>The main character P.T. Barnum was a strong believer in using what makes us different and our unique talents to create something entertaining and surprising for people to enjoy. Throughout the whole movie he has great persuasion when it comes to giving people hope and courage to be themselves. In the movie he says: "" ""No one ever made a difference by being like everyone else"". This shows how his clever use of words made a big difference in giving the people involved in the circus the courage they needed to get through the hate and judgement they constantly were receiving. I also found many inspiring quotes within the music sung by the people in the circus. The Bearded Lady is the lead singer in the song, ""This is me"". During this song she sings lines like: ""When the sharpest words wanna cut me down, I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out"". And ""I am brave. I am bruised. This who I'm meant to be. This is me."" These express the level of hate these people recieve for being part of this circus, yet they do their best to fight through it for the people who are enjoying it and for themselves because it gives the a chance to express who they are.<br/><br/>To conclude, The Greatest Showman is a sensational movie with a great cast and an amazing soundtrack that incorporates important life lessons and an entertaining storyline that can warm the hearts of watchers at any age. If you enjoy fun musical movies with a lot going on like La La Land, A star is born, or Mama Mia, I would recommend this movie to you. No matter where you are or what you are doing this film will excite you and make you want to get up and dance and I believe that makes for a good watch."

","I have to plead ignorance here...I did not know that this movie was a musical until shortly after it began. At first, I questioned whether contemporary music could be successfully used in a period piece set in a time with horse drawn carriages. To my pleasant surprise, the music, the choreography, and the overall story hit on all cylinders. The telling of the rags-to-riches story of PT Barnum, eternal optimist and salesman, entertains from start to finish. While the script is somewhat simple, the audience feels the joy and pain of Barnum's vision as he rises from nothing through his imagination, and the joy and pain of the freaks and sideshow acts that he recruits from the shadows to become his faithful family."

"thekarmicnomad","7","1","1","5 February 2019"," A movie that will reflect your mood
","A musical about a ""freak show""<br/><br/>There are two ways to look at this film.<br/><br/>1:
A trite sickly dollop of Hollywood treacle where beautiful people fly around the screen belting out pop songs.
The supporting characters look up at the main character with damp, thankful eyes as he steamrollers over their lives.<br/><br/>2:
A heart warming piece of escapism with amazing sets, production and choreography.
An unwavering lesson that no matter what hand life has dealt you there is always a way to succeed.<br/><br/>In my opinion both of these statements are true and it really depends what mood you are in when you sit down to watch it.<br/><br/>Some of the plot elements will certainly stick in your throat.<br/><br/>My girlfriend absolutely loved this and (unsurprisingly) I think this may lean more towards a female audience.

"tabuno","8","1","1","28 January 2019"," Entertaining, extravagant, glittering song and dance with a bit less emotion and drama
","Unlike Hugh Jackman's mostly live musical Oscar-nominated performance in Tom Hooper's Best Oscar Movie ""Les Miserable"" (2012), The Great Showman is recorded and lipped sync'd which gives the movie's gorgeous, powerful songs, unfortunately, a sort of artificial quality reminiscent of the older, traditional grand musicals of the sixties My Fair Lady (1964), Mary Poppins (1964), and The Sound of Music (1965). There are even elements of a few scenes that have more in common with a lavish version of episodes from the television musical series Glee (2009-2015) and echoes of musical MTV videos. Nevertheless, The Greatest Showman is entertaining, extravagant with extended bursts of energetic, glittering explosive song and dance routines such as the Oscar-nominated song ""This is Me."" The themes of love, greed, betrayal, discrimination are both timely and well presented, though not quite as emotively and dramatically riveting as Les Miserable, Moulin Rouge (2001), or another Best Picture Oscar winner Chicago (2003)."
"blackfordrovers","10","1","1","27 January 2019"," Critics pan it, you'll love it

"Joeybananas5","8","1","1","26 January 2019"," Critics got it wrong...
","First off, this is obviously a fictional movie. Yes, P.T. Barnum was a real person, but this is about as loosely based on his life as a movie can get, and the movie makes no attempt to convince us otherwise. It's Hollywood, and Hollywood's job, first and foremost, is to entertain. THAT'S what this movie is about. Anyone going into it looking for a history lesson will be sorely dissappointed.<br/><br/>Now to the movie....not since Moulin Rouge has a movie so wonderfully executed the period piece musical. The music is absolutely fantastic...hats off to Benj Pasek and Justin Paul....and, like any great musical, is an integral part of the story telling. Is the story perfect? No, but it does a wonderful job of getting the point across without being too preachy. The main takeaway is a lesson of acceptance and love, and it's a lesson that we could all use a little reminder of from time to time. If you choose to see it, do so with the goal of being entertained, and you will not be dissappointed."

","A few friends I know spoke widely of The Greatest Showman and even told me to see it for myself, but I was not at all willing to go see it. However, all of that changed for the better when I did and found out a few songs were mesmerizing and enchanting enough to hear. Hugh Jackman really kicked it up with another impressive musical performance following from 2012's Les Miserables now as ringmaster P.T. Barnum.<br/><br/>In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, Phineas Taylor Barnum grew up with barely anything as a young boy, but when he found love in a young girl from a rich family who openly despised him over his impoverish background and then proposes to her as they got older, he decides to show the world what more he can do by finding unique people and performers to put on a show for all to enjoy.<br/><br/>The amazing cast that also included Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams were also a plus for this movie (glad to see and hear Efron return to his singing roots since his High School Musical days). And the plot? Explaining how the duo Barnum & Bailey came to be as circus founders in musical form was something I didn't expect. I think the true breakout in the cast is Keala Settle as the Bearded Lady with her song ""This Is Me."" True, there were some historical inaccuracies, name changes, and not meant to be entirely on point with the circus' true humble beginnings, but I'll bet this was the film crew's way of keeping the story moving with its moments of romance, drama, conflict, and deception. Despite Barnum facing so much criticism from the brutality of locals who were either discriminatory toward his circus troupe or resentful of who he is in general, he went and proved them wrong that he had a knack for making his hard work a reality, no matter who he and his troupe were.<br/><br/>Newcomer director Michael Gracey did an exceptional job and a remarkable soundtrack (namely ""Rewrite the Stars"" performed by Zac Efron and Zendaya is also a catchy tune). Some songs still play inside my head whenever I think of this movie. I have no regrets. I enjoyed plenty."

My daughter got me into it by playing ' The Greatest Showman' on 'Light Sabre.'
She then went on to say what a great film it was and that she loved it.
That piqued my interest.
There's not a duff song anywhere and a couple really do give you goosebumps.
Not a fan of musicals but this was one that has really got under my skin.
I even said to my daughter that I was quite proud of the fact she liked this film because of the messages it delivers.
The fact she introduced it to me sort of proved I've brought up a well rounded daughter.

"smolenovaalzbeta","8","1","1","21 January 2019"," One of the best films.
","The greatest showmen is a musical with Hugh Jackman, Zendaya and Zac Efron in it. This film had premier in 2017. Film is about one man (Hugh Jackman) who wanted to had a circus. He did everything to had it and he didn't afraid to risk. He bought an old building and created circus. This film was directed by Michael Gracey in his directorial debut, written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and inspired by real story.
In my opinion narration of story was really absorbing and amusing. I really like musicals and I thing this is the reason why I am a big fan of this film. I really like character of showman. He was ambitious and adventurous. When he needed to do something he did it. What was for me the best thing was music, which was catchy and choreography was ideal.
What I didn't like were not really scenes. I know it was filmed by real story, but I thing It was a little bit fictional.
At the end I rate this film as the one of the best films what I ever seen. I recommend it to every person who like musicals and relaxing films."

","It's ok, with good performances from pretty much all the cast. But it's not a patch on something Moulin Rouge or La La Land. It's not bad but the songs aren't quite good enough to really excite or tug ar the heart strings, the lighting isn't quite good to create an immersive realty and the editing is very basic.

","The Greatest Showman had promise - it failed with the Broadway musical approach.<br/><br/>Sets were constructed as if for a broadway stage (low budget and poorly executed by movie theater standards). Musical numbers were catchy and relatively good, but did not fit the movie or the venue.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this - if I want to see a Broadway play, I will go to New York City and see a broadway play. I do not want to see a Broadway play on my local movie theater screen. (Fences was a perfect example of this failure, and now The Greatest Showman is added to that list!)"

","P.T Barnum became orphaned at a young age, left all alone in the world and poor. But that never stopped him from being creative and full of imagination, or a desire to become something memorable in the world.<br/><br/>After marrying his childhood sweetheart and being a proud father of two daughters, Barnum (Hugh Jackson) loses his job and struggles once again to make ends meet. Barnum soon gets a creative spark and risks it all with the dream of becoming a Great Showman who presents the odd, the strange and the unique to the world.<br/><br/>In case you're not aware, this film is a musical. Being a musical, this will normally scare away many movie goers as the film promises some singing and dancing. But, I'm happy to admit that The Greatest Showman is far more than just another musical film. This film had a great story and fantastic acting.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (no surprise) is solid as the leading character, once again giving audience members chills and watery eyes from his performance alone. From the opening act it didn't take long for his character to become someone rather fun and likeable. Other acting performances from both Michelle Williams and Zac Efron were also well cast and provided outstanding supportive roles. Going into this movie, I never thought I would come out saying that one of my favorite musical numbers would be a number between Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron.<br/><br/>Another point of praise is the film's pacing. Let it be known on social media that I am not a major fan of musical films (more so when they are very sad musicals ...), but this is a musical film that is fast pace and well timed. Even during the Musical numbers, I never felt bored with the musical scene, nor did I ever roll my eyes and think 'oh man not another damn song'. Each song tells a story and that story moves quickly, full of excitement and without feeling dull or uninteresting. All the musical tracks of this movie are new and have many creative elements to them. Combining this with the film's great story, you have film that can be enjoyed by all ages. I enjoyed the film's positive message and I would easily recommend this film be viewed by many.<br/><br/>It should have came as no surprise that this film's success has come heavily from another outstanding performance from Hugh Jackman. There is so much praise to be given to the many other cast members such as actress Michelle Williams. I also feel this was an excellent choice for the actor Zac Efron as he took a break from doing crude comedy films. Even if you're not a fan of musical films (like me), this is film that really shouldn't be missed. There is more to enjoy than just musical numbers here- this is film that carries amazing cinema elements and will leave you joyful.<br/><br/>8.8/10

And I can only chant along with the praising, just saw it for the second time and yet another time I'm astonished from this completely wonderful film!
First of all it is very nice shot with beautiful scenes, lightning and camera-work. The singing and dancing is so inspired (again compare to lalaland where they dance like sticks and sing without inspiration) and you can tell the cast had fun doing this (TIP watch rehearsals, so lovely). Over all everything is excellently delivered and the story is so beautiful with many layers that all take their place without being skipped or taking to much screentime. WATCH THIS FILM. The soundtrack is gospel-inspired with a touch of modern pop so don't expect classic musical-feels to it. Expect more. Cause this film is more and it soars over what critics seem to comprehend.

Yes - ""Men suffer more from imagining too little than too much."" It was so visually rich and the text so resourceful that I would need to watch it again right away to take everything in.

Hugh Jackman plays PT Barnum and I had a hard time seeing Wolverine singing show tunes.<br/><br/>Basically it's the story similar to The Island of Misfit toys with a bunch of ""freaks"" finding a world to fit in and Barnum learning to control his own ego and keep his family intact."

The movie disappointingly only scratched the surface of what it could have been. I'm not suggesting I have better ideas for the movie, but it generally felt somewhat empty in the story after watching it.<br/><br/>Despite its so-so plot, it lives up to its rating, and genre. I have yet to find one single song that I do not absolutely extol, that being said I also praise their choreography (especially Rewrite the Stars), it was just so imaginatively amalgamated and executed that it is enough to ameliorate its lack of depth in plot and more.<br/><br/>Overall, whether you are looking for a good plot or not, this is not a movie to be skipped - in terms of songs, it is arguably the best musical ever.<br/><br/>-EDIT: Added one star.

"ribbonsandroses","10","1","1","26 October 2018"," i've seen this movie 7 times
","The Greatest Showman directed by Michael Gracey (IMDB Greatest Showman) is like a fever dream of catchy sing-alongs, swirling colors, daring cinematography, and uncaged passion... in a good way. The movie, in the form of a musical, is based off the founding of the Barnum and Bailey Ringling Bros. Circus. It isn't just the incredible voices behind each musical scene, but the acting that goes along with it that ties this movie together.<br/><br/>We haven't seen Hugh Jackman (P.T. Barnum) in a musical since 2012 when Les Miserables premiered (IMDB Les Miserables). Where have you been Hugh? His voice has the perfect balance of pitch and rasp and in harmony with the rest of the chorus, still stands on its own. This is especially seen in one of the final numbers, From Now On, when he is running through the streets of New York City but his voice is still tied to the party in the bar.<br/><br/>The supporting characters really made the movie. Can we take a minute to appreciate the bar scene between Hugh Jackman and Zach Effron? All eyes should be focused on the dueling voices of the two leading men, but my eyes were instantly drawn to the skilled hands of the bartender (split-cast Daniel 'Cloud' Campos and Rod Roberts). He/They had skill. Whether it's the simultaneous bottle flipping and drink slinging or the insane ability to do this along to the beat, they definitely had more personality than either of the other two actors during The Other Side. Complimenting this scene was the costume design chosen by Ellen Mirojnick. Along with the battling voices was the contrast of red and blue.<br/><br/>The opening and closing scenes were particularly stunning. We started with Hugh Jackman striking a Bob Fosse- like pose in the shadows and flipping the tail of his coat, or Zach Efron doing knee spins surrounded by a whirlwind of activity. There was so much to enjoy, but it was a little difficult to focus on one specific performer. That's the circus for you. The glittering costumes, unique choreography, and complete individuality of each character in the circus didn't appear disconnected in anyway. The CGI animals were a great substitute for the real deal due to the unhealthy nature of using animals in movie productions. They tied both scenes together and really created the actual feelings of joy, excitement, and expectancy of being in the audience of the Ringling Bros. Circus.<br/><br/>Passion bleeds from this movie. Love is intertwined in every fiber of it. Whether it's a daring trapeze act with two lovers embracing high above the ground or a shared moment of magic in a dilapidated old house, there is love. The singing and dancing are no different. In every number, the facials and energy are hard hitting and honest. This is seen in Keala Settle leading the charge through the snow in This Is Me and Rebecca Ferguson's real tears and quivering lip during the reprise of Never Enough. The movie touched on issues of race, prejudice, and inequality despite being set in the 1840s. Interracial love and the problems that come with are displayed in not only one scene but four. There's determination from both of the actors and the tension seems real. The best example of this scene is Rewrite the Stars where a Romeo and Juliet like defiance of destiny reaches its peak and we are all very much here for it.<br/><br/>I definitely give this movie two thumbs up and a smile because I dare the box office to make $434 million off of another musical. See this movie. You'll love it."
"edrybaaudio","9","1","1","21 October 2018"," There's One Born Every Minute.
","Those are the ACTUAL words of P.T. Barnum, and NOT the words you often hear attributed to the man, ""There's a sucker born every minute"". Barnum NEVER said the previous sentence.<br/><br/>That being said, I worked on many LIVE musicals in a number of theatres. By the time I was fourteen, I had a mustache and a deep voice, and as Technical Director, I was telling ADULTS what to do. I only mention this because all those musicals I put on stage (pretty much always with the same crew, ALL of whom were talented and terrific!) because those shows were what are now considered to be ""Classic"" Musicals - shows like Gypsy, The Music Man, Carnival, West Side Story"" and TONS of others - ALL followed the same formula, with minor variations. You know... ""Boy Meets Girl, Boy and Girl fall in love, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl back: HAPPY ENDING!<br/><br/>ALL of the ""Classic"" musicals do this, and The Greatest Showman follows the formula. HOWEVER...<br/><br/>This musical is like NOTHING written since the early 1960's, and whether it's an accurate portrayal of the life of Barnum or not, THIS musical could be destined to become a ""Classic"" musical that gets performed locally by County, Municipal and High School Theatre Companies all over the USA.<br/><br/>Granted, although the music in this show was VERY good, it's certainly NOT period-correct for the time in American History when the events depicted took place (and that goes for the stuff the writers made up, too). But I can't say I didn't enjoy it. I DID!<br/><br/>So, to wrap this up without giving much away, I shall use terms Early Hollywood borrowed from Barnum himself: ""IT'S COLLOSSAL! IT'S STUPENDOUS! ONE COULD GO AS FAR AS TO SAY: IT'S GOOD!!"""
"mcavnah","10","1","1","21 October 2018"," A fantastic musical!

"rockman182","7","7","18","21 December 2017"," The Greatest Showman (2017)
","Alas, the holiday season is upon us and with that the holiday season of films. A nice mix of buzzworthy films and Oscar hopefuls, this time of year is wonderful for cinephiles. I was mildly interested in checking this film out because it looked like a capable musical. After La La Land, you had to expect more musicals attempting to emulate that film's success. I have no problem with that, I have plenty of time for all times of films. The Greatest Showman stumbles on problems with its script and storytelling but make no mistake about this film having a glorious soundtrack and fantastic production and set design.<br/><br/>The film is (apparently a rather loose) telling of the story of P.T. Barnum and his struggle to make something for himself and his family. His initial idea of a museum isn't a success but he get's the idea of an innovative form of entertainment involving unique individuals with rare talents formerly shunned as outcasts of society. Yes, this becomes the modern day circus. I don't know exactly how truthful this is to the original story but I sensed that this film is heavy on dramatization and made things more peachy and roses than they might have been.<br/><br/>The plot is thin, there isn't a whole lot of development of side characters and you will feel like this film falls short ass a well written musical, like that of La La Land. It's well written in the sense that the songs in the film are quite excellent. Catchy, elegant, and near impeccable in sound , the soundtrack roars and impresses. The same has to be said about the choreography, the dance numbers, costume design, and the glitz and glamor of the early 90's and the grand circus theme. Its honestly a visual and sonic experience that's worth the watch alone.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that this film doesn't overstay its welcome with an under two hour running length. It sort of zooms by and perhaps could have added more meat to its bare story but I'll take that over a long and dreary musical that becomes dull because of its length. The Greatest Showman may get lost in the award season shuffle but it does its job of being a fun time.<br/><br/>7/10"
"gkeith_1","10","8","22","20 December 2017"," PTB the Greatest
","Phineas Taylor Barnum is one of my biggest heroes in life. You all know that I just love musicals. PT inspires me all the time. He in real life was a marketing genius. If he were still alive, the Ringling Bros Barnum and Bailey Combined Circus would not have gone out of business in May, 2017. That was a total tragedy.<br/><br/>I have studied this man's life, for many decades. Here was a man who came from a poor New England time period - specifically born before the War of 1812 and growing up in the midst of a financial depression - one of many U.S. depressions. He could make money from absolutely nothing. He found that people, a lot of them, would fork over their small amounts of hard-earned cash in order to participate in one of his hocus-pocusy outrageous ideas. <br/><br/>He built upon these small successes. He was no dummy. He was very smart and shrewd. Eventually he brought the lovely famous Scandinavian singer to these shores, as depicted in this film. Jenny Lind Crib, anyone? Yes, her name is still famous here. <br/><br/>More of his famous talent are depicted in this film, ala Tom Thumb. What about Jumbo, Barnum's famous elephant? I don't remember Jumbo from the reviews. <br/><br/>Late in life, after several entertainment careers, he began his famous circus, with an accountant names James A. Bailey. After Barnum passed away in 1891, the circus kept going and during the decade of the First World War (100 years ago) merged with that of the Ringling Brothers. <br/><br/>I have been out ill this year, having heart surgery, but I still have made a few movie reviews. This is one of them. Please post this review. I hope to see this new film today or tomorrow, Wednesday or Thursday. This Friday is my birthday. <br/><br/>Again, I am an historian, with a university degree in American History. I am also an actress, singer, dancer, film critic and movie reviewer. I feel that some of P.T. Barnum's greatest successes occurred after the time period of America's Civil War. Certainly, his famous circus came from that historic era. <br/><br/>I will give this film a ten out of ten, sight unseen. I just love musicals, so add more points. Everyone, go see this film. Have some fun in your lives. Phineas Taylor Barnum still inspires. <br/><br/>Note 1: PT was the mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut. I visited there, looking for memorials to his life. I saw some, like a plaque in front of one of the buildings or perhaps the old city hall, in 2006. <br/><br/>Note 2: I saw a PT Barnum televised film starring Beau Bridges as Barnum, some decades ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a drama. I don't remember it being as colorful, however, as this new 2017 Barnum is said to be."

"theneil-52113","3","5","12","31 January 2018"," Hip Hop Meets Marxist Cliches
","The art of the musical has evolved wonderfully--but you wouldn't know it by watching The Greatest Showman."" People don't just start singing mid-sentence! The director needed to check out Chicago and Moulin Rouge. There has to be a point to a song. And speaking of songs, this is the most abrasive collection of virtue-signaling, grating, talentless and eye-rolling noise you will ever find. These songs are laughably bad and tuneless and unmemorable. Leaving a musical, one should be humming the music. You can't, however, hum noise, which these songs are. The Marxist class warfare trope starts early when a boy Barnum gets slapped by, of course, the rich, evil white guy. And the social justice warrior nonsense persists throughout. The music is bad extraordinarily bad, but the dancing is even worse--not because it wasn't performed well--it was. It is bad because it is exhaustingly hyperkinetic and, worse, inappropriate for a movie set in an historical period. Hip hop is fine for a music video, but it's jarring here. On the plus side, both Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron cut fine manly figures as ringmasters, and much of the art direction and cinematography are excellent. Too bad they're wasted on a bunch of tripe."

"gollumsmeagolrocks","1","7","19","27 December 2017"," Critics hated Vertigo too... and Psycho... and The Big Lebowski... need I continue?
","I honestly believe what we are experiencing right now with this movie is an example of a term I refer to as ""Blade Runner-itis,"" simply because it happened most prominently with Blade Runner. It's a condition where criticism for a masterpiece is so inherently negative on its original reviews simply because it is so unique in what it does that there is nothing previous with which to compare it and therefore cannot be immediately understood. Critics, while not entirely simplistic, gloss over anything they cannot immediately understand as bad and therefore these masterpieces are overlooked for a short time. <br/><br/>With this film, for example, it's actually a good thing that it uses so much in-genuine things like overly choreographed sequences and frequent auto-tune. The whole idea the movie presents is that Barnum achieved his whole legacy on lies. He's not REALLY creating something beautiful, he's simply putting on a show... because he's ""The Greatest Showman..."" the greatest liar. He promises all these performers a wonderful place to thrive and end their ridicule, only to toss them aside and abandon them. The auto-tune and unrealistic amount of choreography is another lie. There are two stand out sequences (I won't reveal what they are, no spoilers) which are the only sequences not auto-tuned, if I am correct, where the emotion is more genuine. This happens when the characters realize they've been duped and been tricked by fraud and consumed by the beautiful lie and thus seek to undo the lie. Critics complaining that the film promotes Barnum instead of vilifying his lying, scheming nature frankly either didn't watch the film at all... or are just idiotic."

","As much as The Greatest Showman delivers greater performances particularly from most of the cast with the likes of Hugh Jackman (who never disappoints), Zac Efron, Keala Seattle, Zendaya, Michelle Williams and others and even the music and soundtrack that was looks supposedly to be ""superb"", this movie suffers a greater let-down and wrecking mess in which greater performances from the cast couldn't redeem it.<br/><br/>First of all, the direction is really off the rails given the fact that the film's director Michael Gracey whose track record was based on directing music videos was unable to deliver a solid direction that could have made the film more livid and intriguing. Second, the writing had its good lines except that it made the film rifled with major historical inaccuracies considering that this film is based on a true story of P.T. Barnum and his circus which its depiction of the story made it mediocre and worse, erroneous given the main character's background being seen with darker and questionable history and even dreadfully ignored the circus' dark past in favor of a fictitious depiction. Worse, this film's plot is convoluted and nonsensical. To add insult to the injury, terrible racist depictions of stereotypes are all over the place.<br/><br/>Third has to do with another questionable performance from Rebecca Ferguson whose portrayal of Jenny Lind whose character was considered as the ""Swedish Nightingale"" suffers a glaring issue particularly the singing voice despite the fact that the singing voice was being dubbed by Loren Allred and Ferguson didn't commit herself to singing on her own and while her acting is still appreciated, the singing voice made it another additional problem for the film's historical inaccuracies.<br/><br/>Fourth, despite the film's good costume and production design and its good cinematography and choreography; the film really came out as style over substance, favoring performances as well artful and artistic merits over story, depth and character development, making this film a flashy and disappointing mess. Even the editing and pacing made it more dreadfully convoluted, confusing and dull.<br/><br/>Lastly, what's so disappointing and perplexing is that the Pasek & Paul duo made a disappointing contribution to this film following their great track record for La La Land is that much of these songs they've written despite these songs were entertaining, they come off as bland, fake, and forgettable and worse, very terribly annoying. Even ""This is Me"" song is also considered as forgettable, overproduced, stupid and idiotic despite the ironic fact that it serves as a anthem for the prejudiced and disabled which is really just seen as laughable. The Greatest Showman is truly dishonorable, disgraceful and terribly a laughing stock to the contribution of the revival of contemporary musical films and really an abominable travesty to the superior La La Land and other great musicals including Moulin Rouge!, Chicago, and Dreamgirls.<br/><br/>With all these problems that's plaguing the film's quality, this film is definitely not recommended to be seen even if anyone loved this film's music and soundtrack but honestly speaking that The Greatest Showman in its soundtrack is considered the worst soundtrack being made in this decade."

I was going to watch it for about 10 minutes and then before I knew it the credits were rolling and I felt so much joy that I had to rate this a 10. Not many movies nowadays can bring you joy or make you think of your childhood, but this movie did just that. This is the picture of the year. Shame on critics for downplaying a really great movie. The music is truly addicting and now I have to get the soundtrack. I want to know more about PT Barnum that now I want the book. See what this movie has done to me? If a movie can do this to someone, then I cant rate it any lower on my scale. GO SEE IT and BRING THE FAMILY!!!"
"silvuple","5","4","9","17 January 2018"," Mediocre and weak
","Ladies and gentlemen, The Greatest Showman is not great. The plot, although loosely based on real life person P.T.Barnum (who, based on his Wikipedia page, had an interesting, controversial life), is weak and predictable, the characters are uncompelling and underdeveloped, the songs are mostly forgettable. 
1. the main plot - nothing we haven't seen before. It is mainly a love story: boy meets girl, boy is poor but has ambitions, oh and there is a circus show in the background. As this movie is loosely biographical, there were many aspects in P.T.Barnum's surely eventful life the movie could have borrowed and explored, but instead it settled for soapy clichÃ©s.
2. the subplots - forbidden love, society acceptance, parental acceptance, inequality, rich vs poor, herd mentality, racism are all worthy themes that are lightly touched in this movie but are not explored, don't get much screen time or development and are presented in a stereotypical manner. 
3. the characters - no character stands out. There are no great ""good guys"" and no great ""villains"". The main characters are not compelling, the supporting characters (mainly the circus people) barely have names or lines. The circus people are just backup dancers in this movie, they don't have backstories and we don't even get to see their show numbers really, only some show finale dance routines here and there, nothing more. Besides the bearded lady and the trapeze girl who do get their own songs, rest of the show people are interchangeable and inconsequential, a background setting.
4. the songs - just forgettable, not bad, not great, not ones that make you want to go immediately and buy the movie soundtrack (like Moulin Rouge or Chicago for example). Likewise, the dance routines are good but not spectacular. Only exception for me is the ""everything you ever want, everything you ever need"" tune, that one did get stuck for a while.
6. the actors - are good. I personally didn't care for Hugh Jackman's singing voice, but he is a good actor. Michele Williams looks great in this film, but I guess don't have enough material to work with to show range and gives an overall forgettable performance. Zac Efron looks earnest. 
6. the animals - it bothered me to see wild animals (CGI or not) like elephants and lions jumping through hoops and standing on hind legs for crowd entertainment. Historical accuracy aside, they were nowhere in the movie until the last few minutes, so adding them seemed pointless to the plot anyway and given that in present days we have much better understanding and sensitivity to animal rights and wellbeing, adding them to this family friendly film seemed a bad decision. 
Bottom line, I didn't enjoy this movie and I doubt I will ever watch it again. It had potential, but it did not work for me. Go see it if you are bored and have spare change and you like musicals and watching people dance, but don't expect too much. 5 out of 10."
"view_and_review","5","4","9","15 January 2018"," I'm Calling BS
","All I knew going into this movie is that it was about P.T. Barnum. I had know idea it was a musical and that almost killed it for me. It wasn't even on my radar as far as movies to watch in the theater but hey I have MoviePass and this movie was showing. <br/><br/>Although it was a musical and I'm not a fan of musicals there were some good tunes in there. Of course the majority of the songs ran eight minutes long (seemingly) but the singing was good and the tunes were catchy. They were very modern for a movie about the 19th century but I was willing to forgive that inconsistency. <br/><br/>The story was a feel-good, beautiful, heart-warming story--I mean all that good stuff. This is not me being sarcastic or facetious, it had a very good message and theme. But I'm calling BS. <br/><br/>I'm not calling BS on all of it, just certain aspects of it. P.T. Barnum was probably an imaginative visionary that saw a way of entertaining and making money by showing the odd and freakish. What I don't believe are those that were in the P.T. Barnum circus. America has a dark past that involves the criminal mistreatment of certain people, and I don't mean bearded ladies, small people and siamese twins. A certain race of people were wholly enslaved and ostracized, yet in the mid 1800's P.T. Barnum had mostly African-Americans in his shows?? Get real.<br/><br/>And I don't know much about P.T. Barnum but my guess would be that he was out to line his own pockets first, second and last and whatever it took to do that he would do. Did he bring some joy to the world? Probably. I still doubt that he had one joyous jubilant staff that couldn't wait to show off their oddities. The movie was too harmonious and sanctified to be about real events. Such a movie in and of itself is excellent, just don't revolve it around real people and real events."
"orange775","10","4","9","5 January 2018"," A wonderful instant classic hated by the snobbish critics!
","I, myself is not much of a writer, but often come to IMDB admire all the great writing in the review sections by other. After watching this film three times in the theaters, and reading the biased and pretentious review by the so called professional critics (completely opposite of user reviews), I just feel compelled to write an review while I don't even like musical.<br/><br/>Like many other user's review, ignore the critics, go see this instant classics! if you enjoy musicals (I'm not even a fan to normal musical), watching/listening to this would be heaven on Earth experience. Not only the songs are catch, but the lyrics are beautifully written specifically for every scene in the movie. <br/><br/>If you enjoy great cinematography like I do, you can appreciate every detail of the director's vision, and the editing of the film are so perfectly put together. I was awed from begging to the end even watching for the 3rd time.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a good romance or drama, you will not be disappointed. The story is quite simple, but there are differences when a good story teller vs a bad one. Even though this is considered a musical, the director made this movie's transition from beginning to the end seemingly smooth, you almost forget its a musical. Every song or speech starts naturally. Casting and acting are perfect in every way. From the first second of the film, you can feel the intensity and passion from Hugh Jackman. Every supporting actors are equally good. <br/><br/>In summary, it doesn't matter if you are a man or woman, old or young, every one can truly enjoy this! Every time I watched this, I hear voices behind me say this was the best movie they've seen in a long time. It is just too underrated. In this age, everything has to be big explosion or crazy CGI from a comic book story. There are just not many movies that make you feel good while still put on a spectacular show!"

Acting, Scene, and Musical are just too awesome. The lyrics are so powerful.<br/><br/>Thank you for making this greatest movie."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","4","9","4 January 2018"," A great show
","Love musicals, always have from a very young age seeing the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'West Side Story', 'The Sound of Music', 'Calamity Jane', 'Singin in the Rain' and Disney musicals. So there is absolutely no bias against musicals, though there are bad ones out there and ones that are still enjoyable or mixed where stories, scripts or both are not strong suits. <br/><br/>Went to see 'The Greatest Showman' yesterday with my sister, having been blown away by the trailer (one of the best of the year to me). Both of us found ourselves loving it, it actually is one of my favourites of the year and loved it just as much as 'La La Land'. Like was said with another 2017 favourite 'Paddington 2' it was a breath of fresh air after a variable year seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart as well of course some gems. <br/><br/>Am not sure where the critic bashing (which has been blown out of proportion for some time now for a lot of films, acclaimed and panned, and is getting incredibly annoying and abused) is coming from. Despite the low Metacritic score and the average one for Rotten Tomatoes, actually personally have seen a lot of positive reviews and word of mouth even from people hard to please.<br/><br/>Is 'The Greatest Showman' perfect? Not quite. Some secondary roles are sketchy at best and only serve as ones getting in the way of the troupe overcoming obstacles and adversity and providing conflict. A few of the dramatic parts, like the fire, veer on the slightly melodramatic. Those are my only real complaints.<br/><br/>Anybody who has heard of Jenny Lind will need to suspend disbelief at how she would never have sung like she does here. No record survives of her singing (apart from a rumoured cylinder recording, recordings that often didn't do justice to singing voices, particularly in later life and when they were past prime, and nothing like how they are documented as), but from what has been read about her personally her vocal production and technique is too perfect for a voice that has been described as an acquired taste voice despite immense popularity and admiration. Can overlook that, because ""Never Enough"" was so brilliantly performed and it is hard to match what Jenny Lind sounded like when you don't have the audible evidence and only have documentation on critical reception to go by. 'The Greatest Showman' is also not that sort of film to do that.<br/><br/>Honestly feel however that the historical inaccuracy, as a biographical drama 'The Greatest Showman' is heavily fictionalised, can, and should be, easily ignored. It is so easy to be captivated by the incredible dazzle and delights of the spectacle, and not many 2017 films left me feeling charmed, with my heart fully warmed, fully entertained, uplifted and with tears welling up in my eyes. 'The Greatest Showman' did all those things, from as early as ""A Million Dreams"" and never let go.<br/><br/>'The Greatest Showman' looks amazing, one of the best-looking films of the year. It is one vibrant and classy shot and frame after another, the colours are eye-popping without ever being garish or exhausting and the period detail is as sumptuous as they come. The editing is dazzling and if this is a directorial feature film debut honestly can't wait to see where 'Michael Gracey's directing career takes him.<br/><br/>Was wholly captivated by the song and dance numbers. To me the songs were truly infectious and catchy. ""A Million Dreams"", ""Never Enough"" and ""This is Me"" are the particularly memorable standouts. The choreography is a sheer delight in its energy, class and verve, ""This Is Me"", ""From Now On"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" are just jaw-dropping. The cast do them justice. Vocally, Loren Alfred in ""Never Enough"" and Keala Settle in ""This Is Me"" are brilliant and the aforementioned songs for the choreography are especially well danced.<br/><br/>Personally don't agree that 'The Greatest Showman' lacks substance or that the dramatic parts are empty. Sure the more dramatic sections are not as memorable, as well done or as entertaining as the song and dance numbers. Some of it is melodramatic. However the family scenes do have a lot of heart and charm, are sympathetically and touchingly played and the girls are adorable. The themes and values are not hammered home too much and are relevant and as relatable today as they were then. <br/><br/>Couldn't have asked for better performances, especially the pitch-perfect one of Hugh Jackman, showing that he is fully at ease in musicals as he is as Wolverine. Despite loving him as Valjean in 'Les Miserables', the role of P. T. Barnum suits him much better particularly in the singing, he sounds incredible with a more even and attractive tone. He is as light-on-his-feet as the great dancers of the Golden Age classic musicals were (capturing the spirit of this era was another thing 'The Greatest Showman' excelled at) and he handles the dramatic/family moments with nuance. <br/><br/>Zac Efron not only sounds wonderful and dances a dream (especially in ""Rewrite the Stars"") but shows that he can act, he has come on such a long way and this is the direction he should be taking. Michelle Williams is sympathetic and touching and Rebecca Ferguson is every inch the operatic diva. Keala Settle and Zendaya are especially good of the troupe and the singing voice of young Barnum is beautiful. <br/><br/>Overall, really is a great show. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","Musical movies normally aren't my thing. But after seeing a YouTube clip of Hugh Jackman and the cast, singing their hearts out to the 20th Century Fox executives, trying to get this movie the green light, I was sold.<br/><br/>Hugh had undergone skin cancer surgery for his nose, just the day before he and all the other singers would get together in New York for their big day. And his doctor told him firmly, that he was NOT supposed to sing, or the stitches would come loose. He went anyway for support and being the showman that he is, tried to rally the troops for their battle, without phrasing a single note (with none other than Jeremy Jordan being his voice). All went as expected until the end, where he couldn't hold himself anymore, the whole room exploded and magic....true magic happened. (search for ""Hugh Jackman From Now On"" on YouTube)<br/><br/>That same magic shined throughout the whole movie, giving me a grin from ear to ear and (probably due to me not getting enough sleep during New Years Eve) a trembling lip and moisty tears. You know, the tears that stay with your forever. The good kind.<br/><br/>That's the impact The Greatest Showman had on me. All the songs were stunning, catchy and upbeat. The cast was phenomenal and their colorful costumes together with their infectious joy made me forget I was sitting in a theater. I can't wait to watch it again!<br/><br/>And to the critics who blast this movie for not being historically accurate: ""When was the last time you smiled or had a good laugh? If you as a critic can't find enjoyment in the theater. Now who's a fraud?"""

","I went to see this with my wife and 3 children. We all absolutely loved it. My wife came home and immediately bought the soundtrack. My son (who gives out """"lame"" assessments to just about everything) loved it.
The songs were catchy. I cared what happened to the characters. So many of the scenes in the film were absolutely beautiful. The choreography overall was brilliant and there is one particular scene involving shot glasses that is simply stunning.
Some of the negative reviews complain about sketchy storytelling (it's a musical!), lack of historical accuracy (it's a musical!) or racing too quickly from one period to another (it's a...). I might as well review the Shawshank Redemption and say that the song and dance numbers were really poor :)

It took liberties with time-lines, combined characters, created fictional situations.... and so what?

","Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to The Greatest Showman (2017)<br/><br/>Following on from the misfires Chappie, Pan and Eddie The Eagle, Jackman was certainly not playing it safe with this movie. This film was a dream project for Hugh Jackman since 2009, and he really had to fight to get it made. According to Jackman, the seven year development process was due to studios' unwillingness to take a risk on an original musical.<br/><br/>When the movie was in the process of being green lit, the cast had to have a full read through in front of the studio and the producers. Hugh Jackman had surgery on his nose to remove skin cancer. Hugh Jackman had 80 stitches and was told by his doctor to not sing. Hugh Jackman followed the doctor's recommendation until it came to the last song From Now On where Hugh chose to sing. Halfway through he noticed his nose was bleeding. His stitches had burst when he was singing. Now that, my friends is dedication.<br/><br/>This is Michael Gracey's directoral debut. Jackman and Gracey met on a commercial shoot. Jackman told Gracey he wanted to make a film with him, and Gracey took it with a grain of salt (he said every famous person he'd worked with had made similar promises) To his surprise, Jackman later sent him the script of The Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>This was hands down my favourite movie of 2017. My eldest son watched it on its opening weekend and he said i'd love it, and recommended I see it on the big screen, or I'd regret it. He was right, I loved it. It's easy to forget the awful reviews this movie opened to, it became a phenomenon as people went back time and time again. In the UK, it was in cinemas longer than The Last Jedi and it still playing in cinemas, when the DVD was released. How often does that happen? It was also the biggest selling album of last year in the UK. NOT 2017, when it was released, but last year. Recently, Jackman himself admitted his family are getting sick of hearing the songs everywhere.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's charm makes it impossible to not get behind his PT Barnum, Zac Efron is clearly having fun, Zendaya is gorgeous (my son has a real crush on her) and is a talented actress too, but for me it is Katie Settle who steals the show as the bearded lady. Her song This Is Me, is now an anthem, that will be performed on talent shoes for a long time to come.<br/><br/>It's filled with good, catchy songs (as all good musicals should be) Rewrite The Stars, A Million Dreams, From Now On, Never Enough, The Other Side and of course The Greatest Show are all great and over heardnkost of them performed on karaoke in the time since it's release.<br/><br/>I could waffle on about this movie for a lot longer, but I will not bore you with it.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman grossed $174 million at the domestic box office, to end 2017 as the 18th highest grossing movie of the year."
"anishchari","2","3","6","1 March 2019"," A movie crafted by executives without heart or vision
","The Greatest Showman is the most painful cinematic experience I can recall. I heard this is one ""the critics got wrong"" and with some skepticism watched it in its entirety. Had I not watched it in a group I would have turned it off after 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is not a creative endeavor like any good art production should be. It's a movie made in a factory assembly line by a group of people who know what a movie LOOKS like, but lack any heart or imagination to cobble it together into anything but the most bland, generic pablum to turn a profit before heading back to the line to hammer out another one. It takes no risks and fails in almost all aspects of movie-making save costume design.<br/><br/>This is the not-so-true story of PT Barnum, a public figure no one was interested in learning about and certainly not this sanitized version. It's a rags to riches story with some moralizing about tolerance and family that we've all heard a hundred times. But even these most basic of Hollywood sentiments they can't get right. It's supposed to be about acceptance and tolerance of people that are different, and simultaneously be about a spectacle of bearded women, extremely tall & fat men, and black acrobats. The black love interest may be the most offensive character, as I honestly didn't even know she was black until it was suggested as much by another character. They don't even have the gumption to cast a character whose skin tone is more than 2 shades darker than Hugh Jackman. The actual black actor has no speaking parts whatever and is more a prop than a character, as is the fat man and the tall guy. You know what would have been interesting? Making the love interest the bearded lady. But this is Hollywood and the factory specs called for just a teaspoon of diversity and nothing more.<br/><br/>The story is a bore. The movie is scarcely 100 minutes but it feels like it goes on forever. It's squirm inducing from pillar to post, always threatening to end but never doing so. It's a risk-less, trite affair with passable acting performances and no stand outs.<br/><br/>Oh but it's a musical you say, so it's really about the songs and choreography, right? Fine, but these echo the production ethos of the rest of the movie. Every song could have been ripped straight from the top ten pop hits and no one would know. And in fact that's exactly what they did, there are at least 2-3 songs that I recognize from top 40 radio. It is the most boring, milquetoast music available, made in a boardroom. Every song sounds the same and none are memorable. The choreography could have been pulled straight from any MTV music video - with the addition of a few CGI elephants, lions, and the odd flaming hoop. The most offensive moment is when an opera singer performs. Finally! Something that won't sound like a pop song. But what follows is more Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand than anything even remotely operatic. It was that moment I knew the movie was beyond redemption and would have turned it off there if I wasn't watching in a group.<br/><br/>I am not a musical hater. You can make creative musicals like The Little Barber Shop of Horrors, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, I don't even mind the classic 90s Disney movies or the new Les Miserables. But this? There is exactly one song number that was at least mildly entertaining because it helped with characterization and had a glimpse of novelty: Jackman's duet in the bar room.<br/><br/>Some people will argue this movie shouldn't have to take risks, it's a PG feel-good movie! But I didn't feel good. I felt a mixture of anger, boredom, irritation, and frustration. This should offend the sensibilities of any cinema-goer over the age of 15. The Greatest Showman is the worst kind of movie out there; so bland and produced it offers absolutely nothing new or interesting and the only thing worth discussing is how painfully mediocre it is before shoving it down the memory-hole never to be spoken of again."

","I stayed for one hour, couldn't stand it any more. Costumes were great. Hugh Jackman seems to excel at period films. Unfortunately, it was a musical (which one doesn't learn from the trailer), and unfortunately, the music was terrible. So it was hard to sit still for the music, and finally I couldn't sit still for it any longer. It reminded me of the music in Dream Girls and also La La Land, which was all over the place. I don't know how a singer would even be able to memorize this stuff. It doesn't follow normal musical patterns. Later it occurred to me that it seemed like they were playing the same tune over and over with different words. This didn't have to be a musical with terrible music. If it had just told a story, it would have been all right, although, based on what I've read, the story it did try to tell wasn't even accurate, and it hides a lot of bad stuff about Barnum. I just looked up a review, and it says this tony-winning duo of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul composed this music and that they also composed the songs for La La Land. Well, that's not surprising. I walked out on La La Land also. I love good musicals, but this was not one. I would rate it 1 or 2 except that the costumes and the scenery were quite attractive."

The critics def got the measure of this film wrong and word of mouth meant that the real fans kept it in the top 10 for far longer than anyone expected.<br/><br/>A visual treat for the eyes (Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron aside!), this story may be ""loosely "" based on PT Barnum's life but that doesn't matter - it's emotional, feel good and uplifting all at once and gets you straight into the action from the opening floor stamp.<br/><br/>If you watch one movie based on the recommendations of others, make it this one.

"alfiefresco","4","3","6","8 May 2018"," Does nothing special and still makes it boring
","The film is filled with unlikable characters. Especially the main character. He is rude and in many cases just wrong yet he is still trying to be shown as good. The main plot is nothing special and has been done many times before. It's predictable and has nothing going for it. The choreography was good but it could've tried more such as keeping actions that aren't part of the dance in time and more involved in the music. It's also over saturated with CGI which is just as useless as many of the characters. Including lions and other animals. The only reasonable character in this whole film is the ""mean"" critic who is the antagonist. All in all the film is boring, predictable and over saturated with unlikable protagonists and is awfully paced. The only thing going for it are the songs which each create a sense of joy and keeps the film upbeat at times. But after each song is more boring dialogue."

"aehurtado-03364","10","3","6","6 May 2018"," Most inspiring movie of our generation!!!
","This is the best movie I have seen in a long time! I have watched it 5 times in 2 days. I bought Apple music just to listen to the soundtrack on repeat. I know this sounds crazy, but when you see the movie you will understand. I've never had a movie speak to me the way this one does. It makes you want to jump out of your seat, sing at the top of your lungs, and wave your hands around like a maniac. But it's not just entertaining, it also has a beautiful message of how it feels to be an outcast or an outsider. Every person has felt this way at some point in their lives, and this movie captures that in a way no other movie or song has done before. There are lots of movies about outsiders wanting to be accepted, but this one grabs your heart strings and keeps pulling all the way until the end. I teared up at multiple parts and rewatched certain parts over and over. Hugh Jackman is an incredible actor and plays his character perfectly. Every person has wanted to be his character in this movie. Someone who rises up from nothing, against all the odds. We have all wanted more. And there's an incredible moment of truth when his wife, Michelle Williams, says ""You don't need everyone to love you, just a few good people."" We have all heard this before, but this movie portrays that message in a way that makes it tangible, relatable, and inspiring. Especially in the world we live in today. This movie makes you feel the rejection of each individual character in a way that reminds us how it feels to be vulnerable. It also reminds us to have courage and to stand up for what we believe in and to believe in ourselves. It reminds us that we are all people, we are all humans, and we should treat each other as such. <br/><br/>Every little detail of this movie was thought out and planned perfectly. Everytime I watch it, I notice something else that awes me. From something big, like when Zendaya and Zac Efron are flying around on the trapeze, to something small like how Hugh Jackman moves his fingers and hands in a way that make the music come alive during the song ""The Other Side"". Every detail is perfection. The perfect show, the greatest show! I applaud the actors who learned incredible skills to play their parts and the director who thought out these little details that make this movie ""sensational""!"

"alyssaarcement","10","3","6","1 May 2018"," The Greatest Showman is truly the GREATEST!
","Let me start off by saying I saw The Greatest Showman three times in the theater because I just could not get enough. The emotion and passion that was put in this movie starting with the actors, to the songs, to the sheer relatability to the characters. I was in awe from start to finish, I laughed with the characters, cried with them and felt their pain. I cannot image a more empowering a movie than The Greatest Showman. This movie is relatable on so many levels. It highlights how being a dreamer and going for what you truly want can result in an amazing experience. Taking chances and taking big risks all paid off for P.T. Barnum in the end, but he was not without his trials and tribulations. His need to fit in and be one with those that he had grown up ending up almost costing him the loss of his family. Character like Lettie Lutz give us all the feels. Each character is an ode to the underdogs, the forgotten, the beaten down, and the shamed. They all come together as a big family, in support and love of each other. In a time when shaming people publicly was still socially acceptable, these group of misfits and outcasts stand to change the ideas of what is accepted. People with abnormalities, skin color differences and those with disabilities do not allow the words and actions of others to let it bring them down. Instead we are given a powerful performance empowering themselves and showing that they are who they are, and they will not stand to be thrown away or cast out anymore. The final group scene in the pub truly shows how far they have come and grown as a family. They are no longer ashamed."

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The music, the choreography, the singing, the story, all in all one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. It isn't a documentary, it is a musical inspired by P.T. Barnum's early life and start as great showman.<br/><br/>It is strange that many of us first encountered Hugh Jackman, the actor, as Wolverine. That got him known but in fact he is one of the best modern song-and-dance performers. In fact when he was host of a TV awards program a few years back, in recognition of his ""great showmanship"" the idea of a ""Greatest Showman"" movie musical with him playing thre lead role was conceived.<br/><br/>Most of the story here takes place in the mid 1800s as P.T. Barnum (Jackman), a natural showman, first developed his Manhattan museum of oddities, then eventually ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" with his circus.<br/><br/>Michelle Williams plays his wife Charity Barnum and to my pleasant surprise she is an excellent singer. The only major character that did not do her own singing was Rebecca Ferguson as the Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind.<br/><br/>Lots of good performances, too many to mention in a brief review, but for anyone who enjoys a good musical this one is a real winner. I plan to watch it again before I return the DVD.<br/><br/>January 2019: I watched it a second time on BluRay, I came away with an even better impression. Plus the ""extras"" on how this movie came to be and how the songs were written are among the best I have seen for any movie."

The energy, the songs, the synergy between actors and the overall messages are brilliant.
Thankfully they didn't ""mask"" the plot with something that would sell to the critics. They didn't compress 100 things that (ie. shape of water) would make it look sophisticated/advanced or whatever else in order to appeal to them. <br/><br/>Instead, they got an amazing project that entertains and makes people happy.

","I could rave about how I've seen this film six times in theaters since December (I have) but I wanna address something more serious. I came across an angry review from a 'film student'. Well let me tell you, film student, I have a BA in cinema and it doesn't make you cool to trash on this movie. I could sit here forever and talk to you about how 'lion' or 'Hidden figures' were good movies, but easily half an hour too long, but I'm not going to. Because one day you're gonna be a director making what you think are meaningful films, living off peanuts because no one sees those movies. I am a disabled Hispanic woman and the absolute LAST thing I wanna see is a film about a disabled Hispanic woman. This is easily the funnest film I've ever seen, and not only that, the most profound. I went in expecting to just see a fun film, and came out crying my eyes out at how much I related. The story was beautifully written, JUST long enough to get the point but not so long we look at our watch constantly. I can't listen to 'this is me' or 'rewrite the stars' without crying. In fact, most of the films in this film have you in a puddle. So dear film student, don't think you are so high and mighty to criticize what makes a good movie, otherwise you might be a critical success but a commercial failure, and really the shelf of an oscar win is not long. If you're reading this, film student, I suggest you study the writings of Roger ebert. He was our last objective critic and gave every film its due credit. You could learn a two or thing from him. <br/><br/>To everyone else: I don't have to sell you on how spectacular this film is. You know. From the first frame that has your blood pumping and you cheering, to the final credit roll with tears flowing down your face, this is not a movie, it's an emotional experience, and there's something for everyone. I feel there's a lot of misconceptions about this movie. This is the movie Barnum would make About himself. He was a revolutionary. And to those who say it's a poppy movie aren't paying close attention. 'Rewrite the stars' may be a Pop ballad, but 'the greatest show' is rock, Akin to a michael Jackson song. 'From now on' has an old fashioned country feel. The music is SO diverse, which is part of what makes this film so great. We learn just enough about everybody to care but not look at our watches, like I said. I loved 'la la land' when it came out, but in retrospect, it takes WAY too long to
Get off the ground and frankly a lot that could have been cut. 'The greatest showman' is just the perfect amount of everything."

"newnoir","Null","3","6","2 March 2018"," The Greatest Showman: One of the Year's Greatest Films!
","I remember seeing the trailer for this film around Christmastime and while I dug some of the actors I wasn't that impressed with it. A movie musical about the life of circus impresario P. T. Barnum? <br/><br/>Cut to the aftermath of this film's opening weekend. It was written off as a box office bomb. Then slowly audiences made it a worldwide sleeper hit. Finally I saw it at a matinee and found it doesn't just grab you by the opening scene, it grabs you by the opening credits. The first of ten incredible songs takes you on this whirlwind musical journey that doesn't stop. Plus it's literally a highly colorful film that lights up the screen.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as P. T. Barnum is perfectly cast a romanticized version of the flawed, controversial showman. This film was a true labor of love for Jackman, taking him over seven years to get it to the big screen. And much like the critics in Barnum's day, the stuffed shirt critics didn't get or like this film. One critics's review I read actually complained about the treatment of the animals in the film! When any astute viewer could tell all the animals were CGI! Another described the newspaper critic character in the film played by Paul Sparks as a weaselly little move by the screenwriters, guess that character hit too close to home for that douchebag extraordinaire critic! Those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, review.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron have incredible chemistry in this film and the rest of the supporting cast including Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Keala Settle and Sam Humphrey all give fantastic performances. Though I would have liked have heard actor Sam Humphrey's real voice in the film and not dubbing they used.<br/><br/>Musicals are all about the music and that's the catalyst that makes this great, albeit imperfect, movie musical great. That and great direction by first timer Michael Gracey.<br/><br/>Here's one movie musical headed for its own Broadway show."
"phd_travel","6","3","6","8 January 2018"," Jackman's talent propels the show but the songs are weak
","It's great that Hugh Jackman has another chance to fill the screen with his singing and dancing talent. And he is truly the star of this interesting biopic of PT Barnum. His strong vocals and energy propel the show on and the story keeps you wanting to see what happens. Michelle Williams plays his wife. Her voice seems thin and weak compared to his and she should have been dubbed. Rebecca Fergusson looks good as the diva Jenny Lind and even though she is lip syncing she moves you when her character is singing. Her face with it's old fashioned beauty is just right for the period. Zac Efron is alright if a bit small sized compared to the rest of the cast. At least he can sing and dance. Not much chemistry with Zendaya. <br/><br/>The weak part of this movie is the music itself. The songs are derivative and the lyrics are banal relying on repetition of simplistic tunes and lyrics over and over again. The composing team is tragically untalented. The style of the music and songs are totally out of place with the setting. What a waste of such singing talent.<br/><br/>Things slow down during the rather forced dramatic climax.<br/><br/>Worth watching for Hugh"
"a_sad_cow","10","3","6","2 January 2018"," Brilliantly Executed
","Not my genre, so I was a bit skeptical, but this is truly masterfully done. Many times in the same scene you can see P.T. Barnum as he saw himself, as others saw him, how he saw the world, and how the world saw his business. <br/><br/>For the dance numbers, there were some subtle effects with brilliant timing. At first glance you might think of just the slow motion and real time synced appropriately to the music, but Hugh Jackman worked some magic with some stage props and a talented cast.<br/><br/>They also didn't miss a subtle humanitarian message that the mere creation of the circus addressed in its time. Being as society has largely learned what it can from this phenomenon, this movie also serves as a sort of time capsule to help ensure those lessons aren't lost. I haven't seen a proper circus in decades, and figure the industry is slowly dying.<br/><br/>This is a movie for everyone. Bring a date, bring the family, bring the kids!"

And I'm not talking about the singing and dancing (although he was fantastic in that too) ,the close ups on this man's face throughout this movie shows how diverse, emotive and sublime he is.
Zac Efron, Zendaya and Keala deliver perfect performances. And the whole cast is just sensational.

I have already seen it twice, bought the soundtrack, and may see it another time or two before it leave the theater, and will definitely be owning this one!
The critics seem to think this was supposed to be a historical documentary or something. It could maybe be classified as historical fiction. It is loosely based on PT Barnum's life, but sensationalized for screen. So, as I said, ignore the critics, they really are nothing but Humbug!!"

","The film starts off with a great holiday feel! The music is moving, though very modern. Hugh Jackman can sing! But, then, it starts to explore trite themes with no creativity, including the dreaded theme of ambitious Dad neglects his family. Yaaaaawwwwwwn! They pushed too hard on themes about inequality. A soft touch would have been perfect, since the film is about circus freaks. I loved the theme of the ""moral elite"" vs. the ""freaks, entertainment of the common people."" There wasn't enough about that.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a film that had more fun, more sensational circus performances, less domestic conflict, and songs that bring me into the major plot points of the story instead of as window dressing. (See Little Shop of Horrors if you want to know how it's supposed to be done.) <br/><br/>In fact, Zendaya and Zac Efron's song was right on the money.<br/><br/>Had to give it a 3, since I was rewriting the story in my mind the whole time to make it good. So, I enjoyed it."

Not only did the music not match the time period but the dances were way over the top. And Efron should've been Barnum because he stole the stage from Jackman. The movie would've played better as a drama, without singing and dancing."

I found the music to be generic, bland pop that sounded like it was created by a marketing department, in fact the whole movie seemed like a cheap, glittery plastic bauble from an arcade game. The songs were completely interchangeable and after awhile I cringed every time someone launched into song. There was absolutely no narrative; it seemed like a music video. There was a lot of talent but the characters were like stick figures, with no actual character development, and no motivation. There was not a genuinely creative moment in the whole movie. I started looking at my watch after about a half-hour hoping it would end soon."

Still, there is some nice camera work on show and a particularly nice scene involving Efron and Zendaya."
"burlesonjesse5","5","5","13","27 December 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Greatest Showman
","The Greatest Showman is my latest assessment. It is touted as a musical. Therefore, how can I possibly recommend ""Showman"" if its best scenes don't involve the actors and/or actresses breaking into song.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Greatest Showman comes off like hasty rags to riches stuff. It tests your show tunes patience but it could never be mistaken as boring. ""Showman"" is meager and flashy and I guess, betters something like 2014's Into the Woods. In truth, Into the Woods didn't have an actual hint of a story. ""Showman"" in fits and starts, sort of does. <br/><br/>Throughout ""Showman"", I kept wondering what the late P. T. Barnum (the movie's subject and true-life inspiration) would have thought had he been alive to see it. He probably would've marveled at ""Showman's"" energy and playful, near period look. At the same time, P. T. would've scoffed at the lack of depth used to recreate his own life's account.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman feels like a modern day take on Barnum's inception of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. It has lavish dance numbers accompanied by contemporary melodies that pound you over the head with their Muzak-like senses.<br/><br/>Rookie director Michael Gracey thinks he's making an Academy Award winner with ""Showman"". The unfortunate validity is that his film lacks artistic merit and has an unintentional ""popcorn"" feel to it. Gracey fills The Greatest Showman with plenty of razzle-dazzle. His pace is feverish with roving camera movements and a few whip pans. Sure his ""Showman"" has a narrative but its narrative is arbitrarily slight and takes shortcuts. Gracey would rather have his flick ""show"" off musically, freakishly, and visually. That explains the running time of The Greatest Showman which is a less-than-monumental 105 minutes.<br/><br/>""Showman"", with its characters comprised of a bearded lady, a dwarf, and an acrobat, stars Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Michelle Williams. Jackman takes on the title role of P. T. Barnum. Jackman in a way, is almost perfectly cast. He's got the looks, he can dance, and he can act. The problem is that he's not much of a singer. As for Efron, well it feels like he took on his ""Showman"" role to shake off his image of appearing in lots of teenage sex comedies. Here's the problem: The Greatest Showman is not quite the vehicle to break Zac out of his raunchy, frat boy shell. Rating: 2 stars."

","I read some critics reviews before I went. They ranged from 0 to 100. The movie seems to know this will happen since Hugh and the director thank you for coming to be entertained before the movie starts and the biggest jerk in the movie is a hoity toity critic determined to bring down Barnum's show. What critics want in a movie as they get paid to review it and why I want to pay to see a movie are 2 different things. Two quick thoughts..... 1. How can this be historically spot on anyway? Did Barnum sing and dance in every conversation he had from childhood on? Sheesh, just enjoy the great music and awesome dancing and remember that you had to Wikipedia Barnum's backstory before or after the movie because you didn't know it anyway. 2. The critics want character depth???? They can't just appreciate that the bearded lady nails the singing and the dancing, they need to see her pain and her being picked on from her first hair on her chinny chin chin.
Hollywood will hand you some serious crap and we all know it as we stand at a Redbox, flip through Netflix or decide if we want to take out a home equity loan to take a family/spouse/date out to a movie and buy any snack. If you want entertainment from start to finish without occasional lull's in between then GO SEE THIS MOVIE."

","First time i saw this movie, i can't help but cry pretty much from beginning to end. Also can't help my feet from stomping along with the music. I never cared much for what the critics say about anything and this is definitely one of them. This is my first review of a movie because I just gotta. Does a movie always have to be very deep with crazy highfalutin dialogue for the damn critics to consider it a good one? Well that's just plain crazy. This a really good, fun movie with great music that we can easily understand and sing to. Sorry critics, musicals does not always have to be an opera. Also, it is perfect for our times because of the divide and bigotry that's going on now. This movie has a moving lesson about that. Oh and the best part, it makes fun of high-brow critics. This movie, as described by Bennet--the critic in the movie-- IS A CELEBRATION OF HUMANITY."

I must agree that the musical did not exactly portray the history, but then it is not a documentary either, so to all the critics out there who bash this musical because it left out several historical details: grow a pair and enjoy what it is.<br/><br/>As a musical, it was extremely entertaining. The music was on point, and Hugh Jackman wow'ed me again with his talent. I am not a musician and cannot comment more about the music, I can only say I enjoyed it very much and I am confident that you will too.<br/><br/>As a story on P. T. Barnum, it surely ""over-sanitized"" Barnum as critics say, but anyone who watched the movie would be extremely interested in reading up about it, and in doing so, viewers would not be mislead by the movie. However, that does not mean this is not a good movie. It, in fact, makes this movie even better for telling a good story based on actual events and add in an important moral that is quite important in today's society."

","Ill go ahead and put aside the historical inaccuracies of this movie, although those alone are enough for a bad review, as if America has not had enough rewriting or history through pop culture.
This movie fails to be anything more then an excuse to sell music and fulfill Hugh Jack mans wet dream of a musical. One of the first area's where this movie fails is in the setting and tone of setting. The music is not at all consistent with the already inconsistent time period. Although this movie takes place in the 1800s, there is no way of knowing by listening to the pop-tastic soundtrack that was begging to get some top 40 hits. They did not even attempt to represent the setting.
This movie tries really hard to convince you that its a Icarus-esk story of a man climbing to great heights, only to fall and rise again under a more humble light. P.T. Barnum, never truly falls. He gets everything he wants and more with his circus and international show. The international show in particular is treated as if to be a bad thing regardless of international tours and shows being commonplace in modern American culture from large pop artists. Even when he has a what-appears-to-be affair with the woman he was touring with, instead of making him truly flawed and making the story make some since, they simply give him the cop-out excuse of ""he wasn't in to the kiss."" This is only one example of the movie having a plot that requires Barnum falling from grace, but does not him too in the same breath. What a garbage movie."

","Before watching this movie, I was someone who listened to the critics and based a lot of what I wanted to see on their opinions. This movie changed all that. While it has garnered a mixed review with critics, this movie is widely adored by audiences; guess which group I agree with.<br/><br/>First off, let me just say that the music is absolutely STUNNING. My five favorite numbers (in no order) are ""The Greatest Show,"" ""Come Alive,"" ""The Other Side,"" ""This is Me,"" and ""Rewrite the Stars."" These songs incorporate a mix of Broadway and Pop, and the vocals are absolutely amazing on each and every song!<br/><br/>Speaking of performances, they are all outstanding. Zac Efron's return to musicals after the success of High School Musical is well worth the long wait, while Michelle Williams completely took me by surprise with her great singing voice. Rebecca Ferguson and Loren Allred both give Jenny a beautiful voice, but there are three people that steal the show above all the rest: 1) If you're seeing this show, part of the reason why you're seeing it is because of Hugh Jackman; this man truly is The Greatest Showman, and I honestly put his performance here on par with his performance in Les Mis (he seriously should've been nominated for an Oscar here, too); 2) While I never listened to Zendaya's music, I definitely will from here on out. This woman has the VOICE OF AN ANGEL; her performance with Zac on Rewrite the Stars is absolutely heartbreaking and beautiful. Also, for the first time ever, Zac found someone with as much chemistry with him as he had with Vanessa Hudgens; 3) The breakout performance definitely goes to Keala Settle; it is her song ""This is Me"" that will make you want to get out into the street and start dancing. She has so much power in that voice of hers, and I was so happy to see her perform the song at the Oscars (seriously, this song should've won over Remember Me, and I almost never think that a song should beat out a Disney song).<br/><br/>In other words, if you've seen this movie, go and see it. This might just be my favorite movie ever. These guys absolutely hit it out of the park, and if it takes a few years for the critics to realize just how wrong they are, then so be it.<br/><br/>THIS IS THE GREATEST SHOW!"

","The Greatest Showman wants every musical number to be a showstopper. If it were Music Man there would be no ""Til There Was You""; there would just be Ya Got Trouble over and over. Everything is big, flashy, building up to a crescendo that wants the audience to leap to their feet.<br/><br/>For the most part, I wasn't leaping to my feet. A few songs rise above the noise, like the anthem-y ""This is Me"" and the zippy ""The Other Side,"" but often my reaction was, oh, this again.<br/><br/>Still, the first time I saw this movie was on an airplane, and when I watched it again on TV it seemed better than I'd thought and I raised the score from 6 to 7. Yes, there's heavy doses of auto-tune, a tendency towards pyrotechnical high notes, and a preference for rhythm over melody, all reflective of top 40 radio. But at the same time, the film has some lovely visual ideas, like glittering stars on a ceiling or hung sheets blowing on clotheslines, and the sheer constant hurly burly of big moments and empty flash means that if you don't like what's happening right now, you might well like the thing that's going to happen in 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Call it empty-headed fun. Enjoy the few people who sing so well that they aren't noticeably auto-tuned. Accept that almost everything in the film is untrue. And enjoy it."

"shannen-l-c","10","3","7","2 April 2018"," A true cinematic and artistic masterpiece
","Whilst The Greatest Showman is not a perfect movie (does such a movie even exist?), I simply had to give it 10 stars on the basis that there's nothing I can really critique. It's so fantastically put together and every single scene from beginning to end feels like it has purpose and meaning. Though the story is nothing particularly original or mind-blowing, it's engaging and heartfelt. <br/><br/>Most of the criticisms seem to be on the basis that it is historically inaccurate in its presentation of P. T. Barnum and his life, but honestly, who cares? This is a movie, NOT a documentary. Movies are made for entertainment, not to present facts, so to give it a poor rating or bad review on that basis is a pretty weak reason. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that The Greatest Showman is one of the best musicals I've ever seen. It ticks all the boxes - beautiful cinematography, costumes, choreography and songs; romance, friendship, family, sadness, self-discovery, loss; fantastic acting and a talented cast. Every area of the film is strong and when watching it, everything really does feel seamless. It just flows in a way that few films do. <br/><br/>The music is great and thoroughly enjoyable. Unlike other musicals every single song weaves into the scene its in and tells a story. The singing itself is strong from all of the cast and incredibly emotional. None of the songs feel out of place or forced, they always swell at appropriate times to allow the characters to express their inner emotions. It's exactly what a musical should be. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance as P. T Barnum was fantastic. Personally, I'd only seen him as Wolverine in the X-Men before now, but he proved himself to be a very versatlie and talented actor. The emotion and conviction he brought to the character of Barnum was moving and who knew he could sing! Likewise, Zac Efron's performance as Philip was impressive. Despite not featuring in a musical since High School Musical, it really seemed that he felt at home throughout the film. Just like Jackman he brought an emotional sincerity to Philip's character and being side by side with Zendaya (Anne) seemed to only further showcase his acting skills. The performances from the rest of the cast were equally as good and there's not a single cast member that I considered to be mediocre.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman will take anyone that watches it on an incredibly wonderful and emotional journey, leaving you feeling uplifted and with a smile on your face. There are so many valuable life lessons in there, but the most significant one is how important it is to embrace and love ourselves regardless of our flaws and to not let other people's hurtful words define who we are."

Just for once sheer beauty, perfection and the best of humanity is on display here, everything from the acting to the choreography to each and every song, the writing... All flawless... I don't care about the critics and their reasons for scoring this movie like they did, I feel sorry for anyone who can find reasons to not be moved utterly and completely by this masterpiece of a movie, not to let themselves go free and feel the joy of being alive even if just for a moment.

In short, yes, there is beauty in this world, can be fleeting, can be difficult to spot sometimes but I know every time I have a need to bask in it's glow all I need to do is watch this movie again with my family (and hug them close) If anyone from the production team stumbles on this review, I for one want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

","It's funny but about this time last year my wife and I watched ""La La Land"", the acclaimed, multi Oscar winning feature which was proclaimed as the great throwback celebration of the Hollywood musical and we were sorely disappointed. This latest movie features a soundtrack by the same songwriting team and of course is likewise a popular hit, both at the box office and the music charts but still we were trepidatious to watch it, but happily this time we got it.<br/><br/>Maybe it helped that the characters in this film were easier to like and relate to or maybe it's just that the staging, acting, singing and just the songs themselves were better but whatever the reasons this really was everything we'd expected. Both the title and the story hark back to 50's blockbuster ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" but even if there's occasionally a bit of a culture clash as modern musical stylings rub up sometimes a little incongruously against mid 19th Century Americana, the sheer energy of the piece carries it through.<br/><br/>The rise and fall and rise again story of barnstorming circus entrepreneur P.T. Barnum is naturally exciting, evocative and exotic with the viewer rooting for him and his band of underdog misfits all the way. The songs are terrific, the uptempo ones rhythmic and engaging, the power ballads moving and involving. The choreography and cinematography make excellent use of the circus backdrop, while the cast sell it for all its worth, especially the dashing and energetic Hugh Jackman in the title role.<br/><br/>In summary then, a wonderful old / new-fashioned musical family entertainment which will have you singing along and tapping your toes to from first to last."

It is a musical entertainment piece. I think it captures the exact essence that Hugh Jackman mentions in the movie. Is it a conventional film, no, but it is pure entertainment.

Frankly the critics can go suck eggs.

""Does it bother you that everything you are selling is fake?""
""Do these smiles seem fake?""
The movie is great. It isn't trying to be anything or say anything, it isn't condescending or manipulative, it doesn't linger on cliché situations for long and keeps moving through the story. It exists to make people smile and that is something wonderful. It really is like a trip to the circus. You don't go to the circus for realism, you go for a fun, colorful and fantastical escape from real life, that is what this movie is.
That all being said, if you don't like musicals you probably won't like this movie but I would still suggest giving it a chance and go in with childlike wonder, not adult bitterness and cynicism. Let it remind you of what a trip to the circus was like when you were 6, suspend your disbelief and learn to smile."

The movie is great. It isn't trying to be anything or say anything, it isn't condescending or manipulative, it doesn't linger on cliché situations for long and keeps moving through the story. It exists to make people smile and that is something wonderful. It really is like a trip to the circus. You don't go to the circus for realism, you go for a fun, colorful and fantastical escape from real life, that is what this movie is.
That all being said, if you don't like musicals you probably won't like this movie but I would still suggest giving it a chance and go in with childlike wonder, not adult bitterness and cynicism. Let it remind you of what a trip to the circus was like when you were 6."

","Disclaimer - I HATED La La Land with a passion. Worst film ever recorded. All copies should be burned.
The Greatest Showman is everything La La Land was hyped up to be. Showman has excellent music and excellent acting. You really care about these characters and the music moves the story along wonderfully. 
Found myself teary eyed a couple times, but overall - It's just a lot of fun!
Immediately at the end of the movie I asked my wife when we were going to see it again.
Love the soundtrack and will be downloading that tonight.
I never cared much for Zendaya but I even really enjoyed her in this movie.
Well done by all. Go see it!"

","Not sure who all the 'Critics' are and why they have anything negative to say about this film. If you want to watch more than just a feel good film then this is your cup of tea. <br/><br/>Right from the get go the first song sent shivers down my spine, not only that but it had my mouth wide open which soon turned into a beaming smile across mt face. I didn't have many expectations for this film due to me not knowing who P.T Barnum was or what he did, but my god did I know him after this movie! <br/><br/>Every single song is great. No really, there wasnt one song I didn't like, as soon as I got home I found it on spotify immediately. The singing that the actors did was amazing, from Hugh Jackman's big pipes to newcomer Zendeya's brilliant voice. I understand that there probally was slight studio adjustment, but who cares?<br/><br/>For someone who loves TV and film, and has watched a vast amount of movies/musicals/theatre I can honestly say you will love this film, forget the critics.This musical did what it is suposed to, It left me feeling elated with joy and humming every song out loud!"

","No other movie I've seen, expect for The Passion of the Christ and perhaps August Rush, quickened such deep emotions and inspired such hope inside of me. (""Hope in what?"" you might ask. After all, what point is there in hope if there is no object of that hope? My hope is grounded in the One who dreamed me as one of His million dreams. But, that angle on this film will have to wait for another time.) From the compelling story and sub-stories, to the fantastic soundtrack, this movie thoroughly captivated me. (Move over Rocky IV. I now have a new favorite movie soundtrack!) For a man who insists that men be masculine, this movie moved me to tears of regret and hope. Dreams are fragile and must be held gently lest we break them. I have come to realize that it is thoroughly masculine to be vulnerable in strength at times, to dream big dreams, expend great effort, yet be gentle enough to protect those dreams from myself when, in discontent, I reach for more. The Greatest Showman is a movie that I already wish I could see again for the first time."

","As a passionate artist and film fanatic, I appreciated every moment of this movie. Through an audience capturing introduction to the world of show business, then a taste of reality and the consequences of reaching for the stars, to a romance based on a passion shared by two very different individuals, to the true meaning of family and virtue. This movie has managed to capture every aspect of an authentic yet brilliant musical. Since the premier of 'Moulin Rouge', I never thought I could possibly find a musical that can ever be considered as good, yet, somehow, this was better. The cinematography, the sound effects, the lighting, the editing, the cast. Truly brilliant. I noticed audiences singing along to songs they never heard before, people clapping in the background. My eyes even teared up at some point. Highly recommended, deserves every nomination possible."

","Remember there's this critic in the Barnum show? Isn't this exactly the same as the critics we have today. Seems to me that the producers cheekily and deliberately added the critic character to make fun of the critics we have today. Hahaha.... This is a great family movie. Hugh Jackman is a class on his own. Zac Efron did well too. Michelle Williams, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson also performed really well. Keala is also great. Combined with powerful Oscar winning lyricists and composers Pasek and Paul, no wonder this movie is nominated for Best Motion Picture in the upcoming Golden Globe awards. I'm glad the judges aren't blind or deaf. My only criticism is that it is too short for a musical movie and some scenes seem a bit too rushed.

This film is wonderful. The story, the acting, the colour and costumes, the singing and dancing and the music but mostly I finally cared about the people and it had a happy ending. Sure it is shallow but it is entertainment. The film sweeps you along so you don't get bored for a minute.

","I may have been mistaken but this film is advertising equality with gorillas and bearded women. Then claiming that these events were true to try and make us feel special that we witnessed a true story. Hugh Jackman disappointed me from going from The Wolverine to a singing, dancing, cheating loonie. Being a child out of the High School Musical era, Zac Efron left a disappointing performance being a rich play boy, going for a girl half his age. I wanted to tear my eyes out when i saw the little boy about to sing the worst solo trying to make us feel sorry for him being a child on the streets with dreams, cliche or what. The film want even good enough to land a real award, all they got was kids choice award.
Every time i hear ""this is the greatest show"" on the radio i am deafened and reminded of that traumatic experience that i went through of cheesy songs to try and convince people that they are having a good time.

"Thebeta99","3","2","4","19 January 2020"," Fun Fiction
","My daughter saw this at a friend's house and convinced us to buy it. It is indeed a rousing good time with great musical numbers, but I can't get past the fact that the main character's name is P.T. Barnum. You see, P.T. Barnum got his start by purchasing an elderly slave woman (in the North) and telling people she had been George Washington's wet nurse. He pulled her teeth out. He charged people to see her for 10 years, until she died, and then he charged them to see her autopsy. That's just the beginning - his treatment of ""freaks"" was pure greed and exploitation. There's no origin story that will justify these acts.<br/><br/>I know, I know, I'm supposed to ignore all that and just have fun, but then Jackman should not have used the names of real people. If this film was presented as fiction, I'd still have some issues with the thin plot and anachronistic costumes and numbers, but I'd have given this an 8 for sheer fun. But I can't relax when I watch this film because I can't get past the whitewashing of P.T. Barnum's legacy (and I've lost a lot of respect for Jackman.) This is like making a saccharin musical about George Wallace, in which he high steps a line of adorable multiracial children into a Texas public school, as armed guards do backflips on either side. Would we consider that innocuous? Is it just too soon?"
"Seraphima12","3","2","4","5 January 2020"," A string of short music videos
","A very disappointing in terms of a movie. The story line is weak and left to bare minimum, the motivations of the characters are not clear, and the characters themselves are reduced to clichés. The title does not live up to the expectations - I still cannot perceive why the main character was a great showman?? Colleting 'freaks' and showing them to the public does not make anyone a great showman. Also, the movie seems to be patched together with a series of short music videos, some of which are quite repetitive in terms of choreography and execution. On the positive side, the costumes are lavish, the topic is intriguing, there are some interesting findings in terms of movie shooting and editing. But overall, the movie is not worth watching as it is void of meaning."
"conjh13-1","1","2","4","20 October 2019"," A bad farce

It's nothing but a big soapbox hiding behind a thin facade of glitter, preaching about equality issues that are completely out of place for the era.<br/><br/>The characters are bland contemporary caricatures, the musical numbers are all alike in the fashion of current showtunes, and the ""circus"" is little more than a few contemporary dance numbers with the barest smidgen of circus acts thrown in on rare occasion.<br/><br/>As far as historical accuracy, Jenny Lind did not quit her tour leaving Barnum in debt for it, there was no scandal with her and Barnum, and his financial woes were not caused by a fire burning down his museum. And the actual Circus wasn't started until decades later, when Barnum was 60."

"VikiLauda","4","2","4","27 February 2019"," Honestly?... Not the Greatest!
","Well I am giving this a 4 & this is for the superb acting alone!
I love Huge Jackman & the rest of the cast, who all did an excellent job, but I feel their efforts were wasted with no character development, a very poor screenplay & poorly executed plot. There was so much promise with this movie too, I got the feeling wasting that promise with bad writing was almost a crime! This movie is certainly a ""Moulin Rouge"" for children!
Now lets face facts here Barnum was NOT a very nice character, & this could have been explored better. A very well respect monarch, Queen Victoria is displayed as a sneering, giggling characture & Jenny Lind was NOT some man hungry, marriage wrecker! But by far the worst aspect of this film is the music. Too loud, too auto-tuned, & all the songs sounded the same with the same droning message of ""We can do this, inclusive, empowered people"" followed with a deafening chorus & a bang! The only song I did actually like was the foot stomping one, (can't recall the name though) & the only scene I really liked was Zendaya & the trapeze which was done beautifully, & impressively. As for the rest of it, it felt like an overly long pop video.
The very scarce spoken dialogue was also far too quiet & just as you are trying to adjust your bleeding ears from the music, you can't hear a thing, which is annoying as you are unable to follow the plot (not that there was one!) The only other likable aspect was the awesome costumes even if they were not historically accurate.
Well, if you enjoy overly loud in your face fluffy pop songs, rainbows, unicorns & safe spaces then this just might be the movie for you, however, those of us who are old enough to recognize an invisible plot, bad screenplay & have delicate hearing, avoid this one at all costs!
Finally, a BIG well done to the whole cast! You did your very best! x"

This movie is about Phineas Taylor Barnum, one of the greatest American entertainer and founder of the Barnum and Bailey Circus.
""The Greatest Showman"" is all about hard work, passion, patience and innovative mind. P. T. Barnum gave chances to those who were discriminated on different basis and were not accepted by the society and he gave them a platform to increase their self confidence.

"brunohatzfeld","3","2","4","18 February 2019"," Money can't buy quality
","Although I'm not a big fan of musicals, I've decided to give this film a try. I had good experiences with some movies of the genre before, and actually never had a really bad one so... why not?<br/><br/>Since the first sequence, something started to bother me: things seem... off. Place, habits, coreographies, songs itself. The movie never tells you the year, but by the scenario, you can imagine the age it occurs, by late 1800's to early 1900's. And it's based on real characters. And it's okay to create dysthopia, but this isn't clearly a good one. So why do coreographies with Michael Jackson moves, songs that sound so contemporary and characters that act that they belong to mixed eras?<br/><br/>OK, the characters being so advanced and open minded are the base of the objective of the movie. So let's not sin this. But you never feel the depth of them. You got a lot of great stories that could be told and the movies focus only in it main character, an ambitious man that takes advantage of the ""freakies"". His actions are quite mixed up and don't make you want him to suceed - actually you do so the others can suceed, but not him.<br/><br/>This happens mostly because this movie have no plot. Probably they write this thing in an afternoon. You identify like three major events and the way the movie leads you to them is always cliché. While they are singing a bad song, you always know what will happens in the next 15 minutes and the duration of the music is just a torture because you just want to be surprised by something but it never happens.<br/><br/>The movie has a formula, a really boring one. Goes like this: music > three lines of simplistic dialogue like ""oh she is mad at me"" ""what you gonna do?"" ""i have to make her happy!"" > music. The actors are clearly lost in most of the scenes, completely unenvolved with the script.<br/><br/>And the songs are so identical, there are two or three that really stand up. Specially when they decide to give the hairy woman a space and let Hugh Jackman and Zac Effron go take a coffee. The movie needed more sequences and songs like that.<br/><br/>And, boy, the editing. I never get bothered by chroma key, most of the time I don't even perhaps it. But in this movie the difference in ilumination will denounce the absurd usage of green backgrounds. Again, not a total problem as it creates a kind of atmosphere. But some simple errors in the editing make the chroma key scream at you and shows that this movie had no purpose but to make money.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because probably, with a cast full of stars and all this production, this movie had a lot of money to spent. But they chose only aesthetiques over content, and even in the focus they are totally unimpressive. At the end, The Greatest Showman is just like the main character: it bases itself in money ambition, a lot of lights and faking."

"fabianotto","5","2","4","6 November 2018"," Mediocre musical
","The musical is at best mediocre. It has a very thin plot which is carried by very thin characters. Hugh Jackman's performance is quite good but almost every other character is shallow and forgettable. The musical itself offeres some good choreography but the music is absolutely awful. It is like listening to that ever-present pop cant and whining from the radio. The biggest flaw in my opinion is the attempt of trying to be a critical commentary on historical circumstances. Early American race thinking and class consciousness are touched on but somehow the director decided not to go the whole way. Consequently, the musical ends up to be a very friendly and toothless musical monotony. I do not understand why so many people wrote don't listen to the critics - is objective taste here coerced upon people who simply have a different criticism to offer?"

"jcjalexander","10","2","4","15 September 2018"," I'm a little late posting, but what an amazing musical!!!
","I'm a tad late giving my two cents to this amazing musical, but WOW!!! I loved every moment of this show and the cast was incredible!!! What a wonderful message of love and acceptance through the use of cinematography and music. The Greatest Showman is exactly what you want a musical to accomplish. As I was watching the musical, I became filled with laughter, anger, sorrow and happiness. I was extremely sad when the movie ended. I was so sad I had to watch it again, then soon after order the soundtrack off of Amazon. Don't listen to the nay sayers and experience this truly great musical. This is one to go down as one of the Greatest Shows!"
"varnium","10","2","4","11 September 2018"," Worthy of Its Name
","Don't read other reviews and just believe me that the name says it all! It is truely the Greatest Showman! The drama is logical and touching but never too cheesy. The director can really capture emotions at the perfect moments. The entire soundtrack is very inspiring and can sell millions of copies by itself. Last but not least, it is just a masterpiece."
"heinhtut","10","2","4","10 September 2018"," THE BEST MOVIE.

","I don't normally do musicals, but as everyone has been raving about this film and all I hear on the radio is ""this is it"" I enjoyed this film more than I expected too, my only down fall with this film is some of the songs do drag on a bit, maybe turn it down a notch."
"john_siv","7","2","4","9 September 2018"," Good, but if only...
","This is a good, uplifting musical that, had more care been taken with the screenwriting, could have been an all-time classic.<br/><br/>The music is quite excellent. A good mixture of up-tempo and meaningful numbers that all fit the mood nicely. The characterisations are all excellent as well; this film is well cast and performed.<br/><br/>The big hole in this film, for me, is the lack of backstory in the first third. We blitz from Barnum's childhood to the opening of his museum in what feels like a matter of minutes. This picture really needed 30-40 minutes of character work, detailing his upbringing, romancing of his wife and his early business ventures. There were just enough shots here and there to make the screenplay passable, but a production of his magnitude needs a script that is vastly more fit for purpose.<br/><br/>That additional 30-40 minutes of investment in Barnum's backstory would have taken the running time to around 2hrs 20mins, which, considering the length of some of the great musicals, would, as well as being perfectly reasonable, have lifted it from a good film to a great one. As it is, it's a pleasant way to pass a dark, gloomy night, but not much more.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the picture, Barnum's wife tells him, ""I want the man I fell in love with."" Hard for that line to make any impact on the audience when the lead couple's initial courting was glossed over so quickly.."

Very few things keep my attention these days with the ubiquity of phones, laptops, etc. However, this is the first movie in a LONG time that I cannot stop watching. I literally can't take my eyes off the screen. I can imagine in the theater The Greatest Showman would overwhelm the senses. I usually wouldn't like musicals, but this is absolutely fantastic."

","I don't know where to begin about this film... any critic who gave this film less than a 10 has my deepest sympathy ... I never been more entertained by a film in years. I've already seen it five times and I just can't stop watching it..I was thrilled from beginning to end.
My favorite scene was the one with Rebecca Ferguson singing ""never enough"". I can't get that song out of my head. it is one of my favorite all-time top 10 songs now... The guys who wrote the songs for this film are artistic mgeniuses and the songs are 10 times better than the ones they wrote for ""La La Land"". Jeers to the AMPAS for not recognizing this film for more than just ""best song"", which should've won anyway! The song ""this is me"" is now a national anthem sung by everyone and the lyrics just tear at your heart full of meaning and emotion... some producers should get the bright idea of taking this film to Broadway. but it must have the same cast as the movie..: nobody could've done this better than Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron and Keata Settle... this is the best musical to come out in years and is a true work of artistic showmanship...I stand up and bow down to the producer and director of this film! An incredible masterpiece! No matter how much more I say or how many words I put into this review it would ""never be enough""! Packed with heartfelt emotion, This film really ""rewrite the stars""!"

"lewispower-94","4","2","4","1 August 2018"," This is...it?
","Contrary to popularly held views that this film is a dazzlement of storytelling, a head rush of spectacle and awe...it is indeed a film pertaining to attempt such things, yet falls woefully short. The movie, much like its varied assortment of characters, is a circus booming with life that never quite understands itself.<br/><br/>How so? There is little to no engagement with characters in this story, as the camera moves fleetingly from scene to scene: one moment capturing the rapture of young love, yet within seconds moving to the illness plaguing the character's father and onwards to the young boys supposed struggle with poverty. <br/><br/>This was covered in seconds, and yet is referred to in the final quarter of the movie - as though we could even remotely engage with the intended effect of these scenes. Much the same could be said for the entirety of the movie: a rush of scenes and characters that entangle one another, and could promise emotions and storytelling fathoms in depth...yet only succeeds in glazing over its stars with a fleeting brush, barely encapsulating even the most momentary glimpses of genuine depth or emotion.<br/><br/>Instead we are bombarded with song after song that attempt to capitalise upon emotional moments, yet because of its erratic pacing, these explosions of sing-song never quite ring true. The husband and wife song was laughable when introduced by the miming children, but to its credit, held far more substance and meaning when Jackman's character was grafting his way out of poverty. The chemistry between Efron and Jackman was evident, yet once again never explored or developed, thus Efron's character taking the mantle of circus master meant almost nothing by the movie's close. Ferguson however, though brief in appearance, enraptured me with her one feature song, the lyrics and performance of which resonated much more strongly and meaningfully than the identity politics driven ""this is me"" drivel. <br/><br/>This is a classic example of all style and no substance, though it's frustrating to see so much potential for character development (and thus more engaging storytelling) that is never truly recognized. I didn't connect with a single character. Watch it, but watch it with an open mind."

","We all love kids, right? So as we cherish the happy memories of yesteryear when the circus came to town (ironically the first thing that comes to mind are those gimmicky 2-for-1 tickets the local grocers would print in the weekly newspaper's food section) just as elementary school social studies class painted our country's history of American Indians with about 90% folklore, the same can be said of The Greatest Showman, a delightfully entertaining fairytale about how America's most celebrated circus began a long time ago, in a galaxy called the Milky Way. They've even managed to give Zendaya, the cute actress who livens up this film's romance despite endless Hollywood rumors alluding to problems on the set requiring extra doses of breath fresheners to help her male co-stars deal with what some have called unbearable intimate close-up scenes. They are human, after all. Overall, a disappointment."

If I want the history of the circus I won't be looking for it in a movie theater. Movie theaters are for ENTERTAINMENT! And now and then enlightenment. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is a TOTAL THRILL RIDE. The pace never flags, loaded with show stoppers and the BREATHTAKING ""Never Enough"". We all know Jenny Lind was an opera Diva but what writer in his right mind would interject an aria at the top of this roller coaster.

","This IS the real thing ! This is the right way to do a musical nowadays. Look at the cast, look and the acting, enjoy the song and extremity high performance of singing them. The acting was superb, the values in the movie were of great importance: family, honor, friendship, innovation, taking chances and (of-course) acceptance of the other. The film is a modern (high-rate) musical wrapped in a 19th century wrapper, but don't let it fool you, once you've started watching it - you get addicted to the great numbers and songs in it. Until this movie, it was very rare to see a tight singing and acting performance but now - there is a new standard in the market - The ""Greatest Showman"" standard, and it'll be very hard to meet. Personally, I was so amazed by several of the songs that I've immediately ordered and bought both the movie and OST which are highly recommended to all family and friends. This one is totally the opposite of the terrible La LA Land movie, and got a straight 10 from me. Enjoy."

"b2280545","9","2","4","24 April 2018"," Spectacular
","Hugh Jackman a.k.a the Wolverine returns for another spectacular original performance in an original musical/historical tale of someone who started out with nothing and rose to having everything needed to create a worldwide phenomenon. The Greatest Showman follows optimistic visionary P.T. Barnum on his journey to assemble a cast of talented outcasts of society to create the circus that eventually evolved into the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. This is Jackman's second film of 2017, the first being Logan, the final film starring and ending his iconic role as Wolverine. One thing this film does great at is reminding us audience viewers that while Jackman's career as Wolverine may be over, that doesn't signify the end of his career as an actor. Hugh Jackman truly is amazing in that sense and here we see him using his amazing talents for other areas of film acting and if anyone is more perfect to lead an ensemble cast of actors in a musical it's Wolverine and Jackman can definitely sing. This isn't the first time he has been in a spectacle of a musical film as he starred in the 2012 musical epic Les Miserables as Jean Valjean, a performance he killed just as he kills his role in the Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>Additionally, the rest of the cast do great work in their parts, some honorable mentions are Zac Efron (High School Musical) and Zendaya (Spider-Man Homecoming), both who killed their performances and are vocally talented, not surprising since both were once stars of Disney Channel. The background sets look as though it took great effort to get them to look so great, the costumes were designed smoothly and the musical numbers were beautifully written and performed by the cast. This is because the lyricists from the 2016 musical La La Land wrote several of the songs for the film. Despite all that made this film worthy of recognition, it did not have the same immense appeal as both La La Land and Les Miserables had when they were released. Like many film interpretations of real events, this one isn't without audience members calling it out for historical inaccuracies. Additionally the film got criticized for various reasons including the filmmakers representing acceptance of diversity themes, lacking in storytelling and creating a fantasy aspect through the presentations of Barnum's circus. While it may not be all perfect, Jackman himself holds the entire film together and it is simply a fun, inspirational, heartwarming musical for families to enjoy and not take too serious."
"dreamhousebooks","8","2","4","20 April 2018"," A true Barnum spectacle for family viewing
","Now when we go for movies our first expectation is to get entertained. We want to step out of reality, get our senses taken over and experience something grand. We want to believe that life can be much more than what we expect it to be. The Greatest Showman struck me exactly as that kind of movie made with keeping that same intention in mind. It is truly a spectacle for family viewing. Based on the life of PT Barnum, the showman who created the famous Barnum & Bailey circus, Hugh Jackman fits well in the shoes of Barnum and plays it with charm, rigor and childlike innocence. Treated with an exceptional cast and inspiring music, The Greatest Showman never fails to entertain. Its fast paced narrative combined with catchy song and dance sequences blend well with the story at all times.<br/><br/>The music is one of the biggest strengths of the movie and will resonate well with the audience for a long time to come. The Song 'A million dreams' can re-spark the buried dreams of a common man. The Oscar nominated 'This is Me' forces you to celebrate your uniqueness no matter what. The Greatest Showman not only brings a glamorous spectacle but leaves us with a sense of hope too. Michelle Williams also stands tall in her role as Barnum's wife. Her character is like a shadow to Barnum's but not the one you can miss. She brings lightness and strength to the movie when Barnum falters. She reminds you of someone who could teach you the pleasures and joys of simple things in life. Williams being an extremely beautiful woman herself, carries the role with grace.<br/><br/>The ensemble that creates the team of the circus deserves a mention too. You have a palette of characters that put so much of body to the movie that TGS otherwise would have been lacking. One of them is Zac Efron's character whose love story infuses a refreshing youthful energy to the movie. His lady love, played by Zendaya, is a contemporary woman marked down by the differences of class and race. Similarly the strength of the bearded woman with a voice of nightingale reminds you that you can be so much only if you learn to dim the unnecessary noise. 
TGS reflects on a lot of aspects of life but with a fairy tale approach, which in my view is completely fine. Every kind of cinema is important, it might not be the best of film-making in critics' view but it certainly is very striking and works a hundred percent. It is perfect for a light viewing for a family of all sizes and age. Towards the end, you will find your eyes brightened after seeing the beautiful cinematography and your heart gladdened by its dance and music. This is a well-directed piece of work which should not be deprived of an audience driven by a critical approach of the few.

"hayden_reh","8","2","4","17 April 2018"," Wonderful film
","I decided to watch this film on a cheap Tues. night by myself. I attend with any expectations; I heard about it through my cousins.<br/><br/>*if you really don't like what you read in the negatives, and want to move on to another comment, quickly scroll down to positives. TRUST ME. Don't be in a bubble, and try to think critically. That is not to suggest my analysis is correct, it is an opinion. Now proceed.<br/><br/>Negatives:
1. The film was a roller-coaster of emotions that went up and down. ""We're poor, now we're rich!""; ""We're neglected, now we're accepted!""; ""Our building burned down, thanks for the money partner!"" ""You cheated on me, I love you again!"" I missed some more, but I think the point was made. It lacked a more meaningful build-up.
2. The film structure is poor. Related to above comment. Many themes
3. The lyrics in most of the songs seem like they were rush-written. ex. ""They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy."" - 'A Million Dreams'. Really? Just seems lazy
In general, I actually agree with most of the initial criticisms after theatrical release.<br/><br/>HOWEVER<br/><br/>Positives:
1. In this political climate, where there appears to be more division than before, this film is almost universally liked by the common man, like myself, on BOTH sides of the isle. So to spin the 1st negative, it had enough themes to appeal to most people AND make each other think more thoughtfully about a different P.O.V. I can appreciate that. 
 Couple examples: Someone that leans right may look at the down-trodden differently with more kindness. They can accept unique people for who they are. Someone that leans left may look at wealthy business-people differently and trust they have good motives and others interests at heart - entrepreneurship.
 I used to detest just about every SJW, but now I look at them as people with good motives. As a political junky, I've been guilty of boxing myself in my own world. Seriously, this film helped.
 <br/><br/>2. Again related to the first one. The themes and morals in the film are relevant and good. The audience was taken through P.T. Barnum's LIFE; therefore, there were just enough themes. Too many for a film, but enough for a life. Most people, particularly in America, can identify with them as well. So it will make people feel good and want to identify with the characters (whichever they prefer to). Entrepreneurism, uniqueness of people, class division, working together, raising a family, love for your spouse, acceptance, thinking differently, following your dreams, not meeting other peoples expectations. <br/><br/>3. The messages in the songs and the musical composition. After all, it is a musical. ""A Million Dreams"" is probably my favourite song. I'm a carpenter that works for a general contractor. I live in greater Vancouver and want to become an independent contractor, even start a ""tiny home"" building business. This song has the ability to make me think. <br/><br/>4. Spectacular choreography and visuals. Very ideal to watch in theatre.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself and as a Christian, I can appreciate that there are Christian principles and values embedded in the themes, as they mostly are in Western society.<br/><br/>What is really remarkable is the leginess of this film. Here in Canada, it remained in theatres for 3.5 months. It's rated #1 for smallest drop in box-office. That goes to show how widely like ""The Greatest Showman"" is and the power of word-of-mouth.<br/><br/>I left the theatre disappointed. A week later, I wanted to see it again.
""The Greatest Showman"" is a feel-good movie for everybody, which is good at this present time and is what audiences need once-in-a-while."

","I just finished watching this film and the only word that immediate comes to mind is ""spectacular"". From beginning to end it is a visual masterpiece. Not because it stars Hugh Jackman or Zac Efron, but because it captivates its audience and glues you to that screen. What a phenomenal musical score!! This is,by far, one of the best movie musicals I have ever see, I kept waiting for a mediocre musical number, but I was disappointed, because there were none.The choreography was mesmerizing and when the Jenny Lind character appeared on stage and sang her selection, I could do nothing but tear up from the joy of the sound. Expect the musical selections to give you the chills. Throughout the movie, I found myself shaking my head in awe of the film. There are simple not enough positive adjectives to describe the feeling this movie evokes in the viewer.<br/><br/> Yes, P.T. Barnum: mission accomplished!!! This film about your rise to fame has made me very, very happy. THIS FILM IS NOT TO BE MISSED!!!"

","I have never written a review before. But maybe, as someone who was affected profoundly by this movie, it's time I got an account, and did my bit to counter the cynics who have slammed this movie. First off. It's a demonstration of artistic prowess from every cast member, director, producer and writer affiliated with this title. It's shot, edited, filmed, acted and sung to perfection. Also - this is an extremely empowering film, with a central theme of acceptance, love, tolerance, equality and embracing. Even the most stone-souled viewer has the potential to be reduced to tears. It is remarkable! I can't sing its praises enough. I have never rewatched a movie in the cinema, but I watched this one 4 times. And if my ticket sales help to make Hollywood realise that we need more movies like this, then I'll buy a fifth ticket! The music, choreography, story - second-to-none. I hope this hits the West End and Broadway: FAST. It will likely outperform rival musicals in that arena, too. A MUST-WATCH!"

","I loved this film. Its a showy, unchallenging, fun movie with an uplifting simple message, and great catchy songs. The film has been criticised for being a white wash of the true Barnum story - but thats to miss the point. It has been recast to tell sell an inclusive message for today, it is not a documentary, and I have yet to see a depressing musical - they are by their nature intended to be upbeat and fun. Which means that nuances of history are skipped or left out. Whilst the criticisms may be valid, if you want a fun uplifting film watch this. If you want the real Barnum story - go somewhere else."

The songs were catchy and fun and they had powerful meanings behind them.The whole film felt magical and who cares if it wasn't historically accurate its a fun entertaining musical not a documentary. I don't think this movie was to flashy its a circus things are suppose to be bright and colourful. Sure there wasn't much dialogue and character development from most peoples perspective but this is a musical, character development and the story is told through music.

","My 9 year old daughter was adamant we went to see this because all of her friends had loved it. I was apprehensive, it was a musical, and yes I loved La La Land but typically musicals don't appeal to me and I didn't know anything about the plot. <br/><br/>When I came out of the cinema having watched it, I was truly astounded by the magic of the movie I had just watched and two weeks later we watched it again.<br/><br/>The opening scene grabs you from the first beat and you are hooked right up until the heartwarming final words.<br/><br/>The characters are so endearing, the songs wonderfully written and performed and the story carries and delivers some deep themes very well through a series of set piece scenes all fused with the catchiest movie songs you will ever come across.<br/><br/>I fear this may lose some of its magic on the small screen, its a true example of a big screen experience. <br/><br/>In the words of PT Barnum's character in the movie ""It's everything you ever want, its everything you ever need and its here right in front of you""<br/><br/>Watch it, you won't regret it."
"kjproulx","7","2","4","13 April 2018"," A Fun Musical With Many Issues
","I've never been over-the-moon about musicals per-say, but any musical that has catchy songs will always have a special place in my heart. If a movie can make me smile through its music, regardless of the quality of the story at hand, then it's definitely doing something right. The Greatest Showman is one of the most recent musicals to hit the big screen and while I don't consider this one a masterpiece by any means, I can definitely see why so many people have hyped up the soundtrack. This is the pinnacle example of a film that works very well, solely due to the fact that it has fantastic musical numbers throughout its entire duration. If you haven't seen this film yet and you're not a fan of the musical style, then I would warn you to stay away, but if you're the opposite of that, then you may have found a new favorite to sing along to.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman follows P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) as his family suffers from him not being able to hold a job. Promising his wife a magnificent life at a young age, he hasn't given up on that yet. He decides to buy a museum that he would eventually turn into a musical circus, filled with people of all shapes, sizes, colors, and attitudes. This sparks a huge interest in the town and his rise to fame is quite rapid. Yes, I know the story is altered to suit a film because the actual P.T. Barnum wasn't such a nice person, but it works as a movie and that's all that matters when watching. Having said all that, this particular story has been told to death already, so if you're going in for something fresh, I wouldn't bother, unless you're able to ignore that aspect as I surely did.<br/><br/>This is a film that you go to for the spectacle of the shows and visual storytelling (albeit brief) because the music is so well-written and catchy you honestly forget about the core story completely. Yes, that's a man to cover up something mediocre, but I would be lying if I didn't call this film remarkable in terms of choreography and music. I've only seen this film once, so I wasn't singing along with any of the music, but when the cues occur, I must admit that I had a few goosebumps appearing.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, everyone here was hired for their stardom. They can both sing and act very well. From Hugh Jackman to Michelle Williams, to the very likable chemistry between Zac Efron and Zendaya, I was grinning from ear to ear whenever any of them were singing on-screen together. Even though the story is basic, it put a huge smile on my face through the ways it let the music tell the story. Even though mediocre at its core, I had an absolute blast watching The Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie won't be remembered as one of the greatest musicals of all time, or even the last ten years, but this is a soundtrack that music lovers will be playing for many years to come, and that alone is a tough feat to accomplish. No, I didn't care all that much about the outcome of the story, but the music itself made me care enough to put a smile on my face, and there is a lot of music, so I was distracted into liking this movie enough to warrant a decent recommendation. Please take this recommendation with a massive grain of salt, though, because if you're not into musicals, this movie will probably have the exact opposite effect for you."
"gradyharp","10","2","4","13 April 2018"," 'No one ever made a difference by being like everyone else.'
","THE GREATEST SHOWMAN will likely come as a surprise favorite of audience - especially people who avoid sappy musicals. As written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and directed by Michael Gracey, this biography of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum is a treasure. Rarely doe a movie full of glitz and glamour and over the top antics and dances and big ensemble numbers make sense, but this film does. <br/><br/>The film opens with Phineas Taylor ""P.T."" Barnum (Hugh Jackman) joining his circus troupe in a song (""The Greatest Show""), playing to an enthusiastic crowd as he and his performers put on a dazzling show. Cut to Barnum as a young boy (Ellis Rubin) in the 1800's orphaned, penniless but ambitious and with a mind crammed with imagination and fresh ideas, the American Phineas Taylor Barnum (Hugh Jackman) will always be remembered as the man with the gift to effortlessly blur the line between reality and fiction. He marries the girl of his dreams - Charity (Michelle Williams) - and has two daughters who play a major impact on Barnum's life. Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor will manage to open a wax museum but will soon shift focus to the unique and peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Some will call Barnum's wide collection of oddities, a freak show; however, when the obsessed showman gambles everything on the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) to appeal to a high-brow audience, he will somehow lose sight of the most important aspect of his life: his family. In many ways the show take a turn for the better when wealthy young Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) joins the company. But the joy of the show is in part due to the ebullient cast of circus players (Zendaya, Keala Settle, Sam Humphrey, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, etc). <br/><br/>Sparkling, a bit long on the repetitions of the songs, but a show with a message that leaves your heart hopeful and luminous."

"rutzelb","10","2","4","12 April 2018"," One of the greatest musicals ever
","From humble beginnings P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackson) will come to be known as The Greatest Showman who brought ""a celebration of humanity"" to us all. This was said by his staunchest critic James Gordon Bennett (Paul Sparks) a newspaper reporter and he finally admitted that P.T. Barnum gave people the time to smile and enjoy the entertainment. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that this is not a story about the Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus. No, this is the time before all that. This is how P.T. Barnum got started with his museums and later with live human acts and animals that one of his daughters said was needed. She was right. <br/><br/>P.T. Barnum went looking for people that other people considered ""freaks."" There was Dog Boy (Luciano Acuna, Jr), the Dwarf: Tom Thumb ( Stan Humphrey), the Bearded Lady (Keala Settle), the World's Fattest Man (Daniel Everidge), and so on. All became a fine circus family and proud of what they did. <br/><br/>The entire cast outperformed expectations. Kudos. <br/><br/>The lively, toe-tapping music, the singing and precision choreography was, perhaps, the best I have ever seen in a musical and I 've seen many. And yes each song, dance and the accompanying music stayed strong, vibrant and catchy all the time. Nothing dragged including player dialogues as the pacing was spot on throughout. <br/><br/>I count this movie in a class by itself, and maintain that this is the greatest musical ever. Watch and judge for yourselves. <br/><br/>I was surprised that the whole Barnum team did go and meet Queen Victoria, and Barnum came away with the famous Opera Singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) and did a tour with her. She was touted as an Opera Singer, but she never sang operatic songs in the movie.<br/><br/>Notables: Zac Efron as Phillip Carlyle, a playwright who became part owner in the circus; Michelle Williams as Charity, P.T. Barnum's wife; Ellis Rubin as Young Barnum; Skylar Dunn as Young Charity; Anne Wheeler as Trapeze Artist Zandaya who Phillip Carlyle falls for; <br/><br/> 
All in all one of the most enjoyable musicals I have ever seen. As the reporter Bennet begrudgingly considered that P.T. Barnum brought ""a celebration of humanity"" to us all, he was also the one who is credited in telling P.T. Barnum to change the name of his show to P.T. Barnum's Circus.<br/><br/> 
Maybe there will be another movie later on called The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Let's hope. (10/10)<br/><br/>

","Showman / conman PT Barnum gets the same kid glove treatment Flo Ziegfeld received in 1937 with this antiseptic look at his life and legacy. Filled with a fair share of catchy tunes, a couple of impressive dance numbers and lush production values it mawkishly keeps things saccharine to the point of not allowing PT's kids to grow up over a period of years along with shouldering singer Jenny Lind with the blame regarding her nebulous relationship with Barnum when he had her under contract. It's understandable for a musical to do so but the story in this case is too timid to maintain the energy level between musical numbers.<br/><br/>The dance segments are simply over edited cheating the audience out of a more fully fleshed out Hugh Jackman performance. A major broadway performer and fine hoofer, Jackman's numbers are simply cut to pieces in jump cuts that reduce him to a twirling top. Director Gracery also shortchanges his dance troupe as well by truncating movement and allowing the camera to move more than the dancers, the editor's blade obliterating their abilities and contribution. The numbers are slick and energized but at great disservice to the talent performing it and the audience being denied it."

","As a frequent moviegoer but not a particular fan of musicals due to early trauma caused by the awful Mamma Mia! film (soon to be films...), I was not confident that I would enjoy the Greatest Showman; regardless, I was dragged to see this by my girlfriend, but came out the other side very satisfied with what had been presented to me.<br/><br/>Whilst the storyline is grandiose and fictionalised to a certain degree (such as PT Barnum being portrayed as a benevolent rags-to-riches character), the film does not require a convoluted plot - the magic is supposed to be in the eccentricity of the people, the colours of the settings and, of course, the core musical pieces. To this end, the Greatest Showman definitely succeeds: it combines all these elements into a thriving spectacle set among the gritty backdrop of a newly-industrialised New York. <br/><br/>Barnum (played by Hugh Jackman) and his backstory is quickly and loosely explained, requiring no more than a brief explanation of his poor upbringing, but also his love for the wealthy and elite girl, Charity (Michelle Williams). In a matter of minutes, Barnum's quest to create the museum of oddities (soon to be known as the circus) comes to fruition, allowing the big-piece spectacles to flow thick and fast. As the centre of attention, Jackman manages to exude spirit and dramatic flair on all his showman scenes, which pulls the film along, dividing his efforts between musical numbers with furious choreography and the darker, more moody storyline. The divergence Barnum takes to tour with Jenny Lind (played by Rebecca Ferguson) only proves to be a minor detour, thankfully not detracting from the core principle of the film to a degree which ruins the flow of the story.<br/><br/>At this point in the film, I had bought into the concept of the musical: I could now accept the film for what it was - a cacophony of colour and showmanship, to be taken light-heartedly and not to be dissected in the way the critics had approached it."
"JamesHitchcock","10","2","4","19 January 2018"," Some Things Are Worth Waiting For
","""The Greatest Showman"" is that rare thing in the 21st century, a film musical made in the traditional style but not based upon a Broadway or West End show. The idea of the film was first mooted as long ago as 2009, but remained stuck in ""development hell"" for a number of years, allegedly because of the difficulties in obtaining funding for an original musical. It is loosely based upon the life of the 19th century circus owner and showman P. T. Barnum, telling of his rise from humble beginnings to fame and fortune. A key element is Barnum's relationship with his wife Charity, the daughter of a wealthy family who do not approve of their marriage. The crisis of the story comes when Barnum's circus is destroyed in a fire and Charity leaves him because she believes he is having an affair with the opera singer Jenny Lind; Barnum has to work to rebuild both his business and his marriage. <br/><br/>A subplot deals with the love between Phillip Carlyle, Barnum's friend and financial backer, and Anne Wheeler, a beautiful trapeze artist with the show. Like Charity, Carlyle is from an aristocratic family, and his parents are horrified by this relationship, not only because of Anne's lowly social status but also because she is black. Hollywood is today rather more liberal than it once was about depicting mixed-race relationships on screen, although this film inadvertently reveals the continuing existence of some curious double standards in this respect. It seems to be easier for an African-American actress to find work if she is light-skinned or (like Zendaya Coleman who plays Anne) biracial. This does not apply to male actors; the actor playing Anne's brother is conspicuously darker skinned than she is, so much so as to suggest they could not in reality be children of the same parents. <br/><br/>The Carlyle/Anne relationship, however, fits in well with the film's general message, which is one of tolerance, inclusivity and accepting who you are. One of Barnum's more controversial ventures- controversial even in his own day- was the creation of a ""freak show"", a collection of people of unusual appearance (a dwarf, a giant, a ""bearded lady"", etc.) who were exhibited to the public. In 2017 such a thing would be even more controversial than it was in the 19th century and it might have been easier to airbrush this aspect of Barnum's activities from the historical record. Instead, the scriptwriters make it a central part of the story and defend it by pointing out that Barnum was actually giving these people, who otherwise would have been shut away in seclusion, a sense of purpose in life and a means of earning a living. <br/><br/>The film received mixed reviews from the critics, with one of the main grounds for complaint being its alleged historical inaccuracy. It does indeed take a number of liberties with the facts of Barnum's life, but was never intended as a strictly factual biography. It falls within a long tradition of novels, plays and films which tell an essentially fictional story based upon real historical individuals. There is nothing wrong with that. I would not, for example, recommend Milos Foreman's ""Amadeus"" to anyone wanting to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the lives of Mozart and Salieri- and yet it is still a brilliant film. This tradition goes back far beyond the rise of Hollywood- compare the plot of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" with the known facts about that monarch's reign. <br/><br/>At the heart of the film is a magnificent performance from Hugh Jackman as Barnum, a man who is at the same time a shrewd businessman and a man with a song in his heart, a flashy showman and an inspired visionary. He receives sterling support from, among others, Coleman, Michelle Williams as Charity and Zac Efron as Carlyle. Most of the cast do their own singing, the main exception being Rebecca Ferguson, who clearly felt intimidated by the idea of trying to imitate Lind, the greatest opera star of her day. Actually, the singer brought in to dub her voice does not really sound much like an operatic soprano either, but then Lind's songs here are typical musical-theatre numbers rather than mock-operatic arias. The songs, in fact, are one of the best features, heart-wrenching numbers which add greatly to the film's emotional power. <br/><br/>I was surprised to learn that this was Michael Gracey's directorial debut, but perhaps I should not have been. There have been a number of other directors who made a masterpiece at their first attempt. The classic example is always said to be Orson Welles with ""Citizen Kane"", but I would also add Bryan Forbes with ""Whistle Down the Wind"", Stuart Rosenberg with ""Cool Hand Luke"" and Sam Mendes with ""American Beauty"". And now Gracey with ""The Greatest Showman"". All those years it was stuck in development hell only go to show that some things are worth waiting for. 10/10 <br/><br/>Some goofs. I will not list the various historical inaccuracies, because, as I said, this is not a strictly factual biography. I did wonder, however, why Charity's father always answers the door to his stately mansion himself- would a man of his wealth and position not have had servants to do this? And the scene in which Barnum obtains finding for his venture by offering as collateral a fleet of ships at the bottom of the ocean never rang true. The loss of an entire fleet of American merchant ships in a typhoon would have been widely reported in the press and the bankers would have seen through Barnum's ruse."

Ironically as portrayed in the movie, the critics did not approve of Barnum's circus either. The fact that its plot is based on a true story, the fact that almost all 9 songs of the movie are memorable, the fact that a modern, in some ways almost Michael Jackson-influenced choreography (may sound a bit odd for a musical, but looks fantastic) is preferred, makes this a movie worth seeing. I cannot stop listening to the songs over and over.

I will GUARANTEE you that you can relate to your personal life history in some parts of this film, that's why users are raving about this movie b/c they saw themselves in the movie and hit the emotions.

","JIM'S REVIEW: The Greatest Showman has its heart in the right place, but it unfortunately never achieves its musical goal. It invests a lot, and I mean a lot, of talent and hard work with very little dividend. <br/><br/>The songs are foot-stomping, uplifting, and hummable tunes, but become derivative imitations of themselves. Every musical number sounds and looks alike with no modulation. Even the ballads are slow-downed versions of other songs in the film. The original score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul lacks range, a deliberate sameness creeps in for most musical moments, but their music definitely delivers in energetic peppiness with toe-tapping ""feel-good"" form. They are experts in writing clever ""hooks"". The modern choreography is more 2017 variety than 1917 period but is very well done. Kudos to Ashley Wallen and his accomplished dancers for stomping their way into your hearts.<br/><br/>Nathan's Crowley's lovely production design sings out, as does the costumes created by Ellen Mirojnick. Michael Gracey's solid direction is fluid and successfully captures the nostalgic musical origins of the big Hollywood musicals of yore (although think what these filmmakers could have done with Cy Coleman's far superior Broadway musical gem, Barnum!).<br/><br/>The major problem with the film, and it is a major issue, is the paper thin plot that follows the most predictable of story-lines. Whenever the singing and dancing stops, so does the film. The screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon is a real letdown, with underwritten characters and petty conflicts all under the big top in a very conventional way. Their script is mostly an outline to serve the musical moments and rarely advances the plot. The relationships are all strained beyond reality and each character seems to be a mere prop device to lead into the next musical interlude.<br/><br/>The casting is a mixed bag also. Hugh Jackman is really the greatest showman, more so than Barnum himself. He is a natural song and dance man. Watching him move with such grace and charisma is almost worth the price of admission (but there is that awful script, remember). Michelle Williams is his loving wife, Charity, and she is given so little to do to showcase her musical talents. Zac Efron as rich playboy, Phillip Carlyle, tries hard, but just doesn't have the musical ability, no matter how they edit the movie. Zendaya plays his love interest and their love story seems like a second thought. Their romance may convince a giddy twelve-year-old girl about the things we do for love, but it left me questioning the things they did for a paycheck. <br/><br/>Perhaps the weakest link is the usually dependable Rebecca Ferguson, totally miscast as the operatic Jenny Lind. Supposedly this world renown singer and crowd-pleasing attraction to Barnum's circus of oddities, wowed the patrons back then. However, the singing on the screen could never come near a high C. Ms. Ferguson's performance is more like a B-flat. (In creating such an important supporting role, it is beyond me why the filmmakers couldn't find an attractive and trained opera singer to fill the bill. Go to the Met and take your pick.)<br/><br/>So, even though the movie is entertaining on a musical level, The Greatest Showman is plain hokum, albeit nice-looking hokum. There is plenty of razzle-dazzle on display although it is just painted cardboard and glitter that remains. As Barnum would say, ""There is one born every minute."" (Even though Ms. Lind could not hit that high C, the film's earned that grade from this critic.)"
"gaeun-18844","9","0","0","5 July 2020"," the best movie in my life
","Actually, I saw a few days a go. It was the great movie when I watched the recently. Actually, before watching The Greatest Showman, the best movie is Parasite. However, after watching The Greatest Showman, it became the best movie.
The reason why I choose the best movie is the first, at the first scene, various animals and people shows the greatest show so I thought, it was a circus movie and they are focus on the circus however, suddenly it shows their love story and as time goes by they love each other and born children and prepare his circus.
Second point is I just think he prepares the animal circus but he found the unique people and prepare people circus at that time I thought it is a unique topic and I concentrate more than before. Like a movie, there were good introduction, development, turn, and conclusion. Especially, burned circus hall was the biggest impact scene to me. Because for success he prepared really hard and collects people not easily so at that time I was really sad also even though wife turn his back on. On the other hand, ending, was the happy ending recovered the circus hall and P.T Banum was retired from the circus and Phillip was taken over that job.
Finally, I really like a musical movie. I saw Mama mia, Lalaland, Aladin, Sound of music and so on. I want to say The Greatest Shown is the best musical movie. Especially, all of songs are good and before watching a movie, I knew all of the songs and after watching the movie, I listened to that movie music hole day.
Therefore, I want to say The Greatest Showman is the best movie in my life."

"miyu-a-hayashi","3","0","0","26 June 2020"," Where do I even start
","The only reason I gave this movie as many stars as I did was because the costumes were fantastic and some, not all, but some of the songs were okay.
This movie is a modern day wet dream. It depicts a down and out man who just wants a good life for his wife and children. So he's goes on to create a freak show. By the end of the movie everyone has come together and is a circus. But let's face it, it's still a freak show by those day's standards. Back then freak shows weren't revered, they weren't high brow entertainment, they weren't meant to move people. They were there for the morbidly curious to go and jeer, and gasp, and openly stare at people they would normally do their best to ignore on the street. This movie glorifies what was an awful time, making people think that freak shows were so much more glamorous than how they actually were. Furthermore, they had an 'opera' singer who didn't even sing opera. I won't deny the song was nice, but it wasn't opera. They easily could have just called her a singer, or cast an actual opera singer to at the very least voice over for they actress they chose.
There was so much going on in the movie that it didn't take enough time on any single story to really have meaningful progress. But yet by the end everything was happy and good again. This movie panders to the ""freaks"" of the modern world, who are not freaks, but normal people. It took me nearly 3 months to actually finish this movie because I had to keep putting it down and returning.
Finally, I love Hugh Jackman. I think he's a fantastic actor and was decent in this movie. However, for the love of god, stop casting him in musicals. His singing is just... not up to par. I thought so in Les Miserables, and I haven't changed my opinion.
Watch it if you want, but this is my sincere thought of the movie. It had good and fun aspects, but overall I'm incredibly grateful I didn't waste my money to watch it in the theatre."

","""The Greatest Showman,"" directed with verve and panache by Michael Gracey, is an unabashed piece of pure entertainment, punctuated by 11 memorable songs composed by Oscar- and Tony-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who composed the songs for ""La La Land,"" as well as the current Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen. The film is made for the whole family to enjoy, and so it leaves out many of the darker elements (explored in the 1980 Broadway musical Barnum, music by Cy Coleman). This is a difficult tightrope to walk, but credit is due to Gracey, a perfectly cast Hugh Jackman, and the entire cast, who play this story in the spirit in which it was written (by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon). ""The Greatest Showman"" positions itself as a story celebrating diversity, and the importance of embracing all kinds.<br/><br/>There are those who will see this as a rose-colored-glasses view of what was a pretty exploitive situation. But in a 19th and early 20th century context, the circus and then vaudeville were welcoming places where those who had skills or who were rejected by society could find a home. Barnum put ""misfit toys"" onstage, saying, in essence, ""Aren't they amazing?"" (all while filling his pockets. For more thoughts on P.T. Barnum's barely acknowledged influence on American culture author Trav S.D.'s 2005 lecture at the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, CT is a good place to start.) Cary Grant, who had a harsh poor childhood, got his start as a tumbler in a vaudeville troupe. Years later he described his revelatory first visit to the Bristol Hippodrome:<br/><br/>""The Saturday matinee was in full swing when I arrived backstage; and there I suddenly found my inarticulate self in a dazzling land of smiling, jostling people wearing and not wearing all sorts of costumes and doing all sorts of clever things. And that's when I knew! What other life could there be but that of an actor? They happily traveled and toured. They were classless, cheerful, and carefree. They gaily laughed, lived, and loved.""<br/><br/>That's what ""The Greatest Showman"" captures.<br/><br/>The film starts with the title song ""The Greatest Show,"" a show-stopper with repetitive thumping percussion (reminiscent of Queen's ferocious ""We Will Rock You""). Hugh Jackman-in red impresario's coat and top hat-takes us on a dazzling tour, with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey keeping the movements fluid, and all the actions connected, plunging you into the center ring. The whole number comes from the brazen heart of showbiz: Make it interesting! Give 'em something to look at! Make sure you reach the cheap seats! Barnum croons seductively, ""Just surrender cuz you feel the feeling taking over!"" I obeyed without reservation.<br/><br/>During the next number, ""A Million Dreams"" the young and poor Barnum (Ellis Rubin) befriends a well-bred little girl named Charity Hallett (Skylar Dunn), and they dream of creating their own destiny. This is the first time in ""The Greatest Showman"" where a character stops speaking and starts to sing instead; the segue is gracefully handled, setting up the artificial device early on. If you don't set up that trope with confidence, it makes it look like you're embarrassed to be doing a musical. By the end of the song, the little boy has become Hugh Jackman and the little girl has become Michelle Williams, leaping and twirling across the rooftop of their tenement, bed sheets on the line billowing to the beat.<br/><br/>After struggling to establish himself, Barnum launches out on his own, creating a theatre in the heart of New York City. He gathers together people with special talents as well as those with physical abnormalities (a giant, a bearded lady, Siamese twins, a dwarf-who would eventually be known as General Tom Thumb, Barnum's first ""breakout star""). The ""audition"" sequence is extremely tricky, but the tone is set by Jackman's inclusive delight at the parade of humanity before him. It's a moment when ignored people are for the first time really seen.<br/><br/>Lettie Lutz, the ""bearded lady,"" played by Tony-nominee Keala Settle, with a powerhouse voice, is one of the first to come on board. Settle's performance-her first major role onscreen-is one of the many keys to why ""The Greatest Showman"" is so effective. She understands the spirit of the project, and you watch her transformation from cringing shame to fearless Diva. Her anthemic ""This Is Me"" is one of the emotional centers of the film. Barnum's business partner is playwright and society boy Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron), with snobby parents who are not only horrified at his ""slumming,"" but also at his romance with an African-American trapeze artist (Zendaya) who sports a pompadour of cotton-candy pink hair. Their love story, as presented, is tender, pained, and sweet.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson plays Jenny Lind, the ""Swedish Nightingale,"" whom Barnum took on a whirlwind concert tour through America It was his entryway into ""polite"" society. Jenny Lind's power ballad ""Never Enough"" makes you understand why Barnum, backstage, falls in love with her instantly, throwing his marriage into crisis. Ferguson may be lip-synching to Loren Allred's breathtaking vocals, but it is her performance that carries.<br/><br/>Ashley Wallen choreographed the numbers and there are many innovative moments, where she uses the outer environment to inform the movements of the characters. In ""The Other Side,"" Barnum convinces a reticent Carlyle to join the circus, and as he sings, the bartender puts down shot glasses, swipes the bar with a cloth, all as accents to the beat. The real standout, however, is ""Rewrite the Stars,"" the love song between Efron and Zendaya,taking place in the empty circus tent, when she flies on the trapeze far above him, and he tries to climb up the ropes to meet her. Up, down, they both go, sometimes coming together, dangling above the ground, or sweeping in a wide circle together around the periphery of the tent. It is a moment when the film-every element onscreen-merges and transforms into pure emotion. This is what a musical can do like no other artform.<br/><br/>One of the deep pleasures of ""The Greatest Showman"" is you don't have to grade the singing and dancing on a curve, as was necessary with ""La La Land"" (or, further back, to ""Chicago,"" where quick cuts hid Richard Gere's lack of tap dancing skills.) Hugh Jackman, with his powerful high baritone, got his start in musicals, performing in productions in Melbourne, and then in a hugely acclaimed revival of Oklahoma! in the West End. He won a Tony Award for his performance as Peter Allen in The Boy From Oz and has hosted the Tony Awards three times. He is an old-fashioned triple-threat. Film fans may know him mainly as ""Wolverine,"" and there's nothing wrong with that, but once upon a time a song-and-dance man like Hugh Jackman's could sing and dance his way through mainstream Hollywood. He's unleashed here.<br/><br/>So, too, is Zac Efron, who also got his start because he could sing and dance in the phenom that was ""High School Musical."" His career has morphed into something rather unique, with titles like ""Hairspray,"" ""Neighbors,"" and a hilarious small part in this year's ""The Disaster Artist."" He has something that cannot be manufactured, although many try, and that is old-school movie star charisma. Add to that a beautiful voice, plus dancing skills, plus a surprisingly ironic sense of humor, and he's got the full package. It's thrilling to see him in a big splashy musical. He's very much at home.<br/><br/>Michelle Williams, with anachronistically long blonde hair, has a strong clear voice, and there's something exhilarating about how she tosses herself into thin air, knowing Jackman will catch her. In what could be a thankless ""wet blanket wife"" part, Williams adds a spunky sense of adventure, showing us the kind of woman who would say ""No"" to a ladylike society-wife life, and fling herself into the unknown with her man.<br/><br/>The timing of this release is interesting. On May 21, 2017, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus folded up its tent for good, after 146 years of uninterrupted operation. Rocked by controversy due to criticisms of exploitation and animal abuse, they retired the elephant acts in 2016, but it was too late. Barnum was dogged by criticisms from the beginning. Many of the ""acts"" were fakes. Barnum actually didn't say the quote most associated with him (""There's a sucker born every minute"") but he might as well have said it and his critics despised him for the assumption about popular entertainment and the regular folk who enjoy it. But in the film, Barnum, with a dazzling smile, explains to a skeptical journalist, ""People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked.""<br/><br/>I was hoodwinked by ""The Greatest Showman."" And it was indeed a pleasure. Ringling Brothers may have closed up shop, but Barnum lives on."

","Nowadays, it seems that everyone has seen The Greatest Showman, and it was in the cinema for months when it first came out because people just kept going to see it. I was one of the first, and I fell in love with it straightaway.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is brilliant, especially from Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and Keala Settle. They all portrayed their characters extremely well, and the dynamic between everyone was electrifying.<br/><br/>By far the best part of The Greatest Showman is the music. They aren't only catchy songs, but they fit into the story extremely well and some of them contain powerful meanings. 'This is Me' is an example of that, for obvious reasons, but 'From Now On' is another one. The choreography of the music scenes is phenomenal, and two of my favourite scenes in the film are during the songs of 'The Other Side' and 'Rewrite the Stars'.<br/><br/>A lot of critics seemed to have an issue with the narrative of The Greatest Showman, but I actually think it's quite strong. It's not on the level of the films which went up for Best Picture at the Oscars that year, but I thought it was extremely serviceable and engaging throughout.<br/><br/>There are a few individual moments which I think are too cheesy and over-the-top. I have also never been a huge fan of the song 'Never Enough', although the scene itself isn't too bad and Ferguson can definitely sing.<br/><br/>Aside from those nitpicks, The Greatest Showman is a wonderfully fun film and a strong recommendation if you haven't already seen it.<br/><br/>SCORE: 92%"

"epicdijkstra","10","0","0","24 April 2020"," A wholesome movie during dire times
","To start it off, this movie is a gem. It is a wholesome movie with good performances and visuals all around. The soundtrack is amazing (several songs have been covered by the likes of Pink and several others) and the story is timeless in spite of the era it supposedly takes place in. This was the short version of it.<br/><br/>The details; When the movie came out, from the trailers it seemed like the movie was more about the songs and the visuals like a big music video than story and substance. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is of course somewhat focused around major set pieces, but it is amazing how well the grandeur of the visuals and songs are balanced with the overall story and morality. The performances are amazing overall. Hugh Jackman, straight off his Wolverine duties manages to give in an amazing performance showing himself as being vulnerable and human, Zac Efron showing off his chops as a performer, Zendaya showing off her amazing talent, etc. The most impressive find might be Miss Keala Settle. Initially she was a stand-in during rehearsals, but it might have been the best decision for the movie to grand her the role of a lifetime.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie over 20 times by now and listened to the soundtrack on repeat for the last 2 years and I could see it another 20 times. Overall it does what any good entertainment does: it makes you forget about everything bad in the world for at least a little bit. That is an achievement on its own."

The moment of silence after 're write the stars' where it gave u a moment to just take in the brilliance and be in awe. Then 'This is me' which was the best song , i normally don't take to songs the first time i hear it, but this was undeniable. Then there was 'From now on' which displayed some incredible dancing. Then there was the story, so deep yet so relatable, i had to watch the movie a few times to pick out a few of the hidden meanings. There was just too much good stuff to mention. This was the first movie i watched 3 times in the cinema. I am a dancer so this opened my mind to how creativity can be taken to the next level."
"jayjaycee","7","0","0","9 March 2020"," The greatest songs ... In a too rushed story
","""The Greatest Showman"" is a 2017 musical drama directed by Michael Gracey starring Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams. I happened to have another movie date and I again let the lady choose what to watch and she brought one of the few films she owns herself. So we gave this musical flick a watch together. It was actually one of those films I was stoked to check out as I heard many positive thing about it, but was also hesitant to give it a spin as some even labelled it as a disaster. In my opinion, it's both in some way. One of the most confusing aspects is the absolutely fast pace that really could have been way more slowly. I mean, the relationship between Barnum and his wife is rushed in the blink of an eye, literally during one song and didn't even stop once to allow the characters to create some sort of chemistry. It's one of the problems I expected when I noticed the runtime of only 109 minutes and it really shows how a duration of more than two hours would have been more of an advantage. Also, the specific character development of Jackman's Barnum is well played, but criminally terrible in terms of character traits. He went from a dreamer with a vision and the will to prove the world that talent doesn't come from how much money you have to an arrogant snob who only defines his personality with how wealthy he is and only cares about the opinion of the aristocratic people within a few minutes. Even when he turns it around again in the end, it's a shame to see it develop like this. Hence, the focus doesn't really lie on him and for a protagonists I expected to be the appealing figure this was more than a simple let down. Furthermore, the film's obvious core message is that human beings can achieve anything if they wanted to and that everyone is perfect just the way they are. It's about individualism, hopes and dreams and a call for outcasts and loners to be themselves. It's clear, isn't it? Then why does the protagonist betray those values and why does it spend so much time to (I hope!) unwillingly ridicule and laugh at the outcast characters. Of course, it's done to make them more sympathic and inspire them to sing a wonderful song about it (plot convenience, I assume), but the amount of time it spends to laugh about them prevails and I think it's pretty sad that it contradicts it's try of an uplifting philosophy. It made me feel uncomfortable at times and originally intended the total opposite. Aside from this though, it also has something great to offer as well. For instance, the modern camera work enables the viewer to not just experience the tension, but to even feel it as if the circus was in the living room. The dance choreography goes hand it hand with the singing decently and creates some moments of extreme pleasure. It's full of satisfying colours and numbers and contains only outstanding songs. From ""A Million Dreams"" to ""This Is Me"" they are all beautifully arranged and stuck in my head for a very long time. Next to this, it's notable that all the actors and actresses proved some impressive singing talent that made it even more enjoyable to me as a musician. All in all, it's beauty in a mess and even though the characters are mostly too shallow it has something charming to it. Beneath the horribly executed and double sided moral it follows it's a decent fun nevertheless. It really makes ""style over substance"" work by covering it's flaws with pompousness and frantic camera angles and even though it might not go down in history as an ingenious piece of film, it surely will for its memorable songs and musicality. Despite it's execution, it's somehow still inspiring and a fun watch for in between."

","Watched this in my acting class and it was amazing! The musical numbers were great and the choreography was a thing of beauty during those sequences.

Still it was very colorful and well written and is a cinematic treat."

"ashleighabsurd","10","0","0","9 October 2019"," Better Than Expected
","As someone who only really likes musicals that are more of a horror nature this film really peaked my interest as it was to do with show business. With a cast I had grew up watching and becoming a fan of I had to see if this film was as good as I thought it would be and I was not disappointed at all. This film has an original soundtrack that not only inspired me in my real life but also that made me feel exactly what the characters were feeling.
This film follows Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum who was the first person to ever create a circus and do a style of entertainment that was not of the norm. As someone who was not aware of him and did not know his story this really inspired me as he came from nothing and made, every obstacle he had into a positive thing he could work on and never giving up. As you see the characters grow and the circus grow in the theater and how after a long time it ended up in a tent which is how people of today would mostly know the circus.
This film really inspired me and told me not to give up on my dreams no matter what obstacles get in my way and to always take every negative in my stride and to take a look at what I can do to make this a positive. I would highly recommend this film to everyone with an amazing cast, soundtrack and acting that really will inspire you."
"richarddillomes","7","0","0","7 October 2019"," The greatest conman?
","Maybe it would've helped if I saw this during the 2017 Xmas season when it's easy to offer something to someone and they'd immediately consume it with glee and not during 2018's Typhoon season when the weather is dreary and everything takes a lot of effort to do. While it did lift up the mood on an otherwise gloomy Saturday night with it's blistering choreography, dazzling costumes and contemporary music, once the smoke clears and you go back to the story you kind of realize that you may have been conned a little.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was good. My only critic is it's pacing. While I appreciate the hurried pace since I'm not really into musicals, they sacrificed a lot of things in exchange for keeping the audience's attention span. PT Burnam's life was full of ups and downs but we're only shown what they chose to show. While I agree a musical isn't necessarily for historical accuracy, but what I got from their summary was that he was a con man through and through. They didn't give me time to sympathize why he had to do what he did, they just pushed me into the next scene hoping I didn't notice that aspect of his life. There were a lot of missed opportunities as well between the characters of Philip and Anne, and even between PT and Jenny. Maybe because this is Michael Gracey's first film to direct, prior to this he was doing commercials (where he first met Hugh Jackman and how he remembered him years after and sent Michael the script) and supervising visual effects.<br/><br/>Taking all of those away and just the musical aspect of the show, this movie is an almost-winner. Choreography was near flawless (Zendaya reportedly did all her stunts), the music was purposefully made to sound ahead of it's time but some of the lyrics seemed off even if they were penned by Oscar award-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of La La Land fame. Some lyrics seemed force and were out of tune which pretty much sound like most of the song written nowadays if you think about it.<br/><br/>If you've seen 2001's Mouline Rouge! by Baz Luhrmann, you can't help but compare and contrast and depending on who you listen to, this can mean as an insult or a compliment. But while the MR! is untouchable, The Greatest Showman has a lot of areas it can improve on and only time will tell if the future will be kinder to it."

"zacharykmills","9","0","0","23 July 2019"," An inspiring story!
","The greatest showman takes you back in time with their convincing set, props, costume and their acting. Instantly the audience is drawn into their world and we follow the life of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman). The transition between his youth to adult was a bit rocky but it was necessary to share his early life for the plot to come full circle.<br/><br/>Camera movements were fluid and smooth. I particularly enjoyed the circus performances because of the quick cuts and the different views to keep it interesting and alive. Each of the songs composed in the movie were all unique and exciting to appeal to those who don't enjoy musicals as much, like me.<br/><br/>I imagine it would have been tough to keep track of all the characters they had as a prominent role in the movie. Which also made me feel that some didn't get the spotlight as much as Zac Efron and Zendaya.<br/><br/>Overall I rate the movie a 9 because there were a few parts in the plot that didn't quite connect together and the mob wasn't really that big of a deal besides being push-overs. The real conflict was the inner struggle within them all to find a place of acceptance in the world. The greatest showman demonstrates a well written climax and in the end, it unfolds the lesson that brings everything together. I recommend this movie to those who enjoy a drama with bits of musical action."

","Well I gotta be honest - I'm not the biggest musical fan out there, but my favorite piece of art right now is Hamilton and becouse of that I decided to watch some of the most popular musicals of last few years.<br/><br/>I kinda like the style of it. I mean CGI's terrible, but I thought the sets were beautiful as well as the costumes. And I gotta say - almost all of the songs were very good. Almost, becouse the second song (can't remember the name) was too long and I really don't like This Is Me. It just really didn't fit in this part of the movie, it was just a distraction from what was going on with Hugh Jackman's character.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is awesome, as well as every actor and actress - Zandaya was a little bit wasted for me (she only appered in few scenes) but she was incredible in all of them. And it's always nice to see Zack Efron in something that's not crappy comedy.<br/><br/>But me main problem is the fact that Hugh Jackman's character starts as a good, simple man, than becomes an opsessed with power dick... And than becomes a good person again. Why? Wouldnt it be more interesting to see him leave his family and becoming 'the greatest showman'.

"smolenovaalzbeta","8","0","0","21 January 2019"," Perfect film
","The Greatest Showman is a musical staring Hugh Jackman, Zendaya and Zac Efron in it. This film had premier in 2017. Film is about a man (Hugh Jackman) who wanted to lead a circus. He did everything to receive his goals and he isn't afraid to risk. He bought an old building and created circus. This film was directed by Michael Gracey in his directorial debut, written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and it was inspired by real story.
In my opinion narration of story was really absorbing and amusing. I really like musicals and I think this is the reason why I am a big fan of this film. I really like character of the showman. He was ambitious and adventurous. When he needed to do something he did it. What I consider for the best thing is the music, which was catchy and choreography was amazing.
What I really consider as not real were some scenes like dancing on the tables or jumping on train. I know it was filmed as a real story, but I think It was a little bit fictional.
At the end I rate this film as the one of the best films I have ever seen. I recommend it to every person who like musicals and relaxing films."

"s-94415","9","0","0","17 January 2019"," The Greatest Showman has Rewritten the Stars
","The Greatest Showman is a cinematic wonder! Between the costumes and makeup, stunts and music, this movie truly is amazing. Michael Gracey, director from Australia, came up with a piece that only the right cast could pull off, and with talent like that of Zendaya, Hugh Jackman, and Zac Efron you can't go wrong. This movie revolves around a circus act, made up of people who are different and stand out in a crowd in ways that may make them seem to be outcasts. Hugh Jackman takes the lead role in playing a version of circus ringmaster, P.T. Barnum. Written by Bill Condon and Jenny Bicks (one of the producers of Sex and the City, as well as a well known TV director) Barnum is presented as a hero. A miracle worker to those who stand out, those who are different in the way they look, the way they act, and even the talents they possess. A large woman with a beard, would be least expected to have a voice as outstanding as Keala Settle's character does. The acrobatics performed by Zendaya and her casted brother hold unbelievable talent and ability. Jackman teaches them all to love themselves for who and what they are. The characters learn to find a sense of self worth and purpose within the work they receive from Barnum.<br/><br/>In this particular movie, the musical numbers are staged in such a bizarre and flamboyant manner that whilst watching this movie, you might forget to pay attention to whether the actual singing and dancing are actually any good. (They are extremely expressive and well done) Arranged by Justin Paul and Benj Pasek (also composers and writers of the songs in La La Land) these numbers have that showy overbearing quality that you hear in almost every Broadway show or musical, but they're harmless and the kind of catchy that gets stuck in your head.
If you choose to opt out of watching the debut of Michael Gracey's directing career, The Greatest Showman, it means you'll miss performances like Zendaya, a wonder woman with almost cotton candy like hair who spins and twirls with careful yet frivolous precision with a hanging rope; Anne Wheeler, who creates an amazing performance as a trapeze artist. She becomes somewhat of a main character, her swift and natural beauty luring in Efron's character Philip. One of the most iconic musical numbers from this film, Rewrite the Stars, Anne expresses her love for Philip as well as her desire for him to accept and stand up for what he believes in. To stand up and defend her, no matter her race or social class. Efron's character however, spends more time in sheer awe of her beauty and simplicity rather than acting on any emotion. He's completely stunned by her.<br/><br/>As all things eventually do, the circus crashed after a massive fire was started, mid street brawl. Barnum's fraudulent and borrowed successes, their pride, their pedestal, it all went up in flames. Gracey (director) made clear efforts to show the effect that this crash had on not only the circus, but the town. A grey filter overtook the happiness in the scene, the mood changed to a more somber tone. They became the laughing stock of the town, people began to ridicule them. Barnum had lost his business, the support of the people, and after recent events at an show across the globe, his wife had temporarily left to clear her mind. All of the 'misfits' follow closely behind Barnum as he sulks his way to the town saloon to drink away his losses, and as they realize they all still have each other, we hear a song with true meaning. Starting out with a solo part by Hugh Jackman, ""From Now On"" a song, slow and melancholy, again with that very gray and depressing color overtaking the scene, is at first an indirect apology to his wife and all of the circus for letting them down. It slowly picks up, and the scene starts to have color and life again. He slowly starts to talk about his successes and how *those were someone else's dreams* while realizing that everything he had gone through had given his life a purpose and made him happy. *a man learns who is there for him when the glitter fades and the walls won't hold* This song turns into a drinking song, the energy in the bar becomes uncontainable and they start to sing and dance with Barnum on his way out the door, as he continues singing lead while running down the sidewalk.
Slowly we start to see the sunset's golden glow from behind the clouds, the life is returning to the town as people begin to walk out of their stores and homes and onto the streets. Gracey uses color to help show the mood in this film, as commonly done in many different movies, and it helps you relate emotionally to what's going on during the film. His appropriate use of color in this particular film allow the audience to experience the happiness and excitement during the shows P.T. Barnum puts on, as well as the sadness and strength of the 'misfits' when they walk through the crowds of angry, disapproving people who want peace, quiet and normalcy in their town. Scenes with bright color are typically the scenes with high energy and they're the highlights of the film, in this case, the shows and dances that kids try to copy at home and the songs they go home singing. The scenes with a seemingly drained lighting are those like the circus after the fire had destroyed its walls and spirit inside them. Like Barnum and his fellow employees in the beginning, when everyone was laid off, before Barnum started fraudulently climbing his way to the top of success; both scenes with a very somber mood.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the immense and utter cinematic skill used to put together the amazing, The Greatest Showman is remarkable. This puts previous attempts like the 1934, The Mighty Barnum and A Lady's Morals of 1930 almost to shame. And while the ideas and creativity are similar to that of The Great and Powerful Oz, this film has something that Oz does not, and that is the ability to feel as if you are inside the movie itself. The Greatest Showman captures its audience and takes them on every journey along with the characters and the stories and adventures they make come to life. The best kinds of movies are able to captivate their audience a lot like Gracey's work with this film, and he did an outstanding job."

","Perhaps a little harsh, as I usually love musicals and some of the songs and dances were wonderful, dazzlingly brilliant and clever but it all had an underlying emptiness.
Maybe it was the subject matter, no matter how you spin it it was about a showman exploiting people to make money. He lied, stole and cheated; not a particularly nice character. There was some change of heart at the end in this film version of Barnum's life, but apparently not in reality.
Hugh Jackman was wonderful as were most of the cast and I wish they had been given a better story to tell. Was it made because it epitomises the ""American dream"", poor boy makes good and becomes famous and wealthy - at any cost - then finds his heart again?
Because Hugh Jackman was in it I couldn't help but compare this to the brilliance of the story of Les Miserables, which is about things that matter, redemption, goodness etc As against this shallow, grasping man's life story."
"CabbageCustard","5","0","0","15 January 2019"," Great music, but not much else
","This movie is essentially just a series of lavishly produced and heavily stylized musical numbers held together by a flimsy and perfunctory plot. Anyone looking for any insight into the life of PT Barnum (albeit with music) or, surprisingly, some emotional depth should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>This movie is simply an assault on your senses, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Visually and aurally it is fantastic. I found it completely lacking in emotional impact however, even though some of the songs are definitely meant to evoke emotion. This is possibly because the movie never slows down or quietens down enough to allow emotion to build. I did not dislike this at all. At the end of it all though, I felt curiously unmoved.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the original soundtrack for the most part and kudos goes to the composers. It will be interesting to see if these songs have a life beyond the run of the movie as many songs from other musicals have.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the production was excellent although some of the CGI animals were obviously CGI. A good number of the actors were quite obviously miming their songs to some one else's voice. Make up was top notch and acting was great too.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie and enjoy it as a great concert, just don't go expecting a great movie."

"alindsay-al","8","0","0","29 December 2018"," A great truly unique experience.
","I have been told to watch this film for a while now and I have now watched the Greatest Showman and I really enjoyed watching this film. The premise of this film sees a man come up with the idea of showcasing unique individuals in a performance to impress people. Hugh Jackman plays the lead in this film and he does such an amazing job in the role as PT Barnham in this film, you see his characters vision in the film and are rooting for him so much. He delivers in all the singing scenes and I cannot stress how perfect he was in this film. The supporting cast also does a great job, Michelle Williams plays Jackman's wife in the film and i thought she did a good job in the film, their chemistry is decent and when given some time to shine she does a pretty good job. Rebecca Fergurson is great in this film as a legit singer and you see the good and bad that her character brings to Jackman's life that actually provides some interesting storytelling in the film. Zac Efron and Zendaya are growing as perfromers and both have big roles in this film and I thought they worked very well together and made me careabout certain aspects of their story. The story has some interesting story beats that look at social issues which works as well as you would expect for a film like this. However, it always feel like the story is secondary in this film and that certain things take place just to lengthen the film out and add some drama to the film. The script has some really good quick snappy dialogue in it, expecially with fun humourous moments but it also works when it needs to turn dramatic aswell. The style of this film is so incredibly unique, the songs and dance sequences are ridiculously entertaining and catchy, they are the things that you remember coming out of this film. But some of the CGI used in the film looks poor and not completely finished which does affect the film. Overall this film is a great experience and is worth a watch for sure especially if you are a fan of musicals."
"cricketbat","8","0","0","28 December 2018"," The music is great, the story is simplistic
","The Greatest Showman is much like P.T. Barnum's shows-the music, choreography and presentation are spectacular, so even if the story is simplistic and the performances are hit & miss, it's still an entertaining movie that makes you smile. This isn't a deep, dramatic film for critiquing adults, it's a fun musical for the whole family with memorable songs and a good message."
"samuellickiss","7","0","0","28 December 2018"," First viewing: hated it. Second viewing? Loved it.
","I first came across P.T. Barnum while doing some research for a project I was working on about Wunderkammer, or cabinets of curiosities. Barnum was many things - certainly complex - but he was not a nice man, and an egotist to the extreme.<br/><br/>Being at least vaguely familiar with Barnum tempered my initial viewing of the film, though it's hard not to like the songs and set pieces. Barnum here is a sympathetic, though flawed figure, and we're supposed to believe he was a benevolent employer and all-round good guy.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is best described as a historical fantasy. (Most of) the characters were real and some of the events depicted were real, but that's more or less it. It's best to approach it as fantasy rather than a historical, rather like 300. The artistic license has been taken to new extremes - it's a rather politically correct history.<br/><br/>This irritated me on my initial viewing. The film ignores - completely - some of Barnum's more shady enterprises, including slavery. While it makes some attempt to look at other issues, including an interracial relationship and the promotion of 'freaks' for money-making purposes, it's puddle deep. Character development is thin on the ground (at one point, Hugh Jackman's Barnum makes it clear his 'freaks' are unwelcome to a swanky reception, which prompts Keala Settle's Lettie Lutz to sing 'This is Me' - the film's signature anti-bullying song - but all seems to be forgiven immediately)<br/><br/>There's definitely a place in the film market for a biopic of Barnum's life and works, because that would be fantastic. This is not it. Nevertheless, I watched it again recently and just let myself relax and enjoy it. Do this, and it's an extremely enjoyable film. It's beautifully filmed. You could pause it at any point and print out the still and you'd be happy to have it framed on your wall. Performances are all-round spectacular. If you're like me and you're more used to seeing Jackman murdering people with adamantium claws then you'll be seriously impressed by this man's extraordinary talent. He can sing. Really, really well.<br/><br/>Songs like A Million Dreams, This is Me and The Greatest Show will bring a smile to your face - you'll have to really fight it from forming if you're determined to be a cynic.<br/><br/>It's a little corny and in places overly sentimental. I wish they'd added just a little more depth to it and given some of Barnum's performers proper subplots, as opposed to Zac Effron's mostly forgettable Philip Carlyle.<br/><br/>All in all, it's just fun, and that's absolutely fine. You're allowed to have fun and just enjoy a show. After all, this is what Barnum did: he was a showman. It didn't matter if that show was based upon fakery, lies and exploitation - he entertained people who wanted to be entertained, and that was all he pretended to do. That, probably, is the essence of this film, and honestly I don't care.<br/><br/>So if you're like me and tend to be a bit pedantic and naturally critical, treat yourself to a bottle of wine, let your brain stew a little in the alcohol and let yourself be entertained."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","0","28 December 2018"," The Greatest Showman was unable to rewrite the stars with its formulaic story.
","Every year there is a ""crowd pleaser"", a film that has garnered criticism from industry experts but received overwhelming popularity from audiences. This was that film in 2017. An infectiously joyous musical that was hailed to be a monumental rejuvenation of the genre (because apparently 'La La Land' failed to do that, despite being perfect). But beneath the showstoppers and audacious musical numbers, lies a predictably formulaic story that feels weaker than Efron's 'High School Musical' days. Loosely based on P.T. Barnum's life, this musical chronicles his showmanship years as he recruits a band of ""oddities"" to perform in his new show. However fame and fortune corrupts him as he succumbs to greed and...well, you can guess the rest. You may have noticed the supreme reign of the soundtrack throughout this year, as radio stations constantly blast out ""This Is Me"". That's because, and I'm starting off bold, this is one of the best musical soundtracks ever. Literally every track is memorable, both melodically and lyrically. From the powerhouse ""This Is Me"" to the gorgeously romantic ""Rewrite The Stars"". Each song has its own vibe and suits the situation they are performed in. It's just a shame the film itself doesn't complement the excellence of its soundtrack.<br/><br/>The rags-to-riches plot has been executed countless times, and is quite frankly becoming dull. Aside from the delicate (albeit forced) romance between Efron and Zendaya, the story lacks substance. Barnum remains unlikeable throughout, including at the very end when he encounters redemption. The wrong choices he obviously decides to take prevent him from being relatable. There's a fine margin between representing greed (whilst justifying it) and creating an inhumane character. The theme of acceptance that should've been flailing on the circus floor is unfortunately sidelined. Nearly every supporting character is underused. I mean Barnum's wife forgives him almost immediately, consequently diluting the much needed drama. Williams' fragility and delicate nature was severely misplaced, which frustrates me. It's clear that this is the ""Hugh Jackman Show"" and he does deliver on almost everything. He dives into the routines, brings naivety to Barnum and is most certainly having a good time. Efron and Zendaya were also excellent, and would love to have seen more of them. In fact, I would go as far as saying that the film could've benefited from adding an extra thirty minutes to the runtime. Spacing out the dialogue and drama between songs instead of feeling like a collection of music videos strung together with a lack of imaginative storytelling.<br/><br/>This review may sound negative, but that's only because I wanted more. In all honesty I enjoyed it. I was smiling, tapping my feet to the songs and even belting out ""never enoughhhhhhhh for me...for meee...for MEEEEE"". It's a joyous pleasing film that will appeal to the masses, with the numerous showstoppers disguising what is essentially a weak story."

","With a jejune mindset full of dreams, watch it when you are seeking an inspiration in life. Meticulously expressed in a layperson's experience of events and beautifully developed to engender positive vibes in the viewers. Nonetheless a lot of jargon is present for the acute minded ones to keep them on the track of their journey. Majority of the film relates to the self made people, engrossing themselves in the characters will sure remind them of their path towards success. No matter what phase of your life you are in, it's a must watch for everyone, it's like a rising sun, alone or with others you are sure get hooked on that feeling."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>The ring master P.T. Barnum's life and career are told as only could be: with bold and juicy colors, unique people, animals, music all as a grand spectacle. The story touches on his childhood, early career, rocky start to his entrepreneur vision of curiosities and how he elevated it. Also how he gave peculiar and different people a place to feel accepted and welcome, which was driven home with a heavy hand. We got it the first couple times. The music was enjoyable and blended into the story smoothly. Not sure how factual it was but it was fun and full of eye candy."

","Second viewing for ""The Greatest Showman"" following seeing it at the cinema towards the end of 2017.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is PT Barnum, who rises from poverty via a job on the railroad to become the owner and purveyor of a museum of oddities in New York City, to more legitimate forms of entertainment. The film charts that rise and the effect it has on his family, including his wife who he has loved since their childhood.<br/><br/>Whilst I do think that ""The Greatest Showman"" is an excellent musical, as a legitimate biopic of PT Barnum or even as a film it's not as worthwhile. A bit of research shows its massively inaccurate and there just isn't enough conflict to his adult life to make it worthwhile story to tell. Critics don't like him, but people show up. He turns his back on his circus cast to promote an opera singer, they sing a song about it and then forgive him. He nearly has an affair and his wife leaves him, she comes back the first time he sees her.<br/><br/>The songs though, are undeniable. They're all catchy and memorable and it's not surprising that so many of them have taken on lives of their own outside of the film. They're all performed and choreographed well. The blending in of CGI elements into some of them only enhances the experience on some of the songs and the direction, for a first full feature, is excellent.<br/><br/>I doubt it'd be the one to win over any musical theatre holdouts but if you're anyway inclined towards the genre, I'm confident you'll enjoy it."

","First of all, this film has to be judged as a musical extravaganza not just as a film. If you seek a great story with imagination then you wont get much of that. As a musical however, this is amongst the greatest ever. <br/><br/>High Jackman is a very talented performer. When I first watched him in Les Miserables, I was amazed by his singing. In 'The Greatest Showman' he sings and dances like the greats of old. He puts in so much energy into his performance. You can see that he really enjoyed the role. The performance captures the audience attention on the journey. The support are good but Keala Settle stands out with 'This is me'. I wanted to see more of Zac Efron and Zendaya singing and dancing. But they do a wonderful job when they are called upon. Michelle Williams provides calm in sometimes hectic moments with her singing. The 'Freaks' are not shown as much and judging by their acting, maybe it was deliberate. But the songs and dace sequences mask the few flwas this movie has.<br/><br/>Overall Hugh Jackman is the master showman and carries this film. Well deserved honors this film receives."

","To start with I only watched the trailer, which presented a rags to riches story. this looked interesting as I like to see how people overcome their hardships by turning problems into opportunities. I never read any reviews but after seeing the movie I wished I had. I like some musicals. This, form watching the trailer never gave the impression of being a musical. When it started it turned into a operetta real fast covering period of about twenty years. Major disappointment !!! Had I known it was a musical I would not have went to see it. If you like a fast moving musical go for it."

","I've loved musicals since my mom took me to see West Side Story as a kid (even though I hid my love for them as I was a death metal drummer back in the days). I loved the story, and the visuals, costume and camera work. But the music itself is to modern and to studio sounding for the time period it's supposed to represent. Moulin Rouge did it's own thing with making modern songs in it's own style that made the already epic songs even more timeless. But here it could be songs from any main stream crappy 6 months lifespan ""artist"" nowadays.<br/><br/>And I really hate that the (main) actors aren't doing their own dance scenes, as they aren't real dancers."
"gclingham","3","5","16","29 December 2017"," I knew it was bad from the trailer.
","I watched the trailer and I knew it would be bad. I went to see it and it wasn't as bad as I thought but had flaws that critics managed to find. I was kind of excited to see what the circus was like back then but I was immediately disappointed. The writers just got lazy and didn't bother showing how the show was executed. Every show was just told across songs. They especially wasted the trapeze artists. They just spun on a ring in the air and came down when it was time to sing. They said that they didn't use wires or nets. If that happens you NEED to show more trapeze. I also felt like you could replace Rebecca Furgesson's character with a houseplant and it wouldn't change anything about the storyline. Another thing I didn't like was that some of the actors weren't actually singing. They were lip syncing and having someone replace their vocals. It would have been nice if they at least tried to have them sing instead of casting them because of their popularity."
"coltond-79547","1","4","12","8 November 2018"," Don't watch this film
","The only thing it does right is the drinking scene. That was really cool. But every single other thing about this movie is predictable, so cliche that it's it's own genre of bad, and the soundtrack is just kinda unnecessary. The makers of this flick tried to make P.T. Barnum look like a good guy, which he is not, and they don't even do a good job of convincing me otherwise. The effects are bad, the acting is okay, the singing is mediocre, and the movie itself is really unenjoyable"
"swgreif","1","4","12","21 October 2018"," Hugh Jackman makes a di...uh...fool of himself
","I'd rather go to the dentist for root canal work than watch this ugly monstrosity again. From an historical point of view, it has nothing to do with the long dead, great PT Barnum. The banshee music, the hip hop (why no break-dancing!), was like repeated vulgar mob scenes we see daily on TV news was about as Victorian as an electric toothbrush. I was particularly disgusted by the gyrations of the bovine bearded lady. Once again Hollywood insinuates ""Inclusiveness"" into our wilting brains, brainwashing at its best. Avoid like the plague."
"belizerdogmus","4","4","12","16 January 2018"," It was a lot worse than I expected
","If you are someone who easily recognizes auto-tune and gets annoyed at it, this movie is not for you. All of the songs were heavily auto-tuned from start to end., the music was extremely uninspired and bland, all of them were like songs you hear on the car radio and they're ok but there isn't anything special about them. I liked that they made it a musical, but the music was honestly so bad that I hoped it would end as soon as possible. Also the music is completely off era. I mean the movie takes place in the 1850s and all of the music were 2017 styled same boring rhythmed music. When Jenny Lind was first going to sing I was very excited, then very disappointed. She is an opera singer??? Who sings opera? The music was like a casual pop song and it was really so bad. I really can't understand how people don't notice the auto-tunes, it is so obvious. The only thing I liked about the movie was the casting. Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams and Rebecca Ferguson were all amazing (those three are my favorites). The acting was good though the movie was very predictable. The plot and the dialogues were actually pretty good, if only the music was better. Overall, I don't recommend it. I usually don't trust critics, but this time thy are right."
"shmammy-30599","3","4","12","15 January 2018"," Created an account to review this because I was baffled at the amount of high ratings
","I disliked this movie very much. Maybe I'm not the right demo, maybe I'm too critical but my god this film was not good. As I'm going through these reviews on here, I see so many high ratings. And that's made me very mad so here I am writing my first review on IMDB. If you liked this film, you might want not want to read below because I am going to shred it to pieces.<br/><br/>But I did give this film 3 stars and not 1, and that's because of the performances and cinematography. The actors did a great job with what they were given, the best of them for me was Keala Settle as the bearded lady. Even the child actors were pretty good. But it's too bad that what they were given was awful. And some of the shots were really pretty and unique (Zac Efron's and Zendaya's duet on the ropes) so I'll give them brownie points for those things. Now to the things I didn't like.<br/><br/>The biggest downfall was that the pacing was all off. There were too many story lines trying to be told and I felt that nothing ever got resolved by the time the credits rolled. Example: During the middle of the film (just before 'This is Me') it was revealed to the troupe that P.T (Hugh Jackman) didn't care about his talent anymore because he didn't want to tarnish his reputation and appeal. Near the end of the film the troupe says something along the lines of ""You cared about us and took us in."" WHAT A LOAD OF BS. He abandoned them for fame and riches and this was never addressed in the film ever again. There's were a few examples like this but that one annoyed me the most.<br/><br/>Next was the characters and script. So bloody 2 dimensional. The characters felt so fake and I didn't connect with any of them. There were no real character journeys we went through, no inner turmoil of P.T and everyone felt so airy. Now, the script. A story needs to have tension, stakes, conflict. What this film had didn't even come close to any of those things. As I've said, the pacing was everywhere and too many plots were rolling around in the bag. <br/><br/>My last gripe is the music and FX. This film was set in the Victorian era when the Queen was young, so I'm guessing 1840's? Why the hell they decided on doing pop rock music I'll never know. It didn't fit with the era of time at all, by the middle of the opening song I was uncomfortable. Yes, the music was good but it didn't fit within the film. Quick note of the FX, it was very noticeable. Some examples were the white sheets being lifted up into the sky during the Hugh x Michelle number, the ELEPHANTS DURING THE FINAL SHOW/PERFORMANCE. Not to mention near the end P.T came up riding on one for his daughter's recital and remember audibly groaning in the cinema.<br/><br/>Be realistic movie! A musical can be enjoyable, heartwarming and fun, but it also has to be realistic. And the bottom line was that this film didn't make sense."

","I found this movie boring. While it is filled to the brim with excitement and fun scenes, the cliches and overall cheesiness made it painful to watch. The autotune-infused pop music didn't help with that matter, either- this movie has so many instances where characters start singing when they are met with a conflict they can't resolve. By the sixth time a song came up, I was practically screaming ""JUST TALK IT OUT."" <br/><br/>I love musicals - when the trailer came out, I thought it seemed like it had potential, having a talented cast and stunning visuals. But that didn't save it from having a terrible, predictable story and unlikeable characters.<br/><br/>Oh, and Zac Effron. Hate that guy."

","I'll get this out of the way: some (not all) of the music is enjoyable when it is taken out of the movie to be listened to by its own merits. When that 21st century pop is put into a 19th century period piece, it seems out of place. This movie is not able to develop any of its themes or characters in convincing ways. Every message is either hinted at and never expanded on or just thrown in your face with out any kind of set up. Also the movie has a character in it that is supposed to represent the uptight critic which is teaching the audience that it's ok to harass anyone with critism because you should just have fun. You can enjoy the movie if you want and that's totally up to opinion but this is an objectively bad movie and musical."

This pretty much floored me. The songs were pristine. The choreography was creative and fun. The casting worked wonderfully as did the special effects. I'm only taking a point away because it was so utterly contrived. But I thought Jackman and Ephron did yeoman duty as the leads. The circus bits were great. The ""freaks"" were engaging and fun. I wished it had a slightly sharper edge and a little more internal conflict, but the message put forth was just fine. Go see it because it is great fun."

Unfortunately that's where the fun ends. Having been looking forward to it, we struggled to the end through an almost non existent plot, unlikeable characters, dull, samey music and uninspired production.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","4","3","9","10 April 2018"," The problem isn't that it's a musical but that it isn't a particularly good one.
","There's an interesting story in here that would have been much better served as either a straight drama or comedy. Perhaps, it could have even still been a musical, so long as the real-life events were portrayed honestly and the characters were given some actual development, instead of the glorified and one-note representations we are given here. The point is that the problem I had with the piece isn't that its a musical (admittedly my least favourite genre) but that it isn't a particularly good one. Songs start seemingly out of nowhere and tend to head in that same direction, with only one or two actually representing a change within the characters or displaying their inner desires previously not communicated to the audience. The overall piece also can't seem to decide if it occupies that weird space where the world itself stops for a musical number, but it's essentially just for the audience, or if the flick wants the characters themselves to literally be singing (diegetically) within the scene. Instead, the film confusingly flutters between the two modes, sometimes within the same sequence, breaking any immersion that might've been felt. There were only one or two such sequences I thought were interestingly done, anyway. Its an odd choice for pop-style music in a period narrative, but one that could've worked it if was perhaps pushed further or done more cohesively. I will admit that one or two songs are catchy and entertaining in isolation. But the lack of connective tissue is even more inexcusable when you consider that most of the material just isn't that good. This would've certainly been better served as an album than a screen story. 4/10"

"bencorb-87325","10","3","9","27 March 2018"," I don't like musicals!
","First off I'm not a big musical fan. I like to get lost in a movie and, for me, the musical interludes detract from that feeling as I am also a musician and I just can't connect with the vast majority of the music in musicals. This film is entirely different, the songs add so much emotion, heart, soul, and add to the story like I've never experienced before. <br/><br/>The more you watch it the better it gets. It is an absolute masterpiece, one of only a handful of films that have had a truly profound affect on me. Hugh Jackman is great, Zendaya is brilliant, Zac Effron is astounding, and the direction is subtly beautiful.<br/><br/>I don't read critics reviews on films so I don't know what was written about this, Perhaps it wasn't a true reflection of Barnum's life? Well, when was a movie ever 100% life story? And I don't really think it matters, especially as it is a musical, the idea is enough for me. What is interesting is that the movie itself is somewhat a metaphor for much of what is wrong with critics and reviews. I think we have forgotten how to just enjoy a movie without dissecting every aspect of it and striving to feel like we know something the next person isn't smart enough to know.<br/><br/>This is my first ever review and I was very sceptical about this film due to my lack of enthusiasm regarding musicals, but this was a wonderful experience and one I won't forget in a hurry!<br/><br/>I'm a huge movie fan, written screenplays, and love all aspects of film.

So, the film makers did take a few liberties, Barnum was accompanied by Tom Thumb only when they had an audience with Queen Vic and obviously Zac Efron's character was an almagamation of a few historical people. But.....I couldn't care less, if it was put forward as a historical film then certainly I would be annoyed, but this film is to make you feel good, inspire, joyous and on all levels it did what it set out to do.

"bkoganbing","8","2","5","13 May 2018"," The art of promotion
","It's ironic that this musical celebration of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum comes
out just when the last tangible legacy of his life comes to an end. The plot of
The Greatest Showman ends just when Barnum gets the idea that he just needs
a large tent to house his attractions. We never see Barnum&Bailey's circus come
to fruition, we never even meet James P. Bailey in this film.. Their circus merged
with that of the Ringling family and it was Ringling Brothers&Barnum&Bailey
circus that traveled the world for over a century. Last year the troupe finally
broke up as the circus became an institution confined to history. Still Phineas
Taylor Barnum is still a name that set a standard for promotion.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman looks a whole lot like in style and substance with the
Cole Porter tribute film It's DeLovely. But that film had a library of a song catalog to score that film from its subject. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote the songs for The Greatest Showman and This Is Me gained an Oscar nomination for Best Song, one of the very few now written for that rarest of
film lately, the original screen musical.<br/><br/>A lot of people have brought P.T. Barnum to the screen and Hugh Jackman in 
his performance joins such folks as Wallace Beery, Burt Lancaster, and Michael
Crawford among others. Jackman doesn't take a back seat to any of these.
Two refugees from the Disney Studio, Zac Efron and Zendaya have great parts
to exhibit their musical talents. Rebecca Ferguson plays The Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind who represented Barnum's successful bid for respectability. She has a nice song to sing dubbed by Loren Allred in Never 
Enough. But it might have been wiser and more accurate to have gotten some
soprano to sing a familiar public domain aria instead. What you see here is
most definitely not an authentic Jenny Lind.<br/><br/>There's no more Scudder's Museum where Barnum exhibited his sideshow acts.
Jenny Lind arrived too soon for her voice to be captured on Mr. Edison's new
phonograph, and now the circus is of the past. But The Greatest Showman is
still quite a tribute to the one who really invented the concept of show business, P.T. Barnum."

It's a movie to pass the time, entertain you, you're not going to hallucinate with the shows either, because they're not the bomb.<br/><br/>The actors, normal, neither more nor less.<br/><br/>Yes, he has a good photograph. It's pretty and nice.<br/><br/>The address leaves a lot to be desired. In this type of film, we should have seen some spectacular plans that would have delighted us, but do not know how to do it. He only knows how to watch the movie. It has a rhythm, yes, but not too much.<br/><br/>There are much better films, which raise the mood and are more spectacular."
"heykateforever","10","2","5","29 April 2018"," A rollicking good time. Fabulously entertaining. Great musical numbers.
","What's not to love in this fantastical reinvention of the P.T. Barnum story? In a world where politics are dividing everyone, where standards no longer exist, where it's a rare movie families can enjoy together, there is The Greatest Showman to bring such joy and magnificent energy into our hearts! The music is absolutely wonderful in the very definition of the word. The energy on the screen keeps you tapping your foot and a smile on your face. Not since the great Gene Kelly musicals of the 1940s and 50s have we seen such delightful, excellent, PURE entertainment! Hugh Jackman has proven himself the king of the musical stage and who knew Zac Efron had so much musical and dance talent! A rare movie that lifts your spirits and is so fresh for today's audiences. Bringing back musicals now seems like a reality instead of a dream that happened so many years ago. I predict this movie will join The Sound of Music and Singing in the Rain as a classic to be enjoyed over and over again for years to come. I gave this movie a rare 10 not because it's perfect, but because it played like a dream and time stood still for me throughout it's entirety. I felt transported by the joyfulness and sheer energy that enfused this production. I feel sorry for those of you who could not feel the emotion it elicited for me. I hope we will see many more movies like this in the near future. Mr. Jackman, I forgive you for leaving Wolverine behind. You were definitely meant for a much more inspiring future in musicals."

I never write reviews but I can't believe the critics I'm hearing on here. <br/><br/>As P.T.

The movie is filled with emotions which lift you up in the happiness/joy department which is getting very very rare these days.
The acting is sensational all-around the movie. The music is awesome (My brain is still singing lyrics from the greatest show song... is it everything you ever want... is it everything you ever need). And Hugh Jackman... What an actor he is!! Loved him in every role from the prestige to wolverine to P. T. Barnum...

","When you talked about musicals definitely visuality and musics comes first and in this movie you can satisfy both of them especially from musics. A little unrealistic things at visuals but they are so little, in fact if you aren't too much careful you cant notice. Hugh Jackman left me breathless, great actor great singer great dancer. He is what every musical needs. He made great job in this movie same thing he did at the Les Miserables. Length of movie could be longer and story could be come up more deeply. After all this all you need is this sentence if you are a musical lover don't waste your time and go watch this movie. Your possibility the dislike this movie is probably %0.1

","He Greatest Showman is moviemaking without a net (no pun intended) in the most wonderful way. I truly am taken back by the talented mind that envisioned this and had the bravery to go for it in a way that made me think Walt Disney's magic was once again summoned. From the start to finish this is an amazing musical. The story is both whimsical and moving. The music and dancing is of the highest caliber and tells the story as much as the dialog. All actors are superb in their roles to a point that almost defies reason. And it is all presented in the most spectacular cinematography which becomes a crucial player in it's breathtaking palate of composition, lighting, and color. Bravo! A real creative masterpiece.

","I would like to start by saying that I am a movie fanatic! I enjoy a wide variety from documentaries to slap-stick comedies. Although, musicals might not always be my favorite, this is my first review EVER on IMDB. I can't understand how anyone could have a negative thing to say about such an outstanding film. I loved everything about this movie. The sets, the story, the music; especially the music!!!!!!! I believe that Zac Efron will eventually be considered one of the greats; especially of my generation. He just completely devotes himself to every roll he plays and although I personally believe he excels at comedy, he can do anything and this role was made for him. Hugh Jackman was, to no one's amazement, perfection! The story was so touching and kept my attention from beginning to end. The sets, colors, choreography, singing, etc. were just spectacular. I highly suggest taking a listen to ""Never Enough"" and ""This Is Me"". Both songs gave me goosebumps from head to toe during the film. The negative reviews are just baffling to me. This is sure to become the standard for modern musicals. Do yourself a favor and SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"

To begin, the songs are Oscar worthy and in my opinion deserved an Oscar even more than La La Land (songs written by the same people). Hugh Jackman was amazing as always. Obviously it would have been nice to see more character development in this but hey, it's a Hollywood musical, who cares about character development! You have to watch this movie with an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is. If the critics reviews are putting you off this movie then you especially need to watch this. I have now seen this movie twice and as soon as I finished watching the second time, I wanted to watch it again, and that's how you know a movie is great.

"tfk_punk","10","2","5","5 March 2018"," Critics are dumb. Listen to the audience scores.
","I have never written a review here. Ever. This is the first movie to ever compel me to do so. I admit, I was a bit doubtful about an original ""Hollywood"" musical, as last years La La Land left me severely disappointed, and especially since this movie's lyrics were written by the same people, so I went in with very very low expectations. But this literally ended up being one of THE best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. This might even be my new favorite movie. The songs literally gave me goosebumps, and the movie just makes you smile and fills you with joy. I've seen it twice in theaters, and just pre-ordered the movie through Amazon. This really is one of those movies you can watch over and over. <br/><br/>I have also not trusted critics for a while, especially ones here (Metacritic) and definitely not Rotten Tomatoes. If you look both here and there, Critics give it around a 50% average, while audience gives it nearly a 90%.. Always, ALWAYS listen to the audience. Movies are not made (at least they shouldn't be) for critics, they are made for the audience. That's the whole point of making a movie is for an audience, so their opinion should count above all else. This movie was snubbed at the Academy Awards last night, only being nominated for Best Original Song, and it didn't even win that. The Academy Awards for at least the past decade, have been very untrustworthy. I usually watch the nominated and winning films every year, and most every year they are not at all worthy of such praise. So Academy Award nominations mean nothing to me anymore. People's Choice Awards should be where it is at, that should be the new standard of Hollywood, as I am sure this will be nominated. And being an actor myself, if I ever did ""make it"", a People's Choice would mean more to me than any Academy Award. <br/><br/>This movie is fun, plain and simple. It get's you from the beginning and doesn't let go."

Zac Efron and Zendaya shine in their roles, and Hugh Jackman successfully carries the lead. We don't spend much time with each character. However, the lack of depth is made up for by the inventive and surprising songwriting and the heartfelt performances from the cast.

","Yes, it's a musical. Or isn't it? There're 11 songs so deeply inserted into the story that only because each of them is so good you end up by noticing. But forget about the genre: you leave the cinema in better shape than the one you entered. You will be happy, excited, motivated and grateful. It's a shot of some healthy drug. I'm 51, when with my wife and teenager daughter, and all of us where transformed. I can believe the recognition it gets is one nomination. The Shape of Water has 12, and I'm still trying to recover from the experience. This is WAY BETTER than LaLa Land, Moulin Rouge or any other musical I've seen. Because of the impact it did on us, I will put it together with Forest Gump on the top of my list."
"dishlady69","8","2","5","18 February 2018"," Circus of Life (No Spoilers)
","Jackman brings his A game to this film, as does the entire cast. There's one small plot twist I wasn't a fan of (no spoilers) because it reverses the push for equality that was building up in the film, however the story is well executed and the soundtrack is remarkable. Efron is all grown up and really growing into these more intense roles. (A while ago I thought his recent B-level surfer-dude film was going to be a defining point in his career, but he shows a great deal of potential and is an ideal wingman to Jackman.)"
"magicstone2018","10","2","5","17 February 2018"," Love it!
","The Greatest Showman is the best musical movie I have seen in recent years! Love the performance, love the costume, love the stage settings, and love the music! The cast are so professional, energetic, and passionate that I can feel their emotions. Every song in the movie is so excellent! I liked This Is Me when I first saw the movie. It's the theme song of the film that tells people not to be afraid of being themselves. When I went out from the cinema, Rewrite the Star totally caught my heart, because it's a love song, but not so clichÃ©, kind of elegant. By the time I arrived home, I felt like A Million Dream was awesome. I like Barnum and Charity's dance part on the roof when they were dancing across the bedsheet, truly beautiful! After repeating the soundtrack album for at least three times in two days, I just fell in love with every song. I went to see the movie for the second time last night and I'm sure From Now On will be the one I will keep listening to in the following days. <br/><br/>Some people think the story is too simple, but I think it's amazing. It tells a story about love, friendship, family, and so many wonderful things, and it makes me feel encouraged. When I was writing this review, I couldn't stop humming Never Enough from the movie! The music completes the story and the story perfects the music. Love it! <br/><br/>P.S. Already seen the movie for six times! Fantastic! IMAX is definitely the best choice for this movie!"

I've heard people complain that its not accurate to the reality of Barnum and that he was apparently not a great person in real life etc, but I never expect a ""based on a true story"" to actually be true. so take it as its own story and you will have an amazing time. Everyone is just so passionate in this, from the acting to the sets, costumes and music the whole thing makes you feel the passion that these talented and amazing people have for this story. It is worth mentioning that after I saw it, I immediately went back to the box office and bought a ticket for the next show, then the next day I was able to get half price tickets so I saw it twice more, and to be honest, 2 weeks later I am debating on going again after i finish writing this."
"harmony04-194-66092","10","2","5","14 January 2018"," what the hell are the critics on about?
","Honestly, the critics are crap nowadays. Perfect example is Star Wars the last jedi. The critics mostly rated it highly and the users mostly rubbished it. And that movie really was rubbish. In the case of The Greatest Showman, its the exact opposite where the critics mostly rubbished it but the users mostly rated it highly. And to be honest, this movie was awesome. The story was great, the movie had alot of emotion, comedy and drama. The set pieces were very nice and the actors looked like they gave it their all especially during the dance choregraphy and songs. Speaking of the songs, most were really good and i liked how they continued the story though the singing which meant you werent just sitting there waiting for the songs to end to carry on with the movie, the lyrics continued to tell the story. Such a cool movie. If you havent seen it already, you should go and see it. Stuff the critics. They need to get the chopping board."

","IF YOU GO TO SEE THIS FILM, YOU WILL WANT TO PURSUE YOUR DREAMS.<br/><br/>I have to admit I did have some expectations for this film, maybe unlike the majority of intrigued cinema goers as Hugh Jackman steals me every time he's on-screen.<br/><br/>Although I did feel as though my view of the film would be bias as I was willing for it to live up to what i'd hoped.. But my god it did that all by itself! INCREDIBLE. It's exactly what the world needs right now, an unconditionally inspiring story with a soundtrack that makes you want to join the circus.<br/><br/>The story itself may be predictable, and it's not one for the Sherlock Homes' out there to de-code and look at it upside down, but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

","My daughter begged me to take her to see this film, and I, reluctantly gave in. To be honest, it took the movie 30 seconds to draw me in. The beginning 10 minutes are amazing and with such great music had me hooked. The messages of the film are inspiring. First, there is Barnum's (I know fictionalized) optimism and attitude that no one can keep you from dreaming. But then, the message that Charity was preaching from the beginning, that happiness is where you find it and that family is at the heart of it all comes back with such a great ending. The music, the acting, the choreography, the visuals. This movie was awesome. It is such a great family musical. Please go support it so that Hollywood will make more movies like this."

"xhanetbn","9","2","5","3 January 2018"," The ""Greatest"" Message?
","Disclaimer: I write this review solely on the account of the movie and not on the accuracy of the portrayal of P. T. Barnum's history.<br/><br/>Honestly, I was shook to the core and left the cinema feeling a sense of awe and wonder. Firstly, the music was excellent; the talent unquestionable. I could only laugh as I thought: ""Is Zac Efron FINALLY moving back to the genre he started in?"". Obviously, this is not in anyway negatively intended as I found his presence in this movie to be pleasant and extremely welcomed, much to his favour as a refresh to my increasingly foul impression of him (after having watched Baywatch). Hugh Jackman also did an incredible job as ""The Greatest Showman"", portraying the infamous businessman, P. T. Barnum. Make no mistake, I love the X-Men series, and I love Hugh as the Wolverine but I find myself really enjoying him playing more roles like this as he displays both his acting and musical talents. <br/><br/>I felt like the movie was also well-paced, whereby the scenes flowed fluidly where it was easy to grasp and follow along the development of the character's story. Coming back to the musical aspect of the movie, it didn't feel forced as if the singing seemed unnecessary and untimely. In my opinion, that fluidity creates a truly magical feeling. The plot wasn't anything too fancy, and this isn't a bad thing as I enjoyed the simplicity of it. It was all it needed to be. <br/><br/>But most of all, I truly enjoyed the relevancy of this movie in today's age and time. I felt like this movie could not have been made at a better time. Living currently as part of what is deemed the younger generation, I personally feel this entitlement to a more materialistic lifestyle involving a nice house, nice car. nice everything. This may also be partially biased due to my family not being very wealthy. However, it seems like more and more people from this generation are inclined to look for great ideas, just to make bank or some form of profit. As much as that is true, we often forget that not all great ideas make out to be successes, and we also tend to neglect our loved ones, family and friends alike, as well as our humanity in treating others as equals, in the process of achieving both recognition and wealth. Hence, I felt like this movie had one of the ""greater"" messages amongst many other recent works. If I had one critique about the movie, it would definitely be the special effects applied; one of the instances being in the final scene when the lions jumped on the platforms. They seemed almost unrealistic and ruined the scene (just a little) for me. Aside from that, it also seemed that Jenny Lind's character was almost too abruptly cut out from the story and I felt needed just something slightly more, but these are just minor flaws in an otherwise great piece. If you have not yet seen this movie, I truly wish you the same joyful experience that I had. <br/><br/>Thank you Michael Gracey."

"jeremychan-63517","9","2","5","1 January 2018"," Rotten Tomatoes is Rotten
","Sorry Critics, Sorry Rotten Tomatoes, never judge a movie by its background, but the movie itself.<br/><br/>The greatest showman may be one of the best musical film made, after Lala land. They music of both films are composed by the same music composer, Pasek and Paul. The soundtrack of the greatest showman is not only appealing, but emotionally engaging. 
One of the most notable song, 'This is me',which has been nominated for the golden globes award, might be the representation of the film. The lyrics of the song is talking about how we should be ourselves, the way of the song presented by keala settle will not only make you burst into tears, but reflect on the fact of how people treats those who are different. The other songs like, 'rewrite the stars', 'the greatest show' in terms of the lyrics may not be as engaging as 'this is me', yet, are great songs. <br/><br/>Seamus McGarvey has done a astounding job in terms of cinematography. The using of lighting, camera movement, shooting angle is stunning, comprising different elements, formed an alluring visual formation. With the fast pace cutting of the movie, the cinematography has blent in perfectly with the song. For example, the part where Zac Efron is singing 'rewrite the stars' with Zendaya, the camera movement capture how they dance, how they fly the rope, capturing any tiny bit of details.<br/><br/>Given that Michael Gracey is a first-time director, he has done a marvellous job in terms of directing the movie. Looking forward to his second movie. The movie the Greatest showman is undeniably a masterpiece, in terms of musical film. <br/><br/>highly recommended to the public!"

"KevinHe","10","2","5","28 December 2017"," A great musical with great artists
","From the first moment in the opening of the film I was instantly hooked by Hugh Jackman's charisma. 
There are a few slow moments that I felt were a bit bad but I guess necessary for the story however all the fantastic musical pieces in the film just make you forget the slow moments. 
The voices are strong, the soundtracks are amazingly well written and the film is able to touch on a few social issues. 
I'm also a huge fan of Zac Efron and it was great to hear him sing again. Hugh Jackman also has an amazing voice and presence.
I'd definitely recommend this film to both fans of musicals and people who have never been interested in musicals. Ultimately it's a very happy and joyous movies which movie critics don't seem to get and just want to nitpick (like a certain character in the film) at every tiny detail that is historically wrong even though it's a musical not a biographical movie."
"dmgreer","8","2","5","26 December 2017"," A sweeping impression of an epic life
","The story telling in The Greatest Showman is terse and efficient, yet flashy and impressionistic. Days, months, years of effort are glossed over in a single transition, yet the style is satisfying, because we don't really need to see all the in between stuff, we only need to see the beginning and end, and we can fill in the rest.<br/><br/>The editing dumps us straight into the musical style from the start, in a flash forward, whence we return closer to the beginning, to develop from the childhood characters of our protagonists. And right away there's more singing.<br/><br/>There's really quite a lot of music, singing, and dancing in The Greatest Showman. The music is adequate, it's the kind of pop musical stuff you could write in your sleep. It's not memorable, but some of the rhythms are topnotch, and it's entertaining enough. It doesn't get in the way of the excellent and thoughtful lyrics.<br/><br/>I love the dance choreography though, it's alternately playful and powerful, and it's enhanced with periodical special effects, such as dancers being suspended in mid air until the bass drop.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is amazing to watch and listen to, and he brings huge confidence and joy to his performance. At 37, Michelle Williams is still delicate and pretty enough to play a young woman in her twenties, and the two children are charming and personable.<br/><br/>Zendaya is super hot, and the slow motion meeting scene between her and Zac Efron reminds me of a meeting I once had with a young woman.<br/><br/>Gayle Rankin as Queen Victoria didn't seem quite right, the queen was a bit more delicate at that age (you can find a sexy portrait of Queen Victoria online), but maybe they picked Rankin for her laugh. <br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast were without flaw, and returned performances that sometimes brought a tear to my eye."

","The scene with Efron and Zendaya is simply breathtaking. Everything in life comes together in that moment. They must've had 30 cameras and months invested in it. IMHO if the movie was only that scene...it would be worth the price of a ticket.<br/><br/>I have never gone through so many emotions with any film. Happy, sad, thrilled, anger, thrilled. Hugh Jackman is infectious. <br/><br/>I love that from the very beginning they decided this is a play...not a film and they we're going to use every film technique at their command to enhance the telling of this play. They also let you know right from the get go...this is a modern telling of an old tale. They told me what to expect and delivered. Much like a great, date or any number of real life moments.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film deliver on high expectations. This movie exceeded them and more. I would rank this with any of the greatest musicals. I love seeing movies over and over but rarely get the chance to do that in the theater. That changes today."

Yes he can disguise it with his showmanship but it's gets quite painful and somewhat annoying when he breaks into song in this.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Zac Efron is outstanding and he gives the movie an important boost. It would seriously struggle for any sort of substance if he wasn't involved. Rebecca Williams and Zendaya both get mentions in this regard as well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Its a feel good plot.

This movie is Moulin Rouge, Mr. Selfridge, and Glee rolled into one entertaining package! It could have been ""left in the oven"" a little longer to polish some of the script, but so could most films anymore. No, it's not a detailed bio, nor should it be. It is pointing out and exploring showmanship, and it uses showmanship to do it. The film is at its worst when it tries to preach a message towards the end, but it was not so bad it ruined the movie.

"stefstars","Null","2","6","2 September 2019"," Why do people like this movie ?
","Who on earth said it's a good idea to romanticize the life of the greatest conman / hack P.T. Barnum ? I think what has me even more bitter with this movie is the fact that so many little kids have bought into it because of the soundtrack, which granted has 2 good songs and that's it. The movie tries to make you feel for him, which you probably do if you don't know anything about the guy beforehand, and root for him - cringe. I think Zac Efron does good here, Hugh Jackman sings wonderfully and gives a wasted good performance for a character. The woman who plays the bearded lady has a fantastic voice.<br/><br/>The thing is, this movie could be so much better if it was from the perspective of the true victims of Barnum's story, his players. They're the ones who got the worst end of the bit, they're the ones who got one of the two best decent songs on the soundtrack, they deserved to have the movie be about them and tell their story. No idea why they thought it was such a good idea to sympathize with P.T Barnum. Cheesy, annoying, inaccurate film."
"darren-butterworth","2","2","6","29 April 2019"," Truly Awful
","I'm not sure what's worse here, the modern dance with the old time costumes. Zac Efron pretending he can sing or the mediocrity of everything else.<br/><br/>Let me get this straight; I like musicals. La La Land for example, loved it, loved the mix of the classic musical numbers with the modern setting but it still felt refreshingly old school in the right way.
This misses that mark so far i'm not sure what audience they're aiming for. I suspect it's the teenage crowd but then you have Wolverine with no beard in there so that must be for the older lady and not the teen. But then you have abs himself Efron pretending he can dance and sing like a pro and just not looking convincing at either. The rest of the cast are just forgettable, they just blend into the overly coloured background.
Then you have the modern slappy feet dance numbers all while wearing period costume and singing in a classic musical style. They just don't go together, it's cringy at best and eye bleach needing at worst.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this one is squarely for the kids and teens but i'm pretty sure they'll soon see through it. Could have been great and rode in on the tails of La La Land but instead they made something so mediocre and twee it's almost bland and definitely annoying.<br/><br/>As an added bonus that bloody opening tune will stick in your head worse than that Go Compare advert.<br/><br/>You have been warned."

Usually in a musical, there's only a few songs that stand out after you walk out of the theater; but with The Greatest Showman it was just one after the another of amazing songs that I'm still humming in my mind 24/7 (and mind you this review is a week after watching it).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it you must do yourself and watch it!"

","This movie was so unexpectedly uplifting. I loved the energy that it gave off throughout the whole story, and how amazingly the actors portrayed such a feeling to the audience. Immediately after leaving the theater I went on my phone and downloaded every single song from the soundtrack, and I still listen to it months later.
 Hugh Jackman was the perfect actor for this role, and I truly felt like he was a circus man of the 1800s. Zac Efron has always been a favorite of mine, and in this movie he showed that he doesn't always play the crazy frat boy or bulked up lifeguard; and when he doesn't, he truly shines. Zendaya was perfect as always, and I feel she really brought alive the topic of race in this time period, that can still be relevant today. 
The actors weren't the only ones who made this movie ""come alive,"" but the directors and choreographers worked for months to get everyone in the perfect spot they need to be in at the right time to really catch the viewers' attention. During the musical numbers I was sitting on the edge of my seat; not because I was nervous, but because I felt like I was actually in the scene. It was just one of those movies that makes you want to see it a second time immediately after leaving, which I did! The theater experience is one like no other, and with this one, it really helps you escape from reality and delve into a wonderfully magical film."
"Mohican15","9","2","6","28 March 2018"," ""This IS The Greatest Show!!!"" Period.
","When I came out of this wonderful movie, part of a poem came to mind. The poem is IF by Rudyard Kipling and the quote goes: ""If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on a turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings"". This (in my opinion) describes the spirit and feel of this movie perfectly. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is about following your dreams with the ones you love, it's about being proud of who you are and where you come from and it's about how when you fail and your dreams come toppling down, you CAN build them 10 times back up again! One of the REALLY great things about this movie was just how different it was to what we're used to in today's film industry! It was a wonderful change in the sea of psychological thrillers and police dramas that today's cinema is SO overcrowded with! It's uplifting, inspiring, charming, moving, romantic but most of all has an absolutely killer soundtrack! I can truly say that director Michael Gracey has done an exceptional job in bringing this inspiring and uplifting story to the screen, whatever the critics may say!<br/><br/>Obviously, when you look at musicals, the soundtrack must be good and the songs in this film were absolutely BRILLIANT! John Debney and several others have written funky, uplifting, moving songs that really push the film along. The style of the songs are combinations of the old classics like WEST SIDE STORY, modern funk and modern musicals like LA LA LAND. The combination TOTALLY works and I have listened to ""The Greatest Show"" several times already. It's fair to say that the songs carry the story. The film gets off to a terrific start with ""the greatest show"" and is propelled onwards with several brilliant others. This, of course was due to the awesome vocal talent and this, obviously, was the brilliant cast that Gracey has pulled together. Hugh Jackman leads the show and it feels almost like he was born to play this role. He puts in such enthusiasm and charisma and really becomes a hero that you can root for. Both his acting and his vocal skills were faultless and he really carried this film. The rest of the cast was on top form as well with Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya and Keala Settle. Every single member is on top-form in this film and convey such emotion with their acting and singing! It's a real joy to watch all of the cast and you really grow to care about all of them and their struggles.<br/><br/>Now, I know there have been many critics saying that this film is a flop but to quote one critic (Mark Kermode): ""they're wrong!' Critics complain about the pace of the story, the characters, the clichÃ©s but I reason that they simply don't get what the film is about. It's not perfect but that's not what you watch it for, you watch it for a charming, funky, uplifting and romantic escape from all the same-old, same-old films of today! It's colourful and vibrant. Yes, it goes over the top with some of the CGI but it somehow doesn't matter because it's such a fun and fantastic ride and yes, some of the messages feel a bit over-used but they're told in such a kind and sincere way that you end up not caring! This film, overall, was a brilliant ride, charming, uplifting and totally fresh! It may sound silly but after coming out of this film, for a few seconds, I wanted to grab a top hat and join the circus- just to let you know: I HAVEN'T! <br/><br/>I really enjoyed and loved this film, it was uplifting and a real feel-good movie but it was also a wonderful and refreshing change for today's cinema! All I can say is: there's a reason it's called the ""GREATEST"" SHOMAN!"

After the first song...I was hooked. The movie transports you to another time, a time of true cinema magic. I can't quite put my finger on what works so well, but the songs perhaps are the best part. Hearing my daughter singing them on the way home and demanding I play the soundtrack is a welcome change from the usual Disney fare that we play in the car. 
What's disheartening is that critics don't seem to understand what this movie is trying to accomplish. They fault it for historical inaccuracies but fail to appreciate its escapist qualities.

"sspina","5","2","6","27 January 2018"," Had so much potential to be amazing but didn't live up to it
","I was really excited about seeing this film. I had heard good things about it and I knew that it was the same songwriters that were involved in La La Land which is one of my favourite films and so I went in to this with high expectations. And I was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is a Michael Gracey film starring Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, Zac Efron and Zendaya. It follows the story of P.T. Barnum and his journey with the circus and show business.<br/><br/>Let's start with the things I did like.<br/><br/>I thought that the cinematography was beautiful, the vibrant colours, the moments of slow motion and the visual effects were stunning. If you are a particularly visual person when it comes to films, I would recommend this film to you. <br/><br/>I also liked the dance routines throughout the film. There is a particular moment with Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams on a rooftop that is really lovely choreography and a routine with Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron that I thought was very well done. <br/><br/>The acting was generally not bad, it was well cast and I thought that the actors all fit the roles very well.The story was generally entertaining, though fairly simple. <br/><br/>Now onto the things that I didn't like:<br/><br/>As a musical, I was expecting the music to be good. However, I felt that the lyrics were reasonably uncreative and the general sound of the music felt, almost, too polished for the context of the film. The thing that makes musicals like La La Land so good is that the songs feel a little rough around the edges (although obviously still well performed) and that's what makes them believable and vulnerable.<br/><br/>Also, my first thought about the music in this film was that the songs all sounded kind of the same to me. I figured that was just me not quite paying attention in the moment, but going and listening back to them now I still feel as though there's not much variety in the dynamics of the soundtrack. I feel like they needed some quieter, simpler moments to contrast the big, powerful numbers so that they have more impact.<br/><br/>I was expecting this film to explore topics like equality and being proud of who you are. And while they sort of touched on these, they were never really explored properly. In particular, the romance in the film that could have easily been an exploration of racial segregation preventing the couple from being together, but it was just never really developed and was instead just a very shallow, half-hearted romantic sub-plot with no real impact. <br/><br/>I spent the whole film feeling as though it was missing something stylistically and it took me a while to figure out what that was. It was missing an element of madness in the way that it was filmed. When I think of the circus I think of garish colours, loud noises and a bit of chaos. However I didn't feel chaotic to me. It was as if they needed to take some inspiration from Baz Luhrmann's style in films like Moulin Rouge where it does feel a bit mad but it fits the setting so well. But everything felt too polished and nice and it just made it seem unbelievable.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't terrible but I felt as though it had the potential to be so much better."
"pdmlee","10","2","6","8 January 2018"," Almost walked out of the theater...
","Walked into the theater half awake hoping this number would put me to sleep... was so WRONG. My mouth was wide open for over an hour. WTF. After Jenny Lind's solo by Rebecca Ferguson, there's this urge of me walking outta the theater. No, this can't be it. A musical that combined almost everything a movie should be in this modern day. This is too much!! The mere price of the admission could not and should not cover this much of entertainment that I received!! I read about the critics bashing of this movie and I think their babbling about P.T. Barnum were simply off the mark... It is a MOVIE. It is supposed to make belief and entertain, not calling it fake like REAL NEWS...it's a movie after all. Please go see this movie. See what this humble box office hit accomplished for US as human beings..."
"leegato","5","2","6","4 January 2018"," The OK Showman
","The Greatest Showman tells a musical, highly fictionalized account of P.T. Barnum's rags-to-riches story of starting his world famous circus, with the help of some friends, colleagues, and even enemies.<br/><br/>Let's put aside the fact that it's a historical fiction and a musical, and assume that you know what you're getting into: a musical and a historical fiction film. I will not be critiquing the film based on any of those standards. However, the film is still lacking in several areas that impact this film.<br/><br/>The music lacks heart. But this may not be an issue for you! For me, it is. The numbers in this film tend to follow soulful pop conventions, transcending the time period in which the film takes place and sounding more like a mid-2000s musical. You'll leave the theater with plenty of melodies in your head, as nearly every song is engineered to be an earworm. And that's the problem I have with it, the fact that I just used the word ""engineered."" Music in film, like music in life, is supposed to accentuate and interpret the moments we experience in life. With a musical, they're meant to convey the emotions and atmosphere of particular scenes. But you can't just write a song and expect to automatically have emotion in it! And that's exactly where the music of The Greatest Showman falls short. The entire film feels like one really long song divided and spread out into multiple parts for the film. It's as if the songwriters factory produced melodies and prioritized song memorability over emotional impact for the audience. On the surface, the music is memorable, but there is no emotional depth to these songs.<br/><br/>OK, so why is there no emotional depth to these songs in the first place? Underdeveloped characters and a lack of real conflict. The film manages to get interesting in establishing an ensemble of unique characters that P.T. Barnum meets. But the film ends up using what little time it has (1 hr 40 min to be exact) to focus on P.T. Barnum. This would be fine; after all, he IS the main man of the show. But how does this affect our reaction when the film decides it wants us to sympathize with these side characters (which it does)? The side characters lack the exploration the audience needs to connect with them. Not to mention, there's no REAL conflict in this film! Right when I think the film is about to get interesting because an unexpected yet completely formulaic conflict comes up, it gets resolved before you can even grasp all the details of the said conflict. Just like that? That was easy. In my mind I still think there are many issues the film never addressed in the storyline that would have been excellent and even provocative sources of conflict.<br/><br/>So, ultimately, The Greatest Showman is a half-hearted mess. It's good for something to put on in the background when you have family friends over for your annual get together, but don't expect to be swayed by the music, performances, or storyline, because the film really lacks the potential in all of those areas. It has everything you need in the musical formula minus the energy and heart."
"mike-5445","5","2","6","2 January 2018"," Some good parts but the script needed more polishing
","Lots of people obviously enjoyed this movie and good for them. I found it okay but didn't really rate it as highly.<br/><br/>There were a few individual fun and well choreographed musical numbers, but I think I just came away thinking that it was more like a stage musical which someone decided to film instead of a film with singing.<br/><br/>Other than that there were just lots of little things which I found annoying because they seemed meaningless or weren't clearly explained.<br/><br/>Several characters had radical changes of attitude and confidence which weren't really explained. eg. Lettie Lutz and Tom Thumb were introduced as extremely nervous in society, but at some point suddenly became confident and angry with no explanation beyond maybe a song where they'd sing something like (paraphrased) ""I've changed my mind"", just... because. Most of the rest of the ensemble barely existed beyond shallow individual characters who'd repeatedly end up being background dancers. They usually went everywhere in a bunch, and usually in the same formation. They never even change out of their performing costumes, even when crossing the sea to meet Queen Victoria!<br/><br/>The narrative repeatedly had Barnum being criticised for championing fake things and cheating audiences (which apparently is more like the real-life reputation) but the film didn't really show him doing this... unless compiling people who were genuinely unique into a circus performance is somehow lying.<br/><br/>The movie rationalises Barnum's hiring of Carlyle for his expertise in appealing to the rich classes of society, but actual attempts to do this, nor their consequences, are ever addressed in the story. There's a cameo trip to see the Queen, which is immediately forgotten and with no consequences explained. (In real life, this trip.. which was actually only with Tom Thumb rather than the whole ensemble... resulted in lots of positive attention, zero of which is given any time in the film, so why bother even including it at all?)<br/><br/>Jenny Lind -- portrayed as the greatest European opera singer -- made a thing in the movie of having risen from the lower classes, but this declaration never actually amounted to anything in the story. It was meaningless information that seemed more of a distraction. She also only sang one song in the film... several times.... and instead of opera it was more like a Mariah Carey song with hints of auto-tune effects.<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>I didn't come away hating the film, but if the above sort of stuff might annoy you then I'd not recommend it. Maybe I've been spoiled for film musicals by some of the wonderfully animated musicals for children, often with compelling narratives, scripts that make sense and songs that weave nicely into the story. I don't see why a musical film made for adults, and not animated, can't have a similar kind of fluid composition. It shouldn't need to look like it's done for a stage just because people are singing in it."

"hakrames","8","2","6","24 December 2017"," ""The Greatest Showman"" Non-Spoiler Review
","""The Greatest Showman"" is definitely great in most parts with it's flashy and fast paced-fun musical scenes to it's deep and heart pouring drama scenes with just a great A-List cast and crew in this spectacular production. With Michael Gracey directorial debut, he definitely knew how to open up a show. Visually this movie is stunning with multiple incredible shots of the circus in action with various musical scenes scattered throughout in various locations and it's very witty and fun cast to backup this colorful movie making it stand out from the rest of these serious and deep 'oscar bait' movies coming out before the end of the year. <br/><br/>Casting wise everything was amazing. Hugh Jackman put in another perfect performance as the legendary P.T. Barnum with his golden musical voice and cheering smile. With both him looking ragged and practically homeless to being practically prince material he pulls it off to the tee. Alongside with Michelle Williams giving a great performance as his push and support throughout the film and his guide to what he really needs in the world. Even the other cast; Zac Efron coming back into singing where he started with disney amung with Zendaya from the same network, Rebecca Ferguson and Keala Settle both giving full heart and even one spotting one hell of a beard for this film. Singing wise everyone did their own voices and it fit perfectly, my biggest worry going into any musical is the production dubbing in another person's voice and it just not fitting at all. <br/><br/>The sets were beautiful between it's homeless side of the story in the first act to the gorgeous ballrooms and fancy mansions shown throughout the rest of the film as well. The sets also played great places for the cast to sing and dance to. My personal favorite being the first bar scene in the film with the song choice and the choreographed dance scene was just beautiful. Even the dance scenes with every act on the stage was amazing with the long single takes and the amount of objects moving was beautiful. With the use of CGI to build some of the bigger views of the city and some of the landscape, it seems seamless with the match of practical built sets and real props. <br/><br/>The story was great overall, the songs came in at the best parts to drive the raw emotion into the film. The pacing was overall really well done with some small parts that felt dragged out. But immediately followed by an amazing dance sequence or another singing piece. And even when the singing isn't going on they have a beautiful score to keep the pace and drive of the film rolling just as fast as the trapeze performers in the film. With multiple romances of all different degrees and the build of what has sadly closed recently, the circus is something everyone should (or should have) experienced in their lives one time or another and with it gone ""The Greatest Showman"" is a great substitute to that void that many people will have. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film has to be that a few sequences of time passing could've been stretched out with possibly another dance number or something to show the struggle of it being built instead of it just being there out of nowhere. And then there were a few scenes that were dragged out a bit that were attempted to be corrected by a musical number. But for a first time director he did a brilliant job with this warm-hearted circus filled musical."

","After watching quite a few action films from the 80s and 90s I needed a change of pace with a toe-tapping musical. And The Greatest Showman does the job. The Greatest Showman was a passion project for Hugh Jackman as he wanted to show off musical talents.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman was an old-fashioned all-singing, all-dancing musical that had lots of energetic songs, even if the film did suffer from Frozen syndrome where some of the songs were overplayed. The opening number gets you in the mood and it continues from there. ""A Million Dreams,"" ""The Other Side"", ""Never Enough"" ""This is Me"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" were some of standout songs.<br/><br/>One of the biggest criticism was the film was not historically accurate. This would be a more valid criticism if it was a serious biopic, but I am willing to make allowances for The Greatest Showman because of its median and genre."
"kermitkid","8","1","2","31 March 2020"," This is the Greatest Show!
","This movie was fantastic! The attention to detail for the time period in which it is set was impressive! The opening logo/credits are in the style of how they were in the 40's. This was a nice little touch that enhanced the film, and it wasn't even a full minute in yet. From that moment, I was pulled into the movie and didn't come back out until the end credits were over. Everything from the costumes, to the acting, to the sets is impressive! One of my complaints was the music seemed too modern for a film set in the 1940s. I would have preferred if they had been more true to the style of the music from that time, and also some parts were very obviously autotuned. The narrative also seemed to be all over the place at points. One of the subplots is started early in the film, and it's not even acknowledged again until the last 20-30. I actually forgot it was a subplot. I did enjoy the musical sequences. Even the slow ones were great because the singing was so impressive. (Except for the occasional ""autotune"" at some points.) This felt like a Baz Luhrmann film, and I mean that as a compliment. It even made me like Zendaya. I did not care for her work on the Disney Channel or Spider-Man: Homecoming earlier this year, but she was good in this. The character felt genuine, and that she was actually trying as opposed to her earlier mentioned works where her performance felt phoned in and canned. I was impressed that Zac Efron was able to still sing well, considering he hasn't been in any musicals that I know of since 2008's ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" which was almost 10 years ago now. I smiled throughout nearly the whole thing, and was intrigued by the story. I definitely enjoyed myself at this one.

"nathanielcotom","4","1","2","15 August 2019"," Boring plot and flat characters overshadow an otherwise flashy film.
","This film isn't awful, definitely not. It's mostly just a snore fest. First the positives: The camera work in the dance scenes are fantastic. It shows that a ton of effort was poured into these scenes. The choreography was also fantastic. Some songs are also decent, with notable tracks including the title track and ""This is Me"".The acting isn't notable, but it serves its purpose with the film.
Now the negatives: The story itself is very dull. The first few minutes are very rushed, with it going from the main character as a child to a middle aged man in the span of three or four minutes. We aren't given any reason to care about this character other then the fact that they get slapped and have their best friend get sent to a boarding school, which isn't executed very well. Another thing this film isn't very good at is showing the life of the actual P.T. Barnum, although this may be a minor nitpick. In the film, a character is introduced about thirty minutes in, Jenny Lind. It's implied that this character has a crush on Barnum . During their last concert together, Lind embraces Barnum and kisses him, which is photographed by the press, and the photo eventually makes it to Charity, Barnum's wife. After leaving him, they both meet up on the beach and reconcile. This obviously did not happen in real life. Barnum only toured with Lind, no more, no less. This was obviously made up by the writers in order to fit the cliche of the ""You did something bad, but I forgive you"" ending. This is also a problem, the film is filled with cliches and underdeveloped story ideas. The characters are also pretty bland, consisting of the stereotypical business man who wants to make it big, his wife, two bad child actors as their daughters, and underdeveloped characters galore. Finally, apart from a few examples, the soundtrack is your typical ""Big, flashy, and emotional musical,"" type of thing. Many tracks are very boring, annoying, and poorly produced, usually filled with terrible auto-tune.
Overall, this is a very boring musical with a mediocre soundtrack, but there are a few redeeming elements. Die hard musical geeks and kids would surely get a kick out of this, but viewers with an eye for story and characters should stay away."
"JupiHornet","7","1","2","13 July 2019"," Not a bad movie, but there are definitely problems
","Decided to give this movie a watch because while critics didn't seem to care for it too much, a lot of moviegoers were all like ""THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME"". Do I think this the best movie ever made? Not really, no. Would I go out of my way to watch it again? Nope. That said, though, this movie was pretty decent and I can definitely see why so many people seemed to like it as much as they did.<br/><br/>First things first, the high point of this movie was definitely the visuals. Lots of bright colors, smooth scene transitions, great editing and special effects. The movie is really nice to look at throughout, nothing looks bad or out of place.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but for the most part, I thought the songs in this movie were pretty good! That being said, though, I think the songs that wound up becoming overplayed in other places (A Million Dreams, Never Enough, and ESPECIALLY This Is Me) are the worse ones in the movie. My personal favorites were Come Alive and The Other Side, but I still thought the soundtrack was good overall. There aren't any songs that I would outright call bad.<br/><br/>With the positives out of the way, time for the negatives...honestly, most of this movie's issues come from its plot. To put it bluntly, this movie has one of the most contrived storylines I've ever seen. From pretty much the second this movie starts, you'll know how it ends; most conflicts are resolved within like 15 minutes, and the character of P.T. Barnum goes through a very predictable arc of ""guy is poor and ridiculed by everybody -> guy works hard and becomes successful -> guy's success goes to his head and he turns his back on everyone that helped him -> everyone that was wronged by guy turns on him -> guy realizes he was wrong and makes amends and/or goes back to his old life"". Additionally, the beginning of this movie is VERY slow (it's basically one long montage) and up until around the part you hear Come Alive, it's pretty boring. In contrast, the last few scenes of the movie happen so quickly that the ending almost feels abrupt. Despite the movie being over an hour and 40 minutes long, I was definitely left with a feeling of ""wait, that's it?!"".<br/><br/>Other problems I had with this movie were more minor. For one, the dubbing's not great. There were a few times where a character's mouth didn't match their voice and it was EXTREMELY visible. The other problem I have is the historical inaccuracy. I get that movies can take creative liberties with these kinds of stories, but come on...major plot points in this movie are things that never even happened in real life. I looked into P.T. Barnum's actual life, and it's so much more interesting and complex than what this movie offers (and he was also a horrible person, something only barely touched on in the movie). Finally (and this is the most minor problem of all), one of the protesters in the middle of the movie was such a horrible actor that it was actually hilarious, even moreso because of this movie's otherwise strong performances.<br/><br/>All of the aforementioned problems aside, though, I did like this movie. The visuals were AMAZING, the performances were very good, the songs were catchy, and watching it was a solid experience. It has a nice (if not overdone) message about embracing diversity and overcoming obstacles. You'll leave feeling better than when you came in. Overall, I don't think The Greatest Showman comes anywhere close to being a 10/10 movie, but I DO think the movie is better than critics are giving it credit for. That said, it's not anywhere near as good as most moviegoers say it is, at least in my opinion. It's a lighthearted, enjoyable, family-friendly experience, but it's no cinematic masterpiece. If you're into musicals and ""feel good"" movies, I would absolutely recommend this. If you aren't, I'd say to skip this one."

I am a very hard person to please when it comes musicals and I recorded this and watched it several times since. The Other Side song is stuck in my head constantly and never have I ever wanted a rope playground so much.

"jaredpahl","6","1","2","13 February 2019"," Great Music and Likable Leads, but This Show Is Not the Greatest
","I will admit, I'm a sucker for movie musicals. Give me genial, upbeat stories set to catchy music and I'm willing to forgive a lot of flaws. Generally speaking, musicals are easy to enjoy, no matter who is behind the camera. The Greatest Showman, Hugh Jackman's musical biopic of circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, is indeed likable. Jackman makes a great ring leader, for the circus as well as the film, and the songs are undeniably appealing, but with banal, clichéd, uninteresting stuff going on between the music, The Greatest Showman is barely worth the two-hour investment.<br/><br/>The film is very light on story. The narrative is your standard biographical retelling of an unlikely rise to fame. In this case, it's P.T, Barnum, who had an interesting real life, but whose circus' rise to prominence is rendered pretty well drama-free, here. The Greatest Showman pays lip service to ideas of self-worth and confidence, and it admirably creates a sense of camaraderie among the circus' entertainers, but whatever interest I took in the story was fleeting. The manufactured conflicts, including an interracial love affair between Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters, or a sub-plot concerning circus protestors, wear thin as they go along. The best musicals not only have great music and colorful dance numbers but a powerful central narrative. That aspect is clearly lacking in this script.<br/><br/>Despite feeling like an old-fashioned Hollywood musical, The Greatest Showman is actually rather unorthodox when it comes to its music. The songs are all modern pop, which is initially rather odd considering the film is set in the 19th Century, but before the first number was over, I had warmed to the notion. Now I don't consider myself a fan of modern pop music, but these songs impressed me. There's a brassy mix of acoustic and electronic to nearly every song, and as a result, they all sound kind of similar, but I couldn't help tapping my toes to most of them. These are great songs. If I had one complaint, it's that the best songs seem to be loaded at the front.<br/><br/>There is a subset of 30-40-year-old women who will absolutely adore The Greatest Showman. It is rooted in classic Hollywood, with a charismatic lead actor, a feel-good story, and wholesome themes. Yet, it's hip enough in its music to feel fresh. For that subset and others, that is all they will see. They won't be bothered by the lack of a compelling narrative or the shopworn clichés about letting your freak flag fly. They won't mind the grinding pacing or the chopped-up dance numbers that never linger long enough. There is a lot you have to overlook in The Greatest Showman to really enjoy it, but it is possible.<br/><br/>63/100"

","Great music! Cool musical moments. But I really wish this movie wasn't based on a real person. If it were a pure fantasy, I could have gotten into this more. But knowing PT Barnum is who he is, I constantly wondered 'how did this event really happen.' Because the movie churns through scenes without developing characters or really showing you how Barnum got his ideas/became famous and instead flips the events into moments of fantasy. And that is the main problem - we don't get to know any of the characters particularly well (even Barnum). The script glosses over everything with pizzazz and spectacle but never lets the audience feel, understand or know why characters acted the way they did. Instead, it is a paint-by-numbers formula of every other musical you've ever seen, bringing nothing new to the mix (just a mishmash of cliches). I want to feel sad when the character loses something because I was along with the journey with them and understand their loss, or come to the conclusion that a character was truly motivated to be loved through the scenes and actions of the characters that I saw. Instead The Greatest Showman tells you 'this is the scene where you're supposed to cry' with its loud music and flash. So in an ironic way, this film is the perfect representation of Barnum's work/career - something of spectacle and no substance."

"martax9","5","1","2","21 October 2018"," I would have liked it more if..
","I don't know an awful lot about the real P. T. Barnum's life so I will not compare him and the portrayl of Hugh Jackman, but I will say this: the film wants you to like him. We see him young and poor, with dreams bigger than life itself. Then we see him succeed but always want more. Then we see him fail but we are supposed to root for him again and in the end, he picks up from where he left and is rich and successful again.<br/><br/>Why should I like a person who took advantage of poor, unwanted people just to make money out of them? He didn't want an inclusive society, he wanted ''oddities'' that would shock people and make them laugh because he knew it sells. In his circus, he had animals as well and I'm surprised other reviewers have not mentioned this at all. Don't you know how badly animals are treated at circuses? They whip them, hit them, yell at them and God knows what else they do to them to perform. They are separated from their family, from their own kind, taken from their natural habitat only to be forced to do things that aren't natural to them. How do elephants standing on just one leg or lions jumping through fire make for a nice movie ending? It just made me sad.<br/><br/>Now I kind of liked the music and the movie overall was enjoyable even though I don't like musicals very much. But it was a romanticized account of a real person's life. I would have rated it higher if the movie was truthful because it could have easily been so. It could still be a wonderful musical but portray him as the man he really was."

The Performances of the cast are beautiful. Hugh you could how happy he is doing the project he deserves a salute for his ambition and persistence to make it. The music of the movie of course was the hidden hero of it very wonderful and the movie have some songs that will have you very stunned and amazed and thrilled. The directional debut of Michael Gracey is very beautiful but not free of problems. The movie's only problem was the story and how some characters aren't written well and it's sequence which was kinda not good and you might feel there are problems now I can't see and feel disturbed by how quick the scenes are but the were done very professional and the dances and the shows even though as Indian movies you feel it disturbs the story but let's agree that the movie's purpose was only joy and deeper feelings that doesn't deserve to be looked at from the surface only.

","I knew this had mixed reviews...but we rented it on a Saturday night and my boys LOOOOVED it-I mean ""best-movie-ever"" loved it. My review might be shadowed by the fact that it was awesome watching boys love a romantic, idealistic musical this much, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, too. Were some parts corny? Sure. Was some of the background super digitized and fake. Absolutely. But the whole vibe of the movie was completely exciting and uplifting, and made me smile, too. How often can you say that about a movie? The music and dancing was fantastic and the message about embracing your differences was perfectly apropos. 
Seems a little odd that this movie comes out now after all the controversy about animals being in the Ringling Bros. shows, but I tried to put that out of my head and just watch it from a performance point-of-view. Loved it! Gave it a genuine 10/10. Boys would have given it a 101/10 if they could!!"

","Good characters, great songs and choreography, cool story, fabulous modern musical without groaning that they were breaking out in yet another song and dance. If you can appreciate entertainment done by quality performers, this is tops. I'd almost compare it to My Fair Lady but better in such that the scenery is not meant to be exact (ex. no moon is that big) but all of it is very well done; costumes and actions are not exact for the time period but much more of a 'show' as done; most people can relate to the characters without being that person. No fake looking CG or lip syncing. Believable enough as a story and amazing as a movie. More appreciated after watching the extras to find out what went in to making it. ....and fyi, some critiques would slam Shrek as unbelievable and Star Wars for too much CG and fake scenery, some just don't 'get' fun entertainment."

"tyson-hunsaker","7","1","2","27 January 2018"," The Greatest ""Just Fine"" Showman
","""The Greatest Showman"" is a flashy and beautifully looking spectacle intended to showcase a real life based story on P.T. Barnum, the original creator of the circus. While not remaining true to the real story and drawing real inspiration from true events, the film boasts spectacular aesthetics and emotionally stirring musical numbers, the movie ultimately falls short of truly dazzling but simply satisfies. <br/><br/>Every rumor about outstanding music and dance numbers are, off the bat, justified. In most musicals, at least one number can be pointed out which felt inferior to the rest of the score and couldn't quite escape the fast-forward button. This is not the case with ""The Greatest Showman."" Every number and song is one to listen and jam out to in the car and each piece is performed wonderfully by its charming cast and solid direction. <br/><br/>The driving force of ""The Greatest Showman"" is indeed its cast and their unbelievable devotion to the film. Every performance exudes enthusiasm and charisma which gives the sloppy script and weak story more life than it deserves. Hugh Jackman and Zac Effron are standouts in particular with Michelle Williams coming in strong as always. Zendaya, as usual, didn't impress however and felt unemotional and unconvincing altogether. <br/><br/>As mentioned prior, the aesthetics of ""The Greatest Showman"" are beautiful and astounding. Dripping colorful and lively cinematography, each shot contains wonderful pieces of excellent production design, costumes, and hair and makeup attention. The combination of these important elements help convincingly sell this movie and further immerse the viewer in a more classic feeling musical than what modern audiences are used to.<br/><br/>As mentioned above as well, the film suffers from a weak script with messy narrative structure and distracting editing choices than hurt the film's flow and narrative. Unfortunately, the film's script tends to unevenly tackle 3 or more completely separate themes or focuses for the film. As each act is introduced with a new theme that neither contradicts or compliments the previous theme, so its impact near the end can leave the audience feeling cheated as we wonder ""Why did they tell this story in the first place?"" At the end, we feel satisfied with the high moral values the filmmakers chose to leave the audience with and it warms our hearts. As we think deeper however, we realize maybe we've been tricked as we think of the possibly relevant line of dialogue found in the film ""Does it bother you that what you're selling is all fake?"" <br/><br/>Despite the apparent flaws in its written foundation, ""The Greatest Showman"" manages to entertain and satisfy audiences of all ages. This is a good film to show to younger audiences while older audiences will enjoy a trip to the theater with their family. The wonderful music and grand spectacle of the film outweighs the negatives and ""The Greatest Showman"" is indeed a solid film worth checking out."
"autisticreviewers","7","1","2","22 January 2018"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","The first and original story musical telling of the great P.T. Barnum. P.T. Barnum was always a big dreamer, from being homeless and hardly eating anything as a kid he never stopped believing in dreaming big. He lays his eyes on the most beautiful girl by the name of Charity (played by Michelle Williams) and wanted to share with her his dream and wanted her to be part of it every step of the way no matter the cost. P.T. Barnum then has the perfect idea of starting up his own show/circus and hiring different people of different talent. But what he looks for is them being different or is the low life locals in the town call them ""freaks."" Hugh Jackman plays P.T. Barnum extremely well, nothing Oscar Worthy, but definitely the best cast person in the film. His singing, his acting, his dancing..all very unique. The rest of the cast is fine as well..Michelle Williams is beautiful and really good at her acting and singing. Zac Efron plays Phillip Carlyle, a man who also dreams to make it big, but is very cautious of who he works with and what might ruin his career. Efron has his good moments in the film, one highlight in particular was when Efron and Jackman are drinking, singing and dancing in a bar. That was very cleverly executed and set most of the tone to the entire movie. Rebecca Ferguson plays Jenny Lind, a very jealous, spoilt, vicious yet the most perfect singing person! Her singing is definitely a highlight of the film as well.<br/><br/>The singing, the dancing the songs, the sets, the designs are pretty much perfect. it really can't get any better. The biggest problem with the film is that halfway into the movie we see P.T. Barnum going through a mid life crisis and stuff that could potentially ruin his career and create break up with his family, it was a very deep subject, and that we would have loved to have seen more of. It lacks so much of story depth and character development which is a shame, because it was so close to perfection! But there is one big scene in the movie where P.T. Barnum says to a vicious, miserable critic ""It's not about the critics...its not aimed for you...it's aimed for audiences."" That was a highlight of the film. 3/5 stars."
"cloudymeringue","10","1","2","16 January 2018"," I wanted to see it again after it ended. And again. And again. And again.
","I went into this movie completely blind. I hadn't seen any trailers or read any information about it. I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Don't believe the ""professional"" critics who think that if a movie doesn't have mind-numbing special effects, character development, or an ending that makes you think, say that ""The Greatest Showman"" is not worth your time. <br/><br/>This feel-good film had everything I like in a movie: it was moving, dream-filled, and heartfelt. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya and all the others are amazingly talented. The soundtrack was beyond incredible. See the movie while it's still in theaters for yourself to really have a magical time."
"Pairic","7","1","2","16 January 2018"," Good, but Barnum deserves a better musical biopic.
","The Greatest Showman: Interesting songs and good dancing but The Book (connecting pieces) is a bit weak. A section regarding Jenny Lynd could have been discarded to allow more time to develop the central story of the ""freak show or as Barnum called them: unique people. They include: Dog Boy, Bearded Lady, Irish Giant, Siamese Twins, Tom Thumb, Tattooed Man. Rebecca Ferguson is good as Lynd, The Swedish Nightingale but the structure of the film suffers from this aside.<br/><br/>Even though Barnum brings the unique people into the light, even he is a bit embarrassed by them when a ""better class of punter"" comes to see Lynd. In a wonderful song and dance number the performers refuse to be excluded and burst into a champagne reception. Perhaps the unique people are too forgiving too quickly of Barnum afterwards. Strains credibility a bit.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is impressive as Barnum and a good dancer but perhaps a body double was used for some of his high kicks. I have no such doubts about Zendaya who plays a trapeze artist, her dancing and rope acts look like her own work. <br/><br/> Good, but Barnum deserves a better musical biopic. 7/10"
"Kingslaay","Null","1","2","14 January 2018"," Enjoyable film
","Out of all the films to come out I was most excited to see the greatest showman. <br/><br/>The film was entertaining and showcased some great singing but this was at the expense of a plot which felt a bit thin. There were a bit too many musical numbers that took away precious time from a plot, a deep plot even that this film was capable of. Also the side plot with P T and his affair with the American singer was unnecessary and took the film in different directions. One could not tell whether this was about P.T or the perils of introducing the first circus itself. Nevertheless, it somewhat undermined the perils of the circus and its unique performers. This I feel was the films main attraction. Some creative and careful rewriting and directing could have made this an iconic film. Lost potential but still a treat to watch.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"np-42104","10","1","2","12 January 2018"," You Will Want To See It Over And Over
","The critics just don't get it. This movie isn't about P.T. Barnum or the Circus. It is about you. Every character in the movie either is or feels rejected like we all have. The movie takes us back to those moments then joyously conquers them. I don't recall another movie that would have taxed your emotions like this one does."
"mt-95256","4","1","2","1 January 2018"," Pleasant and Entertaining, but a Mess - Not the Greatest Show
","Around Oscar season there's always a musical there that promises to be the next big thing, often attracting Oscar nominations. With eye-catching trailers promoting catchy songs from the film along with a stellar cast that appeals to the whole family, naturally there are high hopes for such films; Les Miserables, La La Land to name a couple of recent ones - but you can take it back to the likes of Mamma Mia! or Sweeney Todd, not to mention classics like The Sound of Music, Oliver, Singin' in the Rain... Musicals can make a big impact on popular films and it's wonderful when they get it right. One look at the trailer for The Greatest Showman and it seems as though this film has similar aspirations - so does it hit the heights of other recent classics? Sadly, no; whilst this film may be sweet at times and entertaining enough to keep you going until the next musical in about a year's time, this is unlikely to become a classic family-favourite.<br/><br/>On the surface, the story of Barnum's unrelenting climb to fame and success seems like quite an interesting one. Indeed, throughout the film there are numerous moments where the story is quite captivating. Sadly, these moments are too few in a film like this. Instead the story comes across as cluttered and unstructured. As is all too typical in a biopic, the challenge of including so many important events in one man's life becomes too much, resulting in so many things just happening; and not in the beautiful, well-choreographed way you see in John Lewis's advert about a girl growing up. Rather, the important events of Barnum's life are glossed over and just happen without giving us too much detail, almost as though we're given an edited version of the film. Getting married, having two adorable children, secondary characters falling in love, building a successful business from nothing, buying a big house... All these things just happen in between scenes and rarely give us much detail to feel as though we're with Barnum throughout his life. On the contrary, it's as though we're trailing behind, picking up the pieces and have to imagine how these things came to be. Of course the age old rags to riches element of the story is inspiring and entertaining as ever; combined with the the musical side of things, it's 'feel-good' factor is emphasised, but it's often lost amid a lack of structure and detail.<br/><br/>Still, where dramas and musicals differ is the music, something very much present in this film, though on the whole it comes as very hit and miss. Partly my old-fashioned taste in music and love for classical musicals is to blame; but whilst I can appreciate some catchy tunes and good voices, it doesn't always seem to fit in with the tone and period of the film. This isn't to say that the music always has to fit in with the period of the film (often it doesn't but still works well - Hamilton for example), but the music numbers tend to stick out like a sore thumb instead of integrating itself seamlessly into the rest of the film. This is occasionally since there are instances of songs being noticeably shoehorned in and not occurring organically. Adding to this that the songs are obviously pre-recorded and don't look natural, means that this isn't the prize-winning element that it should be in a musical. On the other hand though, there are some dance sequences that are well-done and very enjoyable to watch. Sadly these don't scream glitz and glamour like Barnum deserves, and are occasionally underwhelming, but when the dance scenes work well, they're great fun to watch and compliment their songs well.<br/><br/>So whilst the songs may be a bit underwhelming, fortunately the cast is not; the main cast is excellent and using brilliantly... Yet this seems to come at a the price of ignoring the rest. Hugh Jackman is stand out and his charisma and charm permeate each and every scene, letting him almost carry the film singlehandedly. He's effortlessly likeable and makes the otherwise occasionally irritating ambitions of P.T. Barnum much more palatable. Michelle Williams too is a wonderful addition to the main cast, lending a much needed human, heartwarming and loving touch that she displays marvellously. I've never yet seen a film where Williams isn't terrific and even this film is yet another example of how she deserves every Oscar for which she's been nominated (currently four times). Rebecca Ferguson also makes the most of her role as the counterpart to Williams' comforting wife, oozing sexy sensuality, but she certainly deserved more screen time. Disney stars Zac Efron and Zendaya come together in this non-Disney musical and do their thing well - Efron still hasn't lost any of that pazzazz that made him a hit in High School Musical and it's great to see him back in the genre, managing to be a great match opposite Jackman. Sadly though the romantic sub-plot between Efron and Zendaya isn't fleshed out or allowed to develop much. It just happens while Zendaya remains largely silent. Perhaps this is a way of emphasising the race issue her character suffers through, but within the confines of the circus cast, it would have been nice to allow her character to flourish and develop before us. There are other characters besides these, but sadly the filmmakers seem to have left the majority of the circus cast as a footnote. We have the impressive Keala Settle as the Bearded Lady and Sam Humphrey as dwarf Tom Thumb as spokespeople for an entire roster of interesting characters that make up Barnum's Circus. Aside from a short Full Monty style audition scene, we rarely get much of a look at them, let along many lines allowing us to get know these performers. Instead potentially the most interesting people in the film remain in the background for the majority, relegating them to being uncharacterised freaks - it's a real missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Barnum may have been The Greatest Showman, but this isn't the greatest show by any means. Not to say it's all bad; on the contrary, it's pleasant and can easily entertain... but not much more. In a film riddled with missed opportunities, it tries so hard to dazzle and inspire us with awe that it forgets fundamentals in storytelling and characterisation. Much like Barnum's character, The Greatest Showman sets its sights too high to really pause and appreciate what's there already. Still, for an easy-going family-friendly musical, you could do worse."
"iztokplevelj","10","1","2","29 December 2017"," Don't mind the critics
","This is my first movie review/comment. Because the movie is getting very poor ""professional"" reviews, I urge you not to listen to them. I remember when Moulin Rouge was playing in theaters and some critics slammed it, but the film was outstanding and ahead of it's me - there was no Glee back then. The same goes with The Greatest Showman. It has an original soundtrack which is addictive and the movie is very well made. The performances are top notch, Hugh Jackman shines as the lead actor. The story is about how the circus came to life and is filled with uplifting positive messages for the whole family. The movie flew by for me, there was not one scene that was dragging. A fun and emotional ride with great music worth the ticket price. Will be seeing it again. Thank you, Mr. Gracey and the whole crew that made this movie. You won me over and it was a pleasurable experience."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","23 December 2017"," Tightrope
","Literally and figuratively, this movie treads a tightrope. I cannot remember the last time I saw such polarized critics: from ""empty, moronic"" to ""I was thoroughly enjoying myself"", both coming from the same part of the world, the Great Lakes area (two world-class cities, in two nations). <br/><br/>Alternate titles could have been ""birth of the circus"" or ""from vaudeville to big top"". The trailers are misleading. In the movie itself, the only glimpse of a circus in its generally understood form is at the closing shots. Throughout the course of the movie, ""circus"" (a newly invented word back then) denotes a vaudeville show of freaks (apologies for my failure to resort to euphemism). The subject matter is not exactly politically correct in this time and age, hence my summary ""line"" (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Nor is it truly a biography of the famous (or notorious, take your pick) P.T. Barnum. The way to watch (and enjoy) this musical is look at it as fiction, with the idea borrowed from the real person. That way, you won't get bogged down with a lot of controversial distractions.<br/><br/>As a directly-to-screen musical, TGS has done a reasonable job. At least, it meets the fundamental requirement of a true musical: the songs are not just there because it is a ""musical"", but are there to fulfill the task of moving the story forward (e.g. the lively number through which persuasive Barnum convinces young stage play veteran Philip Carlyle to leave the high-brow circle and join him in adventures that brings out what really living is about, something like that. Most of the songs in TGS are exciting and upbeat rather than languid and romantic, and there is nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>Regardless of how much the movie factal and how much is fictional, a lot the usual elements for melodrama are there (but no heavy stuff such a revenge and murder). I am not going to go through the plotline in detail. The audience will find themselves on familiar ground, with no suspense or surprise. I would rather dwell on a couple of interesting things in this movie. <br/><br/>The key plot element is Barnum's enterprise of assembling a group of freaks (apologies again, no euphemism) into a successful commercial show. This may attract more empathy than you might have initially imagined. All of us, dare I propose, have a little freakishness, be it some unique mannerism, a pair of crossed eyes, or a slight limp. Treading the tightrope with the skill of an expert, director Michael Gracey removes most of the offensive edge and injects a heavy dose of upbeat emotion, magically transferring the whole thing into ""a celebration of humanity"" which gives the members of the circle the dignity they never dream have. While this coup may be ring hollow to cynics, it scores with the general audience. There is wit too, as the ever-persuasive Barnum convinces the recruits thus: you'll be laughed at anyway, so why not get paid for it? <br/><br/>This is also a movie about show business. For that, all I need to do is to refer to Irving Berlin's immortal song ""There's no business, like show business"" (in the movie ""Annie get your gun""). Listen to it, a hundred times if you have the time. It's the most eloquent presentation of what show business is all about.<br/><br/>In the romance department, it is the second line romance story that captures the audience's fancy, the one between Carlyle and trapeze artist Anne Wheeler. The main line is a triangle, sort of. The poor boy/rich girl story between Barnum and his wife Charity is standard staple. More interesting is his relationship with world-class Swedish singer Jenny Lind. While she has romantic inclinations, he considers their intimate relationship during a world tour he stages for her to be more of a professional partnership. The interesting thing is that he finds in her a kindred-spirit soulmate that he fails to find in his wife who does not share his experience of a deprived childhood of an underdog. Jenny does. <br/><br/>The cast contributes a great deal to lifting this movie a notch above what it would have been. After ""Les Miserable"", here is further demonstration that there is another side to Hugh Jackman than Logan Wolverine. As Charity, Michelle Williams is as dependable as ever. Zac Efron is a delightful mixture of energetic youthfulness and world-weary skepticism as Carlyle. Zendaya as Anne Wheeler illustrate the formula of beauty plus style equals class. Rebecca Ferguson made quite an impression as the MI6 agent in ""Mission Impossible - Rouge Nation"" (2015). No kicks and chops here from her, but sheer radiance as Jenny Lind."
"jonesbrooke123","2","5","24","21 December 2017"," Neither Good nor Bad
","A lot of the relationships felt forced and I left this movie wanting more answers or to see more character interaction. This movie also tries to hide how much of a bad person P.T. Barnum really was, but is ultimately unsuccessful. <br/><br/>The majority of the music was really good (minus a song or two) and wonderfully sung. It seemed like there was lots of ideas that they wanted to convey but it might've proved to be a better movie if they just focused on one or two."

Any real talent (which I'm sure there was plenty of) has been artificially cleansed out, and replaced with a thick layer of autotune icing. The story was just about interesting enough to keep me in my seat, and Zac Efron's and Keala Settle's performances had sincerity and were worth watching. Indeed, the only things that were."

If they didn't insist on tethering the film to real people, it would have looked much more like an entertainment and less like a con. Take Jenny Lindt story. She is presented as an opera singer, which she was in real life, but then she goes on stage and sings what is essentially a show tune. She is there for the sole purpose of demonstrating Barnum's quest for class. Once that's achieved, more or less, they give her a completely ridiculous out. And it happens again and again. Just as I'd get into the mood with a musical number, which are all great, some real life related blunder would throw me off. And the other way around - there would be a nice genuine scene, I even cried once, and an out of place musical number would ruin everything. Circus freaks crashing a high society events? Interracial kiss? On stage? To applause? In mid 19th century? It's hard not to notice that kids don't grow up even though clearly years pass. And some of the adults look way older than plausible from the get go. Hugh Jackman is a great actor and truly a great showman, and it pains me to say this, but when there is Barnum as a young teen and in the next scene he becomes Jackman, coming to take his young wife from her parents' home, I cringed. And it took a while to get over that."

","It's a bad sign when before a movie even starts, the star and director appear on screen and beg the audience to like their project, as Hugh Jackman and Michael Gracey do here. Uh, guys, maybe let the film speak for itself, like most filmmakers do? <br/><br/>I find it funny how personally offended some people seem to get when critics slam a movie that they happen to like. Critics are entitled to their opinions, after all. And in the case of ""The Perfect Showman"", not all the critical reviews have been negative. However I would have to strongly agree with those that are. This movie has the seeds of some interesting ideas floating around in it, but it's ultimately very badly done. Even leaving aside the lack of factual accuracy in Barnum's story and taking it purely at face value as a piece of fantasy entertainment, it might have been good, IMO, if some actual craftsmanship had been employed. But almost nothing in ""The Perfect Showman"" works well. The story is simplistic, overly sentimental and devoid of any character depth or development. The look of the film is dark and ugly for the most part, and the musical numbers are shot like music videos, with rapid cuts and no sense of the storytelling continuity needed for effective musical theatre. The music production is terrible, with lyrics getting subsumed by loud orchestrations in the big production numbers, and so much processing done on the vocals that they sound distractingly artificial even though the actors, with one exception, are all doing their own singing. The setups for/transitions into songs are clumsy or nonexistent, and the songs themselves are tuneless, bland, anachronistic and forgettable pop-shlock, something which I have now come to expect from these songwriters. <br/><br/>It pains me to write this because I know some of the people involved in the making of this movie, and because I am a big fan of musicals when they are well done. I knew next to nothing about ""The Greatest Showman"" going in, but given some of the people involved, it certainly seemed like a promising bet. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very disappointing overall. The three star rating is for the talented actors, who all come off well (Michelle Williams and Zac Efron in particular) and do an admirable job with the sub-par material they are given to work with. But despite their best efforts I found very little to enjoy in this movie, and it was almost impossible to sit through it from beginning to end."

","From a musical point of view, ""The greatest showman"" isn't very interesting : the music is bland and the lyrics are trite. Much of it looks and feels like a watered-down version of ""Moulin rouge"". Still, the various makers of the movie were clever enough to make Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, sing the same kind of forgettable stuff as the rest of the crowd, justly realizing that their work was unlikely to withstand a comparison with a nice slice of, say, Meyerbeer or Bellini.<br/><br/>However, there are worse problems than the musical aspect. The movie is intent on delivering some of the most contradictory messages imaginable. Try this one : ""It is fully okay to look unusual - to be a giant, an albino, or half of a Siamese twin - on condition that you don't mind being stared at for ten hours a day"". In the contradiction stakes, this comes close to gems like ""We fully understand that you're a lesbian, we just want you to sleep with men"" or ""As the ruling king of a constitutional monarchy, you are uniquely qualified to spread the word about the benefits of communism"".<br/><br/>Another message from ""The greatest showman"" : if you gather a group of people with unusual looks or medical problems, and if you put them on display for financial gain, you're not exploiting them, you're supporting them.<br/><br/>Finally the movie warns you about the dangers of not wanting to go and see a freak show - chances are that you, annoying spoilsport, are an effete snob, a proto-Nazi or a knuckle-dragging primitive. You're not like that, are you ? So do the right thing ! Do what any decent, all-American, God-fearing citizen would do ! Go and gape at some inoffensive humans with a medical condition !<br/><br/>A modest conclusion : people who teach subjects such as philosophy, ethics and logic would do well to give the movie a wide berth, lest they suffer a stroke.<br/><br/>I'm still throwing the movie a few stars, because there are some likeable performances and fine stunts to enjoy. Hugh Jackman in particular imbues his P.T. Barnum with a great deal of charm - much more charm, I suspect, than the actual P.T. Barnum ever possessed..."

"CubsandCulture","10","1","3","3 March 2019"," An extraordinary number of critics didn't deal with this film fairly...
","This film is a wonderful musical. It is filled with catchy songs and the sort of flash that make musicals such experiences. Jackman, Efron, etc. are all deeply entertaining and bring such joy to the story that it is impossible to not be caught up in the sheer spectacle of the film. The film is all style but it is the sort of cinematic treat that is one needs now and then. It is the film equivalent of big old banana split. On the most basic level it is an old fashion musical fantasia of a rag to riches form. It is great on that level. It is also great when you start thinking about the film in connection to the history.<br/><br/>Now an extraordinary critics, and others, decided that the film being wildly inaccurate to the real PT Barnum was a problem; this is why it got such mixed reviews. It is true the film is largely only uses the most basic outline of Barnum's life. But why on Earth would you expect anything else?<br/><br/>Barnum, the real guy, was a prince of humbug. Of course a film about him is going to be humbug. This is a guy who held a public autopsy to prove he had been lying for years about a woman's age. He, accidentally, boiled to death two whales and sold tickets to show them off after. He was preening self-promoter and tricked people constantly. To increase traffic in the museum he put up a sign to trick people to leave faster (the famous this way to the egress). Why on Earth would you walk into a film about Barnum expecting honesty? Early on in the film Barnum is slapped for being honest! Getting mad this film is humbug is no different than getting mad that a drama wasn't funny. Yeah it's not. But that's on your misplaced expectations.<br/><br/>Now it can be objected that the film turned Barnum into a very likable hero when he was a jerk (he killed at least 6 whales for example). I guess that is true if you ignore every detail of the script. The script makes it clear that 1) the film is from Barnum's perspective and 2) Barnum has an overarching need to be respected by respectable people. The film's whitewashing of Barnum's life makes him seem worse because in context it comes across as a shameless self-promoter lying to hide how awful he was. This is most obvious in how the Lind episode is handled.<br/><br/>The film is knowing humbug, exactly how Barnum would have done it. Critics can dislike what they want; they are not allowed to mangle a text as they did in this case."
"nshaw2311","3","1","3","26 February 2019"," Bad film; bad musical.
","I don't write reviews, but I felt I had to comment on this. I want more original musicals, but this is a terrible example (and this isn't even about Hugh Jackman's singing). The songs in this film are the most generic pop crap you could imagine. If you told someone who didn't know the songs that they were by *-insert modern pop artist-*, rather than from a musical, they would have no reason to dispute it. I have a feeling this was done on purpose, to hit popular music charts, and generate interest, but it makes the film seem like nothing more than a vehicle for the pointless pop songs. The plot is similarly generic. The main plot is at least pretty consistent: Barnum wants to be rich, to show his wife's family that they were wrong about him. It also has a few minor side plots that don't really go anywhere. At one point, the freaks try to get into a party, and Barnum shuts them out; they realise he's embarrassed by them, just like everyone else, and then... nothing? It didn't seem to actually be resolved, but by the end they're acting like he's just always cared about them, or something (they really just threw on the most flowery, pointless, ""none of the rest of this film happened"" happy ending I've ever seen). The other main side plot was about an interracial relationship between Zac Efron's and Zendaya's characters. Came out of nowhere, and achieved nothing. This film's story was totally pointless. Otherwise, the big dance scenes were mostly flashy, but not particularly good. There's probably more to be said, but, you know, I'm not a critic."
"irishboy141","5","1","3","1 February 2019"," An OK musical, but a dismal hostorical film
","Let's start with the positives, The choreography is good, I kinda liked Zac Efron's character, and I thought the child acting was fine.<br/><br/>My main problems with this film stems from how pandering and inoffensive it tries to be.<br/><br/>The real life P.T. Barnum was a slimey crooked scumbag who tried to get rich off anyone, he even coined the phrase, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" So when this story tries to depict him as an innocent guy trying to ""do the right thing"" I can't help but feel the film is trying to pathetically bamboozle me in to sympathizing for a scumbag character. It also bothers me that the inter-racial relationship between Zac's character and the trapeze artist is glossed over, that would be interesting to explore that dynamic in the late 1800s, but no we have to keep things simple for mass audience appeal...<br/><br/>Now to be fair, there are those audience members who don't give a crap about historical accuracy, and that's fine. However even with out the historical inaccuracies, the film still fails for me due to the overly simplistic nature of the plot. P.T. is poor boy, poor boy likes rich girl, rich girl likes poor boy but rich parents don't approve. The same tired plot with an unrealistic main character. (For example, when EVERYONE goes to visit the Queen of England, in real life it was just P.T. and the Little Person Napoleon.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothers me is the CGI in this movie, it all looks so fake, even when they're in physical locations, the backgrounds and everything look so phoney. Also the Little Person actor looked digitally altered somehow, and his real voice was badly dubbed over and looks terrible.<br/><br/>Oh and of course the critic in the film is joyless and unhappy (what the studio thinks the naysayers of this film are like). Which is a cliche that always bothers me, but after ragging on P.T. the whole movie, in the last 15 minutes he complements P.T. and his show..... for some reason.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, aside from one or two decent songs/dances (the bar scene in particular was very nice). I wasn't impressed by this film, it's better than Marry Poppins Returns, but it's sure no Chicago or Rocky Horror Picture Show."

","After loving La La Land, I thought, maybe I'd give this a try. Nope! Not for me. The songs are unmemorable, and everything else was okay. The story has a few plot lines that keep it going but it all feels very surface level? As in the main plot never really took off. It wasn't building towards a climax, it's just events that follow each other but in a film that wasn't slice of life. The characters were also ok. It could have been spectacular, but for me it missed the mark.<br/><br/>IMO they needed a better composer, less subtly with the plots (i mean, it's a CIRCUS! Give PT more PERSONALITY. He's a New York Businessman with a dream and determination (and had controversies with workers). You have the stories of the performers too- everyone in NYC (to this day) has a story of where they came from where they're going but they made it so....bland (to me).<br/><br/>The positives: cinematography and camera work was really good. The way they planned the camera angles or whatnot was excellent. The sets were great (except the CGI animals- seemed hokey to me). The acting was...okay. The characters were...mediocre. The pacing was okay. The music was okay. It honestly made me want to watch a documentary of the fellow cuz he's an interesting person and this film alluded to that (inaccurately) and didn't make it their own.

","I'm not a expert in musicals and i would not say that i watch many of them but The greatest Showman was worth those multiple viewings and was a movie that even if you are not a fan of musicals will convince you to give them a second chance. The greatest Showman is the story of the first circus and .P.T Barnum a man who in real life has some controversy over his famous circus the greatest showman teaches us as the audience about equality and about how people from all sorts of parts of life can come together to put on a show that also brings people together.
Leading the cast is the ever talented Hugh Jackman who has musical experience and you can tell and he is also quite the singer as well and this is a powerful performance from jackman also in the cast is Michelle Williams who could have been used just a little more but when we do see her she brings energy and a sort of energy that only she could bring into being Barnum's wife and Charity is very well potrayed by Williams. Also two younger cast members who caught my attention was Zendaya {Anne Wheeler} and Zac Efron
{Phillip Carlyle} These two have Characters who develop a relationship which is so beliveible that when when they sing the duo song Rewrite the Stars it just sealed it for me and i knew then that they would end up a couple and while there were moments where Phillip was trying to hide the fellings he had because of his social standing he pushed past it for love and that is powerful.
Special mention to the super talented Keala Settle who was Lettie Lutz what a performance and my can she sing and this is me is such a poweful song with a great message behind it and she just nails the whole performace.
also Ellis Rubin and Skylar Dunn as the young Barnum and Charity was so heart melting that in the time we spend with them which is not long we really start to understand the relationship of the two main leads and these kids are awesome loved them in this.
Michael Gracey the director did a awesome job in The Greatest Showman and he made something that is quite spectacular and something that i can easily watch again and again and John Debney and Joseph Trapanese who were in charge of music did such a great job and the original songs are so amazing and catchy my favorites is The Greatest Show, A Million Dreams, Rewrite The Stars and This Is Me and without saying anything someone can tell you how great this movie is and it is by far one of the best musicals that i have seen and i will continue to watch and i will always enjoy"

","MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.com<br/><br/>REVIEW: I don't know much about the life of PT Barnum but the story here was very interesting and entertaining. However, I felt like the transition between some of the scenes somehow felt wrong. Some stories just pop-up without any proper introduction at all. Still, I really liked the songs of this musical. The only one I didn't like is the 'Never Enough' song because it annoyed the hell out of me after hearing it a lot. Also, the choreography of the characters and the cinematography was very amazing and beautiful to watch. The cast did an amazing job especially Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Definitely, yes! Especially if you love musicals.
WOULD I WATCH IT AGAIN: Absolutely!"
"mitcherator777","10","1","3","10 July 2018"," The Best Musical Masterpiece of our time
","""The Greatest Showman,"" Is simply put, one of the best stories there is to tell. The story of PT Barnum as his journey in this harsh world of ours.
The Soundtrack to this movie is one of the best tracks I've heard in a while. I love the piece ""This is Me,"" I sang it as part of the Salt Lake Men's Choir in part of our Pride concert, it fit quite well.
This movie has inspired me, and even in the harsh times there is always the light at the end of the tunnel.
I own this movie and love it more every-time I watch it, But don't believe me; go grab a ticket to the Circus again and see one of the most magical musical movies of our time, ""The Greatest Showman."" you won't regret it!"

"gareth-53974","8","1","3","25 June 2018"," A film or a Musical?
","We are upon an age where Musicals have their own category altogether and The Greatest Showman does a wonderful job of combining both and not Sacrificing one side to fulfill the other. We have equal brilliance in the Soft acting and the Musical performances.
A film which at first looks set to be the old cliché of Man buys business, business fails at first but with humanity being ever present in the world it somehow gets saved right at the end *Not A Spoiler*.
We Have the Larger than life Character Mr P.T Burnam (Hugh Jackman) who believes there's more to life than the dusty old streets of NewYork and the mundane life of working for failing businesses. His loving wife and kids who see him as the person who brings fun and joy to everything.
Another main Character who was a great addition to this role was Philip Carlyle (Zac Efron). Couldn't have played the role anymore perfect for what the film demanded. He's the perfect son gone rogue and it looks like it's going to be another cliché of The Perfect Son winning the approval of his parents because of the Girl he's chosen against their wishes but the film doesn't follow that direction which was fresh.
We have the Original Stars from when a circus act was first put together, small man, tall man, tattoo man, bendy man and not to forget the ever so popular bearded lady. I can only imagine someone like Guy Laliberte (CO Founder of Cirque du Soleil) starting out this way minus the animals.
The film/Musical starts out at a steady pace with acting that requires cheesiness at times and it follows one pace right through the film which is perfect. The story too Song ratio is just perfectly balanced so your not absorbed by the songs so much you lose interest in the story vise versa. The story is quite simple but moving which is clearly down to the selection of music. Important observation is the main actors are great but keep an eye on the background performers who absolutely put everything into the choreography and are just as entertaining as the main screen performers.
great story and simple message that we can get lost in success even without doing anything wrong. To become blind when our ambition is so strong that we lose sight of the people in our peripheral vision and only see the objective. I feel like this great magical film was very simple yet I want to write so much.
I will conclude this long winded yet necessary break down of the film. 100% amazing family film, great musical performances, necessary soft acting (anything too serious takes away from it), great screen shots and the main song has to be the best song for me. Hugh Jackman shows hes not just an actor but a TRUE talented performer. You always know a films going to be Unique when Zac 'can't keep a top on' Efron has his clothes on and it was a joy to watch him play this role.
Not enough great things I can say about this film but I will say this, if you like musicals or not its not a prerequisite for this film. 8/10"
"shweta-51657","8","1","3","25 June 2018"," This is where I want to be..!
","I usually detest musicals (Sound of Music being the greatest exception to this statement) as I dont find the music enthralling and captivating. More often than not, I find myself drifting off during the musical bit, waiting for it to come to an end and wait for the story to progress. 
The Greatest Showman on the other hand was a real show. The music builds and flows and has its own life in the movie. Catchy, beautifully lyrical, intense and delivered superbly by each and every actor in the movie. I can still hear the music and beats in my ears while I type this. I go a step further and say I might get the soundtrack, this movie was that fantastic!"

The movie got love story, struggle of a person who possess a dream since he was a kid. The so called ""Professional"" critics might say this movie was almost a flop, but to me it's definitely worth to watch for me. Well, like what PT. Barnum said in the movie. What's important is what the audience bring home after every show. Not what those critics shows. Again, kudos to Hugh Jackman. From those rugged style wolverine character to such wonderful as Barnum."

","The most fun I've ever had dancing and singing at a movie theater! Haha. 
A few points of slight annoyance for me was the auto tuning ""fake"" sound they used for the singers. I know all of these people can sing magnificently, so I was a little baffled at why they would do that. Also, the little person was horribly animated, nowhere near realistic looking. 
Those are the smallest of points compared to the Larger Than Life story this film is. The nostalgia and metaphor are strong and wistful. The actors are well cast, the costuming was delightful. The songs... oh the songs! I dare you to try watching it and not have them stuck in your head for months following. Go see it NOW!"
"tmpsvita","7","1","3","8 April 2018"," There are many problems but it reaches its objective that of entertaining and fun
","It is trivial, it is glossy and it is also predictable but it is also extremely funny, spectacular, pop, engaging, in some moments emotional, in others genuinely grotesque and above the lines, in short, there are defects and are also many but I would lie to myself if I did not say that I spent an hour and forty in absolute lightness and that I would look it again and again.
At the same time, however, I would have loved it if only it had pushed itself slightly further, if it had tried just a little more to make the story a little 'more substantial, full bodied and less as it was, because the feeling of seeing only a long video clip of a beautiful song is very strong especially in some points that are too pulled away, it seems that everything happens in a single day.
But as I have already said, however, it reaches its objective, that of entertaining, thanks to electrifying and pressing music, suggestive and often absurd but very well contextualized choreography, excellent scenography, great both vocal and acting performances, and enveloping and turned on cinematography and directed perfectly functional.
Also they managed to make me appreciate a film about circus that I personally hate because of the mistreatment on animals that these places allow, but in the film they are in cgi therefore, again, just fun."

","Lately, movies have been categorized into two genres: action-packed super-hero movie or morbid drama with a few comedic undertones. The Greatest Showman stands alone. It's why people went to the movies to begin with... to forget the pain, sadness and tragedy of the world, and enjoy two hours of entertaining fun and joy! I LOVED this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and the performances. The music is stellar (already memorized every song). Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, Zach Efron, Keale Settle, Zendaya and the entire cast are breathtaking (Loren Allred's song is sensational - listen to Never Enough now!). I can't wait to purchase The Greatest Showman when it's released, and I haven't bought an actual DVD in years. Enjoy!"
"kelli-redes","10","1","3","16 March 2018"," A breath of fresh air - and ironic that the critics hate it for the same reason it is good..
","Ok, number one, I am not a fan of the circus. Number two, I am a fan of musicals, but lost ALL hope in Hollywood produced new musicals after La La Land...it just...it didn't work for me! But this of course is not about La La Land...<br/><br/>My husband (who doesn't like musicals) and I were searching for a movie to see. With lack of anything else that captured our interest, we decided to watch The Greatest Showman, as the story seemed intriguing. <br/><br/>What a big surprise! Throughout the movie, we were laughing, crying, and tapping along. The music was extremely catchy and uplifting (and coming from someone who has not found music that tickles her fancy in a while). Everything about this movie reminded us to take joy in the small things, and appreciate uniqueness.<br/><br/>The fact that the critics don't like it because it is not true to the real story is just bonkers---the whole POINT of Barnums is allowing yourself to just get lost in your imagination and enjoy things for what they appear to be, perhaps not as they are in reality, but more as they are in the moment. What is so wrong with that? Enjoying something for what it is and not what everyone expects it to be?<br/><br/>Anyway, WATCH this movie! Weather you like musicals or not...it is wonderful. It is not a fluff romance, nor a typical musical...I just can't describe it other than a movie that everyone should give a chance to. Allow yourself to explore your imagination and enjoy being taken to a happy place."

"heyhey-19521","10","1","3","10 March 2018"," Go For the Music
","If you're a music lover, ""The Greatest Showman"" is quite a recent movie that I think is a must-see. The story describes the life of P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) and the creation of his famous circus. The movie depicts P.T. Barnum as a poor, young boy who grows up to marry his long-time love interest (Michelle Williams). They struggle to get by and provide for their two young daughters. After being fired from his job, he takes a huge financial risk and decides to create a show full of ""odd"" people that don't necessarily fit the mold of society. Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron), an upper-class playwright, gets roped into the show and becomes fascinated by Anne Wheeler (Zendaya), an African-American trapeze artist. The movie depicts the struggle between doing what is morally acceptable versus what is socially acceptable. P.T. Barnum in particular has to discover whether success or family is his main aspiration in life. His first taste of success causes him to turn his back on his eclectic troupe of performers and even his wife and daughters. In the end, he leaves Phillip in charge of the circus so he can focus on his family. The director, Michael Gracey, does a fantastic job of putting together this captivating movie with great special effects infused with an element of magic.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see in my opinion not because of the plot but because of the amazing score. This is obviously a musical, and all of the original music was written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. They're quite a young writing duo, but have recently taken the musical theatre world by storm. They wrote the music for the musical ""Dear Evan Hansen"" that has been extremely successful on Broadway for over a year. As most people probably know, I'm a musical theatre fanatic, and I personally think their writing is absolutely incredible. The impeccable music pairs with very moving lyrics that transports listeners to a different world. The songs definitely carry the plot, and it's precisely the reason why people should watch this movie.<br/><br/>Many musicals that are made into movies are marginal at best; most of the actors and actresses are no where near the caliber of the performers on Broadway. Because the music is recorded in the studio and not performed live, many of the songs in movie-musicals sound very unnatural and touched up (because the actors/actresses aren't skilled enough singers). However, ""The Greatest Showman"" has songs that sound amazing in the movie and in a live-setting. Keala Settle sings a very iconic song in the movie called ""This is Me"". She has performed it live many times, including the 2018 Oscars, and proved to the world that she has raw talent.<br/><br/>Some people might think going to see a movie for the songs is a waste of time and money. There's literally tons of ways to access music, including free apps like Spotify and YouTube. One could always listen to the album in the comfort of their own home. However, I think the whole movie experience enhances the way the viewers interpret the songs. The songs come into the movie at specific times that truly transform the whole movie experience. There's something about going to a movie theatre and watching a movie on a gigantic screen. The experience is amplified; the overall atmosphere takes the watchers into another world.<br/><br/>Despite the rave reviews the movie has received, the music really didn't mesh well with many watchers. A reviewer on IDMB called the music ""generic, bland, pop mixes"" which I fully disagree with. The music channels modern musical theatre which actually does have more pop influences than the classics. Despite this modern twist that many musicals on Broadway are beginning to channel, the songs are beautiful and exciting. Another reviewer claimed all the songs sound the same. As someone who listens to a lot of music, especially musical theatre, I can whole-heartedly say that none of the music sounds the same. There's a mix of up-tempos and ballads all with varying melodies that come together and add levels to the musical. If you're not a musical theatre person, this musical is an ideal in-between because of the essence of pop music. Because it's based on an actual story, this musical is more realistic but is still injected with hints of fantastical qualities that allow the movie to appeal to a wide range of people."

"celestei-50585","10","1","3","9 March 2018"," This Is The Greatest Show
","""The Greatest Showman"" is a truly amazing movie that came out in late 2017. This movie was inspired by the story of P.T. Barnum, a ringmaster and a prestigious showman. It is a gorgeous musical and tells the story of how Barnum started with nothing but later became a worldwide sensation after he opened his own circus. This movie included prominent actors and actresses such as Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Zendaya. This movie is hands down worth watching because from the very beginning the audience is hit with a really cool, mysterious scene. The audience sees Barnum's (Jackman's) shadow and he begins to sing and dance along with the other people in his circus. Following this song, the transition between the previous scene and the scene of Barnum's flashback to his childhood is extremely trippy but also mesmerizing. If you want to find out what the transition is, you have to watch the movie hehe. Each and every one of the songs are truly heavenly music to your ears. I've watched ""The Greatest Showman"" two times within two weeks and both times I was completely struck with amazement. The songs really touch your heart along with the plot itself. The plot is genuinely heart-warming, for I have shed a tear or two while watching every time. The point made from the story is really heartfelt. It teaches the audience that being ""different"" or ""strange"" from everyone else is a good thing because each person is unique in their own ways and beautiful in their own ways as well. Every person regardless of appearance or wealth has something truly worth admiring. This movie also encourages its audience to follow one's own dreams just as Barnum pursued his dream of opening a circus and doing more to aid his family financially. After Barnum lost his job as a clerk at a shipping company due to the company's bankruptcy, he took an enormous risk when he grabbed a loan from a bank to open his own museum. After he received little to no sales Barnum did not insist on giving up, for he persisted to gather ""freaks"" for his circus. I thought the best and main part of the movie was during the song ""This Is Me"". This song is played after Barnum rejects the ""freaks"" to socialize with him and the wealthy community. The audience is struck with sympathy for the circus performers and support them throughout the movie. This song was where I shed tears. There are numerous other parts of the movie which are really heartfelt and inspirational but you just have to watch it to find out. There will always be a few negative souls who aren't touched by the movie, for nothing can please each and every individual. A hater commented on the musical's ""generic, bland, pop mixes"" but in reality ""The Greatest Showman's"" music was gorgeous music to majority's ears. The music had a feel good vibe and truly illustrated the theme of the movie, which was that being ""different"" is a positive thing since each individual is unique and beautiful in their own ways. The hater also addressed his opinion of how the choreography was unsparing and that from the opening to closing credits there was no memorable number. This is obviously false since majority of the viewers commented of how they absolutely loved the opening scene where Barnum's shadow was shown and the music and choreography was truly glorious. In addition, the hater claimed there was no character development. This opinion was obviously wrong due to the fact that the entire story was based on Barnum's life, where he started off with nothing but developed into a wealthy, caring father. Although there are a few negative critics and fans who voice their own opinion, the movie is truly a special one. It earned an average of four and a half stars out of five and tons of spectators said that they absolutely loved the movie and would return to watch it multiple times. I, personally, have watched it twice already and would not mind watching it a few more times. My best advice would be to ignore the hateful comments and to go watch the movie and see how you like it yourself. I promise that you will fall in love and will return to watch it again and again."
"SinSaneSung","Null","1","3","9 March 2018"," All the flaws are right in front but that won't stop you loving this amazing film..
","OK, with all the big cast and great film makers behind, everyone is expecting it to be a Masterpiece. Guess what.. It's not. I wasn't expecting much either. Especially when the critics are beating the drums of negativity all over the internet. I agree there are flaws in this film. In some scenes you do notice there is clichÃ© and kind of typical drama that could have been made in a different way but believe me when I say this.. This is that kind of film which will evoke that uplifiting feeling that makes you happy, optimistic and think about yourself at the same time. I promise, before watching the film I was totally different, static, boring and in a very low state...I feel like this film actually regenerated my internal energy. The music is a treat. I am definately watching it again soon. 
It's a mood recharger..
It's fun...
It's a treat..
It's a wake up call..

"kikisawa","10","1","3","9 March 2018"," A ""Must See"" Movie!!
","""The Greatest Showman"" took its' viewers on the journey of P.T. Barnum and the circus, sharing relatable life stories of heartache and success. Through an amazing cast, sparking music numbers, and intricate storyline, this movie was brought to life, making it a ""must see"" movie.<br/><br/>The characters of the story identify with the audience. Like most viewers, P.T. Barnum had dreams, but his life wasn't going smoothly. His father passes and he becomes separated from his crush, Charity. Although separated, they keep in touch throuh letters, and eventually marry against Charity's father's will. Despite the happy marriage, Barnum's career is not going well, he loses his job and can't provide for his wife and now two daughters. His troubles are experiences that happen to everyone, not only does the view watch a colorful screen, but empathize with the people.<br/><br/>Another real and relatable theme of The Greatest Showman was: be yourself and accept your uniqueness. P.T. Barnum takes a chance and buys a circus. He searches for freaks to make the show come alive. He accepts those who are unwanted by society. As they join together to make a spectacular show, they gain acceptance from not only the crowd, but also themselves. This theme hits home for those insecure about their identity. Themes of acceptance really resonates with people. When viewers watch this movie, they see themselves in the character's shoes, especially with the help of music.<br/><br/>The sound track of ""The Greatest Showman"" springs the viewer's emotions to life. Throughout the hard times, P.T. Barnum sings ""A Million Dreams"", capitalizing on his longing to give his family a better life. This song is so beautifully sang and it's lyrics have so much depth. The song shows the struggles of Barnum and his ever present dreams as it the young Barnum begins the piece, and grown up Barnum ends the piece. The emotions of this song are so vivid to the viewer, allowing them to empathize with P.T. Barnum. Another memorable song was ""This is Me."" This song brought light on the theme of loving yourself and not conforming to society. The lyrics say it all as the chorus sings, ""When the sharpest words wanna cut me down, I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out... I'm not scared to be seen, I make no apologies, this is me."" This motivation the characters feel, prompts the viewer to understand their self worth.<br/><br/>In one particular review of the movie, ""The Greatest Showman,"" one viewer felt unsatisifed with the themes of the film. Their problem with the ideas were that they were cheesy, cliche themes. Claiming that the movie lacked dark, serious moments, the reviewer didn't see the movie for what it was and what it needed to be. The themes the movie covered, may not have been something new to the hears, however it was presented in an unconventional, unique way: the circus. This reviewer didn't see was that this movie did have dark, serious scenes. P.T Barnum goes through so much difficulty, which makes his journey so much more meaningful. Countering the viewer's comment, the circus needed to be bright. The circus was the story's hero. Adding even more serious scenes to the movie would ruin the charm of the circus, and the success of the characters of the movie. This magicial place brought the themes to life.<br/><br/>These themes would not have been as vivid if it weren't for the amazing cast. The chemistry between the whole cast was great. There were a mix of household names, and fresh faces. Personally, before I watched the movie, I thought the focus was going to be more toward Zendaya and Zac Efron; but their story wasn't the focus of the movie. However, I was definitely not disappointed. I'm a new fan of many of the actors. Hugh Jackman and Keala Settle were especially good with their musical numbers. After watching the movie, I looked more into the behind the scenes clips and interviews, and needless to say they all worked very well together.<br/><br/>The spectacular of the movie proved itself through the many awards this film has won. Its' current achievements for its' music and picture include five winnings and sixteen nominee awards. These achievements were among the top awards like the Ocars and Golden Globes. The awards this movie has won are well deserved and gives you yet another reason to watch this film.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an inspiring and exciting movie, I'd recommend The Greatest Showman. Its' elements of story, music and cast wove together to create an amazing movie."

"parameswaranrajendran","9","1","3","7 March 2018"," Why never get any nomination in Oscar!
","The Greatest Showman is magical, colourful & wonderful musical movie. Hugh Jackman & Zac Efron wonderful performances. Just wandering why this movie never get any nomination in Oscars 2018!"
"TheOny13","10","1","3","6 March 2018"," Critics just proved that lately they are a bunch of morons!(no spoilers)
","Where do I start to explain why I wrote the title I did? Well how about a few months ago when Star Wars came out and I saw polarizing opinions but went to the theater anyway to see it. I was shocked by how bad that movie was on every level but mainly on story and logic. That was probably one of my worst movie experiences ever. Then let's take some facts here into consideration before talking about this movie. Almost all the star wars fans with some brain left in their head, hated the movie, yet it got 4 Oscar nominations including original score which was one of the most bland scores I've ever heard from John Williams(he even reused some of the episode IV music, that's how bad it was), and yet that movie got 92% on RT and 85% on Metacritic. Why? Sometimes I understand why some critics or persons might find a movie bad/good even though I have the complete opposite opinion, but here in the case of SW there is nothing to understand on why some people might like that movie. It's just complete garbage. And after this introduction you might know how I feel about this movie. The Greatest Showman tells the story of PT Barnum who has a dream of becoming a great showman and in doing so overcome his low social status. <br/><br/>While not being the most artistic and stylish movie ever this movie succeeded in what it was trying to transmit: That chasing power or wealth might make you transform yourself into something you were never meant to be. This movie has so many powerful quotes at times and so many ideas that I was inspired and moved almost to tears during the whole runtime. The first aspect I'll touch is the performance of Hugh Jackman which is one of the most dedicating performance I've seen from him. That was hinted from the trailer when I saw something very different in his character and that was confirmed throughout the whole movie. Next the set pieces and costumes were stunning and gave the movie a huge sense of realism and made me feel like I was there in that period of time. Last but not least the soundtrack along with the songs was sublime, one of the best I've ever heard. The songs from this movie were hands down the best from any musical period. There were at least 3 songs worthy of Oscar nods(but since it didn't had the critics response as La La Land did it didn't happen) and those were: The Greatest Show, A Million Dreams and This Is Me(which should have won the Oscar although I loved Remember Me from Coco). Now the problem critics had with this is that it wasn't a classical musical, it didn't follow the same pattern La La Land or other previous musicals did. For me it seemed like a Pixar movie both in length and in pacing. That was probably one of the only gripes I had with this movie is that it's pacing was somewhat rushed at times because of it's short runtime. That meant some slightly undeveloped conflicts that honestly, looking back needed development only for retarded people like the critics(I mean if you saw X-men or know about the african-american discrimination you'll totally understand some of the movie conflict). But aside from that this movie was flawless in my opinion and it did what I expected to do ever since I've watched the song This is Me on youtube(you know the behind the scenes one) that brought tears to my eyes even though I didn't see the film at that time. <br/><br/>Overall sublime songs and soundtrack, fantastic and extremely dedicated performance from Hugh Jackman and great message along with inspiring ideas make this movie one of 2017's best movies in my opinion. 10/10"

It's refreshing to see Hugh Jackman take the lead and guide us through the emotions of a man's dream of creating something greater than himself.<br/><br/>I laughed, cried, fell in love, and felt betrayed by his character and almost everyone else around him. This is a visually stunning story with beautiful music that I can't wait to listen to over and over again.<br/><br/>I think everyone should watch this movie at least once in their lives.

Being the lemming she is, she has seen most of the movies nominated for an Oscar. Maybe because it came out for Xmas, late in the year, but I have no idea why this wasn't nominated for anything except best song. This movie reminded me of the those ""classic"" movies that are so fantastical, moving, engaging that you turn around and see it a bunch of times, buy the DVD and Stream it!!!. it's very much in the genre of movies like Star Wars, Rocky, Mary Poppins, Sound of Music.

","Saw it no stop. Makes you feel up into an imaginary world, and them breaks you up to tears, and again keeps up to make you dream, imagine and smile, laugh. <br/><br/>The script is well distributed, accompanied with a well distributed cast. Maybe some actors didn't do so well, but as an overall they could pull it out. <br/><br/>Is important to say that this is what we get when someone really wants to create something from the heart, this was sort of a dream project for Hugh Jackman, working on it for eight years, here we can now enjoy the results. Fully recommended."

","I am sorry I ever read the critics review. I finally watched the movie today due to my Dad telling me to go see it. Wow I was impressed with the music and just the imagination of the movie. I wasn't looking for a biography when I went to see the movie. I was looking for fun and the critics don't understand fun. This is how a musical should be made. LA LA land was not my cup of tea and the music wasn't good at all."

I love it so much that I went back to the cinema to watch it again.<br/><br/>I am always a big fun of movie musicals and Hugh Jackman, so I wanted to see this the moment I learnt about it. This is a little dangerous actually, because you are very easily disappointed when your expectations are too high. This often happens to me. However, this film never disappoint me, and it exceed my expectations in every aspects. Absolutely perfect, bravo!"

"sarahcoleman-79272","9","1","3","28 February 2018"," Great entertainment right across the board
","As an avid fan of musicals, I too was slightly underwhelmed by La La Land, so approached this film with low expectations, but came out of the cinema thinking ""now THAT was a musical!"". It looked amazing (the hairpieces were a bit dodgy in places but I have a thing about bad wigs....AND obviously empty suitcases and handbags but thats another story) the songs, even though new to me, were great, the costumes were dazzling and the dance routines jaw dropping. I KNOW it wasn't exactly factually accurate, but that wasn't why I'd gone to see it, I have other places to go if I want a history lesson. It was a true spectacle - can't wait for it to become a Christmas family staple."
"philipgerardscott","10","1","3","27 February 2018"," One in the eye for the critics!
","My last cinema visit was for Blade Runner 2049 - a quite brilliant film loved by critics and largely ignored by the cinema-going public. Like its predecessor it will probably come to be regarded a classic. <br/><br/>With The Greatest Showman we have the situation in reverse - disliked by critics and thriving on word-of-mouth from paying customers and many repeated viewings. It is a fictionalised musical account of the life of P. T. Barnum. Is it accurate? No. Was Barnum a nice guy? Apparently not. <br/><br/>But this film is a cinema treat for anyone who likes big screen musicals with great performances and a slew of catchy songs. I can understand repeated viewings as it reminds me most of Disney classics like Beauty & the Beast in terms of addictive tunes. If you like big screen musicals then ignore the critics and give it a go. It will, no doubt, be regarded as a musical classic..."
"artistsitrazionoiz","10","1","3","27 February 2018"," The Best movie that I have ever seen
","The best movie that I have ever seen. It should be up for about 10 Acadamy Awards, but it is only up for an award for the theme song, which is fantastic.....The so called professional critics, who reviewed it before it came to the theaters, have proved themselves to be rotten tomatoes, when they rated this superb movie, just like ""The Wizard of Oz"" was rated very poorly by the so called professional critics, but ended up being one of the greatest movies of all time, so this one WILL BE found one of the greatest movies of all time also, it has gross as of yesterday $345 Million dollars, if that don't put the rotten tomatoes in their proper place, than I don't know what would."

","What a wonderful, wonderful film to just escape from this hectic world's problems for approximately two (2) hours and enjoy a great cast from the beginning to the very end ...even the credits. Mrs. Shullivan and I wanted to stay and watch Hugh Jackman, The Greatest Showman a second time but unfortunately we were attending the last showing for the day's film performance.<br/><br/>We especially enjoyed the song and amazingly inspirational choreographed dance of the entire cast in the title song ""This Is Me"". Truly, truly this was inspirational. Michelle Williams, Zendaya, Zac Efron, of course you cannot take your eyes off of Hugh Jackman who is so talented, and the entire cast provided great family entertainment. Forget the multitude of CGI on steroids films produced by Marvel Studios and sit back and watch just a truly entertaining film with a biopic of the great PT Barnum unfold to a superb soundtrack and some inspirational dance numbers burst on to the big screen in such brilliant colors right before your very eyes.<br/><br/>I will definitely be purchasing a special edition Blu Ray when it becomes available to add to my collection of All-Time Film Classics."
"ianjameswatson","9","1","3","24 February 2018"," Great film to take the whole family!
","At first, I'll admit I was sceptical. I never read film reviews anyway, however I was a bit shocked at how critics have really put this film down. It was so good I couldn't stop thinking about it. I went with a group of friends and we embraced the nostalgia of it. It really makes you feel young and free.<br/><br/>I'd say it was perfect to show young people too but just because there isn't any swearing g, sex or bloody violence, does that mean it's not worthy of a decent critique. It was so good, we're considering going a second time to the sing-along screen showing as it will be surely a lot of fun. <br/><br/>I'd give this a 10 as I felt it could've been a bit longer, but if you're considering it, I'd recommend the cinema as there are some amazing trapeze scenes that looked and felt like you were up, close and personal with a circus.<br/><br/>A side note. I was pleasantly surprised with Michelle Williams performance. I expected it from the other actors but she really showed versatility and it was refreshing to watch.<br/><br/>I genuinely hope critiques think again as I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around some of their bad reviews."
"nicelyjesus","9","1","3","23 February 2018"," From now on, I probably won't listen to critics....
","Yes, this is a very loosely based adaptation on the live and performance ministry of P.T Barnum, but still it deserves a chance. It's one of the few films of 2017 that I left with a uplifting spirit in celebrating humanity. The music serves up some iconic hits, that shake the room. Hugh Jackman calls this his passion project, and its obvious why."

","I went two nights in a row. I know others that went two nights in a row. It's beautiful, it's inspiring, it's magical. No, it's not an accurate biopic but it is a celebration of events that revolutionized show business as we know it. The balance between creating a period piece and a modern, current event is impeccably executed. You will laugh and you will cry and you might leave feeling a little better about humanity."
"Paynebyname","8","1","3","16 February 2018"," Simply put - it's wonderfully entertaining
","I'm not a fan of musicals but I went along to see this with my partner and it was wonderful. I was foot tapping at the first song and didn't look back. The songs are great, the set pieces amazing, the characters engaging and the story simple and involving. After seeing the film, I bought the soundtrack and am off to see the sing-a-long version at the weekend.<br/><br/>I find how it has played out with critics sneering at it but audiences loving it, a really interesting and revealing indicator of our current lives. Barnum delivered crowd pleasing entertainment but the elites looked at him with contempt and this is no different.<br/><br/>And hence I read so many critics who just can't get that people like to be entertained when they go to the cinema and don't always have to be educated, lectured to or instructed about how they should be feeling.<br/><br/>We don't need to see a 100% accurate portrayal of a historical figure judged by today's standards, we don't have to see films that need to bang us over the head with a message that needs us to get riled up rather than uplifted and not every film has to be an exercise in virtue signalling that we can brag about to our equally empathetic and 'enlightened' friends.<br/><br/>Sometimes we just want to cut loose and enjoy ourselves, sometimes we just want to leave the politics and wailing at the door and simply revel in spectacle and entertainment. That is what The Greatest Showman offers and that is what so many detached critics are failing to see."
"Gubby-Allen","7","1","3","15 February 2018"," Solid
","A pretty good film, suitable for anyone, any age. The fact that I like it and this is not a genre of film that I usually would, was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The signing, acting, characters, plot are all fine, no gripes with them. <br/><br/>The morality is never completely clear as to what way you should be feeling, or who you should be siding with, which is a good thing, as there isn't necessarily a right or wrong and it lets the viewer decide.<br/><br/>This could have been better though, one or two of songs towards the end, became a little bit of a chore to get through and dragged out a plot which was developing well at the time. They seemed to be included as they had gone ten minutes without one, rather than it adding to the film.<br/><br/>The character time could have been distributed better. The Zac Efron relationship was not given anywhere near enough time.<br/><br/>All in all though, well worth a watch. You won't find much better at the cinema."
"garyeaton182","10","1","3","14 February 2018"," Fantastic for anyone who loves to be entertained.
","Fairly early on in the film, Hugh Jackman's character is talking to a theatre critic, and remarks that he seems to take little joy from his work, considering it is based on entertainment. <br/><br/>Had I taken any notice of the critics reviews for this film I'd likely have waited until it came out on dvd. As it was, a perfectly timed birthday gift for a family member saw us attending the cinema, and for this I'm glad.<br/><br/>If you're the type of person who goes to the cinema to be forget about the stress of everyday life and simply want to be entertained, then you won't fail to like this film. <br/><br/>Regardless of the chronology deviations or factual detail, the only thing that matters is that you leave the cinema with a smile on your face, and I certainly did."
"naturallyrockin","9","1","3","14 February 2018"," Magnificent Movie - I want to see it again!
","Even though i'm not a big fan of musicals, per se, I was enthralled with this movie from start to finish. I don't think I've ever experienced such mesmerizing synchronization of film to song, and this quality was consistent throughout the movie. Breathtaking. Over-the-top impressive. The vocals were stunning & moving, the choreography visually amazing, and the songs were wonderful -- kudos to the two songwriters who were on the billing. As a songwriter myself, that was very impressive as well.<br/><br/>Equally intriguing to me was the cast. I haven't experienced Michelle Williams for many years, since the most tragic loss of Heath, and I was simply blown away by her talent and beauty. Her wonderful voice was an amazing surprise, as was Ms Ferguson's, and many others of the cast. I had already heard Hugh J in Les Miserables, which I thought was an aptly-named miserable remake of that wonderful story, but his voice got more & more impressive throughout this movie. I was also delighted to hear Zac Efron in a musical role again, playing a decent character, since I have avoided his more trashy movies, even though he is one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>The storyline itself? Wonderful -- the kind of stuff all classics are made of. So, even if you aren't a fan of musicals, you owe it to yourself to see this movie with a friend that you can laugh & cry with... I laughed & cried by myself."

"jas-46858","6","1","3","11 February 2018"," Average: The Musical
","I can understand why people enjoy this film. Ill start this reviews with the positives. This film does successfully make you feel good. The actors seem to be having a great time during this film and some moments between characters are heartfelt. The dancing is great and the excellent cinematography emphasises this. The director also uses lighting brilliantly. It's hard to describe, but you will notice it during this film and like it. The music is good, and although some weaker than others, and another nitpick that I'll get to later, you will have most of these songs stuck on repeat in your head, ""This is me"" definitely deserved the nomination.<br/><br/>However when there isn't singing and dancing the film is bland and generic. The characters are very one dimensional and lack character arcs. This was a problem with every character in this film, including the nameless characters. It was very black and white, people either hated the circus or loved it. The director also presented every single rich person as 'snobby and hateful' to the circus. The story of P.T Barnum is an interesting one, however the film didn't do well presenting the struggles of getting a circus, infact, glossed over an entire section of him and the circus late in the film! When it came to the music, it was good, no doubt, however it sounded very present-day for a film set in the 19th century.<br/><br/>To summarise, I wouldn't call it one of the great films of the year, however a fan of musicals will adore this film, and the story will deliver for any casual movie goer. I WOULD recommend this film"

"thefilmnotebook","10","1","3","6 February 2018"," Full of charm and delight!
","There hasn't been that many movies where we feel its joy right away. I didn't expect The Greatest Showman to be so charming, but it had me under its spell in an instant. What can I say, I loved this film. Its happiness is immensely contagious, and it took a great deal of effort to stay put in my seat! Sometimes first impressions in a movie is everything, and Hugh Jackman leaves an extremely positive one from the very first scene. He was the life of this film. I was wondering throughout, is there anything Hugh Jackman can't do? He can sing, he can dance, he can act - and he also melts our hearts with his adorable family (Michelle Williams, and two very cute girls - Austyn Johnson and Cameron Seely). Jackman is a very lovable guy playing a very likeable character, and his amazing showmanship skills is in given ample fuel to truly dazzle here. <br/><br/>The stern show critic in the film described P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman)'s show as 'a celebration of humanity' and in my opinion, it is a perfect summary of what this film is. It is a celebration of our differences, of the courage to be yourself, of love, of family, and of the simple pleasures that we often take for granted in the pursuit of what we perceive at the time to be something greater. It is a singing and dancing fairytale that will quite literally, lift you out of the shadows.<br/><br/>It seems that's the case for many of the characters in the film too. They are marginalised, and excluded from society for their unique features. They live in hiding and in shame. Barnum pulled them from the darkness, and gave them a chance to realise their worth and their individual strengths. Zendaya and Kaela Settle both showcased a quiet resilience that is admirable and inspiring. Their profound talents and astonishing voices gave the heart and warmth to Justin Paul and Benj Pasek's (who also wrote the songs for La La Land) brilliantly written songs (particularly 'This is me', which I have no doubt will win the best song category at the Academy Awards this year). Personally, I was so moved by the songs that I immediately downloaded the soundtrack when I got home! <br/><br/>It is hard to believe that this is Australian director Michael Gracey's first feature film. I could understand the approach that he decided to tell Barnum's story, and I am very glad that he chose to tell his story in a dream-like way. He captured the vision of Barnum with his own imagination, and weaved into his film the idealism and the optimism Barnum's ideas embodied. It is an incredibly uplifting film, and with the colour and magnificence created by production designer Nathan Crowley (the Prestige, Interstellar) and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, I felt like I was right there - being a part of Barnum's spectacularly enchanting show. <br/><br/>It isn't easy to tell a story through music and songs, but the 'the Greatest Showman' is a great one that you shouldn't miss. I guarantee that if you go see it, you will leave the cinema with a huge grin, with your heart full, and for a little while, you will forgive the muddy troubles this world has, and that is definitely worth experiencing these days."
"dandan13","10","1","3","5 February 2018"," For All to Enjoy
","This movie was an excellent blend of entertainment and emotion. While the movie carries two primary themes, the first targeted at the younger viewers, encouraging them to follow their dreams. The second theme is the increasingly relevant theme of the struggles and acceptance of all humanity. 
The soundtrack enhances the viewers experience with a wide range of songs that are seamlessly integrated into the story that is being told. While the songs vary in style and tempo, the two themes are prevalent throughout. 
The cast was excellent, with Zendaya and Keala Settle having some extremely powerful moments regarding the struggles faced and the acceptance of themselves as human beings. This is a huge point that the movie drives home urging us to embrace all of humanity with all it's different cultures, beliefs and appearances.
Overall the movie was an outstanding combination coupled with an excellent soundtrack and magnificent cast. It really was the Greatest Show!"

","I generally don't like musical, too many cheesy teen ones when I was growing up caused a rift, I heard La La Land was good and tried it, decent movie but still got on my nerves. <br/><br/>This on the other hand was fantastic, a really upbeat pop-style soundtrack that effortlessly lends itself to a sing-along version, an easy to follow plot (maybe not the way things really happened but still a better love story then Twilight) and a cast/crew that sold it. During a movie age where everything is either an adaptation of a super hero comic, a remake or a sequel it is nice to have something new and original, spearheaded by a lead actor who thought it would make a good movie, not a board who thought it would make a buck.<br/><br/>Go see it, buy the soundtrack and prepare to get it at home."

","The critics are indeed very wrong about this film. This is why I feel I need to write something to maybe motivate potential viewers to go see it, outside of what they have heard from critics. 
I have never so thoroughly enjoyed a film. It was pure joy!
I have non-stop been listening to the soundtrack ever since. After it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. My friend and I were absolutely speechless on the way home by how it hit us. 
In this day and age a film like this so filled with pure and genuine enjoyment is an absolute gem that should get the recognition it deserves. Sadly, I don't feel like it has received that recognition with only one oscar nomination. The cast was perfect, especially Hugh Jackman! Honestly what that man can't do... The music was phenomenal, cinematography enchanting, I just can't sum up how good this film was. 
To think that a film about a woman who falls in love with a fish-person, boils eggs and floods her bathroom to have sex with said fish-person has been nominated for 13 oscars, while this masterpiece of a film only receives one nomination is a great shame!"

","I have only seen a few films in my life that have left me sitting there wondering if I should stand right there in the theater and applaud its brilliance. The mixture of amazing music and brilliant acting created an experience that you don't find often in film. I sat in my seat spellbound for its entire run time and not even once did I wonder if it was almost time to go. I'm a grown man and left the theater feeling like a little kid again, it ignited the part of my imagination that I forgot was there. Hugh Jackman gives an amazing performance that should have been nominated for an Oscar. I plead with anyone who reads this to ignore the pompous critics and to go and see this amazing film. You will not regret it!!!!"
"mirta-collazo","10","1","3","23 January 2018"," Amazing performances
","I have respected Hugh Jackman for his fascinating performances on the big screen for many years, but I was blown away, I saw Les Miserables but this I believe is one if not the best performance I have seen from him. Zac Efron absolutely brilliant and back to his roots. Love the cast love the bearded lady she has one amazing voice. Yes I will buy this movie and most likely will see it again soon :) LOVED IT"

","Now, I've seen that the critics don't like the film, but seriously, they doesn't know squat about this spectacular movie. I mean, the way it started was really the way to kick of this type of a movie, and then just change to a scene where we can se how the head character in this movie was living trough hes childhood. The movie provides great singers, great acting, great dancing, a great message to the society, and a great way to show people to never give up. As soon as I left that theater, I just had to see it again! So I did! This is my favorite movie out of all time, ever.,"

","The Greatest Showman is The Greatest Movie i've seen in my life, every single person in the theater clapped for a straight minute when the credits rolled in!

"valarik564","9","1","3","22 January 2018"," It isn't perfect and it isn't for everyone, but it is truly spectacular.
","I am a huge fan of musicals. I'm an actor, I went to school for theater, and am intimately familiar with the works of Sondheim, Webber, Tim Rice, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Larson, Miranda, etc. I absolutely love musicals on both stage and screen. <br/><br/>Firstly, what you'll hear a lot in other reviews is that it's pretty simple and straightforward. This is absolutely true, but it's not necessarily a negative. This is a PG Disney movie, so set your expectations accordingly. <br/><br/>Secondly, it also isn't strict in its biographical take on P.T. Barnum. It plays with the story, and turns it into something closer to a fable than a documentary. Again, this is not a negative, unless you were expecting a documentary style movie. <br/><br/>With both of these things in mind, this is why I love this movie: because it is incredibly clear that everyone working on it did, too. This movie ends up being a splashy, live action, musical fable about the wonderous possibilities of chasing your dreams, and being careful not to let them run away with you. It's filled to the brim with striking choreography (including one of my absolute favorite bar numbers), splendid visuals, and energetic and uplifting music. It has its share of low moments throughout the movie, careful to avoid both inaccurately showing Barnum's or the performers' lives as being perfect and unchallenging, and being incessantly happy for a two hour musical. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie shows itself to be nothing more or less than a two hour love letter to the musical genre, set to a dazzling take on the life of a great entertainer, and built on the message of being true to yourself and proud of it. It is the definition of a feelgood movie, and there isn't anything wrong with that."
"peanutclairebailey","10","1","3","22 January 2018"," Sensational!
","I never thought I'd ever find a film I love more than The Shining (my favourite film of all time). The Greatest Showman IS my new favourite film. I can't express how brilliant this film is. I call it ""a natural anti-depressant"". This film would warm even the coldest of hearts. I left feeling happy. I left wanting more (and subsequently went back to see it again the next day!). I'm already booked to go again too. I cried practically from the start. The opening scene is the best I've ever seen. I've never watched a film that opened so brilliantly. Within seconds you're heart is pounding, your feet tapping and heart bursting with adrenaline. All the songs are fantastic (I've been listening obsessively since the first time I saw this film). My favourite scene was Jenny Lind singing Never Enough. WOW! I can't rave about this film enough. I loved Hugh Jackman before but now I'm obsessed! That moment during ""come alive"" when the scene goes into slow motion and he sings ""come alive"" whilst putting his hat on. Sent shivers. I've never even really heard Zac Efron talk before but I was blown away by his performance. Zendaya was fabulous. Her character was awkward and uncomfortable. She portrayed this character perfectly. I thought she stood out. Michelle Williams was brilliant. I can't speak highly enough of all the actors/actresses. This film has brought sunshine into my life. Brilliant. 10/10."
"plod-91484","10","1","3","22 January 2018"," The Best Movie Musical Ever
","I believe that the blending of such an inspiring story with a modern(ish) soundtrack brings this movie to life and raises it above all other musicals put to cinema. The film is riveting from the offset until the credits with no time to become even remotely bored, as there is always something to focus on. Many musicals have a problem with some songs just not clicking with the story and seeming disjointed however, the soundtrack to The Greatest Showman seems to fit perfectly with the story it is trying to tell. I have also listened to the soundtrack independent of the film and must honestly say that it does not contain one song that i would consider anything below great. I would highly recommend this film to all, whether they're a family or not."
"ashleighwaters-90111","10","1","3","22 January 2018"," Brilliant, wonderful, fantastic
","I didn't have an IMDB account before now but felt the need to sign up so I could write this review. I went in to this movie as a tag on to the kids - not really wanting to see it and certainly not expecting anything much. Boy - what a ride. What a wonderful, wonderful movie. The acting - superb, the singing - Hugh Jackman/Zac Efron/""Jenny Lind"" (both actor and singer)/Michelle Williams/Keala Settle/Zendaya - brilliant (incl. the barman!). The music - wow. Simply wow! Absolutely superb. The dancing - fantastic. The messages - clear but not nauseating. Oh wow...there are just not enough superlatives to describe this wonderful movie. The way this movie has been crafted is excellent. From the opening scene to the very end. Brilliant.<br/><br/>We've already bought tickets to see it again, downloaded the soundtrack and waiting with baited breath to buy the blu-ray. BUT - see it on the big screen first. Absolutely well worth it.<br/><br/>Ignore the critics - we're the ones that count (the ones who push the box office takings up!). This movie is now my all time favourite.<br/><br/>Superbly executed...."
"Irena_Spa","10","1","3","21 January 2018"," Perfectly done!!!
","I can't remember when I've seen such a beautiful movie full of emotions, with a good story and a good music. It is gorgeous!!! Every character is beautiful, every scene is very well done, there's not any second that it is boring. Every song is so sensitive and with the clear message. I've enjoyed in every moment of it and ask myself how it would look like if it comes out on the stage of some theatre as Broadway is. Everyone is good, more than good and all of them deserve a winning award. I want to see it again and I am very sure that never will be enough seeing it."
"jacobu","10","1","3","21 January 2018"," Watched it 3 times in the movie theaters and still amazed
","This movie is a masterpiece!!! When I watched it the first time I didn't know it was a musical, I hate musicals. By the second song I realized this is a musical and was annoyed thinking this movie is going to suck. I was so wrong! The story is just beautiful and the songs are really really good. The songs fit perfectly to the scenes/situations when they were sung. I listen to the soundtrack everyday since I first watched the movie which was two weeks ago. Yes, I've watched the movie now 3 times in two weeks and never get tired or bored of it. Could watch it again and again. The acting is amazing from all actors that play in the movie. The emotions expressed by the characters goes straight to your heart. You really feel for them and it's not hard to lose a tear here and there during the movie. So far, multiple friends have cried at different scenes during the movie. I think the greatest thing about the movie are the moral values that the movie gives the audience. I always leave the movie theater in a really good mood every time I watch this movie. Can't relate to any other movie that has ever done this for me. It has become my favorite movie ever."
"hunterpowell-42499","10","1","3","21 January 2018"," Best show ever 10/10
","This movie was so good. As soon as the movie started it had a song titled Million Dreams (I am guessing the title) and it was so good. I watched this film 2 days ago and I still have all the songs stuck in my head. The songs are just so good. This movie should earn some kind of reward. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it it's worth the money. I never imagined a film this good would ever exist."

My reason for 10 out of 10 stars is as follows...<br/><br/>Music: Awesome (bought soundtrack immediately after)
Cinematography: Amazing
Choreography: Stupendous

"copperrd","10","1","3","20 January 2018"," A Beautiful Creation
","Though I listened to the soundtrack before seeing the movie, the songs still stirred my emotions while watching them unfold on the screen. From the opening scene, to the ending, my attention was fully captured as the movie showed a beautiful journey of acceptance, courage, and love. The songs do not fall under the typical Broadway stereotype, so please do not stray away from this movie because it contains singing. The songs varied from making me want to sing and dance along, to making my heart swell and my eyes water.<br/><br/>Every person on the cast deserved to be in this movie and did their characters justice. The chemistry between Zendaya and Zac was incredible, as well as the passion Hugh and Meals had in their voices.<br/><br/>If you have the chance to see this beautiful creation, or even listen to the soundtrack, please take it."

"Psy-Ko","10","1","3","18 January 2018"," I like a musical????
","Up to this point I think the only musicals I've liked are those with a heavy metal/hard rock soundtrack or those that I remember from when I was a kid like Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang & Willy Wonka. But this is right there with those. It made me feel like a kid again! I thought Hugh Jackman played the role great, brought a lot of life into it while still keeping him human. A lot of circus people don't like the film, one because the animals are cgi, I get that but really if you watch it , the scenes with animals could not have been done with real animals. The other reason some don't like it is because it's not historically accurate. Barnum was a teetotaler and very dedicated to his family. He also was not the greatest showman, he liked working behind the scenes and making the decisions, hiring the right people. But that wouldn't have made much of a movie would it? I understand the circus people wanting a more truthful story told but what this movie is, is fun. And it's mainstream and the way things are now anything that keeps the circus in the public eye and positive should be considered a good thing. I think as long as you aren't someone who picks apart the details of a movie you would find this enjoyable.<br/><br/>I am counting the days until it comes out on DVD and I can add it to my collection! This is one I will watch again and again."
"mmccon12","10","1","3","17 January 2018"," Loved It
","I wasn't into musicals or plays until I met my wife. I now have a pretty decent appreciation for them. This movie is no exception. You can tell Hugh Jackman loved to play this role. The music is mostly upbeat, intense or just plain fun. Any sad or melancholic moment soon turns around. Its about bouncing back, fighting to survive, and finding hope. It was also nice to see Hugh Jackman in another musical, especially one that has a little more upbeat fun and happiness, as compared to Les MisÃ©rables. If you like any theatrical musicals, and need a more uplifting and fun story, go see this."

","My love of the movies over the years has reduced rapidly. Most of the time I sit fidgeting in my seat, wondering how long is left and waiting for the same repetitive ending that comes with a lot of ""good movies"" that the critics are telling you to watch. I have grown unimpressed by the overcrowded super hero viewings and fighting over who can make the most money when it comes to its viewers.<br/><br/>But every so often, there is a movie that stands out of the crowd all on its own and changes your view on the cinema experience. The Greatest Showman. Wow. It is rare that I am so drawn into a film that I forget I am sat in the local Vue cinema screen, and not watching a stage show of color, emotion and breathtaking performance. There were times I had to stop myself from clapping with the audience on screen, momentarily bringing myself back into reality.<br/><br/>I can honestly say this movie is a roller coaster of emotions. holding back tears, laughing out loud and eagerly wanting to dance with the characters on screen and cheer them on with their growing positive outlook. Now in my top 10 favorite movies of all time, you have to go see this on the big screen to fully appreciate it."

"ekp223","9","1","3","17 January 2018"," Still listening to the soundtrack!
","Speaking for myself, I view going to see movies as a way to escape the typically mundane, and (sometimes) slightly depressing reality. With so much negativity in the world, it's nice to take a break and go be swept away! If a movie is entertaining, completely captivating, and ultimately make me forget that I'm sitting in a theater... I view that as a success. The Greatest Showman did just that. I saw the trailer, which advertised this movie as a fantastical, whimsy filled musical, and I feel the movie delivered on my expectations. Sure, it may not be the most complex or realistic/historical movie; but I didn't expect it to be. <br/><br/>All in all, it's an enjoyable and fundamentally uplifting movie; acted out by an incredible cast, full of extremely catchy musical numbers and loads of imagination!"
"Geoff1963","10","1","3","16 January 2018"," Very entertaining
","It may not be historically accurate ; I doubt that PT Barnum and his family and employees, actually burst into song quite that often. Look very closely, and perhaps there is the odd technical goof ; but if that is why you go to the cinema, then maybe you should lighten up.<br/><br/>It thought it was very entertaining, but also had enough : drama, romance, and morality."
"michaelcontois","9","1","3","16 January 2018"," Forget the Critics
","After all the negative reviews, I was just a bit uncertain if I would end up going to this in theater, but after hearing nothing but amazing things from family and friends who went, my girls and I spent our holiday at the movies. <br/><br/>WHAT A BLAST!!! Is it the greatest film ever, not at all. But as he said in the movie, it didn't matter if it was flash and illusion, the smiles were real, and it was a lot of fun. It's the kind of movie that knows what heart strings it's going to pull, and I think it succeeded masterfully. <br/><br/>I think the critics are just bitter because of the underlying message about their profession in the movie. So ignore what the high brow artistic ""elite"" say and trust me, if you like the classic, feel-good, musicals of the 50's - 60's, this is going to be right up your alley. Hugh Jackman and Zach Efron were fantastic, the rest of the cast was spectacular, and the score was amazing!"
"sonybhuvanendran","10","1","3","16 January 2018"," Does the smile seems fake to you? Of course not, the best movie ever I saw over a long period of time.
","This is the first time I am writing any review in an international website and this particular movie had made me to do it. This is the best movie which I ever saw in the year end of 2017 with stellar performances and this happened to be enlisted in my all-time favorites list. ""The noblest art is that of making others happy"", which... I did not say it, but P.T. Barnum did, and this movie is all about his idea that changed the world of how people see other people. He has also said that ""no one has ever made a difference by being like everyone else"", which I believe is absolutely true. Barnum had brought a great deal of difference in mankind by becoming the greatest showman to entertain people by the people and the fairytale that continued in the culmination of this magnificent culture called ""CIRCUS"". The story is conveyed to the audience in the form of songs with breathtaking dance performances empowering lot of human emotions and values, which put on a great deal of craftsmanship and making us feel the pain of racism. The songs were all classic numbers, which brought back the glorious moments during my childhood watching movies like ""My Fair Lady, Sound of Music, etc., and even the recent one La La Land."" This movie contained 11 mainstream songs that come onscreen, which conveys to us the story from becoming. There wasn't a single song that brought down the pace of my legs tapping on the ground and that much of complete happiness was felt by me. I believe it would bring the best of moments and a great deal of laughter and splits in everyone by the time the first song starts and continues till the end of show, which I feel is eternal. We would dwell so deep into the characters as it brings immense pleasure with what we could have encountered in our lives and something which we could have missed in our lives too, as the words and dances put together brings on us such a breathtaking impact. This movie is for all ages and I felt something deep inside my heart was getting lost the moment I was stepping out of the theater hall as it had more inspirational messages and credibility on how we need to deal with life. This movie had proven me that still great story tellers do exist in this world and life would be more beautiful if we embrace it with full heartedness. My favorite song in this movie is, oh my god, how would I say one because all the 11 are the best in its own level. Nevertheless, everyone would have their personal best right? and my favorite numbers are, 1) This is me by Keala Settle, 2) Million Dreams by Ziv Zaifman, Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams, 3) Re-write the Stars by Zac Efron and Zendaya, 4) Tightrope by Michelle Williams and not to be forgotten the title song 5) The Greatest Show by all the lead characters and continues the rest of the soundtrack list. The one sensational thing that is unbelievable here is all songs were sung, danced, and performed by the lead characters themselves and I would truly appreciate the makers of this movie ""The director, Micheal Gracey along with story writers Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon, and above all, the greatest of appreciation from all around the world goes to song writers Justin Paul, Benj Pasek and the music directors John Debney and Joseph Trapanese"" for having given this magnificent piece of art called ""The Greatest Showman"". If none of you believe in a word of what I said above, do check out these songs with lyrics in youtube and feel how it brings goosebumps in everyone and how music and words with combination of dance relate to human emotions. So, embrace life and embrace humanity."
"smithcaleb-90386","10","1","3","16 January 2018"," Easily my favorite musical
","I was shocked at how amazing this film was. The way it promotes equality and chasing dreams makes it such a good film for this generation. I wish more movies had such positive themes in it.

A strong leading cast lead by the charismatic and talented Hugh Jackman who gave a fantastic performance. The songs are incredibly catchy - the ballads gave me goosebumps and the upbeat songs had me tapping my feet. (I am now listening to the soundtrack as I write this!) Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, and Zendaya also provides fabulous performances along with the chorus; amazing voices and choreography. The storyline had me hooked from the beginning, it was visually stunning - dreamy and magical - you get lost in it. I left the theatre feeling upbeat and inspired.

","I usually do not write reviews, but I could not believe my eyes when I saw that some people reward this movie with anything below a 10.
A week later and the playlist of this movie is still the only thing I am listening to, and will be for a while.
Of course, the movie is happy and with a lot of songs, but do not let that fool you into thinking there isn't a greater story beneath it all. 
Seeing how people from all different shapes and sizes are able to start seeing their worth in life for the first time is absolutely amazing. The songs are original and very motivational.
I use them to run that extra mile when I try to work out, my sister used them to pump herself up before her car exam (which worker, btw), to give a few examples.
When you see the movie, the next thing you want to do is see it again.
Really well written, very good actors and the music is great.

","I am not a person who likes musicals, if anything I am something like the boring movie viewer. Watching an eye candy action or a stomach hurting comedy. So I might not be the best to judge, but I feel the need to express my feelings about this movie. As a person not intrigued by musicals I must say that I am completely, absolutely, teenage crazy obsessed with ""The Greatest Showman"". The songs are stuck in my mind and weirdly I can relate to all of them (being completely honest I have been listening to them in my car for the past two weeks and I perform the shows of my life on every red light). And all those problems like racism, judging without any particular reason, trying to control others lives, trying to fit in for the price of losing everything and breaking all your principles in desperate need of approval, well all of the above makes me love it even more while hating the fact that they are all stuff we can still see around us, in our world, in our time. The movie is amazing to watch in general but for me it was on another level. It provoked my emotions, it provoked my way of seeing the world, it provoked my soul. For some of you I might seem like I am overreacting but that is my opinion and I will own it as it is. And if you chose to hear me out, you must watch this movie, it will not disappoint you."

 Frankly the promotion of this movie was horrible. I had not read critical reviews so I walked into this film expecting to be entertained for a few hours and not much more.

We didn't see it during the holidays and were surprised to find it's still at all the theaters since the movie critics reviews were so-so at best. We actually had to go to our second choice theater because our first choice was sold out. From the very opening scene you know this is a special movie. The sets, costumes, acting choreography and the MUSIC are magnificent!!! It is extremely entertaining and just makes you feel good. Our second choice theatre was sold out as well with people of all ages - including a LOT of young 20's and teenagers - and at the end the entire audience applauded. That's something I haven't experienced very often. And people were walking out after the movie smiling and talking about how much they loved the movie. Ignore the ""professional"" critics - they forget we go to movies to be entertained and escape the cruel reality of our current days and this movie does that!!!"
"spasek","10","1","3","13 January 2018"," The Power of Unity in this Spectacular Musical!
","It's interesting how often movies and shows come along at a time when we desperately need them the most. We live in a world where division, intolerance, hatred, and prejudice are seeking to divide us daily, which is ironic considering that every single master and saint who has come to this world has taught the exact opposite: unity, tolerance, and love are what Life is all about.<br/><br/>The story is about P.T. Barnum, a poor street boy who has a dream of living in a world of the fantastic; a world where everyone is accepted and included. In fact, he purposely seeks out those who have been shunned and banished from society. What he puts together a collection of talented people who know and understand the power of love, unity, family, and sticking together. <br/><br/>I cannot over-emphasize how incredible the musical numbers are! The movie opens with a terrific sequence and it never stops. Every song is powerful, fun, poignant, and magical! The dance sequences are just as incredible and they compliment the songs perfectly. <br/><br/>As soon as I got home, I immediately downloaded the soundtrack. That's how good these are! <br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is just a ton of fun, and it has a powerful message to go along with it. It's time that people look at what unites us rather than what divides us. It's interesting, considering that music is universal and thus, it provides a terrific medium for the message of this film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is amazing, and so is the rest of the cast that includes, Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, and Zendaya. <br/><br/>A movie that the entire family can go and see, you'll find yourself moving to the music and walking out feeling pretty darn good. What more fun could you ask for in ""The Greatest Showman""?"
"lei-jay","10","1","3","13 January 2018"," An Instant All-Time Favorite
","This movie is nothing I expected it to be. From the moment it started, I was hooked. The way you're walked into the story, how can you not fall in love with the characters? You can try all you want, but every role that is played is so significant, and i love how i wanted to get to know more about each character and that's exactly what happened. They truly are unique as well as flawed.<br/><br/>The songs were nothing short of beautiful. The energy you get from each song is just amazing, whether you like it or not, it moves you. It made my heart dance, and that brought tears to my eyes. At one point I gave up holding back my tears and cried. It's such a feel-good and upbeat movie, even when things seem so out of balance. The characters fall and pull you down with them, but the hope that they hold on to for each other pulls you back up."
"djkrysm","10","1","3","13 January 2018"," Critics are so wrong!!
","The Greatest Showman is a fantastic movie which is so uplifting, positive and sends out a message to the audience about chasing their dreams no matter who they are, and critics seem like they are talking out their backsides or have reviewed a completely different film. There were tears of happiness in my eyes throughout this movie, it's so good I already went to see it twice and planning to go more times until the DVD comes out. Last thing I am going to say is don't listen to the critics and go to the cinema or buy the DVD and enjoy this wonderful little diamond of a movie that The Greatest Showman is as I promise you, you will enjoy it!"

","Though I'm already biased towards musicals, this movie was an absolute delight. I loved every bit of it. Performances by Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron were very praiseworthy. <br/><br/>I thought the arc between Barnum and his father in law took somewhat of a weird turn. That's the only disappointment (minor) I have with the plot. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie, the songs, the dances and the circus performances were all amazingly executed. This is a movie I truly enjoyed. Much recommended for everyone."

","My wife really wanted to see this; she showed me the preview and I thought it looked like the worst movie ever, plus it's a musical, so I definitely did not want to see it. I couldn't let her go to the theater by herself so I went and by the end of the movie on the drive home we had the soundtrack on Spotify to jam to on the car ride home! The story, even it being a musical, really pulls you in and you feel like you are a part of it; the story is very beautiful. The type of music that is sung throughout is very good, it has some rock elements so it really makes you start stomping your feet in the theater when you don't even realize it. Ladies, definitely see it. Guys, don't underestimate it, give it a shot. I loved it!"

","This movie made me feel like all my dreams were coming true all at once. In other musicals that I've seen, the singing can be too much that it makes it awkward and cringey to watch. The movie was just perfect and made you want to sing and dance along. I felt like I was at Broadway watching them perform right in front me. I've seen it twice and it still gives me such joy which no other movie has ever done to me before."

I have seen it three times so far and could see it over and over. I feel happier each time I leave the theater. It's family friendly, something unheard of these days, even more family friendly than so many of the common, crude, animated movies made these days, I loved that. It stirs hope inside of you. Who doesn't need a little extra hope these days. :)"

You laugh, you cry, you dance and you laugh. Such a refreshing and wonderful movie, don't listen to the critics, you will walk away with a smile on your face. The movie is full of imagination and heart, something we all need more of now a days. This movie doesn't claim to be a true story on PT Barnum, so people who say it's not accurate of his life, it never claimed to be. It's a story about imagination and it's amazing."

","I can't even say how much I love this film. I have never been this passionate about a movie- I have actually already seen it twice in the theater (a first for me!) and it may have been even better the second time. It makes me sad that people waste time going to more frivolous movies (like Jumanji- sorry to say) and don't give this a chance. The work and effort that went into this- singing, dancing, acting, song writing and composition, period accurate scenery and costume- is breathtaking. This movie is what a true Hollywood film should be! The cast is superb and the pace of the movie is perfect. We were sad when the movie ended because every second was entertaining! There are so many social issues and injustices going on in the world today that I think we have learned to be hyper sensitive (which usually is excellent) but in this case I think some critics may have done a disservice to themselves by applying that thinking too harshly while viewing this film. This is ENTERTAINMENT pure and beautiful and to miss that would be a shame because this film, if you let it, will leave you in awe and feeling great! Please see this in the theater- a movie like this MUST be seen in the theater!"

","I didn't read the critics review. I don't read critic reviews. Critics are paid professionals, meaning professionals because they are paid. Everyday people who live in the real world and go to see movies for the love of it are the only true qualified critics.<br/><br/>I've been a musician for 49 years. Without a doubt this movie has the greatest music I've seen in a movie in decades. The story is compelling, and if you can believe it, it also has a good bit of historical truth given it's a Hollywood movie. <br/><br/>I was first of all astounded to see that the Wolverine can actually sing... REALLY WELL. But I truly wasn't prepared, even after all the trailers, for the spectacle and the real story with character depth and everything!<br/><br/>Perhaps the critics have become so full of their ""profession"" that they've forgotten how to give good ratings for a truly enjoyable movie. <br/><br/>Coming from a fan of great classic dramas, as well as SciFi, Fantasy, and everything fun in movies, this is my favorite movie in years!"

We have listened to the album non-stop. My husband and I LOVE the music, acting, dancing, cast, costumes, sets and the message. I never listen to the critics, but on this one they definitely missed the mark by trying so hard to put it down. Nice to see the PEOPLE are setting the record straight.

Hugh Jackman was amazing and say what you will about the story of Barnum, it wasn't *actually* about him. The message was not just your typical underdog story, but a story about unity, family, and humanity and that no matter who we are or what we look like, we're still all the same. Zac Efron (Bailey) did a great job as well and I was apprehensive, but it was simply amazing. New addition to my top 10 faves...just need to figure out which one to bump now!"

In fact it soon becomes apparent that, due to the sheer quality of the choreography in dance routines, the songs and the superb cinematography that this film is a contender for the title of best musical, even trumping La La Land in my opinion.
Everybody involved absolutely astonished me with their ability to sing, dance and entertain, just as P.T. Barnum himself would have done. 
In short, this is an absolute must-see family film. Rarely has a musical kept me so entertained! Bravo!"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","10 January 2018"," American Music Story
","""The Greatest Showman"" is a new 2017 movie and one of the most talked about musicals of the year. It runs for 105 minutes and was written by Oscar winner Bill Condon and Emmy winner Jenny Bicks. These two are probably more known than director Michael Gracey. The big star, however, here is lead actor Hugh Jackman playing the title character P.T. Barnum, a man with a poor background whose talent, tolerance and willpower turn him into one of the most creative artists from his generation. Next to him playing the women in his life, we got Oscar nominee Michelle Williams and Golden Globe nominee Rebecca Ferguson. And there's Zac Efron and Zendaya in it too getting their own love story for their characters and these are in it to attract young audiences for sure, but to make sure it's gonna be more than another High School Musical we got the likes of Jackman etc. Efron and Zendaya were okay I guess, I expected worse perhaps. But the huge star is Jackman. I think without him this would have been a pretty mediocre film at times, but he elevates the material by so much. Sure the film is still miles worse than Les Mis for example, but it's still a decent watch most of the time. We'll see if Jackman can get in at the Oscars once again and I sure hope so. He is by far the best musical blockbuster actor for lead characters we got. Also they made a really good job to close the age gap between him and Williams. This film won a Golden Globe recently, but I must say I am not too big on the winning song and that I preferred most others to be honest. But that's just subjective of course and I also don't know how many of the others were original. Still another huge success for the La La Land song composers to strike again.<br/><br/>Another weakness was the rushed-in jealousy / potential cheating story line that ended as quickly as it began and had zero significance overall really. And maybe to a lesser extent also the fire story. If he could expand globally, then he sure can rebuild his dream. Or the sudden loss of money near the end. But it is easy to overlook these flaws with how amazing most of the music was, especially the very first and last song. And the characters were also pretty interesting in this underdog story. They did not try to constantly include try-hard jokes (and the few funny references like the critic felt pretty smart), but let music and story speak for themselves which was a brilliant decision really. The actors are all good, also the lesser known ones. Nothing wrong about the visual side either, costumes, sets and makeup were all top-notch and I hope the recognition the film may possibly find at the Oscars in these areas can extend to Jackman getting in too. His P.T. Barnum is the heart and soul of a movie that I found inspiring to watch and that also creatively inspired me somehow while watching. And this really is the biggest compliment you can make a movie. Of course, I give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out."

I'm hoping it's nominated for Oscars, as it deserves to be. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Celebrates the birth of show business, and tells of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman) a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.<br/><br/>My screening was only half full for a dinner time showing, but what impressed me was the variety in the crowd! For the first time in years (in fact I'd probably have to go back to Dances With Wolves) have I seen that many OAP's in the cinema!! It really has appealed to people of all ages, as there were teenagers, couples and a Nanna and her granddaughter next to me and my son.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant, the songs were catchy and the dance routines were great. This is Me and Rewrite The Stars will probably be heard a lot on talent shows and Karaoke's across the world!! They were the stand out tracks for me. <br/><br/>I'm really hoping Jackman gets an Oscar nomination for a project he tried to get made for 7 years. I have to admit I'm warming to Zac Efron. I dismissed him as the guy from High School Musical with a six pack. Then I seen him on Graham Norton and he seemed like a really nice guy, and he was great here. Zendaya doing all her own stunts, sings, dances and trapeze's up a storm, one to one out for I think!! (She reminded me of Samantha Barks in Les Miserables) However of the supporting cast I was most impressed with Keale Settle who sings This Is Me!! What a voice. <br/><br/>I'm so glad I seen this on the big screen!! I urge everyone to do the same."

","The Greatest Showman managed to keep me entertained throughout its entirety easily. The music, story line and songs that are used to tell the story of P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), feel like they serve a great purpose in shaping the story, rather than feeling as if it is forced for the sake of having songs in a musical. Each song feels full of emotion and passion from the acting side. From 'A Million Dreams' being the opening song, showcasing the imagination of Barnum from a young age, to 'The Other Side' which uses the imagination and passion mentioned in 'A Million Dreams' to convince Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) to join Barnum's show. The soundtrack has been constantly playing on my phone as I truly believe that not only is this a movie, or an amazing soundtrack, but it truly is, a great show."

","8 January 2018<br/><br/>Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Greatest Showman. Wow, I can say from the outset I loved this film. Hugh Grant and Zac Ephron combine with many other talents to bring this all singing, all dancing, all judgemental, all emotional, all round entertaining film to the screen. This film tells the story of Phineous Taylor Barnum, the man who brought together a very special collection of people to enable him to bring his 'freak show' to the public. Shunned by society in life this group of people become a family and the circus becomes their home. However some so called normal members of society cannot accept this and they are challenged at every level, from the working man up to the rich and powerful. At the heart of this film is the story of a man trying to do the best for his family, the love he has for his wife and his children is what spurs him on and even when he makes bad judgement calls you know that he is always trying to do the right thing by them. There are some great song and dance scenes and the soundtrack is loud and catchy. The characters draw you into the film and the bright colours of the circus clash gloriously with the sometimes drab city around. If you don't like musicals then this film is not for you but if you love a good old theatrical performance with singing and dancing then this is definitely is one to see. I need to see it agin!!!!"

","Just got back from seeing this movie and it is based on a true story about PL Brahum(played by Hugh Jackman) who wants to make it big. He was neglected as a kid with his childhood sweethearts father who treated Brahum like trash since he started off as a tailor boy. Years later and Brahum is married to his childhood sweetheart (played by Michelle Williams) and has 2 daughters. At first Brahum decides to set up a wax museum but once that failed he decides to set up a circus and put up adverts for it. People call Brahum a fraud and calls his circus gang which includes a bearded lady,a 500 pound man,a wolf man all freaks. Will Brahum show people that they are all wrong and that he isn't worthless.<br/><br/>
This movie is clearly belonged to Hugh Jackman. I knew the man could sing and dance as he did theatre in the past like Beauty and the Beast,Oklahoma,The Boy From Oz etc and he was fantastic in this,Zac Efron from High School Musical fame plays Philip who becomes Jackman's buddy/helper for the circus and his charcther falls for a woman named Annie played by Shake It Up's Zendaya and certain people are racist because of it. The songs were great and the woman who played the bearded lady was a brilliant singer. <br/><br/>The visuals are stunning and everyone did a great job with this film. Definetly getting this on DVD when it comes out<br/><br/>
Bill Condon wrote the screenplay for this, having directed another Oscar Worthy flick Beauty and The Beast with Emma Watson and Dan Stevens and James Mangold(who directed Kate and Leopold, The Wolverine and Logan) acted as an executive producer for this.<br/><br/>

Firstly, Hugh Jackman's voice is a healing. He sings so beautiful and I think that he really fits the role. Also, I didn't expect Zac Efron to still sing so good but well, he did not disappoint me. The musical was fun to watch and I must say that I enjoyed it more the La La Land. I think that songs are so much better, more appealing and just more fun. I really liked that there weren't many useless scenes or plots. The movie was smooth and very nice to watch, I really recommend it."

","I tend to have a negative feeling in advance when it comes to film musicals. Very often, actors suddenly pretend to be a singer as well, and visual effects and there to hide the lack of talent for dancing and singing. This movie proves me wrong. Every scene, song and dance is perfectly executed. It is warm, full of great songs and the actors can actually sing. A great story and movie for the whole family. Everybody shed a small tear.. so critics, please leave your criticism at the door and let the great warm feeling come in!"

","I have to admit, when I first saw the critic's ratings on IMDB and rotten tomatoes, I was put back on watching this film. But what I also realize was the drastic difference between the users and critic's scores which prompted me to watch the film to judge it on my own and I'm glad it did.<br/><br/>The soundtracks in this film is truly amazing and is without a doubt the best musical I seen from Hollywood (in my opinion). And Hugh Jackman was simply astounding in this film. In fact, everyone in this film was truly amazing especially Keala Settle who is playing the 'Bearded Lady'. <br/><br/>The only real con that this film has was the way it was executed. From what I read from some of the critic's review, the most common criticism thrown was the lack of character development which yes it was true, there wasn't much. But it was because the film was done in way where the flow of the story was base on the soundtracks. Simply put, it's like a Broadway musical. Other criticism like people saying this isn't the actual story of P.T. Barnum or some critics diss the movie just because they don't like the real-life character P.T. Barnum is just idiotic.<br/><br/>To sum it up, go and watch the 'The Greatest Showman', you won't regret it. But watch it like a fun loose representation of P.T. Barnum story mad into a musical."

","I recently watched The Greatest Showman and it was very intriguing. The movies introduction got you hooked from the very beginning, it did not start like movies start normally these days. The movie also did not overwhelm you with songs, they were put in at appropriate times. The story moved along perfectly and it made you feel so immersed that it did not feel like 2 hours. The technical elements were great there were few parts you could tell it was CGI but it didn't take you away from everything else. This movie deserves a lot of praise. The Greatest Showman made you feel something and brought you to the finish line. It effectively had a balance with emotions and pacing.It met everything that it needed to achieve and you were not just watching clips thrown together you experienced a story. Lastly the acting was real, I was sold. They all did amazing and you loved all the secondary characters and the minor characters as much as the mains, they drove the story. I would strongly recommend seeing this movie."

Debutante director Michael Gracey has masterfully taken us through the roller-coaster ride, that was P.T. Barnum's life. The set pieces are mind blowing. The songs by Justin Paul & Benj Pasek are the highlight of the movie. The performances are another talking point of the film. The entire cast has sung flawlessly. Hugh Jackman is spectacular as P.T.

Zendaya is excellent as Anne Wheeler. The chemistry between Efron & Zendaya is electrifying. Rebecca Ferguson is awesome as Jenny Lind. Austyn Johnson & Cameron Seely are adorable as Caroline Barnum & Helen Barnum, respectively. Keala Settle is fantastic as Lettie Lutz. Sam Humphrey is great as Tom Thumb. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is good as W.D. Wheeler. The supporting cast is impressive. The Greatest Showman is a must watch for fans of musicals & Hugh Jackman.

Hugh Jackman must be the best screen if not stage performer currently alive though in this movie the likes of the cast members :
Keala Settle (Bearded Lady), Sam Humphrey (Tom Thumb) and Zendaya (trapeze and sizzling) have such charisma, they more or less steal the show.

"Hellmant","6","1","3","4 January 2018"," Entertaining musical, if you like musicals.
","'THE GREATEST SHOWMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A period musical about how P.T. Barnum started the Barnum and Bailey Circus. The movie stars Hugh Jackman as Barnum, and it costars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson. It was directed by debut feature filmmaker Michael Gracey, and it was scripted by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon (Condon is also well known for his writing on musicals like 'DREAMGIRLS', 'CHICAGO' and the 81st Annual Academy Awards). The film has performed modestly at the Box Office, and it's only gotten mixed to negative reviews from critics, but it was nominated for three major Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Actor - Comedy or Musical, and Best Original Song). I like how the movie deals with making outcasts into heroes (of course), but I always take offense to animal cruelty (like a circus is obviously guilty of). The film as a whole is a decently made musical, but nothing more. <br/><br/>The story revolves around the immensely ambitious entertainer, and showman, P.T. Barnum (Jackman), and how he convinced a bunch of outcasts to be a part of his show. Which famously became the first circus (later becoming the traveling 'Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus'). The movie of course deals with all of the hardships he faced, and opposition from society. It also deals with Barnum's romantic and family issues at the time. <br/><br/>The film is an entertaining musical, if you like musicals, and it's packed with colorful musical performances. Jackman, Efron, and others, are of course talented entertainers, and musical performers as well, so you can't argue that they weren't well cast in the movie. I also (of course) always find stories about making outcasts into heroes inspiring. The film doesn't introduce animals into the circus act, until the very end of the movie, but I (of course) have issues with that, and circuses in general too. The movie as a whole is decently made, and a mildly amusing musical."

","This movie has everything, from amazing music to amazing cinematography, you will not be disappointed. Often movies like this lack the substance of a good story, the story in this movie does not let you down, at times it does struggle and your mind starts to think of possibilities about which way the story could go. This was the best part as every guess I was making was completely wrong. This film not only keeps you guessing but actually drags you deep into the story and makes you feel the emotion of the characters. The camera work is amazing, it is very easy to lose yourself in the music and not look at what is actually happening on the screen. The acting matches the camera work, every actor is portrayed in the right shots and in a way which the director wants to express them as. Usually when you have so many stars in one film they steal the limelight away from each other, but the way this film was written made sure that didn't happen and was clearly focusing on the main storyline with only scenes that would help it move forward. While not stealing the limelight from other characters. Now to the soundtrack, these songs are absolute hits if not already they are destined to be. For Hugh Jackman, his voice just gets better and better, this was a movie that showed the world what he wants to do not what the people want him to do. Definitely a film I would see over and over again without getting sick of the music or the story. To all of those who made this film what it was should definitely consider doing a second one because on a low budget like this it could easily make a profit."

","I love music, so as this is a musical, I will begin here. I have seen comparisons to LA LA Land. Totally different films, but where they can be compared, the music in this film is no comparison. Simplistic, unoriginal and repetitive, it borrows from many already tired pop riffs. In terms of acting and the show, Jackman brings this to life. Williams and Efron also do a solid job. Although not a fan of her music, Zendaya brought energy and grace to her role. Yes there were very good, nigh excellent elements. But the drought of originality, not of the concept, but of the delivery, totally underwhelmed me. Also, although the script was not dry, it did lack mystique, as many of the events and interactions were reasonably foreseeable. That all said, aside from the music and the simple script, the better elements bring this show up to a level of entertainment worthy of not regretting the watch."

"ThomasDrufke","6","1","3","3 January 2018"," Never Enough
","Same lyricists as La La Land (one of my favorite films of all time)? Hugh Jackman going back to his musical roots? A musical surrounding around a circus with plenty of bombastic visuals and acts? Count me in. My interest in The Greatest Showman kept growing with every trailer and TV spot I saw. The final product is a crowd pleasing but ultimately disappointingly bland and cheesy musical loosely based on the infamous P.T. Barnum.<br/><br/>Let me start off by talking about the things I liked. The music is fantastic and nothing short of inspirational and surprisingly moving. Everything from the opening number which sees Barnum as a young boy imagining a ""Greatest Show"", to the jaw-dropping ballad ""Never Enough"", to the likely Oscar winner ""This is Me"", and to my favorite track ""A Million Dreams"". The music is undeniably catchy and exactly what a movie like this needs. In fact, I could have used the film to have more numbers and be closer to a traditional all-sung musical rather than a musical number every scenes. So even though I didn't care for the rest of the film, the numbers are worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film, which seems to be a lot of people's issue, is that every single problem that comes up gets solved within minutes. This film is all about struggle and coming from nothing to achieve your dreams. A universal and worthy theme in any type of movie, but it only works if you can experience the struggle along with the triumph. Unfortunately, the story is muddied with plenty of character struggles that create obstacles for the protagonists, but are merely brushed aside a few minutes later with a quick scene.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting just how cheesy this film is. I don't like using that term loosely, especially since I usually appreciate ""good cheesiness in films"". Heck there's plenty of musicals I've seen that have a charming cheese to them. But when a film has inconsequential struggles and contrived plot points, it's hard to get passed moments of pure unnecessary cheese. The film has grown on me a little bit since I saw it a few days back, with the soundtrack being the overwhelming reason for me rating this is as a positive review. If I could watch only the musical numbers and skip past every other scene, I think I would buy it on blu-ray. <br/><br/>6.0/10"

Barnum, the Ringmaster of Barnum's Circus, filled with extraordinary people with mesmerizing skills. <br/><br/>That Jackman could sing, we knew from Les Mis.

"CineMuseFilms","8","1","3","1 January 2018"," an original, vibrant, fast paced fantasy musical that raises the bar for the revival of this genre
","If you were impressed with the opening number of La La Land (2017) you will find the start of The Greatest Showman (2017) more electrifying, with high-voltage music charging the entire film. But be warned: some will reject it for not being the original Barnum or because Hugh Jackman is not Michael Crawford or because the film plays loose with history. Ignore the naysayers: if you give in to it as pure entertainment, Showman is an original, vibrant, fast paced fantasy musical that raises the bar for the revival of this genre.<br/><br/>In just two musical numbers, the poor boy, P.T. Barnum, meets the well-to-do love of his life Charity, and in a seamlessly compressed time capsule, they grow up, court, elope, start a family, and he sets up a theatre in New York. Barnum turns out to be a natural self-promoter and impresario. He gathers a cast of misfits and fringe-dwellers, including a bearded lady, a dwarf, a tattooed man, the world's fattest, tallest and strongest men; anyone who is different from society's definition of normal. Difference attracts hatred, and critics and protesters are part of Barnum's world, He strives for respectability by recruiting a prominent playwright and a world-class singer but suffers personal and financial setbacks that threaten the circus. Almost defeated by arson, he turns to the canvas tent and reinvents the modern-day circus. As each major scene segues into the next, it is carried forward with a musical number that weaves lyrics, rhythm, and melody to produce dramatic and emotional moments.<br/><br/>It is hard to not be swept away by the pace of action, spectacle, and colours of circus life. Far from the vaudeville-inspired Barnum circus music of yesteryear, Showman has the dramatic percussive beats, harmonies, and video-clip choreography of contemporary musicals that reach a new generation. The instantaneous grabbing power of ""The Greatest Show"", the punch-the-air assertiveness of ""This is Me"", the haunting melodies in ""Never Enough"", ""Million Dreams"", and ""From Now On"", together with six other high-energy numbers create a soundscape that takes you beyond visual realism and into the realm of fantasy. Like all musicals, character and plot are only scaffolds for creating the bigger extravaganza of timeless 'showbiz'. The film's ensemble of diversity, dance, and vocal talent is perfectly matched to its objective of making you tap your feet and leaving you wanting more.<br/><br/>More than any other film genre, the fantasy musical is best judged on its total entertainment effect. There are themes relating to the acceptance of social outliers, pride before the fall, and redemptive healing, but this is not a sermon nor is it a factual historical adaptation. If you need an overriding message, the film's theme song shouts unapologetic self-acceptance with ""no more hiding who I want to be...this is me"". Don't be distracted by the plasticity of personality and performance: that's part of all show business. Above all else, this film is fun, fast, and musically delightful. In today's world, we need more like this."

"pyrocitor","8","1","3","29 December 2017"," Death of a Salesman; Birth of a Show
","Cinema can have a cruel sense of dramatic irony. Only a few months after the Ringling Bros circus announced its final curtain call, due to waning ticket sales and those pesky animal rights activists, comes the release of The Greatest Showman - a loving, nostalgic movie musical tribute to its founder, that could well have rekindled affection, interest, and, crucially, ticket sales. The juxtaposition is poignant, as the film is, at once, a decidedly old-school musical love letter to big-hearted dreamers, but sprinkled with a healthy seasoning of behind-the-curtain artifice and capitalistic pragmatism to help it land in a more cynical contemporary market. Here is a worthwhile spiritual sequel and prequel at once for those wowed by 2016's La La Land: a comparable narrative hamster wheel of short-sighted crutches of cliché, bolstered by truly magical forays into spectacle spectacular. And are you not entertained? <br/><br/>Suffice to say, if The Greatest Showman stands the test of time, it will not be due to its plot. Barnum's 'Rags-To-Riches-but-AT-WHAT-COST' tale is so perilously over-familiar that it verges on the redundant, and you can practically hear director Michael Gracey keeping his eye on his watch through each perfunctory story beat, awaiting the chance for his next musical interlude. Equally uneasy is Gracey's treatment of his titular showman. On the whole, it's a fairly rosy-cheeked take on Barnum, playing up the 'bringing joy and wonder to the hearts of the masses' angle of a characterization that would otherwise be, in essence, 'Capitalism: A Love Story.' A more intriguing take could have inverted the focus, making our put-upon circus performers the central protagonists, and Barnum a more enigmatic Gatsby or Wizard of Oz figure, charismatically sweet-talking them into the conflicted stardom of being his mawkish show ponies. It's poignantly fitting to keep Barnum the face and star of his venture, but it does make his film somewhat lopsided and unnecessarily clichéd. <br/><br/>Yes, circuses are nostalgically magical but now ethically uncertain terrain, perhaps explaining the film's desperate, somewhat inorganic fumbling for thematic urgency and redemption. Earnest pretentions at 'be yourself and be proud' empowerment, 
painting the circus as a refuge for and celebration of the otherwise ostracized (insert discrimination/diversity/racism subplot and requisite torch-brandishing mob here) never fully land, while spending most of its energies asking us to root for Barnum, who cheerfully exploits his unconventional stars for money and social status. Barnum's initial crass pitch of ""They're gonna laugh anyway, kid - may as well get paid for it,"" before launching into his silver-tongued empowering spiel, is about as close to the grimy, hard line truth as the film ever gets. Still, if you hold back tears during the scene-stealing Keala Settle's bombastic showstopper, 'This Is Me' centrepiece number, you're made of sterner stuff than me. <br/><br/>Thematically, the film is more interesting when flirting with unpacking the schism and values of high/low culture and entertainment/cultural value that Barnum becomes obsessed with - even if Gracey resorts to the tired cliché of the most abominable movie critic since Birdman to espouse armchair cultural philosophy. It's tempting to take the bait and extrapolate to a meta-commentary of the film as a whole (if it's significant for one person, regardless of crass intentions, it has value), though still a shame, in the post-Hamilton era of ethically nuanced musical protagonists, that the film balks at digging deeper into Barnum's seedier real-life marketing practices in the name of making a quick buck. <br/><br/>But, just like the real circus, it's probably best not to peek behind the curtain for optimum enjoyment, as Gracey's flair for eye-popping cinematic razzle-dazzle is easily worth the price of admission. Anchored on a backbone of exceptional, almost obnoxiously catchy song numbers by La La Land/Dear Evan Hansen's Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the film's neo-nostalgia pop flashiness feels far more organic and earned than Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby. Replete with exceptionally vibrant costumes, lighting, flooringly immaculate choreography (many dances - particularly a stomping, shot-taking barroom face-off between Jackman and Efron - genuinely do feel unlike anything we've ever seen), and hummingbird cinematography, perennially whizzing between and around the highs and lows of the big top, perfectly encapsulate the dizzying, cotton-candy high of a circus extravaganza. There are times when the kaleidoscope of colours, movement, and CGI verge on overstimulating, but it's fairly apropos for a film about the notoriously hyperbolic Barnum similarly stuffed with spectacle embellishments around every corner. <br/><br/>But, if nothing else, the film finds wings solely as a vehicle to showcase the cinematically untapped musical prowess of Hugh Jackman. Brimming with a jubilant, airy charisma, lighting-quick dance moves, a commanding belt, and a devilish twinkle in his eye, Jackman has never been so explosively, infectiously fun as he is showing off here. Zac Efron similarly impresses with airtight song and dance prowess, even if his (fictitious composite) straight man voice of reason character feels somewhat superfluous to the plot. Michelle Williams, similarly, is a joy to watch, but a tragic case of a phenomenal performance and voice utterly squandered in one of the most inexcusably under-written 'I Am Wife' plot devices pitfalls in years. Thankfully, Zendaya is slyly, impishly likeable as a precocious trapeze artist, while also anchoring a racism-fraught romantic subplot with applaudable gravitas. <br/><br/>It's actually refreshing to have a film so holistically at peace with its ethical dichotomies - yes, it's fairly artificial, junky, exploitative, and fundamentally commercially-minded. But, gosh darn it, are you not entertained, at all costs? Ultimately, it may not be everything you ever want and need, but it's an intrinsically harmless, stupendously fun ride, and so far from the belly-flop off a trapeze that could have been. If nothing else, the film lays a strong foundation for an inevitable run of Broadway revivals - one of which, assuredly, will work closer towards fully requiting the lofty promises of the film's title. <br/><br/>

Cheer up critics no doubt 2018 will be fully of boring bios of historical figures to bring a smile to your sour faces."
"mailes22","10","1","3","29 December 2017"," Best musical since Les Miserables
","The surprising thing with The Greatest Showman is the music. Set in the 1800s, the music and choreography are distinctly modern but somehow it all just works. The acting is excellent, the story moves along without ever dragging but the star of the show is the music, right from the opening song.<br/><br/>My favourite number is the Zac Efron / Zendaya number on the trapeze ropes. The song is lovely, but the choreography is spectacular. Slightly reminiscent of the Billy Elliot The Musical stage production number with 'young Billy' on the trapeze rope dancing with 'adult Billy'. My only slight criticism of the Zac Efron / Zendaya number is that it is really heavily edited with rapid cuts after every single move on the ropes. But overall it was still the highlight for me.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with someone who generally doesn't like musicals, but we both came out humming the songs and we both really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>This movie is 1000 times better than LaLa Land."
"abrown-28617","8","1","3","29 December 2017"," Spoiler free review
","Overall the quality of the movie was great, the actors preform well and the plot is thin but well developed for the time of the movie. There are two places were the movie slacked in quality. First, some of the auto tuned voices loose their true color and warmth. And secondly, in some of the circus scenes it is very obvious that there are modern moving head lights in the shot. Rather than CGI'ing over them to make them look like old fashion spot lights or just leaving them out of the shot, they are left in the 1800's with no electricity. When watching this movie watch it as a fictional piece the shares a lesson not a historical biography."

","Face it, the La La Land comparisons will be made. Well, this is La La Land without the disappointment factor. A new age musical in the Broadway show style ( I can see this moving to stage at the drop of a ringmasters hat!) We attended The Greatest Showman last evening and loved every minute. As was stated here else where, from the toe tapping opening, through the story of loss, love and redemption all the way to the uplifting ending this is entertainment as old as the circus and as new as the 21st Century. This is a movie for the whole family with stories at many levels for different age groups. And with music to remember."
"stevendbeard","7","1","3","26 December 2017"," Catchy Tunes
","I saw ""The Greatest Showman"", starring Hugh Jackman-Eddie the Eagle, Deception; Michelle Williams-Manchester By the Sea, Deception; Zac Efron-Baywatch_2017, Charlie St. Cloud and Zendaya-Spider_Man:Homecoming, Shake It Up_tv.
This is a musical that is based on the life of P.T. Barnum. Hugh plays Mr Barnum, the man that invented show business. He started from nothing and using his ingenuity, ended up with the world's most famous circus. Michelle plays his wife, whose parents did have money but she didn't care about any of that. She just loved Hugh, no matter how much money he had. Ah, romance. Hugh starts out with a museum that he soon developed into his more popular circus venue that would showcase all types of people and animals, from a bearded lady to elephants, and was non-discriminatory-he didn't care what they looked like, as long as they brought in the crowds and made him money. Zendaya was one of Hugh's performers-she was a trapeze artist-and Zac was his business partner, who also just happens to like trapeze artists. The songs are written by the same songwriters as 'La La Land' so they are some mighty catchy tunes. It just takes me some getting used to, when people break into song all the time instead of just talking. And I know that there is an audience for this type of movie but I'm not a big musical fan-there are very few musicals that I did like-but if you are a fan, you will probably like this one more than I did.
It's rated ""PG"" for thematic elements and a brawl and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-I mentioned that I'm not a big musical fan-but it would be a good rental."
"cska91","4","2","10","17 January 2018"," What's with all the drinking?
","I thought this was supposed to be a family movie. And I know that I am not the only one because the theater was packed with kids when we went to see this shallow spectacle. So why is drinking featured so prominently in this film that it could have easily been a platform for a Johnny Walker or a Budweiser commercial? <br/><br/>First, there is a scene, where Hugh Jackman's character (P.T. Barnum) finds Zac Efron's character (Phillip) at the bar. Barnum is trying to convince Phillip to join his show and a musical number ensues, which features Jackman and Efron singing, dancing and... pounding shots like there's no tomorrow.<br/><br/>Later in the movie, there is a scene, where Barnum is at the bar by himself sulking or reflecting and the circus performers find him there. Another musical number ensues, where Barnum realizes what's important to him and becomes inspired to be a good guy again. This leads to a celebration. Suddenly, beer is flowing from the tap like a river. Barnum runs out, but the performers proceed to get shitfaced and pass out.<br/><br/>Both scenes go for quite some time. As I watched them incredulously, I kept thinking to myself what was the message and why. Why was it necessary to portray careless consumption of alcohol as fun and gratifying? The answer I came up with is that it's just another example of how shallow and thoughtless this movie really is. It is a celebration of style over substance, of perception over reality, of deceit over integrity. It is a soulless festival of plastic morals, papier-mache values, one-dimensional characters, and a cliche story line, which at time crumbles the limits of suspended reality (e.g. Phillip has connections that get him and Barnum an audience with the Queen of England?). It's sugar water that is peddled as healthy and good. It confuses people into thinking that imagination is synonymous with graft. <br/><br/>Certainly, plenty of folks will love it and allow themselves to be willfully deluded into thinking that Barnum was an equal rights crusader and an all-around good guy, and not a huckster and profiteer, who succeeded at exploiting people's insecurities and ignorance. But this is not a movie I would ever want my children to see. I would never want them to think that fraud is ingenuity, as this movie portrays when Barnum puts up sunken vessels that don't belong to him as collateral for his first bank loan. <br/><br/>I would never want them to think that being greedy, cunning and unfair is good business, as this movie portrays when Barnum offers Phillip just 8% of the show, even though he badly needs Phillip to join the circus, to give it some badly needed critical acclaim and acceptance as more than just a sideshow. <br/><br/>It's easy to get caught up in all the glitz and glamour of this bright and loud film, and miss the simple fact that its message is often repugnant and it has the cinematic value of a Super Bowl half-time show. <br/><br/>I gave it four stars because it still has some good actors, who give good performances under the circumstances. Why they took these roles I am not sure."

The beat and musics are great and better than that the dance and the show! Just amazing! Loved the show and I would rate it 8-9! That's what it deserves. 
Sadly, I rated it 7. At the beginning it was going really perfect in the regards that it wasn't using, i.e. promoting the use of animals, in circus. I imagined what a great show that not a great movie let alone but also showing us that shows and circus can be great and even greater with humans only! Horses and dogs are ok cause they can adapt without being tortured. So until the last show loved it till I saw the elephants and lions in the last ""greatest"" show. This promotes the using of wild animals in a circus and this is really bad! We can't imagine the suffer of those poor animals!

The film itself is strictly ok, a bit too fast paced in places so we don't get to see much character development, the plot is standard and entirely predictable. A bit lacklustre.

","The intro feels too strong. Eleven minutes are used to create a background on which to build the story onto. And WOW! how perfect is it? Everything is just magical and so brilliant. It had me feeling that the rest of the film must be a let down. How could it not? You cannot keep up that pace and tell a solid story. In a way, the rest is indeed sub-par. But only to the intro. Although some characters are weak and seem to be in it to make the film more accurate, the rest is simply sparkling. This film is based on real people and events, but it is safer to regard it as fantasy. Which is fine, as I do not think I would enjoy an accurate musical-version much. And in that sense, it is accurate. Because it uses 'tricks' in order to make the show better. Just like P.T. Barnum did. And the result is similar: Real emotions. I *had* to watch it again the next day, and it stayed strong. Hence this review."
"davideo-2","9","1","4","27 May 2018"," Interesting, invigorating feast of colour and action
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In the 1800s, P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), an orphaned, penniless boy from a poor background, marries Charity (Michelle Williams), the daughter of his wealthy foster parents, and travels to the city to start a new life with her. Unable to settle into a boring, humdrum life, Barnum envisions creating the world's first circus, in the shape of a 'freak show', gathering together a group of social outcasts, and getting respected writer Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) to help him, until success starts to go to his head...<br/><br/>The musical is a cinematic art form that is enjoyed much more rarely these days, which makes it all the more special when one does roll around. Usually at times like Christmas, such was the case with The Greatest Showman. Director Michael Gracey, making his feature length debut, has chosen an inspiring choice in the shape of Barnum, whose story of bringing a colourful carnival to life certainly provides a lot of potential for rousing musical numbers and colourful dance sequences. But what really seems to be behind this number, made in modern times, is a message of acceptance, with a nod to the LGBTQ movement, in the shape of the bearded woman being part of the story.<br/><br/>It's interesting, given the film's rousing central tune and tone in general, that the central character promotes them in such a politically incorrect way, billing them as a freak show, certainly something that wouldn't be accepted in modern times. But it's the portrayal of Barnum and his attitude to his subjects in general that's the most surprising, being far more motivated for the fame and fortune they can bring him, rather than their feelings or dignity, even side lining his own family as his ego grows bigger. But Jackman still manages to portray him with the nice guy edge that makes most of his roles so personal.<br/><br/>It's a rare musical, and a musical for modern times, and as such is still a nice, pleasant piece of work the whole family can get some nice enjoyment from. ****"

The story was pretty common which you see in any other movie of getting up from bottom but the way they presented was awesome. I would really suggest everyone to watch it and honestly it's far better than La La Land."
"jeffrudd31","9","1","4","23 March 2018"," It is what it supposed to be about - entertainment.
","I have seen a number or reviews that argument over technical points, themes, subplots and pace - besides insulting the music also for extra measure. That's their opinion and they are entitled to give it. Here's mine...<br/><br/>First of all, everyone individually and collectively are great. They all play their parts well. Sub-plots of race, discrimination, family by blood or friendship in the face of adversity and more, are all brought to the screen without laying it on too thick. <br/><br/>In the end, the film centers (like a circus ring) around P.T. Barnum. His aim was to bring entertainment to the masses and also make them switch off from other things if only for a while and also make people smile. In short, entertain them indeed. This is what the film does. It sets out to entertain people about a man that sought to entertain.<br/><br/>Stuff the critics and begrudgers that just don't get this as they try to bit by picky bit, pick the film technical apart. The irony of all ironies - I saw one review that criticised the film because part of it was fictionalised. Did the critics not kop that Barnum originally did this in order to entertain? Clearly that went over the critics heads too! They are so busy looking at the individual parts that they don't see the the whole as a total sum and how the film is also meant to be viewed. It's their loss. For the rest of the world that has 'got it', they have enjoyed the film. Me too. <br/><br/>I started to watch it as there was nothing else to view (I am being honest) and the next thing I know, the film was over. Ten minutes in, the film had me. I loved the music, the showmanship of all - and every part of the film in every aspect. You know you have liked something when you seriously don't notice time passing by. You were simply too busy having fun to notice - as I was having. I liked the soundtrack, the acting, the pace, the sub-plots, etc - the lot.<br/><br/>The film sets out to entertain the world about a man that set out to entertain. What more do critics want for gods sake! Stuff them and join the masses in watching this film for yourself. The many public reviews speak volumes as to how good or bad this show is. It may not be liked by a minority - fair enough - but judging by the masses that have taken time to comment the world over, the likes of this movie far, far out weigh the dislikes. Start watching however and discover how you feel about an entertaining film about entertainment. I suspect you might not regret it!"

","I just left the movie and returned home. I'm really uncertain what to think about it. The critics seem to dislike it, the IMDB users to love. AND I would love, if I could say that its a masterpiece, but it's definitely not. So let's start with the good things:<br/><br/><ul><li>The music was incredible, it blew me away. (I am listening to it while writing)</li><li>Choreography was stunning. Top!</li><li>Actors were great, especially Zendaya. (It's hard not to fall in love with her and her smile)</li><li>Atmosphere was great, romantic and magical.</li></ul><br/><br/>But sadly there was bad stuff too:<br/><br/><ul><li>The plot was just bad. Very poorly written. The ""down-moments"" were too clichéd, too forced and too predictable. They really destroyed the flow of the movie and I felt really annoyed by it. The Opera singer sub-plot was completely unnecessary and out of place. It was too forced and had a really bad conclusion (honestly there was none). Would make no difference, if it had been cut out. </li><li>I know that it's a circus for curiosities, but please don't cast this ""woman"" ever again. I don't think everyone has to be beautiful, but this woman (everyone who saw the movie definitely knows which one) just disgusted me. I know these are hard words and not very political correct, but I just felt that way. To my dissapointment she has a pretty long screentime too. I know that this is not a ""professional"" criticism. </li><li>CGI was pretty bad too. Not a big deal though.</li></ul><br/><br/>In conclusion the movie was good, but sadly not better. There were just too many problems with the plot, but it succeeded music- and atmosphere-wise. Go and watch it! Don't hesitate, build your own opinions ;)"

","Searching for entertainment that makes you feel happy, and inspired? It makes you feel wonder like a child, it touches the heart of parents and brings the beauty of life to rembrance for the cynical. The world's negativity is difficult to face every day. I could feel the intent of the makers of this film- it was to entertain, just as Barnum sought to do. It was to bring joy to the viewers. Do you see now the message of this movie? It is to echo the original intent of show business. To provide a respite from the world. They did a wonderful job. As an artist, when I create something from my heart, it turns out so much more beautiful than when it is just from my head. I don't know how it works, but beauty comes from love. This movie was made with love. I believe that the makers of this movie wanted to help in their own small (or huge) way to brighten the world. Do yourself a favor and go enjoy this sweet gift."

",""" . . . and we don't pick up peanut shells,"" sings the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL guy to P.T. Barnum about 40 minutes into THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, the Fox Fake Musical Division's examination of American Class Warfare. But as Mr. Barnum most famously said (and as the residents of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania now are learning too well), ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Many movies have focused upon so-called ""Freaks versus Geeks"" conflicts in modern U.S. high schools (as frequently explored by Zac Efron--aka, the Greatest Showman, Jr., here--in the aforementioned TV series). However, GREATEST SHOWMAN explicates explosive epic battles between freaks and GREEKS more than 100 years ago (if you define fraternity brother types building their mansions to resemble Greek Temples filled with fake Greek sculptures as being ""Greek""). As they still do Today, these Monied Frat Boys use the news media that they own and control to rile up We ""the masses"" by inventing Sex Police and other bogus, quasi-religious ""social issues"" to seduce some of Barnum's fellow ""Riff Raff"" into torching his theater. To quote P.T. again, ""Suckers!"""
"SHunterSmith-ProudAmeric","10","1","4","2 January 2018"," A Message All Should Hear
","Full disclosure, I worked for Ringling...Circus for five weeks many years ago and have had a lifelong appreciation for the circus and all the stories behind the curtain. Currently, I am writing my life story (Bullied nearly To Death; Loving MY Life) about being bullied and the subsequent suicide attempts I tried due to the bullying.
I was amazed at how well ""The Greatest Showman"" depicted P. T. Barnum as a man who saw and embraced ""unusual"" people who were ridiculed, insulted and shamed for who they are. We are all different in so many ways, but we are also still the same in some ways. In the film, the bullies are the hoodlums and protesters, but they are also the snobby people who believe they know what is best in society. In the end, the bullies have the last laugh, and many others laugh along with them (not at them) for many generations after P. T. Barnum created his masterpiece.
It is a pleasure to speak at Anti-Bullying and Bullying Awareness meetings and events to explain my story and to educate others in how to stop bullying. ""The Greatest Showman"" is a great example of how to overcome bullies. I tip my hat to all who worked on this wonderful musical Thank you all!"

"hockeyholl","6","1","4","1 January 2018"," True to P.T. Barnum as it is All One Large, Entertaining Lie
","The Greatest Showman is true to P.T. Barnum as it is all one large, entertaining lie. While it is inspired by Barnum's life, the movie plays so heavily on fictionalizing who Barnum was that in the end, the movie is far more fiction than it is a representation of reality and I am curious as to why the studio did not choose to make this movie be based entirely around a fictitious person.
Hugh Jackman shines in his performance as Barnum, dazzling in his charisma and endlessly appealing as he sings and dances through well-constructed pop songs. Jackman is a nice casting choice as he is Barnum's polar opposite. Barnum was an ugly person, physically unattractive and morally repugnant. Jackman is quite the opposite. This movie is worth seeing solely for Jackman's performance.
But aside from Jackman, there remains no compelling reason to have the story centred on Barnum, particularly centred on Barnum as a hero. This movie shows some of Barnum's flaws and self-centred nature, but overlooks the majority of his flaws, such as his racism and his cruelty. The Greatest Show had a long history of abusing the people and animals in its employ, eventually leading to its closure in May after the protests towards the treatment of the animals overwhelmed them. This movie conveniently glosses over the fact that Barnum and the Greatest Show was built and run on cruelty and manipulation. 
Additionally, for a movie about spectacle and awe, The Greatest Showman lacks any of the marvel that the Greatest Show was known for. The scenes inside the circus (aside from Zendaya's Anne Wheeler and Zac Effron's Phillip Carlyle's number ""Rewrite the Stars"") were solely song and dance pieces, lacking flare. The closest the film came to recreating the Greatest Show was in its last number, which was far too short and had clear technical manipulation. Overall, the film fell victim to revealing that it was, indeed, a movie far too many times. If Barnum and the Greatest Show dealt in lies and deceit in order to produce spectacle, this movie dropped realism to create visually interesting action. Laundry sheets all turned to the sky in an early number with Charity Barnum (Michelle Williams) and Barnum, reminding the audience that the film is a crafted, manipulated performance put on for them, something the Greatest Show would never have allowed for.
With the number of fictionalized aspects of this film, it is a wonder they made the film about Barnum at all. One of the most compelling story lines revolved around Anne and Phillip falling in love and trying to be together in a racist world where their social status was keeping them apart. Both of these characters are not based on real people and were completely created for this story, so why not have the whole film focus around other crafted characters? If Barnum was a necessity, why not focus on the issues Anne and Phillip faced inside the circus with a racist huckster for a ringmaster?
As many critics have rightfully pointed out, this movie leaves out much of what would have made a P.T. Barnum musical interesting, which is the fact that P.T. Barnum was a liar, a huckster, and a showman. He did strange and bizarre things in order to draw an audience, and the closest this movie comes to exploring it is when Barnum takes a loan from the bank using boats that had sunk to the bottom of the sea.
This movies biggest failing is wasted potential and choosing to go a cliched route of underdog who triumphs rather than exploring the multiple different routes of more unique and interesting storytelling.
It is a fun film with good performances and catchy music, but it loses much to wasted potential."
"lcspeigner","10","1","4","31 December 2017"," Don't listen to the stupid critics!!! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
","It almost never fails...if the critics are slamming a movie, it's probably going to be one of my favorites and this is no exception.""The Greatest Showman"" is fun, upbeat, joyful, exciting, and satisfying! I couldn't care less if it doesn't follow the real story, or that it's ""unrealistic"", or doesn't have some deep message. BIG DEAL!! Right now, life in America is just bad news after bad news after bad news. The movie is a happy distraction that made me tap me feet, laugh, smile, and just feel good for two hours. It was fanciful and happy, with a family that loved each other and followed their dreams...AND I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!!! The music was wonderful, the dancing was amazing, and it made me want to cheer at the end. For those who are comparing it to ""La La Land""...just don't. That CRAP was horrible! (I almost didn't go see this because I hated ""La La Land"" so much...but the critics LOVED that long, boring, stupid, crappy, flaccid drivel!) Yes, The Greatest Showman is fantastic, and bold, and breathtaking, and rather unrealistic, but that's what makes it so magical! I don't go to the movies for reality, I go for the exact opposite reason...to escape from reality for just a little while...and this movie does that just wonderfully! I've already seen it twice and plan to go several more times. It MUST be experienced on the big screen though, so don't wait for it to come out on DVD to see it for the first time. I just hope it becomes one of those interactive movies similar to ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" because I would TOTALLY go, and I am an over 50, black woman who has never even seen the Rocky Horror movie. Haha! Ignore the critics and just GO!!"

It was recommended to watch it on the big screen, and I wholeheartedly agree!<br/><br/>But beyond it being entertaining, and a Great Show - so befitting of the movie title - it is an utter inspiration to the human spirit. I know it is from my own life's experience that I should feel this, but everyone with the capacity for empathy, or who has ever had doubts in their life, I feel, would be moved by this.<br/><br/>From the opening song and visual magic, I already felt something in my soul/heart/being. I didn't ever expect it to build up continually through the entire movie. The pacing and transition to different scenes were smooth and intriguing. They connected them with true storytelling genius and creativity. The filming/compositions/camera work was beautiful!<br/><br/>I knew I had to get the soundtrack to this. I searched for the nearest stores, but they didn't have it. I didn't mind trekking to a store farther away from home, because I knew I had to feel at home in my heart, again. Haha. Yes, that line was cheesy, but still.... haha. You get the emotion.<br/><br/>Watch it in theatres! I'm going to watch it again! I'm going to have to clap this time around. ;) Allow your heart be moved to action(!).<br/><br/>Enjoy the show, ladies and gentleman.

","Amidst an absolutely glorious soundtrack is displayed exceptional acting, character development and timeless themes. In a world where so many movie show character with conflicting morals and questionable ethics The Greatest Showman showcases a man driven by acceptance of others and equality. /While it may not be shouted out or even evident to more technically-focused critics this movie provides a heartwarming story of friendship, equality, and following your dreams. Jackman's character loses this to a degree for a part of this movie and the sadness of this is only triumphed by the power that the ending and his internal realizations present. This movie presents powerful yet not extravagant or controversial themes of equality. This movie fulfills the same purpose that Jackman's character is attempting to fill with his audience. It leaves the viewer happy and more than that, inspired. One of my favorite movies."
"junyhaha","10","1","4","31 December 2017"," Closing 2017 with a bang!
","To be honest, I have no idea why Lala Land was rated so high, it's your average love story with your average songs, I switched off within 40mins, it's pretty monotone if you ask me. The Greatest Showman is so much better than Lala Land! Both I found had common and similar storylines however; both are about a man struggling with success and turmoil about love. Atleast for The Greatest Showman it got me hooked from the start and never let me go. It's kinda hard not to, the opening is just as spectacular as the end. Although the composing team is the same as La La Land, the soundtrack in this movie is so much more thrilling, exciting, enchanting, inspirational and will give you goosebumps all over. The acting of-course is perfect, I got shivers when Barnum (Hugh Jackman) was staring at Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) when she was singing 'Never Enough' in awe, and at that moment I wanted to cry with him. Not to mention the A - class set, the vibrant colours of the circus posters and tent contrasting with the bland boringness of the town. Some people question the reality of this movie. Of the idea of even though you're ridiculed and ignored, it's okay and of a white man helping the black and holding up a freak show. Despite all this, the topic is essentially ""This is me"", embracing yourself and being confident of who you are, you have to view the movie in 21st century context. It's a film with good morals and intentions. It deserves more praise and love."

"cschultz-2","10","1","4","30 December 2017"," Superb Family Entertainment
","Like Johnny Appleseed, Annie Oakley, and possibly Harry Houdini, P.T. Barnum has become less a figure of history than a giant of American popular folklore. And since Barnum himself never pretended to possess more than a passing relationship with the truth, it's richly appropriate that ""The Greatest Showman,"" the new movie which uses as its foundation the life of the father of the circus, does not even bother to use the usual opening gambit, ""based on a true story."" Because it rarely is.<br/><br/>Instead, before the opening credits even hit the screen the movie throws the audience by the seat of its pants into the most foot-stomping, pulse-pounding, show-stopping entertainment since the circus came to town. The picture grabs the viewer by his nose and doesn't let go from the first frame of film until the last. And after the show is over, the viewer leaves with a song in his heart, a smile on his face, a spring in his step, and a tear in his eye. <br/><br/>""The Greatest Showman"" follows the tried-and-true formula of Horatio Alger and dozens of motion pictures biographies, from ""Rhapsody in Blue"" to ""Night and Day"" to ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"": Through hard work and dedication, the hero rises from poverty to the pinnacle of success, falters for a moment, and then through faith and love achieves an even more lofty and soul-satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>But ""The Greatest Showman"" continues the hallowed entertainment tradition to the beat of a percussive and pounding drum-driven hip-hop tempo of street music, accompanied by the most jaw-dropping breakdance moves you'll ever see in an ensemble performance. <br/><br/>During the opening scene the world explodes into a panorama of vivid colors embracing in its entirety the world of the circus-flying acrobats, prancing horses, fire-breathers, elephants, and clowns. When the song ends, it's all you can do to stop yourself from jumping to your feet to applaud. And then the movie tops itself, over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Anyone who's seen Hugh Jackman appearing on an interview show-and he's doing a lot of them in support of this movie-knows that his signature role as the caustic and violent Wolverine in eight ""X-Men"" movies are the real stretch for the actor. <br/><br/>The very definition of the term ""amiable bloke,"" the Australian Jackman at heart is a song-and-dance man. And in ""The Greatest Showman"" Jackman proves it-the actor whirls, jumps, kicks, cakewalks, and struts with such loose-limbed dexterity that he often seems immune to laws of gravity. <br/><br/>Matching Jackman almost step-by-step, scene-by-scene, and note-by-note are a talented array of supporting performers, including Zac Efron as a highbrow New York playwright persuaded by Barnum to join the circus as a means of broadening the show's appeal, and the platinum-selling pop star Zendaya as the trapeze artist Efron falls for. One highlight among many in the picture is the ballad ""Rewrite the Stars,"" performed by Zendaya and Efron in a sort of aerial ballet courting ritual under the big top.<br/><br/>Likewise, the exotic Keala Settle, playing the bearded lady among the uniquely-gifted and physically distinctive show people recruited by Barnum to star in his ""Greatest Show,"" provides much of the heart and soul of the movie. Settle's performance of ""This is Me"" adds real spirit to an anthem for the heartbreaking loneliness of individuality, and the empowerment found in accepting yourself as you are.<br/><br/>The gifted Michelle Williams is as adorable as usual as Barnum's patient wife, Charity, and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson adds European flavor as opera star Jenny Lind, persuaded by impresario Barnum to undertake a series of US concerts under his tutelage in a bid to gain acceptance among the more rarefied echelons of society.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, ""The Greatest Showman"" is receiving mixed reviews from some of the country's more influential critics. Some are turning up their collective noses at the movie's ""soupy soulfulness"" and shallow, populist aspirations. <br/><br/>But the picture in its depiction of the contentious ""friendly enemy"" relationship between Barnum and newspaper critic James Gordon Bennett seems to anticipate the unflattering reviews. When Barnum is confronted with the challenge that everything connected with his show is ""fake,"" Barnum points to the circus' audience and smilingly replies, ""Those smiles seem real enough."" And you know what? He's right.<br/><br/>Written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and guided to the screen by first-time director Michael Gracey, ""The Greatest Showman"" steps up to the plate and bats a grand slam home run in just about every single department. And with a dozen or so rousing, showstopping songs courtesy of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the Academy Award-winning lyricists from last year's ""La La Land,"" the viewer might even want to stop on the way home after the movie to pick up a copy of the soundtrack album. <br/><br/>""The Greatest Showman"" is superb motion picture entertainment in the tradition of the great Hollywood musicals, and as close as we're likely to get to a Broadway experience simulated in a movie auditorium. There's real movie magic at work here: This is one picture packed with an ingredient rarely found in films these days-it's spelled J-O-Y, and it has a big exclamation point at the end. <br/><br/>There's a lot of competition out there for your family entertainment dollar during this holiday season. If you can only see one movie this month, ""The Greatest Showman"" is the choice you want to make. Any movie which depicts a father riding to his daughter's musical recital on a dancing elephant is doing something awfully right. <br/><br/>The highest praise-P.T. Barnum would love this picture. And so will you."
"mrdgal04","7","1","4","30 December 2017"," Soundtrack=AMAZING Movie itself=Good overall
","Just go and enjoy it. Don't think too much about it. This movie is ""inspired by"" the life of P.T. Barnum, it is not based on his life so there are liberties taken to dramatize the movie a bit. There are scene transitions that can easily be transitioned on to stage very easily with a simple sharing of a wall and choreography done. The story is focused on Hugh Jackman's character 90% of the time. 10% is given to Zac Efron and Zendaya. I was a bit skeptical at the previous actor's I mentioned duet but seeing it and hearing it in the movie makes complete sense, plus remember this takes place before the Civil War in America. I enjoyed it and was excited for it but my expectations were a bit too high so the movie didn't exceed them except when it came to the soundtrack which is beautiful no matter what. I really hope this becomes a stage production, its too good and too easy to not be on stage."

","I can't understand how La La land got the great reviews it did. It was very luke warm, hopeless music and the actors were very mediocre with only Emma Stone holding the film together. When I heard that some of the writers from La La land were involved in this I almost didn't go and the critics didn't give it a very good rap either - just goes to show how wrong they can be.. This was a great musical. The music and dancing were actually enjoyable, there were no weak performances in this show and it is definitely a must to see. I am so glad I wasn't put off. I took my mum to see it and she loved it too. It is a real pity that it is not going to rate come Oscar time."
"Stasker6","10","1","4","30 December 2017"," Best Musical Movie I Have Ever Seen
","I'm a fan of musical and dance movies. Grew up watching all the High School Musical movies, Step Up, Stomp the Yard, and the list goes on. Almost didn't watch this due to some of the bad reviews this movie scored but glad I went with my gut feeling. I actually went to see this movie twice and have even more appreciation for it after the second viewing.<br/><br/>While Hugh plays P.T. Barnum, he isn't exactly like him. If anything the name is more of a vessel. I think it would be very hard to make a musical and do everything the real Barnum did.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is amazing. All original songs and they have a nice modern take to them. I've downloaded the whole album on my phone and listen to the music on long drives.<br/><br/>Cast is perfect. Zach Efron is amazing in this. Hugh of course steals the show and does it perfectly. You can see and feel how much emotion he put into this.<br/><br/>I can't wait for this to release on Blu-Ray and plan on watching all the behind the scenes and extras too. If you're on the fence due to other critics or want to see a film that makes you feel happy, please go see The Greatest Showman."
"twai-13645","10","1","4","30 December 2017"," One clever and enjoyable movie with Life imitating Art!
","Loved this movie! It's got me really thinking about how clever this movie is; that in spite of all the criticism it's received; the life of Barnum, as portrayed by Hugh Jackman, faced the same criticism by James Gordon Bennett, the editor of the New York Herald at the time about the way he promoted his acts to bring the crowds in. And after they came and saw the show, they all left with a smile. <br/><br/>I'm wondering if the early criticism by the likes of Rotten Tomatoes was in part by design and all the new positive feedback from the audiences who have now seen the movie; really show that the film makers are genuinely the real deal ... and that Jackman today is truly the Greatest Showman!"

This is an old fashioned musical and fully entertaining. Hugh Jackman is an amazing dancer, singer and actor. I left wanting to find the soundtrack. It is a perfect family movie which cannot be said about so much that comes out of Hollywood."
"alasxand-63669","9","1","4","28 December 2017"," Why did the Critics slam it? I think I know. Relax you will enjoy it.
","Okay I am going to cut to the chase. Most people are looking at the critic scores and going Why? It looks fun. The audience seems to like it. Should I go see it? Do you love or moderately like musicals the answer is YES! If you hate musicals NO, seriously just don't. Back to my point, I think the critics got triggered. Early in the film and even the ads show a disdain for a critic's review. The main critic in the film is one of the more well thought out characters. I feel like whether these critics want to admit it or not they got on the defensive early in the show and saw monumental failures when the movie faltered slightly. It is hard for most people to watch a film in which they feel personally attacked and see it for its true value. <br/><br/>Now my review in general, I saw this day after Christmas. I had the soundtrack stuck in my head most of the holiday. I normally am not a big musical person. I only watched La La Land to see why it was nominated for Oscars okay. To be honest, I didn't enjoy it. Being a Sci-Fi big action geek, the only thing The Greatest Showman had going for it was Hugh Jackman, Wolverine singing? Who wouldn't want to see that? (yes, I know his acting/singing/award winning Tony chops) And it had plenty against it, Zac Efron. High School Musical was released when my girls were young so you can imagine how many times I have seen it. However The Greatest Showman's songs had heart. I had to give it a chance. Hugh Jackman's voice was spot on. He had me convinced of every aspect of this character. He WAS Barnum. Zac Efron did an excellent job as well as Zendaya. My heart was won over by Keala Steele. She had so much power and heart. You can see it in her even if she was under utilized. The set design and costumes are Astounding! The screen is filled with what I can only call wonder 99% of the time. The choreography broke rules and kept you guessing.<br/><br/>From the Opening scene you are told this is a Ride! And just in case you thought all would be glitter it quickly shows you there is more here than meets the eye. <br/><br/>Now my Negative. Some of the direction was choppy and camera placement got lost inside the choreography. The story need more time, however, I can see it was edited to keep the audience engaged and momentum up. These obvious editing choices hurt the film overall. If I can tell you edited something out as an audience member you messed up. And that is about all I can say is wrong with it. It is a musical after all.<br/><br/>So if you think of seeing it. Ask yourself how you feel in general about musicals? Do you want a visual extravaganza? Do you always trust professional critics? It isn't truly for everyone, no musical ever is...I would wager this is pretty close! Take the risk!"
"alvinclark1998","9","1","4","28 December 2017"," The best musical I've seen in a long time!
","Before going into this movie, I had no idea what to expect and I had little detail with what this film was about. First off this is one of the best musicals I've ever seen. Every song in this movie was entertaining and packed with emotion. I shed a tear in the last scene and i'm a 19 year old guy!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is truly the Greatest showman in this film. This is one of the best performances by him and you can see the passion and effort put into this. Just from his voice alone...
Zac Efron and Zendaya were also great in this film along with Keala Settle. The only downside i'd say to this film is the chemistry between Zac and Zendaya half way in this film wasn't as emotional and believable compared to the others. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an outstanding musical with a fantastic score, a great story line and amazing choreography. A MUST WATCH!"

","Reviews are supposed to be made in regards to the movie, not the real-life characters or circumstances. Thus, my review is of this movie. <br/><br/>It had me from the very beginning. The choreography and videography are very engaging. It is fresh and unique. When I use the term 'choreography', it does not simply refer to dance steps, but rather movement of any sort and its connection to the music. So...the choreography was great! I loved that aspect of the movie. It was not your normal 1,2,3,4 dance moves, but rather various actions in the movie being choreographed with the beat and lyrics.<br/><br/>The lighting and cinematography hit their points spot-on and it all came together beautifully to entertain movingly. I was very impressed! <br/><br/>I liked the fact that it did not portray him as perfect, but also showed his acknowledgement of failures or selfishness and relenting. Acceptance of others who look different or are from different backgrounds was a recurring theme and well-played by the actors. The acting and storyline were believable and there was enough truth to overlook any fiction. <br/><br/>It was my favorite movie of 2017!<br/><br/>This will be a movie that I will watch over and over again with my family!

Sorry, no car chases, no evil wizards, no deadly space aliens, not a lot of CGI, but ,YES, you feel good when you leave the theater.

I love movies that have high entertainment values. I love movies that take me on a fantasical journey. I love movies that make me laugh and cry. I love musical movies with soundtracks that make you want to get out of your seat and dance with the actors.<br/><br/>If you enjoy these same things, then you will LOVE this movie too! Don't listen to what others say. Go see it for yourself. What is the cost of a regular movie ticket these days , $8.00. Spend the $8.00 , grab a bucket of popcorn, a drink , and just sit back and let the movie take you for a ride. <br/><br/>I was a partial fan of Jackman before The Greatest Showman, but I always felt he was lost in X-men movies. I always thought he was best on Broadway, or in a well-scripted musical. And, I was right! Mr. Jackman, please heed my words and put your amazing talents to better use than Superhero comic movies. <br/><br/>I saw this movie on the 23rd of December and I have tickets to see it again this weekend. Who knows, I may get tickets to see it next weekend. I also wish they'd show it in Imax with larger-than-life sound and picture. <br/><br/>I hope this review helps some people decide whether to go see this movie.

"rgkarim","9","1","4","24 December 2017"," This Movie Shows Up Many: Greatest Musical In Some Time
","LIKES: <br/><br/>-Exciting Pace
-The Acting
-The Messages
-The Numbers/Soundtrack<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>-More Connectivity/Expanded Story
-CGI Work
-Hollywood glamour<br/><br/>SUMMARY: When it comes to the Greatest Showman, words cannot describe how incredible this movie is. Filled to the brim with energy, this movie will keep you engaged the entire time with its fantastic balance of story, characters, and special effects, this movie certainly breathes life back into the musical movie genre. The storytelling through song is a hard art to master, but this movie blows it out of the water with the magical numbers they have developed. Not only are the numbers crafted in amazing detail, imbued with energy and special effects that are worthy of representing the circus in all its oddness. Outside of the superficial aspects, the songs tell the stories and feelings of the characters, a different angle compared to the other movies I saw this week. This film's ability to illicit feelings is almost unstoppable, and one will go up and down on an emotional roller coaster that not only pulls at your heart strings, but inspires and motivates to change their way of thinking when it comes to looking at humans. 
 The weaknesses are minor, mostly wanting more to come out of this work of art, primarily in expanding the story of the characters and connecting the plots a little better to make them less like isolated events and more of a whole story. In addition, seeing the other characters get more expansion would have been nice as well. Outside of a little Hollywood glamour and CGI improvements, I don't have much that can be improved on this movie given the genres it's classified in. This movie was the champion of the holiday season, and a fantastic thrill for any and all families who aren't scared of the Circus and who especially want a true, inspirational musical. So of the movies, this one gets high regards for going to see in the theater, perhaps twice if you had as much fun as I did. <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Biography/Drama/Musical: 9.5
Movie Overall: 9.0"

"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","1","5","31 May 2018"," THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
","I've noted before that I love movie musicals. They're more rare than ever these days since I don't consider pop song fueled items in that genre. Those movies are made to sell records or up the marketability of a particular pop star. I'm talking about full blown musicals where characters suddenly burst into song about what's taking place. Most these days are based on Broadway shows. But for once a full on movie musical has hit the screen and now disc that deserves notice. That movie is THE GREATEST SHOWMAN. <br/><br/>The movie is loosely based on the life of entrepreneur P.T. Barnum, the first person to create what we call showbiz. At times a promoter and at others a con man at heart, Barnum brought something new to the stage unseen before. This film cleans up his act a bit, puts a nice coat of white paint on his reputation and in doing so makes for one outrageously entertaining film.<br/><br/>As a boy Barnum follows his father, a tailor, around and helps when he can. He meets a young girl named Charity in the home of one of his father's customers and even as a child falls helplessly in love with her. They remain in contact against her father's wishes and eventually marry with promises of a world they will create all their own. <br/><br/>But plans don't follow through. Living in a leaky flat with two young girls to take care of Barnum (Hugh Jackman) loses his job as an accountant. Charity (Michelle Williams) tells him not to worry and as the three celebrate one of the girl's birthdays he has an idea. The next day using documents he took from his ex-employer and spinning a yarn of owning ships at sea (while failing to mention they've all sunk) he gets a loan from the bank and rents a building. <br/><br/>He fills the building with the latest craze, wax figures. He also brings in oddities not seen in the city like wild animals now stuffed. When business doesn't take off his daughter suggest he needs something alive. Another spark of inspiration. Barnum posts signs everywhere looking for unique people, what would later be termed ""freaks"". He starts off the cast of his show by approaching a young man he dubs Gen. Tom Thumb who stands 25 inches tall. As more cast are added to the show it becomes a must see attraction.<br/><br/>Given a bad review by the press it doesn't matter. People come from far and wide to see the show. In addition to that Barnum has given these people something they never had before, a family, people who care for them in their own circle. <br/><br/>Searching for a way to make his location more reputable he approaches a wealthy young playwright named playwright Phillip Carlyle (Zach Efron) to invest in his show. Hesitant at first Carlyle agrees for a percentage and on his first visit falls in love with trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). Barnum gets another assist from Carlyle who helps them get an audience with Queen Victoria, adding a touch of prestige to the show. While there he meets opera star Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) and makes plans to produce a tour featuring her across the US.<br/><br/>More happens in the movie but I've already said too much. Troubles at his show, losing track of his original intent, forgetting the people he brought in who depend on him and losing his path in life all make up for the content of this movie. It's uplifting and heartbreaking at different times. The plight of the stars of his show, being unacceptable to some members of the public who think they should crawl back in the shadows is the heart and soul of this film. The film's strongest song, ""This Is Me"", celebrates their strength in discovering who they are and the power they have to be accepted as real people. The song was nominated for best song at this year's Oscars and in my opinion they were robbed by not winning.<br/><br/>It's not the only song to stand out here though. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul who wrote the songs for last year's LA LA LAND have crafted some of the most amazing music and lyrics to find their way to film in decades. Recent musicals like BURLESQUE and CHICAGO don't compare to this soundtrack in my opinion. The movie lifts you up and breaks your heart both.<br/><br/>The entire cast stand out as amazing in the film. I've wondered when Efron would act in a film rather than just take off his shirt and he does great here. Zendaya is underused but does well. Williams as the love of Barnum's life is wonderful. But it is Jackman who shines above all others here. His portrayal, his emotive expressions and his singing all make the character come alive. <br/><br/>If all of this weren't enough to convince you the movie is worth adding to your collection then consider the extras in this sing-a-long edition. They include THE FAMILY BEHIND THE GREATEST SHOWMAN a featurette on the making of the film, THE SONGS each song singled out for fans, THE SPECTACLE offering behind the scenes info on characters and choreography, a gallery of concept art, a gallery of storyboards used for the film, MUSIC MACHINE offers direct access to each song in the film with a sing-a-long option, sing-a-long mode which presents the entire film with subtitles to sing along with each song and an audio commentary track with Michael Gracey the film's director.<br/><br/>Of all the movies I saw last year, which was quite a lot, I felt that this movie would surely garner an Oscar nod for best picture. But the Academy did what they've done for some time now, nominating movies based on political bent or causes as opposed to what was the best film made. This movie should have won hands down. I saw it twice in the theater and watched it twice on disc now and never been bored. To me that's the sign of a movie worth owning and repeat viewings. Other's I know have felt the same. Give it a watch and my guess is you will too. Soon you'll hear people walking down the street singing ""Ladies and gents this is the show you've been waiting for."""

"RedRider14","6","1","5","5 May 2018"," All Style No Substance
","I really wanted to like this movie. I'd heard from friends who told me it was their favourite movie ever! The number of 10/10 reviews on this website were enough to get me excited.<br/><br/>However, what a mighty letdown. For once the critics git it right. This was a movie that wanted to be a musical masterpiece, but instead turned up with songs that were simply painted by numbers, nothing original here. I was hoping for another La La Land, but instead got High School Musical in a tent!<br/><br/>Cringingly melodramatic set pieces designed to manipulate the viewer into empathising with its characters, The Greatest Showman pretends to be a solid ode to showbusiness, but offers up no real depth at all. Poor old Hugh Jackman tried, but with the script and music he was stuck with, and the way the musical pieces were introduced within the action, it was just too twee for even he to overcome.<br/><br/>From a cinematography point of view, the production values were high, but that was it. Very little insight into any of the cutout characters, poor delivery of the musical component which never matched the period setting, manipulative set pieces designed to tell a character's backstory quickly without spending any time to pull away the layers,... OMG this was cynical moneygrabbing filmmaking 101.<br/><br/>Yeah, I really wanted to like this movie. But what I got was a glitzy, noisy, pseudo jolly but ultimately hollow rendition of a Hollywood musical. Even the ending was contrived and rushed. <br/><br/>Go and see a real musical, like La La Land or Nine... they had style too, but importantly they also possessed substance. Much like Barnum's business model, The Greatest Showman movie is a fake... ""people know they are seeing a fake, but they'll still come!"" I'm sad, but it's a fact."

","I first viewed a trailer for this film last year and instantly knew it was going to be an impressive movie. I've always been a big fan of Hugh Jackman who is an impressive actor and has extensive experience on stage and in front of the camera. He has also shown his ability to sing and act from his remarkable performance in ""Les Miserables"" in 2012. Jackman is known mostly as his vastly different role as Logan in the Wolverine movies. <br/><br/>In this film Jackman shows that he is as great at dancing as anything else. His charming smile, dashing handsome looks, twinkling eyes and intense performance makes this movie impressive. If I were to describe this film in a single word it would be PIZZAZZ! <br/><br/>I was surprised that this film came about by fairly unknown director Michael Gracey. I'm sure that writer Bill Condon, who also wrote the screenplay to the Academy Award winning musical ""Chicago"" in 2002, and Hugh Jackman provided valuable direction for Condon. I also need to mention the impressive production design from Nathan Crowley whose credits include ""Westworld"", ""The Prestige"" and the Christian Bale Batman movies. <br/><br/>I can't say enough about this film. Incredible costumes, sets, special effects, creative style and stunts made this film an enjoyment from beginning to end. <br/><br/>The story is about young P. T. Barnum living in poverty and striving to provide for his wife and two adorable daughters. Barnum' wife was raised in a well to do environment and Barnum wants to prove himself successful to his wife's father. The character development is effective with a playful approach. <br/><br/>The moment the movie began I was hooked and it only got better. The music, lyrics and dancing complemented and strengthened each other. Within minutes I let myself go in the well told fantasy story. It was both fascinating and enjoyable. <br/><br/>The cinematography, editing and lighting were impressive. The passion and expression that was felt from the characters as they danced and sang was believable and convincing and brought me to tears. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Zac Efron and Zendaya was convincing and emotional. (Not to mention Zendaya performed all her own trapeze stunts) Keala Settle killed it with her angry and passion filled expression as she performed ""This Is Me"", which won an Oscar for Best Achievement for Original Song. Settle also performed this song and wowed the audience at the Academy Awards. <br/><br/>This movie is the real deal. I haven't enjoyed a movie like this one in some time. The lights, color, choreography, composition and balance of every shot was an artistic masterpiece. Just like a circus there was so many fun and exciting things happening at every given moment I was overwhelmed and couldn't take it all in. I will have to enjoy it a second and third time just to soak in everything I missed the first time. <br/><br/>An exceptional movie has to be one that I feel can not be improved and must not need anything to make it better. I have a difficult time finding faults in this production. The collaboration of artists, actors, decorated and skilled film makers and creative minds make this film simply awesome. It's evident that working together as an effective team can produce magical results. <br/><br/>How this film didn't win best picture and best director over ""The Shape Of Water"" truly baffles me. We all know that the Academy Awards are very political, but this one stumps me. Now that I've seen the film I completely understand the reason behind Jackman's shocked expression when overlooked at the Golden Globes for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. James Franco won the award for, the appropriate titled movie, ""The Disaster Artist"". Myself, and thousands of others, were left scratching our heads in confusion over that moment. <br/><br/>This movie deserves so much more credit than it has been given. If the 2011 film ""The Artist"" deserves Best Picture and Best Director, than so does this! It's truly an artistic masterpiece and I am anxious to see it again as soon as possible."
"Iusedtobeacat","7","1","5","14 March 2018"," Good Musical. Inaccurate History
","I both loved and disliked this movie for completely different reasons. I loved this movie in part because it's enjoyable, entertaining and for the most part it delivers on what is promises. The songs were fun, they were catchy. The acting was pretty good. It is a feel good movie with a lot of touching scenes. However, the story is meant to be loosely based on the life of PT Barnum and the story in the movie bares little resemblance to the actual life of the real PT Barnum, whatever is based on reality is very mundane and vague that the movie producers could have easily made this film about a fictional character that had ambitions to kickstart a circus and it would have been completely fine. Most of the story here is fictional anyways and for good reason. The producers have took liberties in sugarcoating this movie from the actual exploitive nature of its history and turning it into a fun loving and for the most part family friendly musical. Gotta give them props for making a bleak and unpleasant experience joyous but nonetheless that doesn't completely eradicate the fact that this story is meant to be based on PT Barnum who isn't a very lovable character. <br/><br/>Anyways, just thought I'd throw this trivia out there for anyone thinking of watching this movie. For the most part this is still a good movie to watch with touching emotional scenes. I do recommend you watch it, but bear in mind that it has very little links to actual reality of what PT Barnum was like as a person."
"purchases-22080","6","1","5","4 March 2018"," Fair, but America killed the circus that we never really see here.
","If you've ever been to the real circus, you'd know that it's far different that the song and dance that we see here. Those looking for a circus will be disappointed - no animal acts, no elephants doing tricks, barely the time spent on high-wire flyers, etc, etc. 
 It's got singing, but none of the songs rise to the peppy excitement and memorability of La La's. 
 Overall story is stronger in the 1952 The Greatest Show on Earth. Here, it's more like things move about simply to make the show seem more 'active' than it really is - an illusion. But that's this movie - you think you'll see the circus, but never really do. Instead, you get a drama, songs, interesting sets, etc. and are taken on a different path.
 Fair for the modern storytelling that avoids anything that's not politically correct (no tigers, elephants, etc. doing regular circus tricks), typical black female inserted merely for the feel-good (seriously - when she's facing the screen swinging about, they have to specially light and emphasize her face and beauty beyond the other 'weird and unusual' circus performers).
 Unique enough for just 1 theater viewing at a discount, otherwise a Redbox rental when there's not many other better movies to watch. Eventually worth 1 watch, but then go watch the award winning 1952 The Greatest Show on Earth."
"tomfeyry","5","1","5","3 March 2018"," Not great but okay for a lazy sunday...
","While some parts of the movie are great, some of the actors really good and the costumes wonderful, the songs....are NOT. <br/><br/>If you like High School Musical then you'll really like this because it's the same kind of music, electrical, pop, shitty lyrics...<br/><br/>I was really disapointed from the start (that's when the bad music starts). People on IMDB are comparing it to La la land ahah that's funny because it has nothing to do with it. You can't even compare the 2... sorry but I enjoyed La la land quite a lot and LOVED Into the woods...those 2 are real Musicals if you ask me ! But again you should watch it, if you like average (bad) musicals, you'll like this one a lot !"

"Snootz","10","1","5","14 January 2018"," 10 Stars and Hang the Critics
","Is there any job in the world more useless than a movie critic? What makes one person's opinion of a movie any more valid than anyone else's? A movie is proved by the appreciation of the audience-- not a handful of opinionated critics. So in regard to THE GREATEST SHOWMAN... hang the critics and 10-stars ahead!<br/><br/>First let it be said I am not easy to impress. I will call a skunk a skunk without hesitation-- and in these reviews often do. Be it pro or fan-film, if it lacks story, purpose, emotion or benefit... I'll cut it no slack.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is not a perfect film-- far from it. In places it jumps the shark (something for which I usually have zero tolerance) and in a couple of scenes breaks out in music when spoken lines would have worked better. That is admitted. It is an imperfect film.<br/><br/>But I don't award 10 stars for perfection; I award it for excellence. It is somewhat humorous paradox that one of the main points made in the film was in regard to a critic who has no joy in life. That is why I give this 10 stars... because of the sheer joy and range of emotions this brings to the audience. This may not be ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" but it comes close to being one of the most ENJOYABLE films of the past year. It will bring laughter, tears, wonder at the technical achievements and stunt work, and great appreciation for the acting.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job in this. I was expecting him to do so based on past work... and in this he does not fail to deliver. The supporting actors are cliche but work very well in their roles. In all honesty, this being primarily a musical with a multitude of characters, besides the main role the actors don't really get a chance to strut their stuff. But their purpose is to support Jackman as P.T. Barnum... and that they do, allowing him to shine as The Showman.<br/><br/>What may delight some while striking others as very odd... is the choice of music and style of choreography. I went in expecting more time-established music appropriate to the era. Instead we find a completely modernized score and dance routines in paradox to the very-well-done antiquated presentation of the costumes and sets. But the audience is introduced to the musical factor from the very beginning of the movie so have no reason to expect any different throughout the rest of the show.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering if this was a Disney film; it very much has that flavor. This is High School Musical to a different drum... but that's okay. I don't know enough about the field to identify the style of music and choreography used; all I know is that it seemed very familiar on all counts. However it was well-accomplished on all counts, so the only reason one might complain would be that they don't personally like that style. Meh, diversity is the spice of life. People are free to like or dislike whatever they choose. <br/><br/>While I will agree that at times both the music and choreography seemed a little ""campy"" and over-the-top... we have to realize that the main theme of this movie is a man who was over-the-top. Barnum was KNOWN for going to extremes, for pushing the envelope, and yes... for being a little campy. I can't fault a movie for having the flavor of the very person it's representing. Anyone who goes in expecting ""Gone With the Wind"" simply doesn't get it.<br/><br/>I have given 10-stars here before-- but I withhold them for the very best. In most instances I award them for near-perfection in a film. This time it's different: I rate this 10-stars despite the imperfections. That's kind of the point of the movie, isn't it... the imperfections that make us ""glorious""?<br/><br/>It is the first time in a very long time that the theater audience APPLAUDED a film. I heard one elderly man comment on the way out, ""This is the third time I've seen this film!"" Despite the modern music and contemporary choreography, he loved it. Others were making very positive comments, and still others were criticizing the critics who criticized this movie. <br/><br/>I must agree. I'd watch this again in a heartbeat-- and for me no film gets higher praise than that. Forgive my enthusiasm here, but this film is ""glorious""."
"nogodnomasters","8","1","5","10 January 2018"," A celebration of humanity
","This is a musical biopic of PT Barnum. <br/><br/>Like ""La La Land"" it includes people who should never be in a musical. Zac Efron needed a voice cutter to sound acceptable. Hugh Jackman was hit and miss, mostly a miss. Better than Russell Crowe, but not as good as Emma Stone.<br/><br/>I don't know why casting directors insist on putting people with less than stellar quality voices into musicals when there is so much talent out there. However, there were good performances Keala Settle and Rebecca Ferguson. The music was uplifting and sounded as if it was uplifted from Katy Perry tunes...which would have worked better in a few instances. <br/><br/>The theme of the film comes out at the end which was one of diversity and equality which is why Hollywood loved it considering the age in which we live."
"JamiroBontes","5","1","5","5 January 2018"," A good sang and acted mess!
","The Greatest Showman is about P.T. Barnum and him trying to make money by getting all these 'unique people' together and make a circus. He has a wife that he knows from when he was a kid and he was working for her father as a maid, because he was broke and she was rich her father didn't aprove of the relationship and now they have two kids. There is a subplot with Zac Efron and Zendaya who like each other but I will talk about that later.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. The acting is really good in it espacially Hugh Jackman and he caries the movie in a lot of ways. The songs were very good and that suprised me because I hated the song in the trailer and when I saw it in the movie I actually liked it. But when I was listening I noticed and you will as well that all the songs kinda sound the same. My biggest problem with the movie is the script. It uses a lot of montages to tell it's story and because of that there is no character devolpment at all. The only thing with the 'unique people' in the circus is that there is a group of people who hate them and we supposed to feel bad for them, but that's the thing... we don't, because we don't know them at all. The subplot with Zac and Zendaya is that they like eachother, but they say literally one thing to eachother and then at a concert they hold hands for a bit.<br/><br/>I want to talk a bit about the criticts vs the audience. I get both of them really well, I think the criticts see a sloppy story and because of that they don't like the movie. And I think the audience only hear the great songs and because of that don't really care about the story. I really get both points and understand both of their reasons for not liking the movie and why most of the audience love the movie. I would say if you wanna go see a movie with good acting and very good songs, go and see it. But if you want a real story with those preformances and songs maybe just go on youtube and watch the songs there."

","Amid the crowded December movie season, there were tons of movies I wanted to go see. It's easy to lose The Greatest Showman amongst Star Wars and Jumanji, but I was pretty excited to go see this Hugh Jackman-led musical. The very good trailers held loads of promise, and the award-winning lyricists of La La Land were making a return to compose the songs.<br/><br/>Walking out, I was extremely disappointed. There was so much potential here, and it did not live up to the expectations that I had walking in. However, when checking the buzz around this movie, I noticed the extremely high audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. Although I usually favor audience opinion over critic, I feel like the critics were right this time.<br/><br/>This movie does have lots of good things about it, amid the bad. The songs are spectacular, and the lyric team deserves to be praised. The sets and choreography of the dance sequences are very well done, with the songs being upbeat and catchy. The acting from mostly everybody is good, especially Hugh Jackman. He was the main catalyst behind the production of this film, and it really shows. Jackman gives 100% effort, and has had a pretty awesome year between this and Logan. <br/><br/>The blaring negative is the script. It is so poorly written and executed that I began thinking of ways to rewrite it as the movie was still going. The entire thing feels extremely rushed. It seemed like the writers wrote the movie in the first thirty minutes, then had no idea what to do after that. The film begins with cringy child actors in a pointless flashback sequence that could have been devoted to present character development. The movie gives hardly zero screen time to pretty important characters, then expects us to care for them later down the road. The main romance in the movie, between Zack Efron and Zendaya, is one of the most shallow love interests I've seen in a long time; they basically make eye contact once then are madly in love. The CGI is unforgivably awful, which makes no sense seeing that this movie had a whopping $84 million budget. <br/><br/>The script and the decisions that the film makes were very amateur and downright bad. If you take away the impressive songs and set pieces, then what you're left with is a poorly-written mess that can't stand on its own. One of the biggest praises I can give to La La Land, a similar film, is that amid the spectacular songs, the story is strong enough to stand on its own two legs. That is just not the case for The Greatest Showman."

","Okay. I get it that Hugh Jackman loves to sing and dance. He's something to watch, all right. This film makes me glad I watched it on my laptop, so I could fast forward through the singing bits. Every time I heard any of the singing I was reminded, of all things, of Hair. Don't ask me why. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: I like musicals. Some musicals. I loved My Fair Lady and Oklahoma. Some stories just need to have terrific music and unforgettably wonderful singing. I really don't think the Greatest Showman is one of those stories, though. And the songs seemed (what I heard of them) to be mostly dreck.<br/><br/>Too bad about it being a musical because it's an intriguing tale about imagination and creativity and good old American hard work ethics. Never let the bastards get you down. Barnum sure knew how to put on a show.<br/><br/>Zac Efron was fun to watch, too. I like that he is becoming a much more accomplished actor.<br/><br/>I missed the part where Barnum says, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Maybe Hugh sang his way through that one.

","All, of course, are welcome to their opinion, so this is mine. First, anyone who gave this movie a sterling review are obviously enticed by catchy tunes and shiny things, for this movie is a clunky, shallow and obvious dance of superficiality. Musicals are fine and have a place, but when the songs get in the way of the story instead of helping aid the story and entertainment value of the work it's a problem and that's what happens here. Hugh Jackman is good, and gives an energetic performance, but in my opinion can't save this mess.<br/><br/>If the musics is all that's important here, and it seems to be, do as I suggest in the subject line and buy the soundtrack. If, however, you are looking for a character study and an historical look at the person and character PT Barnum I suggest YouTube it, because you'll be very disappointed."

"Noah_Biondi","6","0","1","18 October 2018"," The Perfectly Adequate Showman
","The Greatest Showman, despite being a huge hit, is not anything great. It's just perfectly adequate. I mean, there's definitely some really cool things about it, it's very energetic, but other than that, it's just... adequate!<br/><br/>What's the story? Inspired by the imagination of P. T. Barnum, The Greatest Showman is an original musical that celebrates the birth of show business & tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE Hugh Jackman. He's very good at playing the Wolverine in the X-Men movies, and he's also very good in The Fountain. In this film, however, you can definitely tell he's giving it his all, but his performance isn't quite as good as what he had to offer from the other films he was in. He seems to show not much emotion in certain scenes, often affecting his fired up nature and ambitious personality. The rest of the acting is pretty good, especially when it's time for them to sing. The musical numbers in this film are FANTASTIC! Well, most of them. Tightrope wasn't really that good and they overplayed A Million Dreams by a million. Fortunately, the rest of the songs, especially Rewrite the Stars, This is Me, and The Greatest Show are very good songs filled with energy, and are also a lot of fun to watch. The choreography is very well done, even if it can get a bit silly sometimes, and make the musical numbers both a spectacle for the eyes and the ears. However, not everything is so good about the film. For instance, the movie is extremely historically inaccurate, an example being P.T. Barnum's character is more brighthearted despite not being that kind of person in real life, there's all of these unnecessary matches that didn't happen in real life, and it's played to be more of a fantasy than a historical film. Which isn't that bad, I mean, it's worked in a lot of Disney films, but in a live-action retelling of a famous showman, it doesn't work here, making the writing feel rough, inconsistent, and even terrible at times. Another thing I'd like to point out is that the characters themselves aren't very interesting nor compelling, and I feel like their sole purpose is to create unnecessary subplots that don't go anywhere in the story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Greatest Showman has got some good things, as well as having some bad things, and in the end, it's nothing short of adequate. It makes a good family film, but that's about it. If you REALLY wanna see a movie about the story of P.T. Barnum's career taken into a more sugar-coated Disney-esque fashion, then go all in for it. But for those looking for a top-notch musical film that also serves as a historical film, no offense but this DEFINITELY isn't for you. Watch it once, maybe again, and that's all you need with this film. Not exactly the best movie to see, but it's not the absolute WORST film ever. Critics hated it, audiences loved it, I'm... sort of in the middle. What can I say but, P.T. Barnum has never felt this average before."

","Walks in with yet another engaging spectacle, Steven Spielberg is hands down a master at filmmaking. The extremely gifted man once again proves with The Post Movie that he is peerless at what he does. His work never ceases to paint flairs of extraordinaire. He is the one man who could make a simple conversation stand out. And there is so much inscribed in his frames that you can't help but wonder how does he manage to pull it all off.
There's a story he tells even in long winding conversations. The Post Movie is full of such brilliant masterly koreros. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep with their Oscar-bait presence, make all those chats stand out. There's something about his direction that's instantly uplifting. Even when he is not busy painting fiction like last years The BFG, he is pouring meaning into the mundane, shaping it and moulding into something delectable.
In a world of power that's run by the corrupt, perches a voice that's broiling to do the right thing. The Post movie bases itself on that very run, the pointlessness of a war that had edged itself precariously on the parapet of ""let down"". The fact ""we can't show the world we lost"" smothers the superpower dream and the United States government was finding it difficult to come clean. It was The New York Times who took the first plunge but the victor - The Washington Post who saw it all the way through.
The Post Movie Plot and Theme (Spoilers)
The Post narrates the true story of the Pentagon Papers that shook the very foundation of the US government when they were made public in 1971. It is built around all that took place inside the head of all the decision makers and the turmoil they were in when something as huge as the truth itself came along.
The Post movie kicks off in the year 1966 with a prologue showing Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) accompanying US troops and documenting US military activities led by Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood). When speaking to President Lyndon Johnson he expresses how hopeless the Vietnam war was, and yet publicly speaking McNamara says the exact opposite.
There was something about that blunt lie that shakes the very foundation on which Daniel was built. Unable to take it anymore he decides to let all the government secrets out in the open for the public to see. He photocopies classified reports that showcase the progress of Americans on Vietnam soil ever since the time of Harry S. Truman and then leaks it to The New York Times. Later he releases it to The Washington Post where a pissed off Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) was scouring for news.
Quality drives profitability.
It should be well noted the import of the papers. It is worth noticing how the director chose to run the camera literally with the Pentagon papers thus establishing the colossal importance of news. A world was about to go down for some really powerful people. You could literally feel the weight of the papers in that parcel that made its way to Ben's desk.
Meryl Streep as Kay Graham
Katherine Graham or Kay (Meryl Streep) found a world on her shoulders when she took the reins of The Washington Post in her hands as the publisher and owner after her husband died. She was overpowered by some really strong men, and it was hard for her to cope with those who condescended her at all times. Be it be her advisors or the men who surrounded her.
In the beginning, there was this apparent tension as clouds of doubts hovered over her. It was important to show that owing to the huge decision boiling in the eventuality of the flick. Meryl nails it giving an Oscar-worthy performance yet again.
There are some really ingenious shots put in by Steven Spielberg when he chose to show a woman entering a room full of men. It spoke of contradiction. Even though words weren't spoken, eyes spake 'em. There was an evident air of control that you could sense in that frame when Katherine takes her seat unable to speak herself out due to stress and hesitation.
News is the first rough draft of history.
You could sense her to be this vulnerable woman who was forced out of her way and flung into a room full of responsibilities. What people did not know was the undeniable fact that every person is totally capable of handling things once they get a hang of it.
There was also one scene where all the wives of men at great posts stood outside smoking, waiting and discussing trivial matters while this contrasting lady Kay Graham goes right through them all to meet with the 'men' to take a call. It is just truly inspiring for all those who thought there was a said place for women. She literally changed the very perspective people had about women.
Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee
Editor in Chief of The Washington Post is Ben Bradlee portrayed by Tom Hanks. He is rooting for a big news when the biggest of all news hits him in the face. A lot of shots are called by him in the flick but at the end of the day, the decision still stood with Kay<br/><br/>Read more at: Straight From A Movie

"ChrisLFinch","6","0","1","20 July 2018"," I'm not a musical person, but i kind of liked this one.
","I didn't know that this Movie was a musical. If I had known that it was a musical I wouldn't of watched it because I don't like musicals. I mean I like high school musical as a kid and I think that was because it was more my age. But I don't like any other musicals other then that. I have been trying to get into them for years and its just not for me. I found them cringe and boring. I'm thinking about trying again as it might just be the Movie storylines that I'm not into. So I'm going to keep trying to see if there are any I like.<br/><br/>I kind of liked the music in this one but it had update songs so it didn't really fit the story's time zone. but I did like the songs and as soon as I came home I listened to a bit of the soundtrack. This Movie looked interesting when I first saw the poster and it popping up everywhere and I liked the decisions of the Movie. I just found it interesting. I like to see how people overcome their struggles by turning their problems into opportunities. <br/><br/>In the Movie a lot of the time an interesting twist was about to bring the story or a character some depth, but they broke into a forced song and everything was forgotten. The one thing that I really didn't like was the fact that This Movie tells a cleaned-up story of Barnum & Bailey Circus creator P.T. Barnum. The truth is that They were responsible for captured, beaten, and deprived animals and this Movie leaves out some important information while romanticizing a person who used any living beings he could get his hands on. animals that he kept in cages and trained through pain and fear. I'm a big person when it comes to animals, I love them, and I don't eat meat. <br/><br/>I think it would be a good family Movie if a few things changed like if they didn't use animals, if it wasn't based of P.T. Barnum and if P.T was nice and caring. anyway I think the acting was good, I liked the cast. and the dancing. I liked the costumes, the imagination and the creatively used in the A Million Dreams song scene. I thought that because It was a musical it would be boring but it wasn't really,<br/><br/>I was worried about how the Movie would show the importance's of having compassion for those who are different, and the effects of racism, and standing up to racism. I think it was Okayish but I really didn't like how P.T asked them to join the show. I liked the senses were they played ''this is me'' song, I find it uplifting and I'm happy they used it."

I know it's a musical and the main focus is the music and dance scenes, but I was still disappointed as many of my friends had given this movie high praise.<br/><br/>The music was far superior to the storyline, expecially ""This is me"" which was both touching and beautifully sung. I expecially loved the misfit circus characters who were each unique and had a certain charm to them. <br/><br/>Overall, I was entertained some of the scenes and music, but I felt it was somewhat lacking in other areas.

BUT I was bored through the first segment with the kids singing, I found most of the songs to be forgettable, the dance numbers all looked like a Glee production and seemed totally out of place for the historical context. 
Jenny Lind was renowned for her angelic voice, not for being a pop diva, although her song was amazing. 
I found it annoying that huge plot progress took place while the daughters didn't grow up. 
This movie had all the ingredients to be a classic, but by trying to appeal to current music taste, it becomes a freakish thing with people in period costume ""gettin' down"" to 21st century tunes. I still stuck with it and enjoyed parts of it immensely, like the Bearded Lady solo (even though, once again, the dancing went all Glee.) 
So, if you watch, start with a forgiving spirit and lowered expectations."
"katiecaswell","6","0","4","30 April 2018"," The Greatest Showman Review
","The film 'The Greatest Showman' is a bright, colorful, classic rags to riches story. The music and choreography were good, especially the trapeze choreography with Zac Efron and Zendaya. The music wasn't quite what I was expecting, specifically the song ""Never Enough"" that was sung by Jenny Lind who was known as an opera singer, but if you like catchy, pop music, you will enjoy the sound track. The film is visually pleasing with many bright colors and good costumes. It also conveys a very important message of acceptance, diversity, and the importance of family. However, I think it was too fast paced, glossing over some of the important plot lines and leaving some events a little unexplained. It results in many of the characters to be under developed when I think their backstories and relating to them should be really important to the story. Overall, I thought it was a little predictable and not really extraordinary, but it was entertaining which should be expected from an over-the-top circus musical."
"donniefriedman","7","0","2","22 April 2018"," Nice to see they're still making musicals, but...
","I'm a sucker for musicals, and this one had the benefit of wonderful performances by triple threat performers who could actually sing, dance and act. (unlike La La Land). The production was impressive, and the musical numbers beautifully staged and executed. I especially liked the duet of Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron singing and dancing in the bar -- talent, talent and then some.<br/><br/>Passing off the story of PT Barnum as a tribute to diversity and acceptance of differences is a bit of a stretch -- that's a true Hollywood treatment, and frankly a little old these days. It's been done and done. But I'm nitpicking, because the performances in the supporting roles (the so-called freaks) were so authentic and guaranteed audience buy-in. <br/><br/>However, unfortunately I found the music and lyrics just okay.

"seige-hound","7","0","3","2 April 2018"," An Immensely entertaining, if unfocused, musical
","I can easily imagine this film being an issue for some people. It takes a controversial historical figure, and invents an almost entirely fictional version of his life that portrays him not as the flawed capitalist who exploited people to make his riches that he was in real life, but as a passionate entertainer that gives the 'freaks' in his show an opportunity to express themselves.<br/><br/>Also, the music is very separated from the tone and the setting of the story itself. The film is set in the mid 1800's, but all of the music is post-2010's pop anthems. Every song feels out of place within a true historical world, and most of the music feels more like Top 40 stuff you hear on the radio.<br/><br/>But...I still like it. It's fun. It's really fun. It's a movie motivated not by plot or history or character, but by pure emotion. The music especially portrays this incredibly well. Songs like Rewrite the Stars, The Other Side and For Now On are just fun to watch and listen to.<br/><br/>If you don't like the music, there's nothing for you here.

The song from Greatest-- """"A Million Dreams"""" does the same thing. I saw Lancaster's film 3 times. <br/><br/>I have seen Greatest Showman 8 times. The last 3-4 viewings, I have started asking different people have they seen it once and they are saying (didn't know if I was the only one over the top): twice, 5 times, once, 5, 6, 3, etc. Four young college kids walking out with one of mother's and they said 5 times and also going back. Most of people who said they saw it multiple times were also going back. From the pre-opening scene where Jackman and Director say a film is best appreciated in a theatre with an audience like you. That opening to me felt so sincere, unlike Hollywood. Then the first opening musical scene with Jackman that just caught my attention and I knew then this was going to be a special movie and stayed true to the end scene where Jackman is whispering """"... its everything you ever want"""". Each scene has music and key is lyrics (words) that are real life to us all. This Barnum musical was so captivating because of Barnum's vision and enthusiasm. Also his struggles when he says """"This is not the life I promised you"""", similar to all of us at some time. Her father basically also says """"still the taylor sport"""" The scene where she says """"our own mothers didn't even want us"""". Also """"nothing draws a crowd like a crowd"""", how true and his comment about abject publicity. Soo many great one liners. All songs are very moving like """"Never Enough"""" and the anthem song but the second to last for me was the key """"From Now ON"""". How many of us in life at different times like a New Year's resolution have said """"From Now On"""" and """"won't be blinded by the light"""" and """"like an anthem in my heart"""". Hollywood really missed the boat on this one--taking another line from movie """"you think I can't spot talent"""" to his daughter. Hollywood did miss and BIG Time here. Soo puzzling. This is going to be one of top ten Musicals of all times.<br/><br/>I wish they would do 2 things: <br/><br/># 1Re-release this film again this year (it costs $84 million and taken in $170 mm US and going on $400 million worldwide. In the UK alone--England and Ireland--it is now in its 12th week, unheard of as well in the US. UK has about 900 theatres and its still playing @ almost 800. Only AVITAR in UK in 2009 has had this staying power in 12th week. <br/><br/># 2--Once a year like """"Rocky Picture Horror Show"""" bring it back to @ least select theatres not @ midnight but 10-12 AM. Audience could sing along like Rocky Picture. This film is so uplifting and we need this in todays times-- a real feel good movie based on a true hero from the Circus world, like the line says """"well they are laughing at you anyway so why not get paid"""". What is different about Hollywood entertainers today being paid $millions but made up to be beautiful. <br/><br/>Sorry I took so much of your time.
AMEN-enough."
"audrablum","10","0","2","2 March 2018"," A brilliant, thrilling masterpiece.
","This week I chose to watch The Greatest Showman (2017). This film is uniquely a biography-drama-musical. The logline reads ""Celebrates the birth of show business, and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation."" This movie made me feel inspired as a creative. The score was amazing and brilliantly paired to sensational visuals. The story made me stop and think about PT Barnum's life and what it was like. You see, I like movies that pay tribute to someone's life this way and how appropriate that it's the way we honor the father of show business in this style. I loved the poetry of the nature of the film being a musical and how it was a show that paid homage to showmanship. Yes, there IS controversy about the accuracy of the film, but the movie really wasn't meant to be a documentary. The entire essence of the films was just a relative artistic portrayal of a man's life that we might otherwise just take for granted. Looking at the real photos of the people this story was based on compared to the cast that played in the movie -- it is clear that this is simply a dolled up version of a real life tale. I think the story was pretty amazing and we got to learn a lot about who PT Barnum was and how the legendary circus came about. The acting of course was A-list actors and the actors were on par. I really enjoyed the cast that was assembled for this movie. I think that they not only worked their individual roles quite nicely, but they also played off of each other rather well. I really enjoyed that Hugh Jackman was cast in this role because I relived a tiny sliver of Les Miserables when he sang (I LOVE Les Miserables). The thing that I think I enjoyed the most about this film was it s directing. The director, Michael Gracey was formerly a visual effects artist and his intimacy with the visual shot composition makes itself apparent in the visual movements and editing transitions. This really gave the film a Baz Luhrmann stylization with added aesthetic excitement. Overall, I thought the film was wonderfully told and beautifully put together. I will be looking forward to owning this movie."

","I was hooked upon seeing the trailer for the first time, and the film itself failed to disappoint me. I have seen this movie twice in theatres now and I am still itching to see it again. This masterpiece didn't receive a welcoming reception from the critics, nevertheless this movie has proved a great success for lovers of theatre, music and arts. Personally I think it's a great movie for all, filled with ridiculously catchy and joyful music, extravagant dance sequences, and endless amounts of inspiring quotes we could all do with taking on board. If you are expecting an accurate Biography of P.T. Barnum, this is not the film for you. Besides the general basis of the film structuring around the life of the American showman himself, his life and work has been interpreted in a more positive, family-friendly and joyful light which may not give justice to the truth behind the ins and outs of his career - but it certainly contributes successfully to a beautifully delightful story. For many fans this movie will go down in history as a classic, and it truly deserves to! Fingers crossed Keala, Benj & Justin win their Oscar! x<br/><br/>A message to those critics who fault this masterpiece for being a fraud... ""A Critic of the theatre who doesn't find joy in it...now who's the fraud?"""

PROS-
Beautiful story line with such inspiring and breathtaking songs that will instantly make your whole body shiver from excitement, 
A surprising birth of a natural Actress (Keala Settle).
Some scenes were the definition of perfection.
A beautiful experience. 
CONS-
OVERDONE with some songs that were just too far fetched and not relevant or needed for the scene. 
Very poor character development with Hugh Jackman. 
Some very cheesy written scenes. 
Overall a very good movie which is heavily underrated by film critics. 
A very important highlight... the scene with the song ""Never Enough"" is one of the most beautiful experiences visually, emotionally, and mentally. Outstanding scene.

"wende_k","10","0","2","22 February 2018"," This movie is an addiction!!!
","This is the BEST movie I have see in a long, long, time! Be prepared, because once you see it, you'll be completely addicted. I've seen it twice already, and going to see it a 3rd time tomorrow, before it leaves the theater. And then, I'm getting the dvd on 3/6/18 as soon as it come out! This is a movie that inspires, uplifts, and bonds people. Two great messages in this movie: 1. What makes you different makes you special and unique, and it's ok to celebrate that. 2. Don't lose sight of why you were following your dreams. Two beautiful messages, especially in today's world. This is NOT a biopic! For those who criticize it because it's not factual, hello, it's a movie! They tell you flat out that it's inspired by some actual events and people, but it's not meant to be factual. It's meant to inspire and entertain the masses, and that it does perfectly! Everything about this movie is magic! The cast, the music (oh man, the music!!!!), the dancing, the acting, the scenery, the costumes...they just all come together to create the most spectacular film. Justin and Benj are incredible writers/composers, and they nailed the music! It's been almost a month since I've seen it the first time, and I've listens to the songs every single day. You can't help but to sing and dance along! I encourage you to check out the two YouTube videos of Hugh Jackman singing ""From Now On"", and Keala Settle singing ""This Is Me"" from the 20th Century Fox Greenlight sessions. The stories behind getting this movie made make you love and appreciate it even more! This movie was a true labor of love, especially for the director Michael Gracey and Hugh Jackman. I love Hugh before, and this movie made me love him even more, if that's possible. He and everyone put their whole heart in this movie, and you see it. You see and feel the emotions in every moment, in every song, in every dance, in every scene. Zac, Michelle, Zendaya, Keala, and the entire cast were brilliant! I don't remember ever hearing such applause and the end of a movie before, but this movie got it! And to think, I almost didn't see it. The commercials I had seen peaked my interest, but I wasn't quite sure. Thankfully, my sister saw it already and wanted to see it again, and already bought us tickets. I'll probably wear out the dvd fast! If you're hesitating, don't! You won't regret it! Update: Saw it a 3rd time and immediately wanted to see it again! An older woman (late sixties - early 70's), her daughter, and teenage grandson were in the theater, and I got talking with the older woman. I told her it was my 3rd time, and after the movie, she told me she totally understands why I saw it 3 times, and she couldn't wait to see it again. Her daughter and grandson loved it too! 3/6/18 can't come soon enough!"

"Ahook7","9","0","2","22 February 2018"," Not like any other movie
","Usually the songs in a musical can be a bit long, boring and uninteresting. But not this one. Here, the songs are the best part and you actually want the ""non-singing parts"" to be over as soon as possible. Why? The songs are thoughtful, meaningful and just overall great. I left the cinema singing some of the many great songs while carrying the biggest smile on my face that I've ever had leaving a cinema. The movie also has a lot of great points and thoughts. It shows how important our differences and flaws as people are. It shows that everyone is important and beautiful in his/her own way. There is one line in the movie that pretty much sums up all that is great and beautiful in this movie and life in general: What is your act? I don't have one. Yes, everyone has an act."
"kevzin-48569","9","0","2","21 February 2018"," Keala Settle, yes girl!
","The music, the songs, the emotion, the magic of the circus, the cinematography, the casting, this was La La Land but more fictionalised but dare I say it, better! The breakout of this film was definitely Keala Settle and she carried the whole film! I'm sure I'll start to see more of her after her portrayal! If I was able to give 9,5 I would do it, -0,5 points because I do agree a bit about the criticism on the film's artistic licensing where sometime's I felt like breaking out to a song wasn't necessary but I'll let this one pass because it just adds to a better soundtrack album! Wouldn't be against seeing it a second and maybe even a third time (and I almost never do that)!"
"Griever_2112","10","0","3","21 February 2018"," I am not a fan of musicals... but I loved this movie.
","Historical inaccuracies/omissions aside, this was a fantastic movie. This is one of those rare gems that hits every mark and does it well. First off the story and pacing. The movie is 105 mins, and it, for me, never had any slow spots or things that seemed dragged out, it fits a lot into the run time and it never feels rushed. Second the acting, everyone was good, Hugh Jackman, Zendaya, Zac Efron, Keala Settle, Michelle Williams all great performances. Also they made me care about the characters. And third, the music... oh my god, the music... now I have done amateur theater, and been is numerous musicals in my youth. I've seen musical movies, and my kids love Disney movies. I've never enjoyed a musical soundtrack like I have this. All the songs are good, they play well to the characters, and hands down best song in the movie is, again for me, ""From now on"". This is a movie I have no problem recommending ."

","This movie was awesome. It has amazing actors, songs, great plot, and more. This movie has a great climax. The building burns, Hugh Jackman goes into save Zac Efron, and Zac Efron's character almost dies. But then it gets happy again. Honestly it should be the feel-good movie of the century. I think it is...
Anyway... It's just really good. WATCH IT!"

","My dad didn't tell me that this was a musical so I was not expecting this. I was sitting in the movie theater and the whole time I felt like everything was perfect. It was like the feeling of falling in love and not knowing what to do with yourself! I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs to anyone that was passing by that I had just seen the best movie ever! The music was a symphony of beautiful voices and skilled instrument playing with clever lyrics. The only thing I didn't like was Zendaya's ""accent"" that was really only there for like a fourth of the film. But everything else is completely fine!"
"jathayer","9","0","1","12 February 2018"," A wonderfully feel-good film
","Although I will agree that, at times, the plotline borders on somewhat predictable and simple, this film must undeniably be one of the most feel-good I have seen in a long time. With a well-tested combination of hardship, betrayal and romance, as well as fantastic costumes and makeup from the behind-the-scenes departments, it is definitely one to go and see. Found it very atmospheric watching on the big-screen, had tears in my eyes and goose-bumps by the end. I was moved by the strong message of the story regarding acceptance of others for their talents, as opposed to their status or appearance- nice to see this coming from a modern film. Was pleasantly surprised by the singing abilities of Mr. Jackman! 
It has been three weeks since I went to see it, and I have honestly not stopped listening to the soundtracks since- perhaps the best part of the whole thing.
I would happily go and watch again- and even again after that :)"

"cbmilan","7","0","3","8 February 2018"," Absolutely flawless execution of a very predictable, crazy mainstream story.
","This might as well have been a disney movie. The songs felt way more ""cheap disney knockoff"" than broadway musical to me. They felt more like pop music. Catchy as hell though. The production value is absolutely perfect. The cast is amazing. Hugh Jackman carried the entire movie on his freaking back which is saying something when the rest of the cast is also great. <br/><br/>But honestly, substance wise... It's really really predictable. And i guess that 's fine, it just makes this movie more of a ""family movie"" where you can miss half the movie and still enjoy it rather than a story driven film. <br/><br/>Overall, was expecting more from the story, was expecting more from the songs, was blown away by the execution of what it actually was."
"thejacobmello","6","0","2","8 February 2018"," Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello
","A movie that proves, once and for all, it doesn't matter if you're tall or short, fat or thin, black or white, bearded or shaved - ANYONE has the power to become mediocre.<br/><br/>Heading into this one, I felt the same way as most people, I assume - pissed at my lack of options this close to Christmas. The good news is: it was much better than I thought it would be! The bad news is: that's still not that great.<br/><br/>Look, I don't claim to be an expert in the musical genre (a strategy I'd recommend to most) but it seems pretty apparent to me that when making a movie set in the 1870's, you should write your soundtrack around traditional folk music - or hell even big band stuff, we're willing to work with you here - that way, you immerse your audience in the times and set the scene a little. Instead (and I get why, but that doesn't make it anymore forgivable) this group decided the move was to go as 2010's era pop ballad heavy as possible. I can practically hear the KIDZ BOP version already (that's still a thing, right?).<br/><br/>The music wasn't bad, it just didn't fit. Not only in genre, but in terms of the lyrics coinciding with the characters actions. The sideshow performers constantly sang about dancing to the beat of their own drum and telling the world to look out. ""I make no apologies, this is me!"" they would boast. this all of course until the slightest glance darted their way from the Hhhwhite, patriarchal, one percenters. Cue in The Greatest Showman himself - Mr. P.T. Barnum. The creator and controller of said sideshow. We first meet him as but a humble man with a dream - and a handful of dance numbers to go along with his songs about being a humble man with a dream. The problem is, as the first act ends, it becomes more and more clear that his big ""dream"" is pretty much just to somehow get filthy rich to spite his father in law. Believe me, I get it. I mean, damn it, do I get it! But that's not exactly as inspiring a journey as the songs would have us believe.<br/><br/>The real acrobatics in this film were in how they managed to contort the P.T. Barnum story to fit this cutesy 'we're all the same, yet unique' narrative. That being said, even after ignoring the fact that they omitted some seriously appalling details from the real-life story in order to carve out this vibrant wholesome circus tale, the plot was still iffy at best (a man realizes he can profit off the talent, sweat and spectacle of a minority of people who are seen, in their own time, as being subhuman). It was Hugh Jackman's powerful performance as Oskar Schindl-P.T. Barnum that kept this circus alive. A performance I dare say is easily in the running for his second best musical performance in which his characters life trajectory changes after stealing a loaf of bread. 
This film won't stand the test of time and only got as far as it did by juggling around some low hanging fruit, but if you don't care about historical accuracy and are just looking to see some fun dance numbers, eh, it'll do for now.<br/><br/>Prescriptions
For a better Hugh Jackman musical: Watch Les MisÃ©rables.<br/><br/>For a better modern musical: Watch Rent, La La Land(featuring the same lyricists as this film), Dreamgirls."

plus the cinematography was spot on the critics say there voices are auto tuned but i disagree they just prerecorded there voice on to a record which was played during the filming similar to the sound of music 
one more thing the romance between Ann wheeler and Phillip Hugh jack man and Michelle Williams we are so believable there really made you feel for the characters and root for them to succeed <br/><br/>So I recommend going to this film it's a rare treat better then the sound of music gone with the wind and any other film to come out of Hollywood in the last 40 years"

","The critics have been unnecessarily harsh on this movie! This was an amazing movie experience and the audience applauded and cheered when the final credits rolled. The songs were fun and very catchy as it has been over a month since I saw the movie, and the songs are still stuck in my head! The visual effects of this movie were incredible. The song that Hugh Jackman's character and Zac Efron's character perform together is visually stunning and highly entertaining. The only criticism I have with this movie is that with Hugh Jackman's character's backstory is over within 5 minutes. Within those 5 minutes, you find out that this character is poor and his father has died and for me that was very fast tracked. However, I do understand that the movie was already 2 hours long and it would have been longer with any more backstory. Other then that, I really really enjoyed this movie and it is definitely worth a watch!"
"pramsalim","7","0","2","5 February 2018"," As a music video? Definitely 11/10.
","As a movie though? Not quite sure.<br/><br/>Musical is one of the most popular genre in the film industry. Some people don't like it and I have no problem with it. I totally won't bash you with a furious rant on Twitter. I, however, am a very big fan of it. Tap dancing, catchy tunes, gleeful choreographies, those things make my eyes tear up with fascination. Last year we got an almost perfect musical with Damien Chazelle's La La Land. An original musical that caught attention of both viewers and critics alike and was rewarded with the seven Oscar nods for that year. In spirit of La La Land's success, Fox decided to go ahead with their own take on an original musical. They decided to cast Hugh Jackman as its lead. Hugh Jackman was also known for his portrayal of Jean Valjean in the musical Les Miserables, which I also adored. Add up all that factors and you could see that I am really anticipating this movie.
 Is this movie bad? Not at all. In fact, it was very entertaining, and a lot of people liked it. Am I disappointed though? Well, a wee bit. As a movie, I thought it had plenty of flaws. Especially the writing. I felt that it was very sloppy. Every scene felt as though it was only a mean as to get to another musical scene. I couldn't really connect with the characters because only glimpses are seen. Just when we are introduced to a character, the movie abruptly chops their development and suddenly shows us the same character but with a wholly different personality. And I'm just left questioning where it came from. However, it is a musical. And what's a musical without a good musical scene. And when those scenes do come, boy oh boy were they fantastic.
 Every musical scene in this movie is just fantastic. It's pretty much why I love musicals. It's epic, it's romantic and it's emotional. It is very well directed. Knowing that the director came from a background of music videos, no wonder he nailed this down. Every scene was pitch perfect a la 50's musicals. The singing was also great, most of the actors recorded with their own voice and they did not disappoint. And most importantly, the song was really good. This is really important because in the end, the thing that makes musicals so damn memorable, is its fantastic songs. I listened to the album for weeks on end, and apparently, other people do too. In Indonesia's Apple Music top five tracks, apparently four of them were tracks from The Greatest Showman. I also want to point out that the movie's songwriters, were the guys from La La Land, which won an Oscar. That explains why the music's so damn good.
 In the end, it wasn't the La La Land I expected it to be, nor was it the Les Miserables I expected it to be. However, as a musical, it is a damn good musical and an extravagant entertainment for families to enjoy. Yes, take your kids to see this movie because this movie actually has a really good message buried inside it. Especially now, in the age where tolerance is an utmost requirement. Turn off your worries, and let the movie work its magic."

","Everything about this movie is just perfect. The cast, the choreography, the soundtrack, the storyline, the editing, the acting, the sets, the wardrobe - it's all amazing. As soon as the movie started I knew I was going to love it - and I was more than right about that. Even if you don't love the storyline or characters, you will love the soundtrack. Each and every song is amazing in its own unique way and each tells a story. I have listened to the soundtrack so many times I lost count weeks ago. It's so upbeat yet deep and puts you in a great mood. The cast was chosen incredibly and each fit their role just as they should have. Throughout the movie I did definitely cry a bit (happy tears - mostly) and when the credits rolled onto the screen I was definitely sad that it was over. I could have just kept sitting in my chair and watched it again on the spot. I am definitely planning on going to see it again in the cinema, I just haven't got around to it yet (I'm not sure how I've managed to avoid it, but time has just slipped away).

The character played by Zac Efron was probably the most average and non-complex character I have seen in a really long time. He had absolutely no flaws, which became a bore soon. <br/><br/>The song ""Rewrite the Stars"" was probably my least favorite, because I found the relationship between the two characters singing this song to have a really forced romantic relationship. It was quite disappointing.<br/><br/>But, I have to say, I really enjoyed this movie overall, it's one of my favorite musical movies."

","I can not express the joy I experienced after watching this movie. I begrudgingly dragged myself with a friend to a cinema through England's cold and wet night not expecting much of it after the online reviews of the movie. But surely enough it did not disappoint, it brought back a sense of childish wonder within me which at some points through the movie made me smile with wonder like a child in an actual circus. The amazing ensemble along with the amazing musical choices have left me in absolute awe. The movie flowed smoothly ensuring that the songs did not create any sense of disconnect to any of the scenes. The movie left me in such euphoria that not even the inconsiderate shuffling stranger beside me could ruin that night for me, for as I can honestly say that I almost danced my way out of the cinema to Kings Cross Station whilst singing ""The Other Side"". It is truly a movie worth seeing and dare to compare and compete against La La Land."

Sure, the movie was better than so many Hollywood films produced by bigtime studios, but this doesnt reached the expectations if you wanted a movie that is superbly done and inspiring. The story telling was flat, it lacked the theatrical feeling comparing to Lalaland, the movie made you get to your feelings but was short. There was a good song, the rest were so forgettable. Lighting couldve been a lot better especially when they sing a song. It was lacking, overall."
"mytwin-02225","8","0","1","4 February 2018"," It is the Greatest Show!
","Michael Gracey, the director of this film, knows very well what is the biggest selling factor for his film and cleverly puts it at the beginning of the film, right after the company logo sequences. This is perhaps why The Greatest Showman opens with the stunning musical performance led by Hugh Jackman who plays PT Barnum and slowly dissolves his image into the young PT Barnum (Ellis Rubin) as the film narrative would start from that point. The flashforward to hook the audiences by revealing the famous actor isn't a new technique in musical films. Pitch Perfect 3, another musical film that is released at the same month with The Greatest Showman, adopts the similar technique. The film begins with the performance of Barden Bellas in a cruise ship, then the narrative starts from another point which happens much earlier than the opening scene. Both films present its timeline in the middle-beginning-middle-end order, however I must say that in The Greatest Showman the middle and beginning parts are nicely merged together. The use of dissolve as the transition from Hugh Jackman to Ellis Rubin creates a strong visual connection between them.<br/><br/>There are much more to talk about from the opening scene alone, such as active camera movement, great dance choreography, great loudness contrast between Hugh Jackman's sound and the rhythmic stomping feet, impressive lyrics with deep meaning. All of these things show how much the film cares about its visual and auditory impression to its audiences.<br/><br/>The only disappointment for this film would be that a few people don't actually sing when they seem to do it. Hugh Jackman, however, is a special case because he got direct order from his doctor not to sing. But I am really surprised when I know Jenny Lind's singing doesn't come from Rebecca Ferguson who plays the role. It is Lorren Allred. I don't know why the director made this decision as he himself hired Keala Settle from Broadway musical. So why didn't he hire someone like Keala or Zac Efron, a great actor with great voice? It's not that I hate Rebecca Ferguson for not singing in a musical film, but lip-syncing is just an unusual thing in musical films."

","Set design, music, acting, script, this film did it all, except the story. It was so predictable it hurt. The story is one we have seen a thousand times: one of failure and redemption, repeated over and over, and both in life and relationships. The main characters go through it and the supporting ones do to. ""Oh, but it has a great message."" Sure, but we have seen that a million times before too. Family and friendship are important, as are loyalty and love, be true to yourself. It's so cliché, it hurts. I don't like politically charged movies, however, even the obviously political subplots in this film are cliché. <br/><br/>Fortunately, movies aren't just about the story. The music, acting, set design, and script were so great that it makes up for the weaknesses in the story. An 8, therefore, will suffice."

","How could this vivacious movie musical not bring joy to the most joyless critic? It brought joy to me, and I'm a tough one to win over. ""A theater critic who can't find joy in the theater? NOW who's the fraud?"" The audience loved it; I've seen it a few times now, and there is always applause when the final quote comes up. Regarding Barnum, the man, the controllers of Hollow Hollywood only hate him because of his outspoken criticisms of their 1800s ancestors, who, ethically speaking, were not too far removed from the controllers of Hollywood today. They will never tell you this about Barnum: 1) He was a Unionist, activist against the Confederacy. The critics paint him as a racist, claim he ""owned a slave"", but he only took an elderly frail woman on the road with him, when she was too blind and paralyzed to work, and she could not successfully beg for charity on her own, with nobody to look after her in such a vulnerable state. Consider the 1800s and it's lack of any safety net for the poor and elderly: if you could not pry money from the tight grips of the wealthy, by telling them a wildly tall tale and hoping they believe it, chances were high you would starve. Barnum's show saved many otherwise unemployable people from this fate. 2) He really was invited to Buckingham Palace, and his ""Oddities"" really did mingle with Queen Victoria. It is said ""Tom Thumb"", the dwarf, was a multimillionaire, who ""regularly traded barbs with the queen"" - probably the wealthiest dwarf alive back then, and all that wealth was proudly self-made. Tom Thumb also gave generously to charity. Many of the ways in which the circus recruited would violate our labor laws and employment standards today, but the 1800s was very different from now: it was the Wild West. There was no Americans With Disabilities Act, to protect people with disabilities against discrimination, and to guarantee jobs. There was no PETA. It's sad, but true: Survival was every man for himself. I've seen articles which blame Barnum for the animals that perished in the fires set to his museums. To me, that's really reaching; it would be like blaming a family because their pets died in a fire set by an arsonist, meant to attack and bankrupt that family. Barnum was no saint; obviously far from perfect, but we can't just blame him for everything that went wrong. Back then, The circus was just a gamble and an experiment -one we have learned a lot from. Judge any man by the time period he lived in. Today, as a society, we can afford to be more educated, more civilized, more humane, and provide far better safety nets for our poor and downtrodden, that simply did not exist back then. For the few unfortunate oddballs, from around the world, who lived back then, it was the circus or nothing."

"DKosty123","9","0","1","1 February 2018"," Superb Movie./ Show on All Levels
","The story here of PT Barnum is done in a daring musical here, and in the real spirit of the great showman, it works. The point of the greatest showmans life is the show. This movie brings this spirit into the telling of the story perfectly. Jenny Bicks story adaptation to the screen is a greatly paced masterpiece. <br/><br/>The lyrics for the music here are from the same folks who did La La Land, but this music soundtrack leaves that movie in the dust. This is the best musical I have seen in a long time. The mixture of dialogue to musical is perfect. Hugh Jackman is fabulous in the Barnum role. I never saw the live Broadway show Barnum years back, so I am not sure if the film owes anything to that. <br/><br/>I fell in love with Zendaya, playing the Anne Wheeler aerial role. She actually rises to the top of the Co-Starring roles, even though her role was not intended to be a main role. Michelle Williams /Charity Barnum role starts off well, but fades later in the film. She is good, but suffers a bit from lack of script in the last 20 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Zac Efrons/ Phillip Carlyle is excellent acting, and his scenes with Zendaya are electricity in a bottle. The film does get a couple of excellent messages about the society Barnum existed in. The first of these is about the New York City rich elite snobs. These folks really did exist, and in some cases still do. It took the television era to actually get through these walls put up by these puffed up egotistic people. The second is about how Barnum in his shows took down these walls and accepted everyone because he did not start as one of these snobs. His sole purpose was to be the Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>Sometimes Barnum almost certainly, as this story suggests, lost sight of everyone and everything around him trying to promote himself. That is one of the best things this story/movie captures. This is truly, the spirit of Barnum."

Every movie based on truth takes liberties and of course this is no different but that didn't have an effect on the movie. The soundtrack was moving. There wasn't a song I did not enjoy. As a musician myself I feel that if music makes you feel strong emotions then it has done its job and was well written. During the movie I found myself getting a bit choked up. I don't know why and I can't pin point a reason or connection but something about the music just made me feel emotional. The cast was great and the choice for actors was wonderful. It was definitely well cast as the actors looked like what I thought the real personas would look like. I've never been a big fan of musicals but this is one I would gladly watch again and again. For Michael Gracey this was about as good of a directorial debut as you could have.

","Little did I know that when I told the missus that we had a ""Great Escape"" movie pass we needed to use before the end of January, and to pick something she wanted to see, that we would be sitting down in a nearly empty theatre, waiting for what would soon become one of the best movies we've seen in several years. <br/><br/>From the opening title cards, then BOOM straight into a glorious musical number that sets the stage for the rollercoaster ride of spectacular visuals, incredible music and a sweeping range of emotion. <br/><br/>The decision to make the soundtrack a collection of contemporary-styled songs works perfectly against the Victorian-era backgroup of P.T. Barnum's journey. Every song is exceptionally well-written and married perfectly to its scene. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast supporting Hugh Jackman are all talented performers, delivering great vocals and touching spoken scenes. Excellent choreography highlights the power of the vocals, without distracting from them. The writers even managed to work in a little social commentary without being ridiculously heavy-handed about it. <br/><br/>Visually, it is a riot of color, interspersed with bleak vignettes of grays and black, with incredible cinematic impact. If there was greenscreen/mocap/CGI, it was perfectly blended in. <br/><br/>We left the theatre wrung out, but enthralled with this film. I immediately bought and downloaded the soundtrack, and I've pre-ordered the Blu-Ray. If they release an extended edition, I'll order that, too. <br/><br/>This is a movie that will see regular rotation on my home media server, along with other great movies like The Shawshank Redemption, Newsies, Frozen, Unforgiven, The Godfather and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1. One of those movies that even when you own it on tape/DVD/BluRay, if you happen across it while channel-surfing, you stop and watch it, even if it's halfway through already.<br/><br/>In a word, perfection.

"chrisjhembury","8","0","1","30 January 2018"," The Greatest Showman ****
","The Greatest Showman is musical that tells the story of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman) as he creates the circus and instigates start of modern show biz in this glitzy Hollywood singalong.
We see P.T Barnum's story unfold from a toddler to the entrepreneur that creates the world's first circus creating a home and business for anyone of life's out cast to come to and be celebrated for their individual uniqueness. Whether it's the bearded lady, the Irish Giant, the dog boy or world's fattest man they now become the stars of the show!
 
The narrative structure is stronger than one would have expected and carries the story at a good beat, which is not always the case but pleasant viewing here.<br/><br/>
The cast lead by the enthusiastic Jackman who you can tell is loving every minute of this opportunity to flex his singing and dancing talents is on top form performing his socks off wit the energy like his first year in Drama school. Backed up with a strong cast like Zac Efron who has less to do than Hugh but still shows his strong High School Musical routes and joins in the film effortlessly.<br/><br/>With a great cast and catchy songs any lovers of the genre who were sat on the fence with LA LA LAND can rest assured this musical knows what it's doing and performs the genre majestically.
Some Critics have said the film's rebranding of the true life story deflects from the real life gritty aspects but I honestly think the glitzy make over with Hugh Jackman in the lead would get the approval of the spot light loving Barnum.<br/><br/>With strong messages about outcasts, lower classes vs higher classes, snobbery and acceptance the film advocates good morals and life lessons.
A great feel good modern Hollywood Musical at it's best.
As the film quotes
""The noblest art is that of making others happy""
-- P. T. Barnum<br/><br/>And in this day and age that ain't no bad thing."

","The Greatest Showman is a fantastic movie with a really well developed plot and a stellar cast. The film is, by all technicalities, a biography on P.T. Barnum, the man who created the concept of the circus, but it tells his story in a really fresh, unconventional way, while also exaggerating and altering many aspects of his life. It is like a throwback to classic, timely musicals from the 50s, creating a tone and atmosphere very similar to those. As well as that, every number is beautifully written, choreographed and performed, I can see songs such as A Million Dreams and From Now On standing the test of time. <br/><br/>I will say that they did not portray the quirkiness of Barnum as much as the trailers and any facts I would have heard about this man's life would have suggested. There seemed to have been a lot of aspects taken out that would have made for a much more unconventional main character, I have no gripes with Jackman's excellent performance, I just felt the writers made Barnum in to too much of a typical everyman. <br/><br/>The cast is marvelous, shining in both dramatic scenes and high octane musical numbers. Hugh Jackman is the life and soul of this film and is immersed in to this man's life from beginning to end, Michelle Williams plays a complicated, torn wife beautifully, Zac Efron conveys his character's growth throughout the movie immensely well and Zendaya brings a lot of truth to the film, every other member of the cast is just as terrific, fitting perfectly in to this world. <br/><br/>A breathtaking spectacle. Heartwarming and pure, The Greatest Showman teaches us not to be afraid to dream, and to embrace our individuality, I would certainly recommend it to anybody looking for a good musical.<br/><br/>
After losing his job, a man decides to pursue his dream of performing and creating a spectacle unlike any other. <br/><br/>
Best Performance: Hugh Jackman"
"asda-man","8","0","1","29 January 2018"," Great Show!
","""Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for"" are the first words Hugh Jackman warbles in this box office smash hit. I'm not entirely sure that the world has been waiting for a jazz-handed, all-singing, all-dancing musical about P.T Barnum (the man who invented the business of show) but the audience numbers prove otherwise. Like a bad penny, Jackman's returned to the world of musicals, only he's looking a little happier in this one compared to Tom Hooper's sprawling adaptation of Les Miserables and his voice is sounding a little better too! Or is that just the autotune? 
Either way, Jackman and the rest of the cast look like they're having the time of their lives in Michael Gracey's infectiously joyous debut. I must admit to being a little apprehensive about seeing it, fearing the worst for a High School Musical-esque cheese-fest, but was immediately drawn in by the spectacular visuals and mighty music. From start to finish, The Greatest Showman does what P.T Barnum knew how to do best, entertain. The film moves at a glorious pace, piling on the impressive images and sounds until your senses feel overwhelmed. Gracey displays great skill and confidence from behind the camera, at best it displays similarities to Baz Luhrmann's musical masterpiece, Moulin Rouge! It's hard to believe that this is a film from a first-time director.
Unfortunately it's the screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Oscar-winner Bill Condon which stop this show from soaring to the heights of Zendaya's pink-haired trapeze artist. The story is undeniably cliché and predictable. It's the rags to riches tale we've all seen countless times before, only this time with more song and dance routines. The film almost peaks too early by rushing through Barnum's rise to stardom and then not giving our hero much to do through the rest of the running time. A flat love story is introduced between Zac Efron (who remains fully-clothed for once) and Zendaya but neither character is developed enough for us to care what happens. Shock, horror, Hugh gets too fame obsessed and ends up neglecting his wife and children only to realise his sins in the end so we can neatly tie a bow and let the credits roll. There are also moments of sugary sentimentality enough to make even the soppiest person cringe.
But in the end none of that matters, The Greatest Showman is a pleasure of the guiltiest kind. It knows exactly what kind of film it is and it does it very well. There isn't a duff song in the film, although that's no surprise given that the lyrics were penned by the duo who wrote for last year's stupendous La La Land. The choreography is also top-notch, daring you not to take your eyes away from the screen. Despisers of musicals might want to steer clear, but those who are a sucker for a catchy showtune will undoubtedly find a lot to admire. It's perhaps not something I'd shout from the rooftops and ruin my street cred, but I was a big fan and strangely I can't wait to see it again."

","I'd like to make one point on this right off the back: I usually try to take it easy on critics when there's a discrepancy between them and the public view of a film, but they are legitimately hard to trust on this one. Mainly, because many take themselves far too seriously and can't get over that one of the main sources of conflict is from a stuck up theater critic. What's rich is how little self awareness they have, as when they complain to no end about a critic acting like a miserable snob in a movie, they're pretty much proving the movie right.<br/><br/>Critics who immediately find the need to dislike a movie based on whether or not it has a snobby critic character, I implore you: take a look in the mirror and learn how to laugh at what you see. You'll find yourself much happier with your life.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I see about the movie is that it's not historically accurate. Which... I mean... if you have a problem that the movie where everyone breaks into a musical number whenever they're feeling an emotion might not tell the exact story of what went down 100% accurately, I weep for your family.<br/><br/>Now, the movie: it's great. Really great. In fact it's one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in a movie theater in a long time. I can't remember the last time I walked into a theater and was out in a brisk hour and 45 minutes, but I wish it was the case more often.<br/><br/>In just that amount of time, the movie had everything: it had enjoyable and relatable characters, solid comedy, drama, conflict, development and yeah musical numbers that holy crap, were actually good and enhanced the production more than it hurt it. I had a smile on my face when I was meant to, I felt tension was I was meant to and I was fully invested in every moment, even as someone that isn't typically fond of musicals.<br/><br/>The film is lead by the typically brilliant Hugh Jackman, who you originally think will annoyingly enter the realm of an ultra-romanticized saint of a human being only for the film to turn around and show moments of weakness. You begin to see his obsessive devotion to becoming universally renowned, and the mistakes that he makes as a result. This may not be an accurate portrayal of the real human, but it is an unmistakably human story and Jackman delivers it perfectly.<br/><br/>Also effective in the film to my shock and awe is Zac Efron. Ever since my mom used played 17 Again on loop while I was living with my parents, I've deliberately avoided his films out of sheer contempt for my own Vietnam flashbacks. But damn, this guy is good. He can sing, he can dance and can sure as hell act. Respect.<br/><br/>I can continue to point out the actors who did a great job with their performances, but the truth is, they are all great. Go on imdb and place your finger on a random cast member. They were great in the movie. Guaranteed.<br/><br/>You would expect this movie to be primarily driven by Hugh Jackmans character, and that's only true to an extent. Ultimately this is a film about acceptance, no matter your race, gender or any other quality that makes you different. A bit obvious, sure, but it works in the musical genre. To that end though, as much as the film was carried by Hugh Jackman, it was equally carried by his band of colorful characters. Their mutual story of finding a purpose and acceptance through Barnum's circus is well told and well performed by each and every one of them. The bearded lady was especially a standout. Her musical number ""This is Me"" received an ovation after it was over. It's available on YouTube but the context of the movie is what really makes it a moving piece.<br/><br/>I didn't give the deserved ovation after the particular musical performance because I'm shy, but allow me to do my part and give it a standing ovation now. Wonderful film."

","Since 'Moulin Rouge' was first released in 2001, there have been a few tries to get closer to that magic engagement, and Michael Gracey's first shot on cinema landed not too far from it. 13 Oscar nominations were given to the incredibly overrated La La Land, and let me say that, if the critics relaxed and tried to enjoy this movie since the beginning, The Greatest Showman would end up deserving even more if we use the 'enjoyability' scale, which would destroy any Gosling-Stone duet. The story of an american dreamer, an ambitious and reckless father that transmits nothing but joy and rule breaking values giving a chance to the left behinds of the early 20th century in New York. Although seen as freaks at the beginning, Mr. Barnum, played by a great Hugh Jackman, manages to turn this into an ode to differences hand in hand with Zac Efron, whose performance will soon make those HSM fans feel that he has come back, reinforcing the idea that he can be more than a six-pack. A big shout out to the excellent game of lights and cinematography of the film, where the colorful and magical shots of the performers, combined with great camera movement (slow-mo epic included), create this enchanted atmosphere. The Greatest Showman drama is a fairytale, with some of the most popular stigma-plot out there, but never too old to stop remembering them. Mr. Barnum's story will not make history in cinema, but 105 minutes of pure entertainment and joy-shots to refill your stamina, ambitions and dreams are more than guaranteed."

","As a heavy cinema-goer, I pride myself in being able to sort the chaff from the wheat from a movie trailer.

A stunning piece of work, which operates on multiple levels to narrate messages of diversity, adversity, life, joy and inspiration.

"luttrellhenshawsam","10","0","1","24 January 2018"," Please, for the love of god, don't listen to the critics and go see this amazing musical!
","Honestly, I'm shocked. It's difficult to find the words to describe this movie, it's just so... incredible. Everything about it. 
The only thing that has annoyed me about it are the critics. Straight after watching this I got on imdb and found all the positive reviews and an averaged score of 8.0. And then, Rotten Tomatoes, the website that likes to take the joy out of every movie possible by nitpicking every. single. thing. (Like, seriously WHO TF SAYS ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HOME ALONE??!!) But critics (not all critics, but a few) are usually so picky about movies that they can't sit down and enjoy something, but luckily, the audience clearly did (55% vs 90%. Need I say more?)
So all I'm saying to everyone is do NOT research critic reviews before watching a movie, because you could be missing out on something amazing. And I'm extremely glad I didn't get to miss out on this musical. The beautiful sets, intriguing characters and powerful message about being yourself told in a unique, non-cliché way. Not to mention that every single song is just BRILLIANT and I had to download every song straight after the movie was finished. Hugh Jackman was perfect as the main role, he's now one of my favourite actors. The singing and acting was outstanding and there wasn't a single second of dullness. PLEASE watch this movie, even if you want to avoid musicals like the plague. It's got a strong message and is both touching and fun. It is one of THE BEST films I have ever seen and my new favourite musical. In fact, as I'm writing this review I'm listening to ""This Is Me"". I can't say anymore, just go see it, ignore the reviews and enjoy this movie :)"

","The Greatest Showman is the most perfect movie to come out of Hollywood in recent years.<br/><br/>I don't mean that it was my favorite, and it perhaps not even reach into my top 10. There are many movies that I hold dearer for their flaws and quirks.<br/><br/>That said, everything about the greatest showman was polished to perfection. The sets - magical! The broadway production - on the mark! The story - sensational!<br/><br/>The biggest hint of its success was the nonstop train of tension which seemed to switch tracks constantly. There was racial notes, generational divides, and multiple love stories. However, most movies would struggle to pull all of these together into a single theme. Which sets up the question, what is The Greatest Showman's greatest theme?<br/><br/>My answer would ultimately be escapism. There is a certain meta-aware aspect of this. The movie experience is our modern circus, and we go to escape a diverse and multiplying set of tensions outside the theatre. The true value of the Greatest Showman is pulling us away from constant and evergreen struggles like race relations, progressive vs. regressive powers, and finding love.<br/><br/>And it succeeds."

","The movie The Greatest Showman was released in 2017. The actor includes Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Zendara. The film was directed by Michael Gracey. This movie is a romance movie. And the movie took place in New York.<br/><br/>The Greatest Showman plays up and waters down Barnum's narrative to position him as a social reject in his own right, determined to support his wife Charity (Michelle Williams) and their two daughters to such an extent that they want for nothing. He's a blustering charmer, a man quick with words and hip to what audiences really want when they want to be amused. He also has a big heart, apparently, so as he goes about assembling his motley crew, made up of bearded ladies (Keala Settle), dwarves (Sam Humphrey), tattooed men (Shannon Holtzapffel), acrobats (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and trapeze artists (Zendaya), he unwittingly assembles an ersatz family for himself, for his stars and for his co-partner in petty hucksterism, Phillip (Zac Efron).<br/><br/>The movie have a meaning that people who looks ugly but if they try their best to perform they will find the place in the public to make a business. Bermum is a person who wants everything to be better but when he have enoguh he cannot stop. Happiness is the thing we have a person must know (enough). <br/><br/>In conclution this movie has many beautiful actors, good meaning and good musics. It is suitable for all ages."

"areneehunt","9","0","1","22 January 2018"," Great Movie As Long As You Remember: It's Not A Musical Biography!
","I've always loved musicals. I grew up on them, from both sides of my family, so seeing The Greatest Showman's movie trailer had me a bit concerned. I mean, yea, Hugh Jackman is amazingly handsome, a fantastic actor and could move like wolverine-ish lightning, but could he sing. Could he really pull off such a elegant performance? OF COURSE HE COULDThe title says it all- The Greatest Showman is the telling of Phineas Taylor Barnum, though not a biography. This Broadway movie is more like a fantasy. With colors that lit up the large screen, energetic moves that was weren't always from dancing, and lyrics that made you swoon, The Greatest Showman was one of the best bits of entertainment I've seen this year!<br/><br/>But you have to understand, while watching, this is not who Barnum actually was. It's a movie. A really fun movie, but that is all. He really wasn't a good man. He got incredibly rich from the misery of his acts. None were as happy and cheerful, as with he movie. But who wants to know the gory details, right? Especially about Lind and Barnum splitting over financial differences, instead of unrequited love...<br/><br/>All in all, I found myself just as mesmerized with The Greatest Showman, about half as much as when I see West Side Story- a real musical/Broadway play that kicks butt! Hugh Jackman did an incredible job, though he's much older than when Barnum began his circus. Zendaya, a woman I'd never seen before the movie, was sweet and sings beautifully. And Keala Settle has a huge voice. I believe I read this was her first movie.<br/><br/>So if you want to hear an incredible soundtrack, see bright lights and colors that leap from the screen, along with fun jump and shouts- this is your movie. The Greatest Showman will probably wind up in my iTunes library, along with the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

"bankofmarquis","6","0","4","21 January 2018"," Whole does not add up to the sum of it's parts
","Have you ever heard of the phrase ""The whole does not equal the sum of it's parts""? If you need evidence of what this phrase means, check out THE GREATEST SHOWMAN.<br/><br/>Starring Hugh Jackman, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN follows the life of PT Barnum, who brought himself up from nothing to become one of the most famous (if not THE most famous) promoter (some would say huckster) of all time. This film is a musical and I couldn't think of a better subject matter for a musical than this.<br/><br/>And it starts off promising - the Opening number is fun and upbeat...and then the plot (what there is of it) kicks in...and then there's another ""show-stopper"" musical number...and then there's more weak plot...and ANOTHER show-stopper musical number and then...<br/><br/>You get the picture.<br/><br/>Let's start with what works - the songs. Written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (LA LA LAND, Broadway's DEAR EVAN HANSON), the songs are catchy and show-stoppery, the perfect building blocks for eye-catching, fast-paced, quick cutting, movie spectaculars. And that's part of the problem. This film jumps from ""show-stopper"" to ""show-stopper"" - there was no variety. It's kind of like eating cupcakes. The first one is really good and tasty. The 2nd one - still good, but a little less so, and so on. By the time you get to your fifth cupcake, you're sick of cupcakes and are yearning for a carrot. Such is the case here. If you take any one of these songs on their own, you'll be entertained. But - after awhile - I was just yearning for some variety.<br/><br/>Unfortunately...I couldn't find the variety that I was looking for in the plot. Calling the script by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon slight would be doing a disservice to the word slight. It clearly is just an excuse to get us to the next ""show-stopper"" song. None of the characters are really fleshed out (including Barnum) they are all pretty one note, with one goal (respect) and one obstacle (she has a beard! his parents don't approve of him! she married beneath her!) that all get resolved in a song.<br/><br/>As for the performances, they are all pretty one-note as well. Hugh Jackman is all bravado as Barnum, never wavering in his appetites, his panache and his cockiness. Jackman has a million dollar smile and he flashes it constantly. The usually reliable Michelle Williams is acting in another movie than Jackman. Her scenes with Jackman as Barnum's wife don't really hit the mark and only at the end does her true acting chops show (and shows just how far better of an actress she is than everyone else in the film).<br/><br/>To be honest, I kind of found myself rooting for the Zac Efron/Zendaya love story part of this film. These are two very photgenic, charismatic performers - with strong song and dance chops - and when they're love song came on screen I was into it - except it was the 5th cupcake I had by that time. I really found myself wishing that their song was the dessert and not served as part of the main meal.<br/><br/>Special notice should be given to Rebecca Ferguson's performance as Jenny Lind. Her number, NEVER ENOUGH, had me engaged throughout. It was only later that I discovered that the singing was done by Loren Allred. That disappointed me until my wife pointed out that I was ""fooled"" by this and should just roll with it. I gotta admit that Ferguson acted the heck out of the role (and the song), so I'll give this one a pass.<br/><br/>As for the ""freaks"" in Barnum's show - there is a reason I haven't mentioned them. Keala Settle has the lead in the ""show-stopper"" number ""This is Me"" (a lock to win the Oscar for best song), but none of these characters are fleshed out and are even less than one-note (if this is even possible).<br/><br/>Ultimately, I lay the blame for this film on Director Michael Gracey. This is his theatrical film debut as a Director, and maybe that is why this film,is disjointed. Perhaps with a stronger, more experienced director of motion picture musicals like Rob Marshall or Damien Chazelle, there would have been some nuance and some change of pace and mood. We'll never know...and that's too bad, for the pieces of a good film musical were there.<br/><br/>They just didn't add up.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B-<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"aryassen","9","0","1","21 January 2018"," Incredible voices, vibrant scenes
","I'm not that much into musicals, but this got me simply mesmerised. I didn't know what to expect to be honest, and I was a bit sceptical when the curtains rolled up, but scene after scene I was just pulled in more and more, and by ""never enough"", I was cooked, flambé'd and (well) done completely. <br/><br/>All characters are really performing at their best, even the supporting roles are superb! Obvously the songs are are the ""bread and butter"" here, and they are great (I mean, really great), but it doesn't stop there: the characters are not 2 dimensional, the costumes are fantastic, and the settings just bring alive the period it is all set in. The story only loosely follows the ""true""events, but who cares: it is human, it is emotional, it is enchanting, elevating and sometimes heart-wrenching...somehow making the power of pursuing dreams to the full tangible (along with the related costs of such an endeavour).<br/><br/>Definitely, defintely worth the time to be spent at the cinema, and can't wait to get it on DVD (the songs and scenes just keep haunting me, so youtube till then - but this will get onto the self, that's for sure)."
"aarontjohnston","10","0","1","21 January 2018"," ""Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the moment you've waiting for!""
","First off, I personally would give the film a 9.5/10. To get the negatives out the way first, some CGI shots were a little iffy but they didn't detract from the film. Now! On with the show!<br/><br/>Having seen La La Land last year, a critically acclaimed musical that won several awards, I walked away incredibly disappointed at a film I still believe as, arguably, over-exaggerated. And in comparison, critics began to destroy this film when it was first released. Having now seen it for myself I think it is fair to say its a musical done right! From the very opening of the film we, the audience, are drawn in straight away. <br/><br/>The opening number is flashy, glitzy and ultimately makes us feel like little children once again - marveling at the circus. It is impossible not to smile, and Michael Gracey keeps us smiling throughout. Songs can sometimes feel misplaced but Gracey perfectly makes each number flow with the story. In fact, they ARE the story. No song feels out of place nor leaves you feeling anything less than joyous. The film makes you want to imagine and believe in the impossible and does an excellent job of it. Relentless action keeps the film upbeat and never hits an off-note. Each character is believable and their singing is unbelievable. Its very hard not to run, skip and jump out of the cinema on the way to buying the soundtrack.<br/><br/>An amazing film for all the family that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face! And just like Barnum, it's best not to listen to the critics.
So come one, come all to see Phineas Taylor Barnum and his Greatest Show!"
"jkylebennett","9","0","1","21 January 2018"," Stellar!

This movie is an experience that needs to be seen. I think if there is anything that I have to consider as a negative for the movie, it's just that some things are rather predictable. You could tell was some of the situations were going to lead to. But, to say that this movie is a masterpiece to behold is nothing short of 100% true. This movie is a must see for anyone's movie list. In fact, it should be at the top of the list."

Every song in this film is amazing, and I've had them stuck in my head ever since I watched it. Hugh Jackman is fantastic, Zac Efron and Zendaya have the most onscreen chemistry I've seen outside of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and the whole thing is a triumph."
"Icedooitle","8","0","1","20 January 2018"," No History Lesson, Just Joy
","If ever there were a musical that can get away with manipulative character development, hokey plot lines, and complete misrepresentation of history with 9 layers of gloss, the story of P.T. Barnum would be it. The Greatest Showman leans so heavily on just a few (but marvelous) elements that it's hard to imagine that the whole tent doesn't just come crashing down. There's a good reason you might find it hard to believe that the 1850's New York portrayed in Greatest Showman, takes place (concurrently) only blocks from the filthy streets in Gangs of New York. That's because it didn't. We are being shown a shamelessly white-washed fairy tale that cares little to educate, but will do anything to dazzle... P.T. Barnum would've been proud.<br/><br/>How Barnum differs from other historical figures of his ilk is that he's more fascinating than beloved. If you were to shake his hand after a show, marveling at his pomp and costume, you may also be tempted to check for your wallet as you walk away. So, when a movie like The Greatest Showman oversimplifies the exploits of history's biggest perpetrator of exploitation, it might as well swing for the fences.<br/><br/>The film begins with silent movie titles and heavy beats that evoke The Colosseum and Imagine Dragons. Hugh Jackman's whisper carries us into the opening number ""Greatest Show,"" which lets you know this movie hinges and sustains its fate on the music. A powerful choir punctuates Jackman's capable baritone as the track moves seamlessly from punk, to rock, to hip-hop, to vaudeville. The cynic in me retired from the on-deck circle and told my inner-child to grab a bat. For the rest of the evening I was smiling like a fool and singing 9 of the catchiest songs I've heard written for a single movie in... maybe ever. If your only bellwether for Jackman's musical talents is Les Miserables, just know that the man had a Tony on his shelf years before he donned the adamantium claws. He is more than up to the challenge.<br/><br/>When the fantasy of The Greatest Show fades into Barnum's childhood, forlornly gazing at a ringleader costume at his father's tailor shop, we see that the dream sequence isn't far removed from the movies slick set pieces. We settle on his childhood for just long enough to get the next number, A Million Dreams. Ellis Rubin's remarkable vocals carry us into the adult Barnum where Jackman and new bride Michelle Williams dance on the roof of a decrepit tenement building where they start a family with two adorable daughters. The music picks back up on the roof to the same tune of A Million Dreams, just three octaves higher. I sat in me seat thinking, ""I don't know if my heart can handle it if these little girls start singing,"" I hid my face behind my Coke.<br/><br/>Barnum's rise to power at this point is rushed through with little conflict. I'll confess to being a bit disappointed at the low gravity of the adventure. An Ocean's 11 style sequence gets the gang of ""freaks"" together for Barnum's risky start-up. He funds this through means appropriate to the character. Jackman takes Barnum into highs that are glittering and lows that never feel too low. The story is not quite as weak as the songs are strong, making it all very forgivable. For example, Barnum turns away from his business and family after hearing a single song from an opera singer (Rebecca Ferguson.) How good would that song have to be for that plot turn to make sense? You'll see.<br/><br/>You might not be surprised to find that Jackman, Efron, Zendaya, and Keala Settle (of Broadway fame) bring powerful voices and dancing to the film. So you may be delighted to hear that Michelle Williams keeps up with seeming ease, even soloing her own number, Tightrope. Ferguson is the only first billed member that is dubbed over, though it is done wonderfully by The Voice contestant, Loren Allred.<br/><br/>I walked out of The Greatest Showman feeling like I hadn't learned a single thing about P.T. Barnum's real life. There may be a movie one day that aims to reveal the fascination and ugliness of Barnum's time, personal flaws, and impact on the world. That is not this film. The Greatest Showman is a celebration of the lie that Barnum sold the world for decades. Even after they all knew it was a gimmick by a gifted hoodwinker, they still stood in line eager to hand over their two-bits for the privilege. I knew at the ten minute mark that if I was to be entertained, it would be superficially. This would be a film that holds little value on paper and would bring out the worst in my cynicism if I let it. It may speak little to my instincts as a critic that I found it easy to set that negativity aside, but it also hardened my resolve to be the moviegoer I want to be. Then again, maybe I'm one of the suckers born every minute."

","At last we saw a great musical after many years of forgettable films like la la land.
 last time I enjoyed....I really enjoyed a musical was in last decade when I saw hairspray.
 hairspray was good and had nice songs but the greatest showman was something else.
 everything was great in the movie.
 the chemistry the actors had was fantastic.
 the lead actress was a dream and her two daughters.
 the music was divine especially the songs million dreams and never enough.
 there 2-3 also more great songs like this is me the great show and written in the stars.
 don't forget to buy not only the dvd but the cd too.
 this is the best musical so far in this century and deserves to be include in the all time best musical list together with legends like west saint story the sound of music, grease, the king and and other greats of the past century.
 first 30 or so minutes in the film were a dream. a straight A grade.
 then the movie lost a bit of the magic as not all the songs were great and the script had a few issues as to why things were happening the way they did but soon the movie picked up again and overall if it's not deserve an A grade it gets a B +++ = 9 out of 10 easily.

That's the magic of this film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack has been playing on my mind since I watched the film and I ended up buying it and have been listening to it consistently.<br/><br/>There does seem to be a major disconnect with critics, where Star Wars The Last Jedi was loved and praised (yet it made a mockery of the Star Wars universe and I felt Luke's was just not Luke), and this film has been panned by them.<br/><br/>I hope if you watch the movie, you enjoy as much as I did.

","So, when I first saw the trailers for this movie I didn't want to see it because it was about the start of the circus and I am completely against circuses with animals in them and I know the real PT Barnum was a bad guy but I decided to see it because I love musicals and Zac Efron and now I've already seen it twice!!! The music is so amazing in it and there is such energy and heart in this film! You could tell everyone who worked on it put a lot of work into it. This is one of my favorite musicals ever and I'm obsessed with the songs. This music makes you feel so good inside and it's so inspiring. It's a great film for families, for anyone really."

"chrisjhembury","8","0","1","16 January 2018"," Fun, Hollywood Musical with great catchy soundtrack
","The Greatest Showman is musical that tells the story of P.T Barnum (Hugh Jackman) as he creates the circus and instigates start of modern show biz in this glitzy Hollywood singalong.<br/><br/>We see P.T Barnum's story unfold from a toddler to the entrepreneur that creates the world's first circus creating a home and business for anyone of life's out cast to come to and be celebrated for their individual uniqueness. Whether it's the bearded lady, the Irish Giant, the dog boy or world's fattest man they now become the stars of the show!<br/><br/>The narrative structure is stronger than one would have expected and carries the story at a good beat, which is not always the case but pleasant viewing here.<br/><br/>The cast lead by the enthusiastic Jackman who you can tell is loving every minute of this opportunity to flex his singing and dancing talents is on top form performing his socks off wit the energy like his first year in Drama school. Backed up with a strong cast like Zac Efron who has less to do than Hugh but still shows his strong High School Musical routes and joins in the film effortlessly.<br/><br/>With a great cast and catchy songs any lovers of the genre who were sat on the fence with LA LA LAND can rest assured this musical knows what it's doing and performs the genre majestically.<br/><br/>Some Critics have said the film's rebranding of the true life story deflects from the real life gritty aspects but I honestly think the glitzy make over with Hugh Jackman in the lead would get the approval of the spot light loving Barnum.<br/><br/>With strong messages about outcasts, lower classes vs higher classes, snobbery and acceptance the film advocates good morals and life lessons.<br/><br/>A great feel good modern Hollywood Musical at it's best.<br/><br/>As the film quotes 
""The noblest art is that of making others happy"" 
-- P. T. Barnum<br/><br/>And in this day and age that ain't no bad thing."

"paigethefran","5","0","4","15 January 2018"," Flashy and Fun, but Not Anything Special
","This movie has a beautiful color palette, gorgeous cinematography, and it's a fun movie to see with your family or friends. The acting is fun, the music is great, but that's about where the positives stop.<br/><br/>As a movie, the structure of this film is rather unbalanced. There isn't a lot of character development, expect in Hugh Jackman's character. Zac Efron's character starts as a bit of a scoundrel, he gives off a very laid back feel to his polished lifestyle, and then immediately that whole element of his character is abandoned, and traded in for a hard-working, loyal, and honest character. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but it happened almost instantaneously, so there's almost no emotional connection to this new and improved character at all, because we didn't see his journey from becoming a high and mighty, arrogant big shot to a hard-working and honest man. <br/><br/>The acting for the most part is pretty well done. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Zendaya definitely brought their A-Game to this movie. The only problem with acting I had was with the child actors, but that can be overlooked since they aren't really in the movie that much. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought this movie looked gorgeous, the costumes, lighting, and special effects were all great. It wasn't anything groundbreaking or spectacular, it was just a bit of fun. This is a great movie for kids or anyone who loves theater, but as a movie, it doesn't stand against some of the masterpieces that came out in the same year."

"keatingpaul","9","0","1","13 January 2018"," A Most Enjoyable Show
","Splashy and entertaining original musical based on the life of circus master P.T. Barnum. The biopic depicts him as a saintly protector of misfits which is contrary to what history books say that he was a vulgar man who exploited people and held little value for animal rights. If you excuse the movie's inaccurate sanitized details of his life and assess it as a creative product, you will find many elements to love. Among them are the memorable songs courtesy of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who were partly responsible for the award-winning song City of Stars from La La Land as well the stage play Dear Evan Hansen, the production design, whirling cinematography, robust choreography, engaging performances from Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams and Keala Settle. Jackman is a bit old for his role as the greatest showman but his pure energy and commitment make up for it. Efron enjoys one of his better works in years (remember that debacle called Baywatch?) while Williams is lovely and always watchable. Settle almost steals the movie with her powerful vocals. There are parts which are reminiscent of Moulin Rouge which happens to have been directed by another Australian. This is one of the few times that a movie could have used more running time to dig deeper on Barnum's motivations in making the greatest show on the earth."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","0","1","13 January 2018"," Some of the best Songs of the year
","I liked it. It was not a perfect movie by any means but it was quite an entertaining turn with some truly fabulous and entertaining songs.
The biggest problem I had with it was probably Michael Gracey's direction which was not very satisfying and felt amateurish at times, and so did some of the choreographies (not all). The acting was solid and good but did not have a performance that truly out stood. Hugh Jackman was good but I preferred him this year in ""Logan"" and also his musical turn in ""Les Miserables"" was better. Zac Efron was okay, but a bit flat, and so was his character. Michelle Williams was good and had some good moments, probably the best performance in the whole film. Rebecca Furgeson was also good for the limited and one dimensional material she had to work with. Another good performance came from Keala Settle. 
The look was good, in particular the costume work. The screenplay deserved some work, as it was probably a bit too straight forward, at least you could expect exactly what is going to happen so it was yeah, very predictable. But as mentioned in the beginning, I truly enjoyed the songs which were all through amazing. Kudos to the work of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul who after La La Land hit once again and that let me forget some of the flaws the film has."

"cruise01","10","0","1","12 January 2018"," Fantastic and one of the best musicals that has such a powerful emotional story.
","The Greatest Showman surpassed my expectations for a musical historical drama film. Definitely, one of the best films of the year. It has everything you can expect in a musical. The plot is emotional and beautiful at the same time, the musical set pieces are fantastic and the songs are just beautiful. The cast were all great with there characters. I enjoyed every minute of the film. It nearly has everything and an inspirational love story that will make you have tears and smile in the end. <br/><br/>The plot follows P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), who was once a tailor's boy and struggled throughout his childhood with providing food for his father. He fell in love with his childhood sweetheart Charity (Michelle Williams). They grew up and married and had kids. His work goes bankrupt with him having the struggle to afford a roof over his family. He decides to open a circus with extraordinary people. He inspires them to join, that they should not be afraid to hide their appearances. It does create a crowd outrage, when people who are judgmental disapprove of there show starts backfirin. P.T. will need the help from a famous singer to help draw the crowd in. But when it will be too much when P.T. loses himself from the greed of one than being part of a bigger family. <br/><br/>What I liked about the film is everything about it. It has a beautiful love story. P.T. struggles to build himself and able to support his family. By struggling to bring in a crowd to his shows to earning enough to buy Charity's family estate home. He puts a team together that will eventually be one big family. He brings in a lost actor Phillip (Zac Efron) to his circus family where he falls for Anne (Zendaya), which would create a backlash from the judgmental public about their race and relationship. It is a cute heartwarming love story, were one gives it all up for their love ones. <br/><br/>The musical set pieces are just astonishing. The music soundtrack was great. Every cast did well with there singing. Even if it was recorded at the studio and lip sync. The music was great. The Greatest Showman song was fantastic and even the rewriting the stars set piece done by Zac Efron and Zendaya was just beautiful and it was really hard to take your eyes off the screen from this sequence. I am not a huge fan of musicals since it eventually falls flat or there are some songs that gets boring. Not The Greatest Showman. Every song was great, even when some songs are done again. It was great and it worked with the story and characters in the film. It was never boring. Hugh Jackman was amazing. Zac Efron did great. Michelle Williams was good. Zendaya is beautiful and her character did great. <br/><br/>Overall, The Greatest Showman is such a great film. Every musical song was amazing. It delivers emotions and joy when watching these characters. The plot was a beautiful inspirational love story. It was always entertaining and fun to watch with the cast ensemble. <br/><br/>I recommend seeing the film in theatres for its beautiful fantastic musical set pieces. Even if you are not a musical fan or are. You may enjoy this film. <br/><br/>I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars."

"eagandersongil","7","0","1","11 January 2018"," The Art of Entertainment
","A fun movie that combines comedy, romance and music to a good sound editing, reasonable acting and a cool storyline. Telling the story of what was once called ""The Circus of Horrors,"" debutant director Michael Gracey sought to show people with a disability by another prism, rather than the traditional terror, as aborted in the film Freaks (1932) for example, he seeks to show the humanity, talent and willpower of these people, even if in the final balance, it's a gum lesson. The script is well worked out, telling the story of a man of vision, who seeks to win in life through entertainment, and finds a niche little explored, in the background is a film about vision with a dressing overcoming cute. We have a good photo, a very sharp direction and with good light and camera angles (taking into account mainly that it is a beginner director), the editing and mixing of sound are good, although at times it is clear the voice overlap , we also feel the slight variation of the trail, but even so, it is pleasant. Nemhuma's acting comes to be noticeable, but Hugh Jackman is very well, and plays a role that combines too much with him. Finally ""The King of Show"" is no masterpiece, but it amuses, and is far from displeasing."

"ntsmoviereviews","7","0","1","10 January 2018"," If you like Musicals; give this film a shot.
","The Greatest Showman, directed by Michael Gracey and written by Bill Condon and Jenny Bicks and is about P.T. Barnum, the founder of Barnum and Bailey's Circus, and his upbringing of the circus into American culture and stars the extremely talented Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum, Zac Efron as his assistant named Phillip Carlyle and Zendaya as Anne Wheeler with Michelle Williams as Charity Barnum. Before I get into my review, was I greatly impressed by this film; no. It was mediocre at best. But, I gave it a seven so I do think this move is average so here's why I think that. The first thing I look at is Cinematography. This movie looks undoubtedly beautiful. The shots where there is close ups on certain characters shows their emotion very well. Also, when there are characters who are sitting or standing in a location that is vital to the story or the story's progression it shows pretty much the whole area with the actor/actress which shows how miniscule they are compared to the scenery. All in all, it's a beautifully shots film with virtually no errors, as compared to the cinematography. However, the film's writing/dialogue/story in opinion was extremely poor. I did not care for the film's dialogue as I found it to be very forced and even awkward at times. Especially one scene where young Barnum and Charity are on the beach and as they're talking, you get a sense of that the child actors, Ellis Ruban and Skylar Dunn, aren't trying very well to make their scenes authentic. I also feel as if they romanticized the story of P.T. Barnum. They made being a poor teenager living on the street as a glorious entity. This was also a one hour and forty five minute long film, which I believed to be way to short. This film should've at least have been two hours and fifteen minutes. There was much material that the writers could've elaborated on and made his childhood more in depth and detail that the writers didn't care to do. The acting in this film was good but had some issues with it, that's why I only took off one point for the acting. First, were the poor aspects of the acting. Again, referring back to my statement on the child actors, they feel short in here too. I do believe that these child actors are good, but they were not given the substantial source material from the writers. However, Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams all give fantastic performances! Especially Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum in which he completely steals the show. As well as his incredible acting, he is also a surprisingly really good singer. With that statement, let me now talk about the music. It was phenomenal; every minute of it. I prefer La La Land's music over this but that music was considered to be a musical fan's dream, this definitely follows that route. The opening song is absolutely my favorite from the film; it honestly gave me some chills. I would consider buying the whole album on your phone I think it's that good. My last category to go over is the design of the film; this means the sets/locations throughout the film and the costumes. First off, the costumes are and look extraordinary especially Barnum's Ringmaster outfit. These outfits for all of the characters look so real. The dresses that the women in the film wear especially those who the higher class look absolutely amazing and the top hatted suits that the men wear look so classy. Now to my final point; the sets and locations where the film was shot. The sets look so colorful and gorgeous. The sets that contain the circus scenes are full of color and excitement! In conclusion, I do recommend that you go see this film and decide for yourself if you think this movie is good."

","The critics definitely got it wrong because this movie was phenomenal; I was utterly entranced from start to end.
Sure it was a tad too fast paced but I actually think it worked really well. We have seen this type of story before so we don't need to have someone holding our hand guiding us through it.
Normally I get quite bored in musicals (eg. la la land) but this was something special. I have never walked out of ANY film and whispered to myself ""that was incredible"" until this film.
I snuck in to watch it and it was such an great life choice, it has been almost an entire day and I am still in awe by the film, and I am still thinking about the songs and the dancing; enough so that I am actually going to go back and watch it again (and pay for it this time because this is one film that I actually want to make hundreds of millions of dollars so that they keep bringing us beauts like it).

"Ndetzzz","8","0","1","9 January 2018"," A very enjoyable film, don't listen to the critics
","This film is by no means technically perfect - not in the eyes of the critics anyway. I could understand this view to some extent. For instance, the story lacked real conflicts. There were several conflicts encountered by various characters in the film, but none of them was rigid enough to serve as a solid foundation of the plot story. This resulted in a relatively thin character development. I would also argue that a musical film like this could benefit from utilizing long-take shots, especially in dance sequences - this film did not have many long and continuous scenes. But, films are not just about technicality. <br/><br/>I did not feel that this film was created solely obtain to technical achievements, such as best screenplay, best cinematography, etc. This film was made to deliver a message about social discrimination and it did just that. There is no need for a Shakespeare-like screenplay or a La La Land-like cinematography. Nor it had to be 100% historically accurate. In other words, this film should not be judged by its technical aspects per se, but also by the moral message it is trying to convey and its overall entertainment value. In my opinion, this is what the critics failed to see.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film, and do watch it in the cinema for better experience. The songs are very beautiful, both from the music and lyrics point of view. Some of the scenes are just magical. Overall, a very enjoyable film to watch. A very good job by the Michael Gracey for his directorial debut."

"chestern-80136","7","0","1","8 January 2018"," Greatest may be an overstatement, but still certainly enjoyable.
","Movie musicals have been making a resurgence in recent years, and it seems we have two people to either thank or blame, depending on your opinion on the genre. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are an American songwriting duo, and have been making quite the name for themselves in recent years. The first brush I have had with the pair was with the Broadway hit 'Dear Evan Hansen', which went on to sweep the Tony awards last year. Following this was their success on the silver screen with the Oscar-winning 'La La Land'. This success showed there was a real audience for modern movie musicals, and it seems they sought to capitalise on this realisation.<br/><br/>The film actually struggled to come to be, with studios nervous about producing a big budget movie musical. Following La La Land, of course, confidence was found with an almost guaranteed promise of a large paycheck. Having been first announced in 2009, it's good to see the film finally see the light.<br/><br/>How much you'll enjoy this film will almost certainly revolve around how much you know about the character. It's important to note that there is many inaccuracies and oddities littered throughout, both relating to P.T. Barnum as a person, and to the time period in general. I shan't go into all of the specifics, but here are a couple of outlines of things conveniently missing: Joice Heth (a literal slave whom Barnum passed off as the 161 year old nursemaid to George Washington) and child labour (both 'The bearded woman' and 'General Tom Thumb' were brought on as attractions when they were children). Finally, it's debatable whether or not the climax of the film even happened. Barnum's museum did burn down, however this was before he'd even gotten into the circus business at all. Rather clearly, many liberties were taken.<br/><br/>Michael Gracey managed to put incredible things onto the screen with this film, and I was genuinely amazed at moments. If I were to score it based on the cinematography and choreography alone, it'd have a comfortable 9/10. Almost every song has fantastic action accompanying it, whether it be elaborate dance members featuring the majority of the cast, or intimate performances between two characters. The CGI, however, was lacking, presumably due to the lower budget compared to the CGI extravaganzas i'm used to. It's also used sparingly, so I can forgive it.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances in this film. Besides the child actors who I felt were lacking (I rarely enjoy child actors, so this may be an issue of my own) I feel everyone was at least passable. Some, however, surpassed my expectations. Zendaya, whom I had yet to enjoyed in a film, particularly after Spider-Man: Homecoming, was incredible. After seeing her here, I'm actually rethinking my thoughts of her in Spider-Man. I believe the fault lied with her character itself, rather than her performance. I, personally, almost never feel any real emotion in the cinema. I can find a scene sad, but i'll rarely cry. Despite the actual scene being rather unremarkable, Zendaya's performance was incredibly believable, to a point where I almost found myself crying. Hugh Jackman, unsurprisingly, was also fantastic and I even found myself enjoying Zac Effron's character, and not just as a novelty.<br/><br/>One character I found myself bewildered by was Jenny Lind. While I have only read about the real life person briefly, she seems to be a genuinely kindhearted and incredibly talented person. In this film, she's debatably neither. Given the fact she is an opera singer, I expected her song to be.. opera. It wasn't. Instead, it was a belted pop ballad, which I wouldn't be against were it not meant to be sung by one of the greatest opera singers of the 19th Century. As one of the few characters whose real-life counterpart actually sung, I was also surprised to find her vocal type was different. She was entitled the 'Swedish Nightingale' due to her gorgeous Soprano singing, while in this film, she belts in what I believe is an Alto's range. Additionally, within the film she quits the tour out of what seems like a jealous tantrum. In reality, while she did split from Barnum's employment, she finished the tour. As mentioned in the film, she gave much of her money to charities. Ending the tour wouldn't simply affect her. She instead finished it alone.<br/><br/>As this is a musical, I have another element I get to discuss, one which I might usually miss: The music! I felt it was a mixed bag. All of the songs are enjoyable, but I found many of the group performances to blend together, becoming hard to distinguish from one another. Also, I personally wasn't a fan of how almost all of the songs were Pop, in one way or another. I appreciate it appeals to the largest audience, but I'd have rather seen some risks taken with the genres. In many of the songs, the music can almost drown out the singers. I feel the strongest songs are the quietest.<br/><br/>Also, while I don't know how much the actors knew beforehand, the skills shown are fantastic. I've no idea if all the cast could dance before, but it was clear effort was put in to pull off the moves and what appeared to be demanding choreography. Zac Effron and Zendaya both even learned how use a trapeze!<br/><br/>Finally, though I rarely mention it, the costumes within this film were genuinely brilliant. I've no idea how accurate they were, but they certainly looked the part to me.<br/><br/>If you wish to learn about P.T. Barnum, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. He's a fascinating character, and in this case, truth is almost stranger than fiction. Taking historical accuracy and the like into consideration, the film is most likely a 4/10. Despite this, however, I don't feel I can give it such a low score. I legitimately enjoyed myself watching this film, and though it had it's many flaws, I feel it deserves better. If you can watch this as it's own, standalone story, without the baggage that reality brings with it, I feel 7/10 is a perfectly fair score, and it's the one I'll be using officially. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movie musicals, and even to regular film lovers who enjoy dazzling cinematography."

"kyella14","8","0","3","8 January 2018"," Entertaining, but lacks substance
","Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The songs, the choreography and the performances of the actors and actresses were fantastic. I loved the spectacle of it, and honestly, I was moved to tears a few times.<br/><br/>But underneath all that shine and glitter, the film doesn't really achieve much in terms of character development and plot. The 'unique persons' brought together by the circus feel like decorative figures in the plot, their personalities bland beneath their striking appearances, their relationships explored with very limited depth. There are so many elements in the story that the plot also feels a little confused, and the producers are so busy trying to explore each element that all of it feels quite shallow. <br/><br/>Aside from that, for being all about diversity and acceptance, the film does not seem to adequately deal with those issues. When Barnum returns to his circus after his attempted venture into the snobbish, upper-class world ends in bankruptcy, he does not actually apologise for his appalling treatment of his circus employees. He has shunned and hidden them away, embarrassed of them, demonstrating that whatever he told them, he does not actually accept them. Yet the film glosses over this aspect, and when he returns to his circus, he is readily met with forgiveness and the barest hint of resentment from the circus members. <br/><br/>Still, for all its flaws, I give it an 8/10, because truly, the spectacle of it entranced me. From the beginning to the end, the movie reeled me in with catchy songs and upbeat tunes, with fireworks and spinning trapeze artists. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride, and much like the circus-goers in the film, I left delighted with what I'd seen."

","It seems every reviewer on this site is up in arms against a swarm of film critics who reviewed this film negatively. I abstained from any reviews or ratings before viewing, but frankly the film was only above average, no more.<br/><br/>Choreography was quite good, and certainly captured the energy demanded by the film's subject matter. The accompanying cinematography was well executed, as should be expected from a director whose background is in commercial advertising. But for a film that relies on its score and spectacle, almost every song was immediately forgettable.<br/><br/>Watch Moulin Rouge and plan to walk out with ""Come What May"" and ""Your Song"" stuck in your head. See Hamilton, and you'll be unwrapping dozens of cleverly hidden double-entendres for days. The songs from ""The Greatest Showman"" simply pale in comparison to those from any noteworthy musical. The lyrics are shallow, relying on tired turns of phrase and unoriginal analogies. The melodies border on pedestrian, and often provide little more than a framework to support the vocal riffs of the (admittedly excellent) performers.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is clearly in his element here, and makes the most of every moment on screen. The same can be said for the majority of the cast, but sadly their greatest moments are limited by the failure of originality from the writing/composing team.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely worth seeing, particularly for fans of theater and musicals. Just don't expect it to stand up to the expectations that have been set by the great musicals of our time."
"chestern-80136","7","0","2","7 January 2018"," 'Greatest' is an overstatement, but still certainly enjoyable despite it's inaccuracies
","Movie musicals have been making a resurgence in recent years, and it seems we have to people to either thank or blame, depending on your opinion on the genre.Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are an American songwriting duo, and have been making quite the name for themselves in recent years. The first brush I have had with the pair was with the Broadway hit 'Dear Evan Hansen', which went on to sweep the Tony awards last year. Following this was their success on the silver screen with the Oscar-winning 'La La Land'. This success showed there was a real audience for modern movie musicals, and it seems they sought to capitalise on this realisation.<br/><br/>The film actually struggled to come to be, with studios nervous about producing a big budget movie musical. Following La La Land, of course, confidence was found with an almost guaranteed promise of a large paycheck. Having been first announced in 2009, it's good to see the film finally see the light.<br/><br/>How much you'll enjoy this film will almost certainly revolve around how much you know about the character. It's important to note that there is many inaccuracies and oddities littered throughout, both relating to P.T. Barnum as a person, and to the time period in general. I shan't go into all of the specifics, but here are a couple of outlines of things conveniently missing: Joice Heth (a literal slave whom Barnum passed off as the 161 year old nursemaid to George Washington) and child labour (both 'The bearded woman' and 'General Tom Thumb' were brought on as attractions when they were children). Finally, it's debatable whether or not the climax of the film even happened. Barnum's museum did burn down, however this was before he'd even gotten into the circus business at all. Rather clearly, many liberties were taken.<br/><br/>Michael Gracey managed to put incredible things onto the screen with this film, and I was genuinely amazed at moments. If I were to score it based on the cinematography and choreography alone, it'd have a comfortable 9/10. Almost every song has fantastic action accompanying it, whether it be elaborate dance members featuring the majority of the cast, or intimate performances between two characters. The CGI, however, was lacking, presumably due to the lower budget compared to the CGI extravaganzas i'm used to. It's also used sparingly, so I can forgive it.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances in this film. Besides the child actors who I felt were lacking (I rarely enjoy child actors, so this may be an issue of my own) I feel everyone was at least passable. Some, however, surpassed my expectations. Zendaya, whom I had yet to enjoyed in a film, particularly after Spider-Man: Homecoming, was incredible. After seeing her here, I'm actually rethinking my thoughts of her in Spider-Man. I believe the fault lied with her character itself, rather than her performance. I, personally, almost never feel any real emotion in the cinema. I can find a scene sad, but i'll rarely cry. Despite the actual scene being rather unremarkable, Zendaya's performance was incredibly believable, to a point where I almost found myself crying. Hugh Jackman, unsurprisingly, was also fantastic and I even found myself enjoying Zac Effron's character, and not just as a novelty.<br/><br/>One character I found myself bewildered by was Jenny Lind. While I have only read about the real life person briefly, she seems to be a genuinely kindhearted and incredibly talented person. In this film, she's debatably neither. Given the fact she is an opera singer, I expected her song to be.. opera. It wasn't. Instead, it was a belted pop ballad, which I wouldn't be against were it not meant to be sung by one of the greatest opera singers of the 19th Century. As one of the few characters whose real-life counterpart actually sung, I was also surprised to find her vocal type was different. She was entitled the 'Swedish Nightingale' due to her gorgeous Soprano singing, while in this film, she belts in what I believe is an Alto's range. Additionally, within the film she quits the tour out of what seems like a jealous tantrum. In reality, while she did split from Barnum's employment, she finished the tour. As mentioned in the film, she gave much of her money to charities. Ending the tour wouldn't simply affect her. She instead finished it alone.<br/><br/>As this is a musical, I have another element I get to discuss, one which I might usually miss: The music! I felt it was a mixed bag. All of the songs are enjoyable, but I found many of the group performances to blend together, becoming hard to distinguish from one another. Also, I personally wasn't a fan of how almost all of the songs were Pop, in one way or another. I appreciate it appeals to the largest audience, but I'd have rather seen some risks taken with the genres. In much of the songs, the music can almost drown out the singers. I feel the strongest songs are the quietest.<br/><br/>Also, while I don't know how much the actors knew beforehand, the skills shown are fantastic. I've no idea if all the cast could dance before, but it was clear effort was put in to pull off the moves and what appeared to be demanding choreography. Zac Effron and Zendaya both even learned how use a trapeze!<br/><br/>Finally, though I rarely mention it, the costumes within this film were genuinely brilliant. I've no idea how accurate they were, but they certainly looked the part to me.<br/><br/>If you wish to learn about P.T. Barnum, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. He's a fascinating character, and in this case, truth is almost stranger than fiction. Taking historical accuracy and the like into consideration, the film is most likely a 4/10. Despite this, however, I don't feel I can give it such a low score. I legitimately enjoyed myself watching this film, and though it had it's many flaws, I feel it deserves better. If you can watch this as it's own, standalone story, without the baggage that reality brings with it, I feel 7/10 is a perfectly fair score, and it's the one I'll be using officially. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movie musicals, and even to regular film lovers who enjoy dazzling cinematography."
"lukefriday","7","0","1","7 January 2018"," I understand the critics, but it depends what you're looking for.
","I can fully understand why the critics gave this film poor ratings, as there is a lot to criticise if you are looking to do so. On the flip side, The Greatest Showman can be viewed as entertaining and uplifting if you aren't after perfect writing.<br/><br/>Although the songs are well written, generally their style and delivery are completely wrong for the setting of the film. The majority of the musical numbers come with modern choreography and musical style. Some may like this, but it does detract from the overall ""lost in the film"" feeling. <br/><br/>The story itself was entertaining, although I am sure doesn't follow the true history of Barnum's life, which again opens itself up to criticism from those who feel it should. I didn't feel this an issue. <br/><br/>Sweeney Todd (2007) is the only musical I can say i really like, and it did much more to use the music to bring the audience into the movie. In the Greatest Showman, it seemed like an unnecessary added extra, done only to attract fans of musicals. There were a few points where I enjoyed it's musical nature (the bar scene where Phillip joins Barnum), but generally could take it or leave it.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I still rate this film fairly highly, as it is entertaining. Anyone who likes modern dance troupes (not me), and that kind of ""Britain's got Talent"" style entertainment would love this film. Although, most people will be able to get some joy out of it."
"Wizinator","3","0","9","7 January 2018"," La La Land + Circus = The Greatest Showman
","I'm going to start on a positive note -- the music was absolutely terrific. As I'm writing this, I'm actually listening to the soundtrack. But overall, I'm severely disappointed in the film. P. T. Barnum's story is truly fascinating, but the plot of The Greatest Showman was so over-dramatized and romanticized that I find myself doubting whether any part of the plot was based on real events (except the actual circus). The plot was all over the place, trying to be too many things. But if you enjoyed La La Land's random dance/spectacle numbers and want to ""escape"" and zone out for two hours, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Honestly, I'm really disappointed. I was really looking forward to this movie :/"

","Th movie The greatest showman is really great. The musical numbers with singing and dancing are magnificent. But it felt to me that the movie was really dragging. Like in the middle of the movie (when you see it, you will know, when) I thought, that: Well, we have seen what we need, end of story great, what can they show us now?<br/><br/>I was not bored with that second half of the movie. I know it is a biography, but to me it was like they must add something to the movie, because it must be longer than 90 minutes. <br/><br/>But that is maybe just a feeling. The dance performances are great (some will say The Greatest) and if you really enjoy musicals, you must see it. It will entertain you and you will feel optimistic, because that is like the legacy of P.T. Barnum. Everybody is extraordinary and nobody just make a difference being like everyone else.

My only real criticism was the CGI elephants - they were not well done."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","0","1","6 January 2018"," Ignore the critics - this IS the greatest show!
","Will you like ""The Greatest Showman""? This will be dictated almost entirely by whether you are a ""musicals"" person or not! For ""The Greatest Showman"" is a frothy, very loud, cheesy and high-energy musical, much more aligned, in fact, to the mainstream genre from the 40's and 50's than ""La La Land"" was. <br/><br/>In a VERY loose interpretation of the early life of Phineas Taylor Barnum, the American huckster and impressario, we start the story with a pre-pubescent Barnum (Ellis Rubin, sung by Ziv Zaifman) as a young tailor's assistant punching above his weight with young socialite Charity (Skylar Dunn), firmly against the wishes of her father. Spin forward (via song) and the hitched Barnum's - now Hugh Jackman (""Logan"") and Michelle Williams (""Manchester By The Sea"") - are barely scraping a living. But Barnum has ""A Million Dreams"" and hits on the novel idea of opening an entertainment (coined ""a circus"" by journalist James Gordon Bennett (Paul Sparks)) where he offers both respect and a family to those of the city who are deformed, rejected and socially shunned. Barnum's show is shockingly entertaining - as in both filling seats and shocking the morally-self-righteous upper classes. But never one to rest on his laurels, Barnum's endless ambition drives him to break his social ceiling by importing the ""Swedish songbird"", opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson, ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"", ""The Snowman"") ), for an ambitious and extravegant tour of the States. All does not exactly go to plan.<br/><br/>Most critics have been making sniffy noises about this film. But I am not one of them.... I LOVED IT, have already bought the glorious soundtrack album and will be looking forwards to the DVD release. For this is joy in a box. Sure, the story is a bit weak, the characterisations of everyone (other than Barnum) pretty lightweight, but it's a musical extravaganza! Live with it! <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, who of course started his career in stage musicals, is marvellously charismatic as Barnum although his singing does tend to the ""shouty"" end of the scale in many of the numbers. He's joined here by fellow musicals star Zac Efron (let's forget ""Dirty Grandpa"") as the fictitious Phillip Carlyle: a socialite playwright and partner.<br/><br/>But the acting and singing revelation for me was Zendaya (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"") as Efron's (scandalous) inter-racial love interest, who has a fantastically athletic body, sings and dances wonderfully and has a magnetic stare. A marvellous trapeze routine between Efron and Zendaya (""Rewrite The Stars"") is one of the high-spots of the film for me.<br/><br/>Elsewhere Williams proves she has a singing voice as well as being a top flight actress and the bearded lady (Broadway star Keala Settle) belts out one of the show-stopping numbers ""This is Me"" (although she is a little 'shrill' for my musical tastes).<br/><br/>It would be nice to extend that compliment to the wonderful Rebecca Ferguson as the ""greatest singer in the world"" - but she is (wisely I think) dubbed here by Loren Allred (a finalist on the US version of ""The Voice""). It is a bit of a shock when ""the great opera singer"" opens her mouth and a modern love song comes out, but once you get over that then the combination of Ferguson's acting and Allred's singing makes ""Never Enough"" one of the standout songs in the movie. (It's been described as ""a bit Eurovision"" by Kevin Maher, ""The Times"" critic, which I can see but I don't care! I find it marvellously moving).<br/><br/>If you haven't guessed it, there are some fantastic songs in this movie, written by ""La La Land"" song composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and at least one of these surely must be Oscar nominated (I'm not sure what the cut-off would be for the 2018 Oscars?). <br/><br/>There's also a lot of talent in the backroom with production design and memorable costumes. Where I'd single out particular praise though is in the choreography and the editing on show. <br/><br/>Firstly, the choreography of ""beats"" in the song to the action on screen is brilliantly done, done, probably at its most impressive in a shot-glass bar-room scene between Jackman and Efron. And never (hats off to the special effects guys and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey) have you seen washing on a washing line so cleverly in time with the music. <br/><br/>Secondly in terms of the film editing, I am a sucker for clever ""transition"" shots, and there are some in this movie that just took my breath away: a transition to a pregnant Charity; a transition from ballet practice to ballet performance; there are numerous others! <br/><br/>I have decided to park some of my minor criticisms within the greater joy of the whole: some of the dialogue (by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon) is as cheesy as hell, but probably no more so than in some of the Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney musicals. Where I had my biggest problem is in some of the lip synching to the songs. This is an age where the live recording of songs in films like ""Les Miserables"" and ""La La Land"" has set the bar high, and returning to the norm (I had the same problem with ""Beauty and the Beast"") becomes noticeable and irritating to me. (Perhaps this is just me!). <br/><br/>It's certainly not a perfect film, but its energy and drive carry it through as a memorable movie musical that may well take on a life of its own as word-of-mouth gets it more widely viewed (outside of the rather difficult Christmas holiday season). It would also be a good film for youngsters, with a bit of judicious editing (there is one moment of violence in the first 10 minutes that I would choose to edit out). From my perspective it is certainly a truly impressive debut for advert director Michael Gracey. Recommended for musical fans.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks)."
"davispittman","7","0","1","6 January 2018"," Good, not great
","20th Century Fox's The Greatest Showman is a family oriented musical based on P.T. Barnum. I have somewhat mixed feelings after seeing this tonight. I'll first go over the positive aspects of the film, then I'll cover the negative ones. <br/><br/>First of all, I'll say that the singing is very good, the musical numbers don't disappoint for the vast majority of the time. There were moments in a couple of the big musical numbers where I felt they got a bit Disney Channel, which is not how a big screen musical should feel. It's kind of strange though because some songs, like we can rewrite the stars between Zac Efron and Zendaya, or any time Rebecca Ferguson was singing, those did not have that feel to it at all and I really enjoyed it. I thought the actors were well cast and the acting was fine, I won't say that the performances were amazing because I didn't feel that they were. I have seen better acting from all the stars in previous films they've done, but that's not to say that their were bad, they were just fine. The visuals is another thumbs up. Visually, this movie was great, if we were only talking about visuals, then this would be a ten. <br/><br/>Now for the negatives. What I mentioned previously when talking about the singing is one of the negatives, the moments where it felt too kiddie and not like a big screen musical. Another negative is that it's just not up to par with other great musicals in cinema history. I felt that it was too safe in places, like it was content at just being good and not great. It didn't take that extra step.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling a sense of ""that was a decent musical, but I have definitely seen better"". I suggest this mildly, if you're looking for a family oriented musical then I's definetly say this one, but there are much better musical films out there and I think this one could have been better than just good. 7/10 for The Greatest Showman."

","I saw the trailer for the film, I assumed the song featured in it was just for a performance number, so it came as a pleasant surprise when it turned out I was watching a musical movie, at least I knew it was inspired by the story of the creation of a famous institution. Basically young P.T. Barnum (Ellis Rubin, Ziv Zaifman singing) and his father Philo (Will Swenson), a tailor, work for the Hallett family. The young Barnum has an affection for the daughter Charity Hallett (Skylar Dunn), he is reprimanded for making Charity laugh, she is grounded, she later tells Barnum that she is being sent to finishing school. Barnum assures Charity they will not be separated, the two keep in touch through letters until they meet again as adults (""A Million Dreams""). Barnum (Golden Globe nominated Hugh Jackman) and Charity (Michelle Williams) get married and have two children, daughters Caroline (Austyn Johnson) and Helen (Cameron Seely) (""A Million Dreams (Reprise)""), they live a humble life in New York City, Clarity is happy, but Barnum dreams of more. Barnum works as a clerk at a shipping company, but is laid off after the company goes bankrupt, so he takes a risky bet, he deceives the bank into accepting his former employer's lost goods as collateral to take out a large loan. With the loan, Barnum builds Barnum's American Museum in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models, but sales are slow, the children suggest attractions should be ""alive"". Barnum advertises for ""freaks"", to serve as performers for his museum (""Come Alive""), the unique people he finds include bearded lady Lettie Lutz (Keala Settle), dwarf performer Charles Stratton aka General Tom Thumb (Sam Humphrey), Fedor Jeftichew the Dog Boy (Luciano Acuna Jr.) and many more. Despite protests and poor reviews, a larger audience are attracted, wanting to see unique looking people with unique talents, one critic describes the museum as a ""circus"", this prompts Barnum to rename his venture ""Barnum's Circus"", out of spite. Having found success, and making a fortune, Barnum is finally able to buy the mansion he had promised Charity when they were younger, but he searches ways to further his reputation with the upper class. Barnum meets and convinces Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) to join his venture (""The Other Side""), Carlyle becomes enamoured with African-American circus acrobat and trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). Carlyle arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet Queen Victoria (Gayle Rankin); at this meeting, Barnum meets famed Swedish singer Jenny Lind, known as ""The Swedish Nightingale"" (Rebecca Ferguson, Loren Allred singing), he convinces her to perform in America, serving as her manager. Lind stuns Barnum and the audience with her performance (""Never Enough""), during which Carlyle upsets Wheeler by not showing affection for her when his parents notice. The success leads to a U.S. tour, but in the process Barnum neglects his original circus, the troupe's performers feel disheartened and ignored (""This Is Me""). Carlyle takes Wheeler to the theatre, but Carlyle's parents insult her, and she leaves, he chases after her, trying to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him (""Rewrite the Stars""). Meanwhile Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home and takes care of their children (""Tightrope""). While on tour, Lind becomes attached to Barnum, but he declines her advances, in anger she calls off the tour, at her final performance, during curtain call (""Never Enough (Reprise)""), Lind kisses Barnum, this moment is photographed. When Barnum returns to the circus, he finds it on fire, following a fight between protesters and the troupe, there is a moment when Carlyle believes Wheeler is in the burning building, and runs in to save her, but she emerges unharmed, Barnum runs in and saves Carlyle. After the fire, most of the set and props have been destroyed and Carlyle is gravely injured, word of Lind's cancellation and Barnum's public intimacy reaches New York, leading to him having financial difficulties and becoming estranged from his wife. Barnum becomes depressed and starts drinking, his troupe find him in a bar, they persuade him to rebuild the circus; he resolves in future to stay down-to-earth and not get carried away with reputation and wealth (""From Now On""), meanwhile Carlyle wakes in hospital, with Wheeler by his side. Barnum visits Charity, and they rebuild their relationship, he finds it difficult to find a bank willing to loan him money to rebuild the circus, but the recovering Carlyle has saved his profits from the circus, he offers his earnings to rebuild, on the condition of becoming equal partners, Barnum happily accepts. Rebuilding at the original circus location is too expensive, so Barnum rebuilds the circus as an open-air tent event by the harbour, the new circus is a great success, in the end, Barnum hands over the reins of the show to Carlyle and retires to focus more on his family (""The Greatest Show""). Also starring Paul Sparks as James Gordon Bennett, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as W. D. Wheeler, Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Deng Yan, a Chinese blade-specialist and Shannon Holtzapffel as Prince Constantine, The Tattooed Man. Former Broadway and West End performer Jackman is superb as the ringmaster, Efron is likeable as his showbiz partner, and there is terrific support from Ferguson, Williams, Zendaya and Settle. It is a fictionalised version of the true creation Barnum & Bailey Circus, and the lives of its star attractions, the real circus ran for 146 years, but it is much more about the extravagant song and dance routines, with splendidly written and melodic numbers, ""Never Enough"" and ""This Is Me"" being the highlights, a lavish spectacle and most entertaining period musical drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""This is Me"" (it was also nominated the Oscar), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"
"kkaluhio","7","0","1","5 January 2018"," Rating is misleading - 7.5
","I really enjoyed this movie. It's a very upbeat movie with above average music. The vocals were better than La La Land, but the music behind the vocals is not. La La Land incorporated poetry and dynamics into its score, which I thought was very creative. The Greatest Showman (in my opinion) was more about vocal harmony, which is not a bad thing (just not as creative instrumentally). If you want to be entertained, I highly recommend this movie. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of things I didn't like:
1) The plot was very bland. There weren't a lot of up and down moments. Barnum succeeded very quickly and the main conflicts were also resolved very quickly. If you are watching to hear fun music, then this won't bother you much.
2) The singing was too voiced-over/auto-tuned for my taste. In the very beginning, the two kids start singing, and although they sound great, it bothered me a little that the vocals were so staged. Jen (the European opera singer) has a different voice actor as well, and it's hard to perfectly match mouth with voice if the singing styles are different. There are also parts when you can clearly hear auto-tuned or ""pieced-together"" vocals (tiny skips). However, Zendaya's singing sounded like it was barely touched. Rewrite the Stars is a very great song.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this movie if you want to be entertained. Don't go into it with a technical mindset. Enjoy it!"

The songs are very upbeat as it's been stated in other reviews. I found them nice but a little sugary, nothing exaggerated though.
The only major complain I'd have is on how fast things get solved. Anyway, it might be a good thing. If you want to just chill and have fun without any tension, go for it and you'll have a great experience!"

"MarketaN","9","0","1","4 January 2018"," Musical! Spectacular!
","The first valuable thing about this film is that it is an original for-film-musical, not a Broadway adaptation as it might seem. <br/><br/>The music is created by an amazing duo Pasek and Paul who got on the top after La La Land´s success. It was a good promotion strategy to release soundtrack before film premiere because the music is great and catchy and resonates. People follow these two and they followed the music before the film. <br/><br/>What is even better is that it works with the visual as well. There is space for choreography. Logically, while giving space to musical numbers, there is not that much left for dialogs and storytelling. Creators succeeded to start with the main character´s childhood and finish in the middle age by using visually nicely done shortcuts and time bridges. It is a musical in its pure form. <br/><br/>What was missed was at least some space for the supporting characters, all the misfits from the concert who were used only as dancers which sort of spoiled the main thought. Even Zendaya´s and Zack Efron´s characters did not get much space if it was not about their romance. I missed knowing how did Anne and her brother learned their trapeze art or who is the girl with albino skin and hair often shown in frame. <br/><br/>Probably no one else than Jackman could be chosen for this character. It seemed he felt maybe the best in his part from all the characters he had portraited before. <br/><br/>The film is about P. T. Barnum who was a great entertainer but also someone who brought wild animals to circus and generally was quite terrifying person from what is known, not glamorous as Jackman´s performance at all. It is totally fine because this is a film and film can do whatever it wants to make a good result. The movie used obviously digital techniques for visualizing the animals mostly and cannot be blamed for anything of course. But in that moment Hollywood again served as a tool for misrepresentation, cannot help the feeling. It is made-up story based on a couple real facts, not a biography, so it was not necessary to stick to P. T. Barnum´s name and celebrate him. But that is just a personal note. <br/><br/>The movie targets emotions big time! And I encourage everyone to go through the sentimental experience simply because it is done so well!"
"snakekeeper-11956","9","0","1","4 January 2018"," Inspiring field of fictional reality
","It's a stunning pleasure to start year 2018 with such distinguished movie as ""The Greatest Showman"", with Hugh Jackman singing in IMAX. The actor finally feels himself creatively free from the X-Men Logan profile. Nearly empty cinema hall, even as a contrast to the December premiere of Star Wars (still full), in fact, gives a positive attitude to the movie, you've just seen. Mainstream audience generally ignores such premiers (even ""La-La Land""), as well as depicted in ""The Greatest Showman. New movie does not copy Chazelle's masterpiece, but plays in the same field of emotional coherence with the audience. The golden age of Hollywood is now replaced with the palm shine of the XIX century. The very first opening scene brightly harmonizes the appropriate attitude. Therewith, the movie does not go too far with the dancing and singing experience, balancing on this thin spectator's edge. Soundtrack challenges sincere admiration with some personal singing with the soft voice of, at the very least, two musical pieces. <br/><br/>""The greatest Showman"" opens a door with a gold key by means of incredible, positive wave and life-affirming feeling. Plot, partially based on real P.T. Barnum story, is bitter simple, combining life obstacles with incredible success of one dreamer. You should not foretaste some revelations, as, after the first hour, you may pause the movie and successfully suppose the next events and even characters' behavior. Hugh Jackman amazes with his diversified approach to his own actor carrier. His P.T. Barnum is a kind of a person we all may take something for granted - to see behind the walls, to see the advantages and best features of people around. ""The Greatest Showman"" creates a creative environment far from historical. Half-screen Moon, New York roofs, which look like theatron, dancing barman and bright multicolor pallet of tones with some child's irreality. Such inspiring field of fictional reality can be characterized with only two common ""beautiful tale"" words. <br/><br/>*8 of 10*"
"klarabaumeister","8","0","2","3 January 2018"," Usually, I'm not a fan of movies with a predictive plot, but somehow this movie managed to convince me.
","In my opinion, ""The Greatest Showman"" is a good, solid movie. It's not the best I've seen, but it's on my list of ""I'd-like-to-watch-it-again-sometime-movies"".<br/><br/>The plot surely is predictable: The poor but goodhearted, upbeat guy without a job experiences what success, especially success from what you love to do, feels like. He wants more and more, he wants a bigger audience, people from all social classes to like his show and in the end, he wants too much and ends up losing it all. Then he notices his mistakes, returns to his true friends/crew and they help him build it all up again. So cheesy, so foreseeable. But somehow, this movie still got me walking out of the theater with a happy smile on my face.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie can be exaggerating at some times. Especially in the end. Where did the lions come from? Why is Hugh Jackman riding on an elephant? Well, all I can say to that is: Who cares. I, for myself, like exaggeration in movies, so I didn't care. After all, it's a musical.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is good. It tells you to not only accept, but appreciate the things that differenciate you from others, even though others may find it weird. People are going to look at you either way, so you might as well shove it in their face and have fun - that's what the show is about (mostly). Hugh Jackman is really celebrating humanity at all its diversions.<br/><br/>What I also very much liked were the choreographies and the camera angles. There were some very cool and surprising effects, that were just fun to look at. They made me feel like I was in the audience, watching the show live.<br/><br/>In the end, all I can say is that this movie is a predictable, good and solid musical. It made me smile, and catched my attention. It's maybe not the most outstanding musical there is, but sometimes you don't need that. 
If you are looking for an upbeat, fast-paced movie that makes you forget about the real world for a short time, then I'd totally recommend this for you!<br/><br/>Also, there is Zac Efron singing in a musical again. I do not want to compare this to High School Musical at all, but if you're in for Zac Efron dancing and singing again, then go for it, that's all I'm saying. ;)"
"RforFilm","6","0","3","3 January 2018"," The Greatest Showman works better as a musical then telling the story of P.T. Barnum
","Ladies and gentleman! Boys and girls of all ages! Welcome to the circus! This was a statement that I heard at least once a year whenever the circus came to town. I'm not talking about the more artistic acrobatics of Cirque du Soleil, but the three ring shows that come with a tent, clowns, animals, and the rest of the entertainers who have chosen to use that to showcase their talents. As a child, seeing all these elements together was magical. As an adult, I do question their place in today's bigger world of mixed media. How can a circus that comes once a year compete with specific shows, film, Internet, and zoos?<br/><br/>People have to understand that before all of that was created, the circus was often the only place to see the clowns, elephants, and such. True, there was a darker element to the factor on just how far the people behind the scenes would push themselves and others. But if they were good at something, they knew how to entertain. They've built businesses out of it, including those of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Baily (both now closed). The story of one of the originators, P.T. Barnum, is now showcased in The Greatest Showman.<br/><br/>We learn that as a child, P.T. Barnum grew up with a tailor father, but liked to make others smile...including a young Charity Hallett. Years later, P.T. (played by Hugh Jackman) meets with Charity (played by Michelle Williams), they marry, have two daughters, and try to make something of their lives. Though everyone is content with their lives, P.T. is let go from an accounting job while he dreams of something better for his family. While entertaining his children, he gets an idea to bring the world of the mysterious and unknown to everyone.<br/><br/>He gets a loan and opens Barnum's American Museum, to showcase wax figures, odd exhibits, and anything he can make to invoke a greater wonder within the world. The public is resistant. Lower ticket sales gets P.T. to start hiring live performers including midget ""Tom Thumb"", a bearded lady, and acrobat Anne (played by Zendaya). This brings in more people, but local critics are unimpressed. The museum (later named a circus) becomes popular enough that P.T. hires a famous playwright Phillip (played by Zac Efron) to try to help run the show and make it appealing for everyone...including the upper class. <br/><br/>The Greatest Showman is trying to do a lot of things. It tries to make P.T. Barnum likable and conflicted, it tries to show the merits of the circus, it tries to make you sympathize with his freak show, and it tries to be historically accurate. Oh, and it's also a musical. Does it all come together? Not all the time, but I can't deny that I enjoyed myself. Seeing this is a lot like a real circus; it's full of talent and has a lot of effort put into it, but what is it leaving behind?<br/><br/>My problem with The Greatest Showman is that we only get glimpses at the real P.T. Barnum. Hugh Jackman does great with the material given to him, but given how the real life figure was a debunker, a salesman, and even a representative of Connecticut, I got more of an edited version. The same goes for Zac Efron, Zendaya, and the others that work in the circus. There's a lot you could have done to show the conflict of exploiting their ""specialty"" while finding a home. I'm glad we do get the conflict of a man who wants to climb socially, yet isn't sure if his show can come with him.<br/><br/>How is it as a musical? It's probably the best element. I'm sure that the overall intention of this movie was to make it as such. What's interesting is that all the songs and music have more of a modern sound (trying in replicate what Hamilton did on Broadway). It does work in it's favor, though not all the songs are memorable. The one I liked the most was ""This is me"", which I'm sure will get a lot of song nominations. <br/><br/>I'll give this six circus elephants out of ten. The story of the real P.T. Barnum is fascinating, but The Greatest Showman only scratches the surface. I can't say it was for nothing, as the musical sequences are fun and I did care about parts of the story. If you like musicals, you'll get into this. Families are more or less the target, so I might as well say to check it out if you like the circus."

","Just when you have tired of the fast cross-cutting, the obvious use of dancing doubles and the auto-tuning, just when you start to think of The Greatest Showman as a movie you can crack wise during, Rebecca Ferguson will start to sing her power ballad. And you will be nudged into the musical's world. Or so you think. Because here comes the amazing Keala Settle with an anthem on pride that will SHOVE you, lock, stock and barrel, into The Greatest Showman's world, and you will never look back. So what if Barnum's adorable kids never age in 5 years? So what if Zac Efron can't dance? This movie tries way too hard, especially in the first half hour, but it will win you over."
"nmn34","7","0","2","2 January 2018"," A Visual Treat but Narratively Weak
","PT Barnum is the greatest carny to have ever lived. This is the undeniable truth every Connecticut resident should have drilled into them from cradle to the grave. This film, it doesn't seem to capture his greatness, his autobiography makes a far more interesting tale, but it at least provides for an interesting diversion. The music is good and the choreography is excellent, the story while watered down at least flows well so as to keep your interest. Its just that instead of the greatest showman they present an unnecessarily family friendly imitation.<br/><br/>This needs repeating, the choreography is top notch. There is so much going on in every song and dance it can't all be caught in a single viewing. Their timing is perfect, the bar scene where shots are being slid, caught, and downed is so fluid its like watching the waves crashing into the shore. Everything is perfectly natural, like going to an actual Barnum & Bailey show (RIP). That is until they bring in the animals. Its hard to believe that they couldn't find any animal trainers for this movie, I know quite a few that could use the work, but the CGI is an abomination. Tom Thumb riding the horse looks like hot garbage, the elephants in the musical number look faker than if it was a man in a mask,. and the horses in the final number... they are a three frame gif. Considering everything else they had shown throughout the film, its just unacceptable.<br/><br/>The writing is the weakest point of the movie, there is no conflict. Disregarding how it strayed from the actual life of PT Barnum, the caricature they give has no real trouble. He goes from being laid off when his employer goes belly up to success in half of the first act. He goes from shunned by high society to well respectable impressario in two scenes. He loses everything an rebuilds in one scene. Everything he does is trivialized by his immediate success so soon afterward to such a degree that nothing seems to matter. And the way they solve these problems are infuriating. A struggling business venture solved by his daughter with one line as he tucks her in the very next scene after the only person he could sell tickets to was his family. There is no build, the answer is given to him plain as day by a literal plot device. Its impossible to write a review with spoilers, there is absolutely nothing here to spoil.<br/><br/>The major flaw with Barnum is simply this, he has no flaws. This could be said somewhat about the real man, he was an otherwise upright man who supported emancipation, charity, and family friendly entertainment, but to his core he was a carny. His early career was rife with trickery, from the Feejee Mermaid to exit signs written in other languages so that visitors had to pay to get back in. He was a great talker never to be left outside arm's reach. The film never goes into that. They say he is the King of Humbuggery, but he does little to warrant the title. In fact, they even go to great lengths to over up his exploits. Tom Thumb is introduced at 25, a dwarf hidden away by his mother. He was adopted by the real Barnum at 4 and started performing at 5. It gets to the point that the only real connection between the two is a name and a gift of gab.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a terrible movie. Reading the 11 questions from EW and some of the professional reviews really makes it sound worse than it is. Its just a lacking movie. A movie about the man who watered down his stage play of Uncle Tom's Cabin to make it family friendly, its only fitting they do the same to him. I just have to question why they chose to put a trailer for The Commuter with a scene of a man being pushed in front of a bus before it. Right after the Gnome sequel too. In fact, I question why most of the trailers were included when only one seemed age appropriate."

","I went to see this movie after hearing so many amazing things about the music the performances and even the actors that I had quite high expectations for it. <br/><br/>The film completely lived up to them as well. It was an incredible film to watch. Usually I get bored of watching musicalls as the songs become so incessant that you can't understand the story properly. This was the complete opposite there was plenty of music but it would always stop in time to tell the story. 
Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron and Zendaya did an amazing job performing the roles of their characters and gave really brought them to life. 
Even having only watched the movie once I can already tell that it will be one of my favourites and I will be able to watch it on repeat for many years. 
I think it will become a family favourite and an instant classic movie."

"zdfranz","8","0","2","1 January 2018"," The Best Musical Soundtrack in Decades.
","What makes a musical a great movie? If it's story and character development-bringing you closer to every emotional twist and turn, energizing the empty space between each song-The Greatest Showman is a mediocre enterprise. If, however, it's music that makes a musical, then Showman is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best musicals in decades.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially a biography of P.T. Barnum, whose name is synonymous with the circus he founded. It's 19th century New York. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) grows up a tailor's son, then a street rat. He marries the wealthy Charity and they have two beautiful daughters.<br/><br/>Years later they're still in New York, barely getting by. Charity's happily left her silver spoon behind, but Barnum wants more for her, their daughters, and himself-even if he doesn't know it.<br/><br/>His imagination and drive lead to a museum, which becomes a freak show, then is renamed a 'circus.' But, perhaps, not even Phineas Taylor Barnum could have foreseen the heights his creation would eventually reach.<br/><br/>It's not a rare narrative arc; you've seen this story before: goodhearted businessman breaks his foot getting it in the door, finally earns his fortune, then risks everything to remember what life is really all about. And, while Showman is inspired by true events, no cynic would be chided for narrowing an eye toward such benevolent treatment of a character many consider a swindler and a fraud.<br/><br/>None of this, though, is likely to matter by the time the end credits role. Because the music-the songs, the dancing-are just that good. From The Other Side, sung by Barnum and his new partner Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron), to Carlyle and Anne Wheeler (Zendaya) soaring through Rewrite the Stars, to Lettie Lutz's (Keala Settle) show stopping This is Me, every tune is a prime cut. Never Enough, The Greatest Show, A Million Dreams-trust me, the titles don't do them justice.<br/><br/>But a soundtrack is one thing...and one thing only; it's half a movie. You need visuals to bring the lyrics to life. Enter Jackman, who, with his effervescence and likeability, seems born to play Barnum. Efron reminds us of the musical chops that made him a star in the first place; Williams and Zendaya each shine in the vocal spotlight, the former surprising us with her talent, the latter not at all.<br/><br/>This might be why The Greatest Showman is, in parts, an acute disappointment. There is such opportunity for more here, beyond song and stage. But from the start the film adopts a streamlined, almost frantic storytelling. Details are glossed over; years of activity are condensed within the melody of a montage.<br/><br/>This style doesn't necessarily have to backfire, but Showman lacks the patience to make it work. The movie is like a rock on a lake, skipping over its dramatic possibilities, never quite breaking their surface. It also carries hints of the metaphysical, sometimes seeming more dreamlike than real. This can enchant, but also isolate, keeping an audience at arm's length from a world and characters struggling to attain true flesh and blood. <br/><br/>And yet...the music. It all comes back to that. This is, after all, a musical. Upon further review, relating the story may not be such a lost cause. For we don't always need to know a character through what they say and do, but by how they sing and dance. Lyrics-the right lyrics, sung in the right way-have the power to reveal a human heart in greater detail than the grandest soliloquy or deepest history ever could.<br/><br/>That is what The Greatest Showman does. We know these characters, this world, through their song. Perhaps that is what a musical was always meant to be."

","Today I watched The Greatest Showman.
***SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS**
A world of weirdos, freaks and fantastic costumes is an easy sale for me so I've been looking forward to this for some time and I was not disappointed - from the very single opening shot - which is superb! I was hooked. Properly hooked.
I loved it all the way through.
Yes it's a very basic plot and a very basic script, very light in substance and quite predictable but if you want sumptuous visuals, incredible dance sequences and some really great cinematic moment it delivers the goods big time. Performances are excellent across the cast particularly good are Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson (Playing singer Jenny Lind). Proper on screen chemistry.
For my money I enjoyed it far more than LA LA Land, but for some reason it's had a lot of bad press. Too much willing suspension of disbelief perhaps? They have gone to a lot of effort on costume and wardrobe for that time period, but then one of the dancers is wearing DMs so, erm... Anyhoo.
There are three stand out scenes that should win this film Cinematography and Choreography awards left right and centre. Jackman and Effrom in the Bar with the barman is just the best choreographed scene I think I have ever seen and the 'Rope dance' with Effron and Zendaya defies gravity, and the premiere of Jenny Lind on stage is captivating.
I loved this film and if you need a bit of unashamed entertainment in this time of cold and darkness you could do a lot worse.
5/5. One of my favourite films of 2017."

","My last movie review for 2017-
and it's a good one, I loved this original screen musical not as much as La La Land but think Moulin Rouge meets La La land and there are similarities.
If you don't like musicals ,perhaps this movie may not appeal but if you enjoy an interesting story based on some fact and plenty of spectacle and a very talented cast headed by Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum you may enjoy this cleverly crafted film.
I love musicals and there are plenty of original songs and great Circus choreography in The Greatest Showman.
Michelle Williams is delightful as Barnum's wife and Zac Efron , plays a great supporting role as Barnum's business partner.
I'll be pleasantly surprised if this is a great box office success I hope it is because it deserves success and has a timely message 
of accepting and celebrating diversity and differences inhuman kind.
It's not what a person looks like physically that counts even if their a bearded lady or a giant or dwarf it's the similarities we should celebrate not their differences.

"brankovranjkovic","9","0","2","29 December 2017"," The Greatest Showman: Chasing the American Dream
","Loosely based on the true story of PT Barnum, this is an original and extravagant musical that celebrates the birth of 'show business'. <br/><br/>This tells the rags to riches story of a pioneer who rose from nothing to create a circus of oddities that became a worldwide sensation.
Hugh Jackman plays the circus pioneer, and follows his life from boy to businessman. His poor background drives him to success through some very risky business ventures directly following the loss of his job. 
Hugh convinces Zac Efron to quit his highly paid luxurious life to become his apprentice ringmaster. Along the way Zac falls in love with the ethnic trapese artist Zendaya played by Anne Wheeler. Michelle Williams plays his wife. Rebecca Ferguson plays the talented opera singer Jenny Lind. <br/><br/>There are many great catchy musical sequences, with lyrics from the composers of La La Land, the most memorable being ""This Is Me"" sung by Keala Settle as the Bearded Lady. Great costumes. Great acting. The Greatest Showman is an instant classic but with modern touches. This film celebrates human diversity, is full of colour, emotion and plenty of knee slides. <br/><br/>Professional critics are rating this generally low, while the audiences are rating it high. Don't follow the 'experts', many I presume are just trying to appear intellectual! <br/><br/>See this soon and end the year on a high energy, hugely entertaining climax. Very highly recommended."
