","Perhaps I'm a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it's located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.<br/><br/>Still, judging 28 Days Later entirely on its merit as a film, it's easy to arrive at the conclusion that it's a fantastic achievement, as well as a coming-of-age of sorts for director Danny Boyle; I can't say the MTV-inspired vanity of The Beach, or the self-consciously trendy posturing of Trainspotting appealed to me, and to my shame I initially expected 28 Days Later to be given a similar treatment. Thankfully, my fears proved unfounded, discarded straight after a opening sequence which is at once effortless and fearsome. The rest of the movie was a joy. A terrifying joy, but a joy nonetheless.<br/><br/>It's true that sometimes minimalism can be more effective than overblown bravado, and it's definitely true for this movie. It's the scenes of complete silence which get to you the most; an entire metropolis empty. The grainy picture serves to add a documentary-style quality to the film, which makes the whole situation seem almost too real to bear. Definitely a wise choice to film this on digital video.<br/><br/>You will occasionally meet people who thought 28 Days Later wasn't 'scary' or 'gory' enough. These are the same people who will tell you that 2001 was 'boring', or that Memento was 'confusing'. Ignore them. Others didn't understand the purpose of the second half, or were confused by its change of pace, feeling that it distracted from the movie as a whole. However, I personally regard the second half as very important because, as another reviewer pointed out, it makes a very succinct point: What is scarier, the end of the world, or having the world repopulated by maniacs? That, I think, is where the real Horror of 28 Days Later lies.<br/><br/>28 Days Later, like the Romero zombie flicks of yore, is ultimately an allegory of the days we are living in, an age in which we are constantly confronted with violence by the media (much like the ape right at the start of the film), where violence begets violence, and humanity faces an uncertain future. I applaud Danny Boyle's bravery in making 28 Days Later because he undoubtedly took a big commercial risk when the majority of the cinema-going public might prefer escapism to words of caution. Remember, Rage is a human-made disease. Quite the allegory there.<br/><br/>Like most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. I have no doubt it will go down in history as a classic, the one movie which perfectly sums up the confused era we are living in. And even if you didn't like it, it would be advisable to give 28 Days Later another chance; it's a haunting experience when looked at from the right angle. Danny Boyle has many years left in him, I hope he'll continue making more movies like this."
"shanfloyd","8","356","456","30 December 2004"," What makes it different...
","This film is about a virus, 'Rage' virus that makes the infected person mad with extreme rage and hungry for blood. Within 28 days one outbreak in London caused entire Britain dead or evacuated leaving behind a blood-thirsty infected population and a handful of solitary normal persons. Civilization came to a halt, society got destroyed while those limited survivors fight for existence among frequent attack by the vicious victims.<br/><br/>Sounds familiar? Then what makes ""28 Days Later..."" a classic among a horde of zombie/biohazard movies? Simply a touch of art that Danny Boyle is able to bring what others could not. The others focus too much on extensive, special-effects-controlled, gory action sequences between infected and normals, with heavy background music. But here there's always a tinge of sadness, emptyness, helplessness. Consider that empty London scene with that background music. We found out there's much else to show than just electrifying action or gore to describe the picture of life in this condition that these movies talk about.<br/><br/>There are mistakes and loopholes in this movie. But that couldn't weaken the otherwise tight-gripping storyline. The greatest achievement of this movie is to make one viewer stay neutral throughout the film, without taking any side in the first place. Because the virus we talk about is simply used as a metaphor. 'Rage' is shown as a social disease. That makes it a 'serious' film, not a flick. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this. 5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention Cillian Murphy was awesome?"
"ljbad","Null","153","193","28 June 2004"," Quite good
","I'm amazed there are so many negative reviews of this film; I thought it succeeded on every level. It's artistic and atmospheric, with a great pace, sympathetic characters, and a fantastic climax. The music is very nicely done, and, to me, the eerie opening scenes of the empty London streets are worth the price of admission all on their own. I'm a stubborn viewer, and, normally, when a film benefits from early critical buzz in the manner that this one did, I find some excuse not to like it. But not this time; I'm completely impressed. (Incidentally, I think it's interesting that while most horror films these days seem to have been inspired by knockoffs of knockoffs, ""28 Days Later"" apparently owes more to John Wyndham's classic disaster novel ""The Day of the Triffids"" than to anything else. And that's a good thing.) HIGHLY recommended."
"terpsfan89","Null","40","47","30 June 2004"," this movie broke my thumb!!
","No, I'm not kidding. I've been a horror fan for years, but few movies scared me, until one of my friends told me about this one. I rented it, wondering if it was any good, and I watched it. Well, I was very impressed...so impressed that I freaked out during one of the scenes and reached for a pillow, and my thumb snapped back, breaking the bone. Sad, isn't it? This movie is that good. If you can find a movie that can cause you to react and break a bone, then you've found a movie worth watching. 28 Days Later had an amazing plot, great actors, a great director, and most of all, it wasn't like all of the other horror movies. It's now one of my favorites, and one of the best horror type films I have seen."
"KUAlum26","8","214","282","10 August 2005"," An Existential Drama,with Horror woven in
","The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.<br/><br/>When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.<br/><br/>This film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.<br/><br/>An very interesting and disturbing flick that probably sold itself wrong."
"Quinoa1984","10","236","315","16 August 2003"," one of the best European horror films this decade
","The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive in the cinemas, as of late, is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime 60s and 70s era of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be on any given list one of the greatest horror directors (I included), it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of 28 Days Later- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work. <br/><br/>What does Boyle and his team set out to do to freshen up the zombie string? By making not in precise terms a ""zombie"" movie- you never hear ""living-dead"" uttered in this film, although you do hear ""infected"" and a new word for what these people have, ""rage"". Indeed, this is what the infected have in Britain, when a monkey virus gets let loose on the Island, and from the beginning of the infectious spread the film cuts to a man, Jim, lying in a hospital bed, who wanders abandoned streets and views torn fragments of society in front of him. That Boyle implements atmosphere as heavily as he does with the action/chase scenes gives an indication of his dedication to the detail. Jim soon finds a few other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris) and a father and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns) who hear of salvation on a radio and decide to brave it out to find it. When they do, it's a military outpost that's without any true salvation, outside of the various military typos. <br/><br/>Like in Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald's spellbinding (if that's the proper terminology) adaptation of Trainspotting, the craft is on par (or arguably topping) with the story and characters, and thus it has to captivate us all the more so to care about the plight of Jim and his companions. The photography by Anthony Dod Mantle is striking, not the least of which since it was done on digital photography (like in Blair Witch, the use of non-professional camera equipment adds the proper shading when needed), but also many of the shot compositions are different for such a film. The editing by Chris Gill goes quicker than expected in the attack scenes, going so fast between the infected throwing up blood, the screaming on-looker; the new infected transforming within seconds, and then the results that follow. Mark Tildesley's production design, as well as John Murphy's music, evokes haunting, evocative moods even in the more mundane scenes. And the acting, considering not many of the actors are well-known, is more than believable for such a script. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if 28 Days Later will be everyone's cup of tea. Some of the horror and science fiction fans out there will immediately hear of this film, see a preview or a TV ad, or even see it, and dismiss it as phooey rubble borrowed from the video-store. I can see their points of view, since I saw many similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of Day of the Dead, though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in Dawn of the Dead). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, 28 Days Later is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen, and like not many other sci-fi horror films you've ever seen combined, in a sense, for a modern audience: fascinating throughout."
"soymaid327","Null","117","159","16 July 2004"," the one thing
","The one thing that made this movie effective... well, let me back up. Ever have a nightmare where you're being stalked, or otherwise threatened, and you could die, and it's scary as hell? I mean, the absolute worst? Now, think: have you ever had a nightmare where someone you love was already dead, and you knew it, you saw it?<br/><br/>It's infinitely worse.<br/><br/>This movie recognizes that. There is some action, yes, mostly towards the end, but what makes this movie one of the scariest I've seen is its method of accessing the deepest fears in all of us -- not fear for ourselves, of our own deaths, but for others, our families and loved ones, and the utter, complete loneliness if they were to simply be gone forever. This is a post-apocalyptic movie that really drives in the impact of the idea, to devastating effect. It makes everything more engaging: the characters feel more real (though this is also due to the excellent script), the danger more immediate. But this is not a things-pop-out-and-scare-you horror movie. It's a film that will haunt you."

","28 Days Later successfully takes the zombie genre to a new level, this movie is far more than just a horror flick. There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like, some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.<br/><br/>The story is well written and avoids the clichéd cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And I must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.<br/><br/>For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.<br/><br/>I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - I am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.<br/><br/>If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.<br/><br/>9/10"
"nycritic","9","84","115","9 May 2005"," An Emotion Infects a Nation.
","A film that at time plays like a frenzied docudrama, 28 DAYS LATER... is unrelenting, grim, horrific, and completely nightmarish. Images of violence against humans dominates the screen for a few minutes, and we soon learn these are televisions mounted against a wall, broadcasting non-stop footage of the inhuman things people do to one another. A monkey lies strapped down, facing these images, helpless. There are others in cages nearby. A band of environmentalists break in, predictably to free these imprisoned monkeys, but a conflict ensues as a scientist barges in and warns them it would be completely insane to do so -- they're infected with Rage. However, since scientists normally equal evil corporations and dehumanized technology known for cruelty not only against animals but humans, they proceed to free one of the apes... and total pandemonium breaks loose as the monkey viciously attacks its freer, and in seconds we see her eyes have become red. She is an infected.<br/><br/>And this is the simple setup for a movie that in 100 minutes frightens the pants of even a jaded person. To see shots of a deserted London magnified by shots of abandoned vehicles, overturned equipment, and a haunting collage of missing persons that recalls the scores of photos of the missing that did not survive the 9 - 11 attacks, is extremely disturbing and unsettling and made me squirm in my seat as Cillian Murphy's character Jim walks around town, having awaken about a month later from a coma. It's not reassuring for him to know he may be the only surviving person in the city, and soon he learns there are others out there... but not reasonable, frightened people as much as ferocious predators who will rip the flesh right off you, and if mercy takes over, you may die right there and then, because it only takes 20 seconds for full infection to take over and turn you into a raving monster.<br/><br/>That he is saved at the last minute by others who have survived the madness is his saving grace. These are Naomi Harris as Selena and Noah Huntley as Mark, who brief Jim on what happened in haunting monologues, and that Danny Boyle stays focused on Huntley's face as he relates to Jim his own story is flashback enough: it only heightens the terror that swept London and that is still alive and well. This prompts Jim to go visit his parents, maybe hoping they are still alive, and after a near-fatal encounter with an infected there in which Mark does not survive (Selena, absolutely committed to survive this, hacks him to pieces after quickly noticing he's been infected), they barely manage to escape more infected before meeting two other people, a bearish man and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns). They have been listening to scattered transmissions that are indicating Manchester holds a possible refuge for survivors.<br/><br/>Once they make the decision to leave to Manchester the movie takes a turn and becomes a road film and involved a harrowing if somewhat implausible escape from London through a tunnel, where even the rats are running away from the sheer horror these barely seen people have become. That they eventually meet this fort in an already destroyed Manchester gives them little reassurance, which proves to be true as a small band of military guys lead by Christopher Eccleston have dubious intentions with the women.<br/><br/>And here is where Danny Boyle cleverly turns an apocalyptic movie into a study of the human race: can the people who are supposedly meant to protect us be actually worse than the ones who have fallen to a devastating plague? The answer, quite simply, turns out to be yes. That this makes Jim do a much needed transition from dazed youth to fierce survivor drives the point even more home: Rage wiped out most of the population, as a virus, but in given circumstances, is found quite well within us, and Jim becomes so filled with it at one climactic sequence it takes Selena a second before reacting that he hasn't yet been infected.<br/><br/>This is a very tense film. There are moments of quietude in a field, where sleep comes uneasy, and even that moment to me was worse than any of the moments when the infected actually sped out and after any of the characters. Seen in stroboscopic images, they becomes even more frightening than if seen as lumbering idiots. If the ending seems a little too upbeat, maybe it's only the decision Boyle and the screenwriters took after having us gone through so much gut-wrenching tension and clear calls, that it was only fair to have Jim, Selena, and Hannah survive and see a glimmer of hope at the end. Other than that, 28 DAYS LATER compresses the battles with good and evil in a world gone wild instead of going all over the place with too many characters like THE STAND and many others do. Intelligent, repulsive at times, unbearable, this was one of the best films of 2003. The DVD release has some nice extras, like alternate endings, deleted scenes, for those into investigating further into Boyle's dark tale."
"tributarystu","8","101","141","12 September 2003"," A Pint of Rage
","As it so happens, 28 Days Later is the best zombie movie in the last few decades. Probably since Romero's classics, if I recall accurately. It stands up on its own in a genre which is frequently plagued by a sort of innate stupidity, a consequence of one too many dead people. Otherwise how could one explain the fact that the most acclaimed zombie films are parodies of the genre? <br/><br/>28 Days Later shares a striking resemblance with Resident Evil, in that it kind of starts where RE left off: after one of the most exciting intro sequences I have ever witnessed (!), a lonely average-Joe, (Jim in this particular case) wakes up in a deserted London and takes a jolly good walk through the intimidatingly empty streets. Man-kind seems to have been wiped out by a contagious virus which induces a sort of blind rage upon those who fall prey to it. As may have guessed by now, this will be a story of survival.<br/><br/>While most horror films will offer a relatively exciting ride with little more than sparse scares, Danny Boyle's movie sheds a new light on the survival instinct of human beings which can damned well spook the living hell out of you - even if not in the traditional sense. Looking at Children of Men might offer some insight into what it feels like to have no future and this itself may clear the way to appreciating 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>I guess it's one of those rare horror films which not only enlighten the viewer with nice, gory slaughters but also with a share of psychological goodies. 28 Days Later doesn't forget ""the Master"" either and offers an obvious and unobtrusive tribute to Dawn of the Dead. All around the movie keeps you going because it is an immersive experience and not just a ""poke-your-finger"" kind of experience."
"Theo Robertson","7","79","112","20 October 2004"," Very Good In Places But Ultimately Unconvincing
","Long before I watched 28 DAYS LATER I had an online conversation with a couple of my cyber friends Jeremy and Riquez . Jeremy praised the movie thinking it was one of the best film releases in several years . I did point out to him the ridiculous idea that a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds wouldn't be able to cause the type of havoc as featured in the movie . Riquez contributed to the conversation by saying "" Theo you have no problem with rabid zombies but you find a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds ridiculous ! "" After finally seeing 28 DAYS LATER ( Thanks for the video Robin ) my reservations were confirmed , the audience can quite happily accept the concept of raging psychos tearing up the country destroying all in their path but the thought put into small details spoils the film somewhat <br/><br/>!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>Most of the problems lie in Alex Garland's script , it lacks depth , logic and internal continuity . Take for example the line where Selena tells Jim that the apocalypse was caused by something in the blood . How would she know this ? This is an example of characters knowing what's happening because the screenwriter does which is a mistake on Alex Garland's part . The reverse is also very true with characters being unable to work out things the audience has . Before seeing the movie I did have online conversations on the message board that a virus that takes 20 seconds to turn people into zombies wouldn't be able to spread world wide , indeed this is central to the plot and Sgt Farrell does state that "" How does the infection spread across the oceans , mountains and rivers ? "" and yet he's the only character in the story to draw this very obvious conclusion that only mainland Britain has been struck by rage . It would have been far less obvious if Selena and others had been totally ignorant as to the mechanics of infection <br/><br/>As for the gaps in logic ask yourself this: If the soldiers want to keep Selena and Hannah as sex slaves why didn't they murder Jim as soon as they saw him ? I guess if they did we wouldn't have a story , but the screenplay is full of these niggling problems , like Jones and Mitchell getting into a fight so Jim can escape or West and Davies going to the barricade to kill Jim when they've got everything they need ( ie Selena and Hannah ) at the house . There's no reason for the soldiers to care about killing Jim<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the characterisation . Selena is shown as being tough as nails and totally ruthless at the start of the story and then needs rescuing by Jim at the end . Compare her to characters in say a John Christopher story where the protagonist starts off as middle class and mild mannered and ends up having to kill to survive . This is what happens to Jim but it seems a totally ridiculous character arc as he wipes out West's platoon . Jim has spent a month in a coma , has no military experience and manages to beat some squaddies who not only managed to survive mass attacks of the infected but had considerable battle experience before rage . I'm telling you Saddam must be kicking himself about not recruiting any bicycle couriers into the Iraqi army <br/><br/>I will absolve Garland of any blame for the bizarre upbeat ending where Jim survives a bullet wound to the stomach and lives happily ever after with Selena and Hannah since the studio demanded a happy ending for their audience . Let's be honest here , the only ending that would have made sense is Jim dying and the two girls facing an uncertain future with rage turning into a pandemic holocaust <br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that I hated 28 DAYS LATER . I liked it a lot and will praise director Danny Boyle for making a tense and often very thrilling film . The use of digital video succeeds and the cinematography is breath taking especially the scenes set at the rain drenched roadblock where you can almost see every single raindrop falling pass the screen . The casting is somewhat uneven ( The French foreign legion isn't that cosmopolitan never mind the British army ) but mention must go to Ricci Harnett as Cpl Mitchell who plays one of cinema's most memorable thugs in a long time , Leo Bill might give an irritating performance as Jones but that's the way he's written , Naomie Harris is impressive where she's not let down by the script and the only real disappointment is Christopher Ecclestone as Major West who seems slightly miscast <br/><br/>I gave 28 DAYS LATER seven out of ten but to be honest this should have been so much better . One can't help thinking Boyle would have been better off filming an adaptation of John Christopher's THE DEATH OF GRASS . As it stands it's a very good example of if a film is good it's because of the director . If it's bad it's because of the screenwriter"

","In England a group of animal rights activists break into a research facility to free monkeys.  However the monkeys are infected with a new developed virus called rage which is contagious by blood or bodily fluid - at the same time Jim lies in a coma.  28 days later Jim awakens from his state to find London deserted and populated only by a group of those infected by rage. Jim is rescued by Selena and her friend who tell him what has happened and start a search for other survivors and a quest to find the cure, promised by a military unit stationed in the north.<br/><br/>I excitedly arrived at the preview for this looking forward to a tense British horror movie to make me jump with fear.  I got pretty much what I wanted.  The plot is simple and omits much detail but not to it's disservice.  Details as to what the virus is or what it was created in the first place (by putting monkeys in front of TV's Clockwork Orange style?) but the detail is not important seconds into the film when we wake up with Jim.  At this point his fear becomes ours and what is important to him is not the detail but the bigger picture of the infected and the chances of survival.<br/><br/>The plot is told in two parts.  First the big picture in London and then the smaller battle north of Manchester.  Both are well told but for different reasons.  The bridging section of the journey north is good as it helps us know the characters better.  Of course is it scary?  Well, not scary but thrilling all the way.  To me scary is things like Ringu - creepy stuff, but most will be freaked by 28 days later.  The infected are not zombies in definition or in action - they move silently and fast and with pure blood lust. I was always more scared by zombie flicks than anything else becomes they keep coming - here they do the same but fast!<br/><br/>The direction is good for the most part.  The opening scene in London just shows how badly Crowe did his bit in Vanilla Sky.  Here it is clever and chilling to see much of London totally empty.  The direction is better when it is fast cutting and handheld style.  We see things like the characters would see them out of the corner of their eyes, a flicker, a shadow etc and it works to great effect.  The only downside is that, at one or two points, the attacks were signalled by a preceding talking 5 minutes, but this is minor.  The final rain soaked action is excellent - fast, gripping and paced.  This film doesn't rely on gore or special effects (although it is there) instead it has genuine tension and fear.<br/><br/>The film is very British.  It is very low-key and realistic.  The survivors are not Mad Max style heroes but people clinging to life by a thread or setting up survivalist measures that simply don't work.  The ending is not as good as I had hoped but it wasn't bad and it fitted with the tone of reality that Jim had realised when lying on his back in the woods towards the end.  It's not without flaws but the film is a very good British horror film - Americans will wonder `where are all the teenager girls to scream' or `why don't they all have guns' or `why is there no real dah-dah music to tell us when something is going to happen' but that is because this is a British film and not Hollywood.<br/><br/>Most reviews have praised the `unknown' cast.  Well I agree the cast did very well - but unknown?  Murphy certainly is not unknown (and won't be from now on) and he does Jim very well, from when the truth is first real to him, to his decision that he must learn to kill through to his transformation near the end.  Harris is excellent again, I say again as she did well in miniseries `white teeth'.  Her accent is British and she plays a younger role but she is a good actress.  Brendan Gleeson is good in a fatherly role but Eccleston seems clipped and at odds with his military role.  In fact all the military guys were laddish caricatures and only just did the job - but I never believed in their characters as I did with the others.<br/><br/>Overall I was glad to see this early.  I really enjoyed it, the pace at times may have been uneven but to me that added to the tension - an attack could come at any time.  The eventual small scale focus helped the tension and pace of the story.  Thrilling, scary, tense and well written - even more surprising is that it's home grown!"

","Danny Boyle is an exceptionally gifted filmmaker and I've been enamored with his work since the brilliant ""Shallow Grave."" ""Trainspotting"" only gets better every time you see it and ""A Life Less Ordinary"" has some bright moments. (The singing and dancing number is parfait.) Mr. Boyle hit a bump in the road when it came to ""The Beach,"" but then he forsake us all by casting DiCaprio. He's back to redeem himself, as is Alex Garland, with ""28 Days Later,"" a marvelous twist on the apocalyptic film.<br/><br/>IMDB's summary isn't completely accurate in that ""nearly the entire planet has been wiped out."" But that's a plot twist you'll have to uncover for yourself. What occurs - a la ""12 Monkeys"" - is while trying to expose the work taking place at a primate research center, a group of activists unwittingly release a virus called rage. The way it works is if a person is bitten by an infected person, he or she develops a murderous rage and desire to kill within 10 to 12 seconds. (Infection can also occur if the afflicted person's blood enters another person's body, through the nose, eye, mouth or open wound.)<br/><br/>Twenty-eight days after being hit by a car, Jim, a bike courier and our film's hero, wakes up to find London deserted. He eventually meets two other survivors and then encounters another two. After picking up a radio broadcast that calls all uninfected people to Manchester, the survivors fight off the infected and make their way to what seems like the promised land. Complications follow is all I'll say.<br/><br/>Some have compared this film to George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead,"" giving some people the wrong impression that this is the British take on the zombie flick. Wrong. The infected aren't zombies but they are terrifying. They can be killed and the director doesn't gross us out by showing the infected feasting on human flesh. (All in all, ""28 Days"" isn't visually disgusting. It's the thought of what's going on that bothers you.)<br/><br/>The acting in this film is really first rate, with Cillian Murphy giving an emotionally compelling performance. As in most Boyle films, the camera work also is exceptional and in the first part we are shown some phenomenal long shots of an evacuted London with a soundtrack devoid of sound. The effect is gooseflesh raising. Boyle also adds in other nice touches, like a bunch of goldfish swimming in about five inches of water. (Symbolism?) And a scene with wild horses is another fine moment.<br/><br/>The story too goes beyond what we might expect. We get the jumps associated with zombie films - they come out of no where and travel in packs - and yet the heroes don't come off too much better. One character suggests that the virus, by killing off humankind, returns things to normalcy. Christopher Eccleston, a terrific actor, retorts that before the virus man killed man and now he's still doing it. So what's changed? The film also suggests that to save yourself, you would have to kill anyone - child, adult; family member, stranger. And these characters do. But what's noteworthy is we see how having to make those sorts of decisions affects them, particularly Jim.<br/><br/>Like Lord of the Flies, the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said the film fell apart after the first 45 minutes when, in fact, I felt it only got stronger. The last half of the film proved to be very intense. Garland truly raised the stakes.<br/><br/>If you enjoy your scares with a bit more thought to them, ""28 Days Later"" won't disappoint. (And if you do, try these similar films - ""12 Monkeys,"" ""Quiet Earth"" and ""Lord of the Flies."")"
"dave_472","8","63","95","20 June 2005"," Wow! A horrifying, survivalist-type thriller that is GREAT
","This film was fantastic. I was expecting something along the lines of a combination of ""Resident Evil"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but this is quite different from that description. Yes, it involves a terrible disease that leaves its infected victims as blood-sucking, mindless zombies who pray on the not-yet-infected and yes, it involves a group of survivors who are left together to fend for themselves. But it is quite different from Resident Evil (no comic-book or video-game type plot here and no explosives or automatic weapons) and is a much more thrilling ""survivalist-type"" film than ""The Day After Tomorrow"".<br/><br/>An awful virus is spreading through the streets and cities of Great Britain. Soon nearly everybody is affected by this deadly disease that turns its victims into zombies, who are quite noticeable and different from normal people due to their odd/rapid body movements, their blood red eyes, foaming at the mouth, and their inability to communicate with normal people unless they are trying to bite them. A small group of survivors manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe. They do eventually make it there, but what can stop zombies (who are mindless, blood-thirsty and have nothing to lose) from invading an army base? Are the survivors and British soldiers safe? Or will they soon become zombies themselves?<br/><br/>This film is quite scary and exciting and perhaps one of the best British films that I have seen from modern times...

","This, I have to say, was one of the better viral-zombie films I have seen. The plot was highly un-original, but extremely well made. The acting was powerfully preformed, the filming having many ""diagonally tilted camera view"" scenes, giving off more suspense, without the reliance on the overly used ""scary music"". Also, the addition of the alternate ending gave a strong closing to the film. This is the kind of movie that you end up feeling physically drained after seeing your first time. It will suck you in until the end, every time. I seriously recommend seeing this if you enjoy zombie films, you will not be disappointed."
"Coventry","5","47","75","3 February 2005"," Uneven horror film, but with occasional flashes of sheer brilliance
","Back in good old Great Britain, Danny Boyle proves that he's still a gifted filmmaker even though his short Hollywood career wasn't as fruitful as initially hoped for. The opening sequences of this ""28 Days Later"" are downright astonishing and  for a moment  you suspect that you're about to watch to most brilliant horror film in a long, long time. Especially the already classic sequence in which Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through the entirely deserted streets of the otherwise so lively and crowded London, guided by disturbing music, is efficiently creepy. The plot centers on an extremely aggressive virus that turns people into blood-crazed maniacs. It's only 28 days since the virus was unleashed and the entire population is wiped away already, while a few lonely survivors desperately prepare for the total apocalypse. Jim is one of them, as he just awoke from a coma, completely unaware of the vile events that took place the past 28 days Even though the story isn't very original (Romero's ""The Crazies"" come to mind as well as ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""), Danny Boyle succeeds in portraying a gripping mix of drama, action, suspense and  oh yes  gore! Now, I really wished I could end my user comment here and conclude that ""28 Days Later"" was a simply great new horror film but unfortunately the script takes a complete U-turn halfway and becomes a repetitive lesson in which Boyle and writer Alex Garland try to convince us that mankind still remains the biggest threat of all. The last survivors end up at a military post where their lives are even in bigger danger. The tension and carefully built up atmosphere disappears and is replaced by tedious macho speeches and gratuitous brutality. The acting performances in this film aren't very spectacular but that's understandable considering most cast-members are debuting here. The fact that this project was entirely filmed with digital cameras might be a nice trivia element, but I'm not too keen on this type of cinematography. Overall, Boyle's film is worthy viewing for horror fans but experienced fanatics won't be too impressed."
"razorpetti37","3","79","137","22 May 2005"," Has more loop holes than an amusement park
","This movie is mildly entertaining but there are a ridiculous amount of loop holes. In fact, there are so many that it becomes distracting while viewing the film. This is quite disappointing because the idea of the film has so much more potential, although it is an idea that has remarkable similarities to about 20 other zombie type flicks. First i'll start off with what i liked, then i will continue with a list of loopholes and other points that ruin this movie.<br/><br/>-The lab scene at the beginning is a decent introduction. I like this explanation of where the virus came from considering real life viruses such as AIDs supposedly came from chimps. I also found it a much more believable reason for a apocalypse type virus than in other movies, at least the virus didn't come in an asteroid or something. I found ""Dawn of the Dead"" to be quite similar to this movie in so many ways but in ""Dawn of the Dead"", they don't give you an explanation of where the virus came from. I also liked how there is a little more to the story than just fighting off zombies. Actually, most of the movie doesn't even involve fighting off zombies, most of it is them just talking (which makes the movie kind of boring at times).<br/><br/>*Now for the parts that make this movie horrible* -So he wakes up in the hospital and is the only one there? For one, why would there not be other patients who couldn't leave such as the disabled, secondly, if the hospital was evacuated, why would they just leave him there.<br/><br/>-If there was no one there to fill his feeding tubes and stuff, why wouldn't he have died in his sleep -If there is no power in the city, why is the grocery store all lit up inside, especially if there is no one to continue running the power plants.<br/><br/>-So your telling me that with a disaster such as an exodus from Britian, that there were no riots or panicking and nobody tried raiding stores. The food is perfectly stacked and nothing seems to be missing in the grocery store. I would think at least somebody would have gone in there to grab some supplies.<br/><br/>-If these infected people are so vicious and all they do is blood lust, then why do they not attack each other. That makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>-How come the infected are never seen unless the characters are vulnerable? They always show up in hordes yet while looking over the city, you never see them wandering in the streets. At least in ""Dawn of the Dead"" there were masses of zombies everywhere, which made sense if the population was supposed to be infected.<br/><br/>-Apparently a rickety piece of junk taxi can drive like a monster truck over wrecked cars in the tunnel. Why does that make sense? And all they get is a flat.<br/><br/>-Considering the city is supposed to be abandoned besides those who are infected, you would think there would be a lot more parked cars, wrecked cars, and other common city street objects.<br/><br/>-So if the infected are supposed to be vicious and killing machines, then why are there no corpses on the streets? Besides the loft in the church, there were a total of like 10 corpses in the whole movie.<br/><br/>-If the infected kill because they have ""rage"" and not for eating the people, then what do they eat to survive. You never see them eating anyone, so you'd think that after 28 days of not eating anything, they would have died. If they don't eat their victims, what are they eating since the grocery stores are intact.<br/><br/>-When they are filling up with gas, i find it very curious that even though they know not to go anywhere alone, Jim decides to go wandering into a dark shack by himself for absolutely no reason. Big surprise that there's an infected person in there...<br/><br/>-So these military guys have this secure base set up and apparently nobody but they survived the move from the previous base. At the barricade there were parked cars and stuff implying that there were civilians that came yet there are none with the leftover military men.<br/><br/>-You think that trained military men would be able able to find a slightly more secure place to make a base. If they planned on surviving there for a long time, i think it would make sense to find a place more easily defend-able.<br/><br/>-This is what really doesn't make sense: If these military guys have the radios to send out a strong broadcast, then why would they not be able to pick up transmissions from other countries that are not infected? -If there are other countries that are not infected, then why would none of them be concerned with finding survivors in Britain. If they do this at the end by flying over the country side with a jet, then why would the military guys never see a plane that would give them hope that the rest of the world is OK.<br/><br/>-Apparently a scrawny bike carrier can undermine 8 or 9 trained military personnel. He somehow gets back onto the property unnoticed (which nobody has been able to do yet), then he sneaks around the property like some sort of ninja, then moves throughout the house without running into any of the military guys or any of the infected military guys. Why is he so skilled all of a sudden.<br/><br/>That about covers all the loopholes i can think of. I'm sure there are many more but that just goes to show how ridiculous this movie is. I'm normally not so picky about movies but this one just bugs me."

","I originally saw this in the Cinema and left un-entertained. I thought it was a good idea that was shoddily executed. Some acting was appalling especially the daughter, can't remember her name.<br/><br/>Also, Danny Boyle isn't a good director, he's meant to be making a horror film here and he puts a stupid supermarket scene in. It starts with trolleys being ridiculously choreographed through the checkouts and the 2 girls having great fun helping themselves to the chocolate, forget 5 minutes before, when they were nearly savaged by the sprinting zombies.<br/><br/>And the ending?! What a joke. Cillian Murphy is suddenly an action hero. Nowhere before in the movie did it reveal that he had such stealth skills and the nerve to take out trained army personnel.<br/><br/>28 Weeks Later was by far a superior film. So when 28 Days Later was on TV last night, I thought maybe I was being a bit harsh with it, so I watched it again. After two hours, I realised I wasn't being harsh enough."
"RazziDazzi","1","72","125","6 July 2003"," Shockingly stupid film. Here's why... (SPOILERS)
","Bad horror films tend to hit bottom when their characters make idiotic choices and leave the audience scratching their head wondering, `why the hell he do that?'  By this standard, 28 DAYS LATER. plummets to bottom of the bad movie barrel.  Rarely have  film characters made such consistently, stupefying decisions.  Skip this flick unless you're meeting with friends, have a couple of beers, and want an impromptu session of  Mystery Science Theater 3000.<br/><br/>Okay, how dumb are the characters?  Let's start.  (SPOILER ALERT AGAIN)<br/><br/>-- Our lead Female finds a guy who just woke up from a coma, so at night when the Infected roam, she goes to sleep and lets him stand guard. without telling him not to light candles as they will attracted the Infected.<br/><br/>-- So he lights the candle, not being bright enough himself to see the danger.  Then he starts watching video tapes!!!  (Where the hell is the electricity coming from!!!??)  The Infected see the light and attack. What a surprise.  As a result, she has to murder her partner. By this point, you wish she was dead too.<br/><br/>-- Next, they find the Father and his Daughter.  The Father is extremely cautious guarding his child, wears goggles and layered clothing to protect against accidental infection (as did our two initially survivors).  But protective clothing is too intelligent a response so our characters promptly abandon the idea and go on a road trip sans any protective gear.  And what do you know.Father gets infected when accidentally blood drops into his eyes.  He's killed.  Boy, I didn't see that twist coming.  Guess, if he wore protective gear like he did in the beginning of the film, we wouldn't have this `twist'.<br/><br/>But I'm getting ahead of myself as more idiocy abounds prior to Father's death.<br/><br/>--  Our merry crew of four has to get to Manchester, and keep in mind that the Infected tend to roam in the darkness.  So what do they do.. Take a dark tunnel short cut!  Who's idea is this idiocy.. The father, who before was so cautious with his daughter's safely, but now's he's feeling. I guess. lucky. Well, the decision almost costs them their lives when the get a flat tire in the tunnel (guess you did see that `twist' coming either).<br/><br/>--  Next comes the stop at the supermarket.  Are our foursome quick in restocking their supplies and moving on.  Nope, they play, quibble about alcohol.. It's not like the sun is setting because next, they.<br/><br/>-- have a picnic!!!!  Out in the open!  How dumb can you get?!?!  Then instead of racing to the refuge in Manchester, they have a leisurely walk! Guess it helps the digestion.<br/><br/>-- Now these amateur idiots go for pro status by spending the night. out in the OPEN WITH A CAMPFIRE ABLAZE!!  (didn't some one get killed when the infected were attracted by a candle!)<br/><br/>This idiocy continues.  People in the theater are starting to laugh by now. I'll spare you more of this mirth, but I got to mention one supremely, idiotic move by our hero.  How does he rescue the two girls from the mansion???  BY UNLEASHING AN INFECTED SOLDIER  INTO THE BUILDING!!!!!!!!! Well, the infection spreads and nearly kills our gals!!!  I'm ready to throw popcorn at the screen by this point.  What a moron this guy is!  And every assault gun he finds. he leaves behind, cause using his thumbs ( I kid you not) is so much more effective.<br/><br/>AHHHHHH!!!!!  And the damn story moves at a snail's pace!"
"Parallax-UK","1","70","130","1 November 2002"," The days are numbered for the British film industry...
","I first saw this film at a test screening about 6 months ago. I decided not to post a review then, as I assumed that there was no way the film would be released as it was, considering the reaction of the test audience. However, it was.<br/><br/>The trailer actually makes the film appear to be quite promising. The audience is promised a tale of virus-ravaged UK, and one man's ordeal to survive. Upon seeing the film, the ordeal is suffered by the audience, who thankfully only have just short of two hours to get through.<br/><br/>The film does indeed begin with a virus being let loose upon the good citizens of Great Britain. After the brief set up, we join Jim (Murphy), a bicycle courier who was locked in a hospital room during the initial 28 days, waking from a coma. After the much publicised scenes of Jim staggering around a deserted London, he hooks up with love interest Selena, and a father and daughter. The quintuplet then embark upon a mostly tedious journey to Manchester, where Major West (Ecclestone) resides over a military base.<br/><br/>The problems with this film are numerous. The script is abysmal, and is not helped along by the performances of the leads. The dull lines are droned out by Murphy in a whinge-like monotone, whilst the usually excellent Christopher Ecclestone delivers his lines like he's in the school play. Thankfully, single-father Frank (Brendan Gleeson) is performed thoughtfully and with warmth. It is a great credit to Gleeson that he turns in such a performance when given such a disgraceful script.<br/><br/>The film is also not helped by the story. It is so ludicrous in places that Jim could have hopped on the London bus at the beginning of the film and driven it through many of the holes. For a capital that has been ravaged by a virus, and evacuated, there is remarkably little evidence left behind. Where are all the vehicles? Why have the shops not been looted?<br/><br/>**********SPOILER PARAGRAPH**************** To top the lot, we are expected to believe that an entire army unit has a) managed to do what apparently only four other people have achieved by staying alive, and b) have gone mad. Have they gone mad because of the virus? No. They've just gone mad. That's it. **********END OF SPOILER*******************<br/><br/>The film looks cheap. Not in a stylish, atmospheric way - it just looks cheap. To give credit where it's due, the zombie attack scenes are reasonably effective. They are powerful and violent enough to ramp up the tension, but this only contrasts to make the rest of the film feel even lamer.<br/><br/>Perhaps the must heinous crime this film commits is that it is excruciatingly boring. A number of people at the test screening actually got up and left. Considering test screenings are free, that goes some way towards explaining just how dull the film is.<br/><br/>I think I've made my point. Two minutes of genuinely scary zombie attacks do not constitute a sufficient payoff for sitting through what is, in summary, a very poor, dull, cheap-looking, boring film. Avoid like the Rage virus - if you go in to this film, it will feel like you're leaving it 28 days later."
"throbert","5","12","18","29 May 2016"," Starts in the UK, but ends in Hollywood
","Starts interesting, but the 2nd half turns into a B-movie. Like Walking dead 7th season would be directed/written by Steven Seagal. It is full with illogical things that are only there for the show (the hero is a bicycle courier... I don't want to give away anything, but after finishing the movie think over the end-show again). The actors are good, the writing/directing is failing here. I really don't know what to add to this review, everything is so foreseeable. When I started the movie I hoped for the best and feared the worst, but in the end the second version came. The whole plot was thinned down to a male-female, badboy-goodboy cliché. I don't even know how could I spoil the story. The first part is an 8, the second is a ~3, so I gave 5."
"isenberg-e","9","21","36","6 March 2005"," Excellent end-of-the-world scenario with a flawed ending
","Although the plot is very unoriginal, I especially liked this version of the story because of the leisurely pace that sets the mood without letting you get bored. The Director didn't mind relatively long sequences without dialog when it was called for; I'm not sure a Hollywood-made film (this one was made in the U.K. by a U.K. company) would have been willing to do this. Ever since Star Wars the reigning action-movie concept in Hollywood seems to be action every 7 minutes max.<br/><br/>I also liked the cinematography. There were great shots (extremely wide, taken from an unusual angle, etc.) that were unorthodox and in another film would have gotten in the way, but here they helped set the mood of a few people isolated in a huge city.<br/><br/>I imagine it would be an even better experience in the theater, where the larger format and viewer being in the dark would have enhanced the feeling of isolation.<br/><br/>**** SPOILER *** The one flaw is the ending, and unfortunately it is a bid problem. In the penultimate scene, the male protagonist (Jim) is shot in the stomach. Now, even in a modern big city, stomach wounds are very often fatal, and virtually always so without prompt surgery. Not only will the victim bleed to death, but even if the bleeding can somehow be stopped, peritonitis will almost always set in. Nevertheless, without anyone having more than a pharmacist's knowledge of medicine, with no surgical tools, and after a car ride where he would certainly have bled out, Jim survives. The last scene shows him hale and hearty, running over a meadow. I suppose there could be some explanation, but none was given, and it broke me out of my ""willing suspension of disbelief.""<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I give the film a ""9"". Definitely worth watching and re-watching."
"catanmax","10","6","8","7 February 2004"," 28 days later is a classic end of the world movie.
","28 days later begins I think much the way a sequel to Resident Evil the movie would begin. Jim wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by drips and wires but no people, he gets up to find the door of his hospital room has been locked and the key pushed under the door. He puts on some clothes and makes his way through the hospital, it is completely deserted. As is the streets which are littered with rubbish, he begins to collect things off the streets he feels he may need, drinks, and even money, he carries them in a plastic bag, it is so quiet you could hear a pin drop. He makes his way through the city until he comes to what seems to be a shrine, it is covered in pictures of 'loved ones' the pictures include photos of families, even young children. Jim still doesn't know what has happened but things are beginning to piece together bit by bit. Common sense tells him something has taken out the population although he doesn't know yet it was a virus. He enters a chapel, as he walks along the upper balcony he looks down over the 'congregation' to see bodies scattered around everywhere, there doesn't seem to be anyone left alive, that is until Jim says 'Hello'...<br/><br/>
28 days later is a classic end of the world movie. These type of movies are my favourite kind of thriller. As I said before if you have seen Resident Evil the movie I am sure you would agree that this movie could almost be a continuation of what would happen with a sequel to it. The scariest thing for me about the movie was the speed of the infected. They are much like zombies, once the virus enters the bloodstream the victim becomes infected within 10-20 seconds, not much time to say your goodbyes. However these 'zombies' move fast, gone are the days of movies like 'Day Of The Dead', where if you had to you could just run past your attacker! Once these critters are on your tail they are hard to shake off."

","28 Days Later, I had heard about this movie a little bit when it was first released here in the US. I wasn't sure what to expect, but people were saying that it was extremely scary and one of the best horror films they had seen in a while. So my mother bought it on DVD and we watched it together, I would say it's not just one of the best horror films in years, but it was also one of the more brilliant one's. We all know the ultimate fear of maybe waking up to a different world and the main character just doesn't wake up to a different world, but a very nightmarish one where people have gone from eating food to eating human flesh! This is not very pretty.<br/><br/>Late one night, British animal rights activists break into a research facility to free chimpanzees being used for medical research. The local scientist warns the activists that the chimps are infected with something he only calls ""Rage,"" but the activists disregard him and set a chimp free. It immediately attacks and infects the activists and scientist. 28 days later, a bicycle courier named Jim awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital. As he leaves the hospital, he discovers London is completely deserted and rife with signs of catastrophe. Jim is soon discovered and chased through the streets by infected people before being rescued by two survivors, Selena and Mark, who rush him to their hideout in the London Underground. They reveal that while Jim was comatose, the virus spread uncontrollably among the populace, turning most people into vicious monsters and resulting in societal collapse, possibly on a global scale. That night, two of the Infected attack the survivors, and when the fight ends they discover that Mark is bleeding and is likely infected. Selena kills him, explaining to Jim that infection is spread through the blood and overwhelms its victims in seconds, rendering them deadly to others. They discover two more survivors, Frank and his teenage daughter Hannah, holed up in an abandoned block of flats. The next morning, Frank informs Jim and Selena that supplies, particularly water, are dwindling, and shows them a prerecorded radio broadcast loop transmitted by soldiers near Manchester who claim to have ""the answer to infection."" But this is the government, we know how this always goes.<br/><br/>This is a great horror film that I'm sure will not disappoint you, this has one of the most intense scenes of all time in it. When the gang is in the tunnel trying to get to the sunlight as quick as they can before the ""virus"" attacks them as well, but they accidentally make a noise and it awakens the dead people and it becomes the ultimate chase for life. Plus these are not George A. Romaro's walking zombies that you can for the most part outrun, this is zombies on speed and they are terrifying. So I do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's a great horror movie, has good actors, and a terrifying story that will probably give you some really scary nightmares. Not to scare you off, but that's an effective horror film and believe me I have seen them all, so 28 Days Later is a new treasure of mine.<br/><br/>8/10"

","28 Days Later has been one of my favourite movies of all time since I first saw the opening scene! The characters are very imaginative and the film has the perfect balance between gore and terror. The music by John Murphy brings the film alive and the camera angles are perfect. It has truly brought the zombie horror back from the dead. The infected and the virus are believable and scary because you never know what those scientists are up to these days... The only downside was the fact that it was only Britain infected (a soldier says that England was quarantined). It would have been a lot scarier if the world was infected because there would be nowhere to run. But overall, Danny Boyle has brought an original idea and made it better and more interesting, and yes, it is scary as hell."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS From the hype and gushes over this film, one would expect way more than one gets out of 28 DAYS LATER. Starting out bleak and hopeless, the film devolves into your standard British tirade against any and all authority figures coupled with some moments that are more ""Rambo"" than ""Dawn of the Dead."" While having zombiedom achieved through a virus is an interesting take on the zombie genre, what wasn't so novel was how, predictably enough, the soldiers (ie, the ""bad men with guns"") are the real threat. Seems that four weeks without female contact is enough to turn these British soldiers into thuggish brutes hell-bent on raping the first women that come across their paths, namely, the film's heroines.<br/><br/>There were a few tense moments and some bits that made me jump, but for the most part, the over-indulgent logic made this film an exercise in debunking than a trip through a hellish world of what if. And given that the Rage victims could be brought down by one good hit anywhere it hurt, one can't help but think that the problems afflicting the heroes in this film might have been rendered moot by a large shotgun or two.<br/><br/>Silly, tepid, and overrated.

","I expect I will stick with Danny Boyle no matter what, because ""Sunshine"" has changed me. I like what he does, circumnavigating zones of cinematic expression. He does it in the jumps from project to project, seemingly exploring both the depth at the center of each lake and its bounds.<br/><br/>But he does it within each project as well, working the overlay among what we seem to need to keep straight as separate genres. I'm not sure I really understand much about the necessity of genres. Surely they are a narrative necessity: a film only lasts a short while and you have to insert yourself into it quickly, filling in all sorts of context along the way based on established assumptions. But there's also the familiarity of stories that goes beyond film, indeed beyond all art and forms the basis of action in life. Art merely acknowledges these stories and is allowed to play with them a bit. Not too much, mind you, which is why combining and overlaying stories is so effective. <br/><br/>And that's what Boyle seems to understand so well. Its more than just being capable cinematically. He seems to find cinematic means in the overlap of these genre inspired strokes. In this case, its literally three genre-strokes in three acts. It isn't life-changing, but it is a bit exciting seeing how he can shift us from thrill to adventure to revenge to romance without too many bumps. Well, maybe that last one was a bit rough.<br/><br/>But he takes chances. And he enlists his actors in them, so there is an overlap as well among himself, his actors and their characters.<br/><br/>There was only one annoying thing here. When a character knows he is being stalked, and the stalker passes quickly in front of the camera so we know he is there but the character does not, there's this swoosh that first appeared in slasher films and is just lazy.<br/><br/>(The shopping scene references ""They Might Be Giants."")<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Don't do it again, Christopher.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this film is some the aesthetics of the camera work which uses a similar technique to battle scenes in Gladiator. Frames are removed in the filming process leading to a slightly jerky playback which offsets nicely against the rain falling.<br/><br/>However, I also believe this is one of those films like Blair Which Project. It will either be loved or hated. In this case, I hated it. But you must watch it make your own decision. Just try and get someone else to pay for you so you don't waste your hard earned money!"

","I'm surprised this movie has such a respectable IMDB score (7 or something like that), because it is actually A_VERY_BAD_MOVIE(TM).<br/><br/>I kinda had some good time watching it, but for the wrong reasons: me and my friend could not stop laughing :'-D<br/><br/>There's no way to spoil the movie any more, but *SPOILERS AHEAD*!<br/><br/>I mean, even from the start the whole thing goes downward. It opens with a chimp who is been ""tortured"" by watching like 8 television sets portraying human crowds on strike. As if the thing was scary or something (?). Think cheap ""Clockwork Orange for Monkeys"" and you are there.<br/><br/>Then some ecologist jerks go and free the monkeys-- to end their endless TV suffering I presume. But, regrettably, one of them (of the monkeys) seems to be infected with a virus or something and transmits it to the jerks. The virus makes you go nuts and byte everyone around, be they people, monkeys or whatever.<br/><br/>The infection process takes like 1 second (?) and when you get it you are displayed on screen as if you were being recorded with a fast-shutter camera (like in ""Saving Private Ryan""). I keep wondering if that is supposed to be scary or is it just that they bought the camera and had to use it to justify the purchase :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, if you don't find that stupid opening scene funny enough, wait until the main character opens his mouth. He is such a lame actor you won't believe he got to play the main part. Its performance is even more ridiculous if you happen to see the dubbed Spanish version of the movie, in which the voice of this guy sounds as if he is retarded. I can't believe this wasn't done on purpose =:'-D<br/><br/>Well, then there are lots of stupid situations, but I won't bother commenting on them. Just your average standard-substandard ""scary"" moments and those oh-no-don't-do-that ""thrilling"" set-ups.<br/><br/>So, in summary, if you enjoy cheap b-movies and have nothing better to do, you can give it a try and have some bored laughs."

","28 Days Later is a brilliant genre-defying film wrapped in a shoebox budget. The world is in ruins, and humanity's days are almost over. The story follows a group of survivors trying to outlast the aftermath of a rage epidemic. The film really gives a new definition to the term 'zombie' because they are not portrayed as slow and undead. These zombies are super fast and very much alive, which increases fear factor. Unlike regular superhero movies, the characters had more believable qualites that were well established, making the story more in touch with reality. The gripping events that build up to the climax were very effective as they are terrifying. Some of the chase scenes were short and under-developed, they weren't satisfying enough. Overall, I would still recommend 28 Days Later for a thrilling night in."
"michelleeb","1","30","61","13 April 2008"," So very very dull.
","Now, I love Zombie movies - Romero, Raimi, even Shaun of the Dead are classics. But this ... this is just boring. (And in response to a previous reviewer who implied that those who didn't like this are too thick for 2001 and Memento - I both loved and understood those movies). There is no sense of impending terror, apart from one all-too-brief sequence in a tunnel (although you have to wonder why they were stupid enough to go in there). The characters are very one-dimensional, and the female lead goes from being a machete-wielding tough girl to a screaming, cringing little girl waiting for the big brave man to rescue her (Apparently falling in love makes men murderous and women weak). The much vaunted opening sequence of an empty London has been done before, and better, in Day of the Triffids. There were a couple of 'make-you-jump' moments - but not many. The final battle sequence is so disjointed and awkward it's difficult to know what's going on.<br/><br/>I understand this meant to be a zombie movie for the intelligentsia, as Cloverfield is a monster movie for the intelligentsia, but it lacks the latter's sense of danger, sense of devastation, and real, in depth characters. In fact, I hated these characters so much, that by the end, I was hoping the zombies would get them.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead has horror, death, gore and is actually scary enough to keep me glued to the screen - and that's a parody. This is supposed to be a proper, intelligent zombie movie - and it was so very very dull."

","A man named Mark wakes up in a deserted hospital in London. He wanders outside finding no sign of people at all. It seems a plague (transmitted by blood) has turned most of the population into flesh-eating, fast moving zombies. Mark finds a few more uninfected people and they struggle to survive.<br/><br/>I expected a gore fest on the order of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"". That's not what I got. There is some extreme violence (including a little bit at the end that I'm surprised got by with an R rating) but not a lot and it comes in short bursts. This story concentrates on the characters and their moods and actions. And, for once, they act just like you would expect people to act in such a situation. Also attention is paid to such things as electricity, water supply, food etc etc which other movies like this totally ignore. But it is depressing and, at the end, extremely disturbing. This isn't a movie you really enjoy...you just appreciate it for how well it's done. Also it was shot in muted color on video which just adds to the feeling of helplessness. It does have some very scary scenes...these zombies move VERY quickly (they're shot in fast motion), the attack scenes have blood gushing out and there's an extremely eerie sequence inside a tunnel. <br/><br/>Also the acting is uniformly good especially by Cillian Murphy (who also has a very lengthy nude scene at the beginning) and Naomie Harris as strong, tough Selena. <br/><br/>Like director Danny Boyle's other films (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary) I like this with reservations. I'm recommending it but only for those with strong stomaches."
"Stevieheuge","7","11","19","6 October 2004"," Makes the very best of a small budget.
","*review contains spoilers*<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later it without a doubt the best British horror film of recent times. It has some genuinely chilling moments, some great subtle humour, and best (and most importantly) of all, its a pretty original piece of work.<br/><br/>'Jim', played by up and coming Irish actor Cillian Murphy emerges from a coma in a London hospital. he is alone. He goes out into the corridor - he is still alone, and the place is trashed. He goes out into the street, and by jove, the whole of London is completely deserted... And its great! Immediately the audience is asking ""what the hell is going on here?"" Its something we're just not used to - never before have we been struck with such scenes in a British setting, and it is truly startling.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Jim, the answer to the current state of his country, is that it has been obliterated by a virus that infects and overcomes its victims in seconds with 'rage', turning them into almost unstoppable violent monsters...<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is great, and Boyle uses every second of his deserted London footage perfectly, building an incredibly creepy atmosphere, but its even in these early scenes that we see that the lack of budget is apparent - there are no bodies in the streets, it all seems just a little too TOO empty. However, this does add to the isolated theme even more.<br/><br/>The film slows a little as it makes its way through the second act. The whole movie was shot on digital film, which has been tweaked to give the film a grainy, moody look, and as much as this works, it does not disguise the fact that the film begins to lose its way a bit. As the characters trudge on in search of hope, the continued isolation of the two main characters becomes steadily more uneventful, rather than unnervingly lonesome. Although thats not to say it doesn't have its moments - Boyle gives us a few little set pieces in the moments to follow, but they just don't seem to do the premise justice - if all of Great Britain has been decimated by this virus, there should be rampaging hoards of infected crashing at them at every turn - but no-one, NO-ONE is around!<br/><br/>Its a shame though, because everything that could have made the last half of this film great, would cost lots of money. If you don't have it, you cant make it. Due to this, and a bad turn in story, the last third of the film descends into the unwanted, the unbelievable, and it just seems like such a waste. <br/><br/>Let me explain:<br/><br/>The infected humans in this film are just that - people who are overcome with a virus. They are not undead, thay are not zombies, as the director has stressed on many occasions. This means they sprint after you, not hobble like a pensioner with typhoid. One adversary is as dangerous as many. Most of the chills come from this fact, because as isolated as the survivors seem, what may be around the next corner could devastate everything. Whenever a few of the infected are on the screen, the tension is cranked up to breaking point - its edge of the seat stuff.<br/><br/>So why, why, WHY in the last third of the film are these brutal, scary enemies replaced by a much more idle threat? A few cockney soldiers! NOOOO! We almost completely forget about the infected masses, and are tossed into a completely new world where the bad guys are soldiers who all seem to have lost their minds, and have decided the only useful thing left to do is to rape a woman and a 13 year old girl. Useless. But wait, this shows us people we don't like! Baddies! I wonder what will happen to those guys...<br/><br/>Thankfully however, the final segment of the film makes up for it, all hell breaks loose before your eyes, people get mauled, blood is spilled, and it seems like a fitting payoff that leaves you satisfied with what has gone before.<br/><br/>One more gripe however. The acting throughout is very solid. From everyone. Except Megan Burns, who plays Hannah. She is young, fair enough, but her performance is so incredibly bad, she almost wrecks every single scene she is in, its ridiculous. There is no way Danny Boyle could have been satisfied with her acting, and there simply MUST have been something preventing him from replacing her.<br/><br/>Still though, all in all, the film works. Its unique, its scary, and it raises the bar significantly for bigger budget British films. Lets hope we get more of the same in the future, only without Megan Burns.<br/><br/>7/10. SP"

","This terrific film has turned out to be the most misunderstood film of the decade. Referring to it as a ""zombie horror"" is incorrect in its entirety: the creatures in the film are NOT the undead, but are in fact humans that are infected with a devastating virus that locks them into a permanent state of murderous rage; and while one could be forgiven for calling the film a horror, it is in fact a focus on human drama, as the protagonists struggle to understand and deal with their predicament.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film does deliver a few genuinely terrifying moments, and the geysers of gore are frequent enough to keep the horror fans happy. The early scenes are the most memorable, as we see the deserted city of London explored by a formerly comatose Cillian Murphy, ignorant to the devastation that the virus has caused.<br/><br/>Stealing the show is actor Naomi Harris, with her brilliant portrayal of Selena, while Danny Boyle's direction and John Murphy's music are close seconds."

I wasted one hour and 48 minutes of my life watching this garbage. The first 15 mins were OK, but from the minute Jim wakes up it was a disaster. As he walks on the dead London streets there's some nice music, which could as well been ""hop goes the weasel"". The minute Selena and Mark appear, it becomes obvious that Mark will die and Jim and Selena will get together. Then, as they meet Frank and Anna, it is immediately obvious that Frank will die. They could have made it much more morbid and gut-wrenching, for example if Hanna would have become infected and Frank had to kill her. The soldier's mansion was plain pathetic. The soldiers turned out to be evil monsters only interested in sex in such dire times. The colonel was plain evil, and they were so single dimensioned personalities you wouldn't even find in the White House. The ending was so horrendous that is not even worth being mentioned.

Instead of waiting 1 minute he kicks a wall and get's blood in his eye...why?

Well how about the ""Kill the boy-scene""? He walks into a burger store AFTER they looted the shop aforementioned because he want's a cheeseburger? Does he really think, that these things just lay around for him? It looked to me, like that he really wanted to see dead bodies. Or kill himself, because he literally shouted ""hello"" in there.

","""28 Days Later"" does deviate somewhat from the stereotypical zombie movie genre. And whether or not that is a good thing or a bad thing is, of course, a matter of personal preference. I did, however, find it to be a refreshing approach to the genre. I liked some parts of the movie, and I disliked others.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle took a bold approach to the genre when he came up with this zombie movie or viral infection movie, call it what you will. And it was an approach that resulted in a fairly entertaining movie, which did bring some new and interesting things to the genre.<br/><br/>What works in favor of ""28 Days Later"" is the storyline and the way that director Danny Boyle told the story. It is a fast paced story that is driven by a solid story, good characters and equally good acting performances.<br/><br/>However, I am not personally a big fan of having fast, agile and running zombies. But since these aren't zombies as such, then I guess as an infected person it is alright. But for the genre, then I would classify them as zombies, and as such running is a no go.<br/><br/>I mentioned that the storyline is good, and it is the heart of the story, and the writers did put together a good story which is thrilling and entertaining. It was a thrill ride to follow Jim (played by Cillian Murphy) from waking up in the hospital and throughout the movie right up to the end.<br/><br/>The effects in ""28 Days Later"" are quite good, and that is something which also helps the movie quite a lot. You can't really have a zombie movie, infected people movie, or whatever this was, and not have proper effects. So thumbs up to the special effects team for their work on ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>Usually I am not one who pays much attention to music in a movie, unless it is awfully bad and overshadows everything else. But the music they opted for in this movie was actually good and did help to supplement the movie quite well.<br/><br/>If you enjoy zombie movies and want something fast paced that deviates from the stereotypical how-to-make-a-zombie-movie recipe, then give ""28 Days"" a chance."
"skybrick736","10","2","2","7 June 2015"," 28 Days Later
","Even though it's technically a virus, I think grouping 28 Days Later into the zombie category is still acceptable since it's the majority of people in an apocalyptic world turn into unconscious deadly beings. I'd rate 28 Days Later in my top five favorite horror flicks, close to #1, just because the atmosphere feels like reality and a dreadful mood sets in every time I sit down and watch it. The movie has fantastic camera work, characters/acting, plot, effects, theme song, cinematography and just about all aspects of film-making I can think of. Everybody I've watched it with has loved it and 28 Days Later can be watched multiple times, definitely can deserve a 10/10 rating."
"ThomasDrufke","7","2","2","18 May 2015"," Beautiful Wasteland
","Never being a horror fan, I'm always hesitant on watching that genre of filmmaking. It's not because I don't think they make for good cinema, they certainly do. But in most horror films that I have seen, they don't give me much more than a few scares and jumps. But 28 Days Later is a much different story. It's ability to balance the frightening movements of zombies with the beautiful imagery of a world without people. It's the scenes with simple and quiet shots of wastelands that haunt me more than the zombies themselves.<br/><br/>We begin with seeing experiments on apes, because of course humans cant be at fault for the virus. But in reality they are. It was an accidental spread from humans. As creepy as the opening scene was, I didn't find it to be paid off in any way throughout the film. I just felt like that could have been explained in a voice-over or monologue. No matter, we then find our lead character, Jim, played by the brilliant Cillian Murphy. He of course is clueless about the outbreak as he has been in a coma for 28 days. The initial shots of him walking through Cambridge with no one to be seen were both gorgeous and haunting. Much like in I Am Legend, we all wonder, what the hell would we do if we had the whole city to ourselves? Jim comes across Serena and another man who end up saving his life. But we soon learn the details of the virus and how quickly it infects people. After the other guy dies, Jim and Serena are forced to keep moving. The two initially despise one another and don't want anything to do with each other, but as they meet Frank and Hannah, their minds change. In situations like this, it seems as though everyone has a breaking point. As strong as you think you are by yourself, you always need help, and the 4 of them learned that along the way.<br/><br/>The joy of the shopping scene was one of the highlights of the movie for me, as it was the only scene where all of our leads were genuinely happy. It's a simple smile that you remember from scenes like this. As chaos unfolds and each character comes into their own, choices had to be made. I think Jim's character arc was great as the more he grew adapt to the situation, the more he acted like the infected. Which by the way, Danny Boyle did a great job at imagining new types of zombies. They move fast and frantically instead of the stupidity of slowly walking. His filming of them was also fascinating. There weren't many moments if at all that he surprised us with their appearance. Often, he would show them first to us, before the characters would see them. In terms of the ending, well I could tell that the directors had different intentions, and hearing about the alternate endings, I think I would have preferred one of those to the one we got. It's a different approach to the horror and jump scare moments. So in all, 28 Days Later is a refreshing take on the horror and zombie genre.

","When animal activists in London set free a laboratory chimp infected with a deadly virus, they unwittingly unleash a plague that consumes the entire planet. A small group of Britishers who have survived the apocalypse hear a radio transmission from the military and decide to risk the three-day drive to an Army outpost in Manchester, though not without consequence: marauding zombies who feast on the living are socked away everywhere, ready to attack. Suspenseful horror film with an astounding artistic eye, courtesy director Danny Boyle, though with a frenetic, action-packed finale which releases much of the suspense and tension built up in the first two-thirds of the picture. Still quite an extraordinary achievement, particularly for the over-crowded and overly-familiar end-of-the-world movie genre.

","First of all, I want to say I did like this movie. The photography was excellent, the acting was pretty good and the atmosphere of the movie well developed. I was scared, too! However, the moment the movie finished I immediately thought ""this is a Nightfall rip-off!"". Of course, the setting of the movie is way different than the setting of the book: alien world vs our civilization in the present, Nightfall vs a virus, and the characters don't match, of course. But the overall plot is similar:<br/><br/>-It all starts by a massive tragedy that causes people to go mad<br/><br/>-After the thing started, a group of survivors tries to find others<br/><br/>-In both the movie and the book, the initial goal of this group is to reach a place where supposedly those who survived are all going<br/><br/>-The militaries in the movie think they are a bastion of order in the chaos and that it is up to them to get civilization going again, in<br/><br/>time. In the book, recall the Fire Patrol episode?<br/><br/>-The scene where they are on a highway and in the distance a city is burning is very very similar to a scene described in the book<br/><br/>Don't you think it's too many coincidences?

"userofthewheel","6","2","2","23 November 2003"," Great potential - not developed
","I've always been a fan of this genre of movie so was really looking forward to this.  My review may contain SPOILERS.<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed however for a number of reasons.  The film had great potential and a good story line but became unbelievable as soon as the characters reached Manchester.  Upon reaching Manchester they met a bunch of ""soldiers"" who represented a modern day English version of the Dirty Dozen with a typically eccentric CO.  Very stereotypical.  From here the film descended into farce.  The CO, played by Eccleston, had apparently lured our intrepid survivors to Manchester as he had promised his men ""some women"". We are now supposed to believe that British soldiers become sex crazed maniacs after about a month apparently.<br/><br/>To add insult to this, the central characters had spent the first half of the film being extremely careful regarding catching the infection as a single drop of any bodily fluid can apparently infect.  In the finale however they are all running through a complete (infected) bloodbath of a house, in the dark, and yet none of them become infected. Incredible.<br/><br/>Plot aside, other complaints I have are regarding the lack of music in the film. The film had the set pieces and the plot premise for great atmosphere yet they didn't capitalise on it with any music (think opening credits of Omega Man or Soylent Green for instance)  One of the characters who gets bumped off early on talks about the chaos at the rail station as people are trying to escape London yet we see no reconstruction or flashback of this or any of the other chaos associated with the virus.  A 5 minute montage of what actually happened after the lab break in would have been good.<br/><br/>Also whenever there was an action scene involving the infected you couldn't actually see what was going on as it was all shot in a fast, flashy sort of camerawork which was really irritating - presume this is the digital some other reviewers have commented on."

","<ul><li>28 Days Later: 8/10</li></ul><br/><br/>This was one innovative movie. Made in England, this documents a sort of post-apocolypse nation after a virus that turns people into virtual savage animals or zombies breaks out. The country is largely evacuated, but one man wakes up in hospital. We then get one of the most ""WOW"" scenes in cinema history, when he walks around an EMPTY London. DEAD silence, the sort you can never really hear. He basically tours the city and it's sights... and then runs into the first zombie. And boy, does the movie get creepy after that. He hooks up with some fellow survivors, and the attempt to not eradicate the virus, but to not catch it, begins. Surreal moment of the movie for me was, from a distance (as they didn't go there), seeing my city of birth and upbringing, Manchester, in flames. The acting isn't really great, but the concept and whole intrigue of the plot really compensates for any shortcomings in that department. Not as much fighting as I expected, but never boring. This is definitely the first true ""zombie"" classic of the 21st century, and worth seeing AT LEAST once."

Now we've got the Diamond Dead to look forward to, and a host of other zombie fare in the near future. Now, I know this isn't your typical zombie flick, it's more about a virus.<br/><br/>Same thing though, really. This movie was a gritty, in your face kind of movie and the first half hour is about as tense as anything I've seen.

I immediately question this because when you get infected you turn almost directly. So how are then the infection accidently taken to other partsof the world. The characters later in the movie also question this and it turns out that its only England that is affected.<br/><br/>When the Black Girl kills her companion when she suspects he is affected by the look in his eyes, I think that is kind of stupid. She could have just waited a few seconds and she would have known.<br/><br/>But the thing that made me dislike the movie was when they meet the military men. All that happens when they are there is boring and stupid. Firstly the men dont act like military men. They dont seem to have any training when they shoot at the zombies and dont act any professional at all. Then they seem to have lost all hope and are whiling to kill each other because of a girl. It has gone like a month since the outbreak. I have a hard time even when it seems to them that society had collapsed that they would act this desperate and strange. One last thing I remembered. When they escape from the city through the tunnel, the zombies follow them. Then they just stop when they are abit far away from them, like they are thinking ""we cannot run to them and catch them, they are driving to fast, lets stop runing"". Smart zombies. :)"
"hjpog","10","7","12","17 June 2017"," One of the best of infected movies..
","Firstly when you try to watch with a constantly controversial community with the film, if you evaluate this 28-day adventure with blank glances like the British excavation that has eaten the virus since the minute of the end, you will see that the movie is directly virus-infected. In other words, the movie is infected, it's processed from beginning to end. It is a film that can be described as a classic among the infected movies. The fact that it is not possible to leave the island in the film, what is attributed to the fictional, may be considered a reference to both empty London streets and perhaps Hollywood cinema, the UK is the center of the world. It is possible to search for mistakes in the film, to sort out the parties who are not suitable for the real life. However, in my opinion, a film that features more fictional items alongside these real icons, should not be considered too much. All kinds of material used as classical zombie movie stereotypes virus, red eyes, rapid change, aggression and protection, this is a metaphor. If Boyle is trying to get the viewer into the film, he has done it a lot, I do not think that Boyle try to overlap and confront the reality in a movie with such fantastic content. The film begins with a classical zombie movie and then shows the war that people turn into psychological tension and what they can do to survive and what they can do. The soundtracks in the movie are tremendous. Nowadays these soundtracks are still available in many places. The film has great views because it is captured with a digital camera. This visuality is even better, especially since the shoots are usually in the morning. Through Danny Boyle, this film has been interpreted differently by many people. Because you can get many questions in the movie. These questions are almost always an answer, but audience comments can be joined very clearly. Because there is not always a definite answer in the film. So it makes a good movie to think about the events to the audience. In the film you feel the difference of using a basic camera very clearly. Even though it is fantastic in terms of content, this basic camera makes the film very realistic. In summary, despite the fact that the film is fantasy-based, the basic camera shots can give you a fear. Only in the last scene was a movie camera. It allows you to feel as though you were in that adventure, as if you had taken an event that you experienced."
"paddy-2","Null","7","12","4 May 2007"," great.. annoying... great
","So many reasons to love this movie, and so many reason to hate it...<br/><br/>First of all - the concept is great. Full-on apocalypse, decent attempt to provide some topical justification for the infection, reasonable cause and effect in the main story. But only up to a point. Because, try as I might to run with this film, I just keep tripping over puzzling directorial and script decisions. Over and over again - about every five minutes - there's something in this movie that just makes you go - ""Hold on, that doesn't make sense?!""<br/><br/>Just a few examples (so many to choose from!): <br/><br/><ul><li>Why does Cillian Murphy run through the house shouting ""WE HAVE TO LEAVE!!!"" at the top of his voice? Er - dude, whispering would make more sense! But no, someone has deemed that it would be more exciting and cinematic to have them running around shouting at the top of their voices. Makes no sense. I'm starting to lose interest.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why park the taxi so far from the petrol tanker? Why not drive up close, keep everyone together, and FILL UP THE TANK OF THE TAXI ITSELF!!??? Rather than just a can? Oh yeah - so we could get a pointless couple of shots of the girl doing a handbrake turn. Right.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does Cillian Murphy (in ridiculous ""terminator"" mode) set free the infected guy in the yard (cutting the chain with totally implausible blast of machine gun fire) when he's just as likely to attack the girls as he is to get the soldiers? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Is it really feasible that the young girl driving the taxi MEANT to reverse the cab up to the infected guy so he would then smash through the rear window, grab the bad major and kill him? JUMP THE SHARK, JUMP THE SHARK, JUMP THE SHARK!!!! Insulting to the audience. A Jackie Chan/Sammo Hung fight sequence has more credibility.</li></ul><br/><br/>You see - it's just a slow decline from a great premise and a dynamite first 20 minutes to an ending that can't come too soon. There's so much to love - the DV camera work, the stark lighting, the great angles, the nutty details like the girls in ball dresses in a rain drenched manor house while mayhem erupts around them, a main character who is spaced out on Valium during said mayhem, the sequences in silent, dead London, the blood puking, the basic attempt to make a gritty original SF horror action movie that pulls no punches etc etc.<br/><br/>Like I said, there are so many reasons to love this movie. But I can't - it annoys me, there's always the feeling that the makers are saying - ""Yeah, OK, this bit doesn't make sense but no one will notice because it looks cool!"" Nah - it doesn't make sense, and it's annoying.<br/><br/>Having said all that, to be honest, I'd recommend that anyone interested in the genre would see 28 Days Later. Just prepare to be irritated.<br/><br/>But... as it happens I have seen 28 Weeks Later, and it's a much better movie. It rocks! AND, it more or less makes sense! You see? You CAN have your cake and eat it."

Danny Boyle has created a wonderful horror classic that takes you into new territory just when you've begun to think you've seen it all before.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is some of the best horror film making of the last twenty years or so. Simply put a man wakes up from a coma to find the world in ruins and most of the world now blood thirsty monsters. Staggering around England he ends up with a group of people who try to get out of the city to a safe place in the country. Filled with great set pieces this part of the film raises your expectations for a bang up second half and the genre itself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the military arrive and things shift gears as the movie becomes something else. Its not a totally bad change, what happens is quite good, but after a first half t which effectively rewrites the rules of the genre we get a tale that seems like we've been there and done that. The flight to the countryside becomes literally housebound and it stagnates in ideas that are good but which we've already seen.<br/><br/>That said, see this movie.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","4","10","19","15 May 2004"," Failed Potential
","With the exception of the opening 10 minutes, 28 Days Later fails completely. The scenes of the Jim (Cillian Murphy) walking around an abandoned, completely deserted London are creepy and un-nerving. The scenes that hint at mystery and unknown danger are far more intriguing than the rest of the movie. As soon as Jim hooks up with other survivors the scares are lost. Danny Boyle stupidly telegraphs every jump to the point of disqualification. When the survivors leave London and are 'rescued' by a bunch of thuggish army louts it degenerates into extremely cruddy sub-straight-to-video nonsense. I've never seen a film lose its way so badly as this. What could have been really exciting and scary ends up being too cheap and confused.<br/><br/>There are hardly any 'zombies' in this movie. Any action or thrills are over within seconds and the complete lack of logical thinking (even within the morally bankrupt army) becomes annoying. <br/><br/>It did appreciate the raw-looking photography, it gave the movie a realistic edge but it's soon ruined as the plot meanders and doesn't know what to do. Cillian Murphy was quite good as the hero but the woman playing Selena was too brutish and hostile to be sympathetic. I did like Brendan Gleeson's character but he wasn't in it long enough.<br/><br/>Mainly, 28 Days Later suffers badly from minimal plotting, awkward characters, a distinct lack of scares and a corny ending that's out of sync with everything that preceded it. Danny Boyle should NOT attempt horror again.<br/><br/>The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras include a commentary, documentary and deleted scenes. The cut scenes (and alternate ending) are worthless and not interesting. <br/><br/>For a superior and more exciting zombie movie wait for the new Dawn of the Dead to hit DVD. In the meantime, rent this one."
"dalbuc","1","10","19","28 June 2003"," God awful and dull
","I'm a sucker for a good zombie-type film but I was cheated on this flick. Minor spoilers.<br/><br/>First off, this is not a zombie flick anymore than the Blair Witch Project was about the witch or Signs was about aliens. In all three cases the ""monster"" is used as a device to explore human problems (and in fairness Night of the Living Dead does the same thing). I like the latter three films becuase while they aren't just monster movies the monsters are sort of omnipiresent and you feel their influence constantly in the film. 28 Days Later doesn't do that. The ""rage"" infected (the zombies are vicitms of, shocker, a bioexperiment gone wrong and unleashed) are intermittently in the film and there are times you totally forget about them.<br/><br/>Second, the main conflict in the film arises sort of out of nowhere- I won't divulge what it is. It makes no sense what so ever and the ""good"" guy's solution to it is to kill all sorts of non-zombies by working with the ""zombies"". You might be able to rationalize some of the actions of the real bad guys but when you realize that society has been gone for all of 28 days at most it gets hard to accept that all societal norms could vanish so quickly- escpeially among folks not in the heat of the moment, spare me about riots and such things.<br/><br/>Third, Danny Boyle has the camera sense of the guy who filmed Battlefield Earth. Too many shots on tilts. His handling of action is outright abominable. He's not good with action so he resorts to the classic close shots, bad lighting and frequent cuts to obscure his failures. I don't know why folks still do this since the end result is that you can't see anything happening in the climax. That would assume you care since the zombies are killing bad guys anyway. In BWP, Signs and NotLD you are emotionally invested in the trapped would-be victims but in this flick you don't care a lick about the zombie show and might even be rooting for thier demise. Scarey it ain't.<br/><br/>Oh, BTW, one last little gripe at a key moment a British solider has his gun jam- and of course can not clear the jam. This is a really tired movie cliche and deux et machina effect but worse is that all soliders act like they've never been trained to clear a jam."

","British attempt at a 'scientific' zombie flick. A virus takes '10-15 seconds' to transform victims into raging biting speeded-up zombies. There's nothing original here, the plot never quite makes sense, and the actions of the standard group of survivors never come close: at one point they destroy the zombies with Molotov cocktails and a triggered explosion which takes out a city block, a bit later they have only a machete and a baseball bat and they never bother to even look for more effective weapons. But the whole thing is reasonably staged and reasonably acted. Minor spoilers follow.<br/><br/>This is an OK piece of mindless entertainment  apart from the treatment of the female lead, who starts the movie as a tough, resourceful survivor, efficiently killing an infected companion before he can become a threat. By the end she has unaccountably become a frightened girlie, making no resistance as she's dragged around by a nasty man, just waiting for a (previously feeble) nicer one to rescue her. There's nothing new in reducing strong female characters to props for some hero-type's emerging macho-linity, but the message here is: when society breaks down (as it so often does in so many parts of the world) forget being tough and resourceful, girls, go find a man to protect you.

","I remember when ""28 Days Later"" was in theaters. After about a month or so, the television ads were up to a full minute to a minute and a half long. They were packed with sterling reviews, thrilling speedy zombie cut scenes, and the promise of three possible endings! A few friends of mine went to see the movie five times so that they could see all three. They weren't the only ones. A ton of my friends were quick to say things like, ""You, of all people, will love this movie!"" Hype hype hype. If there is one thing I can't friggin' stand is every one and their grandmother telling me I have to see one particular movie. Given, hyped movies are either good or are ruined by the hype and that ratio is hovering around 50%. However, this movie falls into the latter. It wasn't the worst movie ever (close, but at least it had a budget), though right from the start I had issues. Now, I'm down with the idea that some hippie, animal liberation bozos would end up destroying society, but the whole first scene was weak. The movie started becoming promising only to rot away and FAST! I don't know, I personally don't see how this movie is any different than ""Dawn of the Dead"" other than the fact that ""DotD"" was a criticism on consumerism and ""28 Days"" was a commentary on...sex? ""Soldiers are horny"" seems to be this movie's overall message. Was the ending supposed to reflect something else, because any and all attempts to convince me otherwise have Stretch Armstrong shaking his head. I've been reading the glowing comments of this movie, and also shaking mine. I've read that it plainly deals with the hopelessness of the situation...as if ""DotD"" or even ""Return of the Living Dead"" didn't. There's nothing particularly special about this movie. And talking about ""Return,"" I think it's bull to declae ""28 Days"" as the introduction of the ""Fast Zombie."" There were plenty of zombies running around in ""Return of the Living Dead"" and ""RotLD Part 2."" How about the scene when all the zombies bum rush the cops? There are two separate scenes of zombies bum rushing the cops in ""RotLD,"" and another one when they take out the paramedics! So what, we should give credit to ""28 Days"" because some of the zombies were superhumanly fast? We should give it full marks for making them faster? Please. Also, I've read that the movie's landmark because it doesn't rely on violence. Instead it relies on changing a tire really really quickly so the stampeding herd of zombies don't infect you. Come on! This is supposed to be tension? It was like watching NASCAR! Oh, and how about calling the disease ""rage?"" How friggin' hokey can you get? Oh, and only one of the possible three endings was decent. There was certainly a reason why the other two weren't in the original final cut. <br/><br/>I will say that the sequel looks interesting, not that I'm going to pay theater prices to see it, but I will definitely give it a try on DVD. As for the predecessor, I'll just leave it for the monkeys."
"Infofreak","Null","9","17","5 April 2004"," 'The Crazies' meets 'The Omega Man'. Long term horror buffs have seen it all before - and better.
","Let me get one thing off my chest - this is NOT a zombie movie! A zombie is a reanimated corpse. There are no zombies in '28 Days Later...' Much has been made about this movie being a George Romero tribute, and in some ways it is. While there are some parallels with Romero's underrated 'Day Of The Dead' in the latter half of the movie when Christopher Eccleston and co. turn up, it's actually closer to being a remake of 'The Crazies' than his Dead movies. I suppose that more people have seen 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' than 'The Crazies', so that's their main reference point, but believe me, 'The Crazies' is much more accurate. 'The Crazies' with a bit of 'The Omega Man' thrown in. And that to me is the major problem with Danny Boyle's uneven movie - it's just all too familiar. Long term horror buffs have seen it all before - and better. The movie starts off well with a dazed Jim (Cillian Murphy) wandering the streets of an apparently deserted London. These opening sequences are some of the best in the movie and conjure up memories of Vincent Price in 'The Last Man On Earth' and Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' (both movies were inspired by Richard Matheson's novel 'I Am Legend'). Soon other characters are introduced and the movie is reasonable enjoyable, albeit a bit predictable and lacking any real depth. Around the half way point I was expecting some new spin, something fresh and original... and it never comes. It's funny but I really expected a lot more from this movie and it failed to deliver, but 'Dog Soldiers', which I expected next to nothing from was much more entertaining in my opinion. So if you're looking for a horror/action movie with fun and thrills check out 'Dog Soldiers', it really delivers.  And if you want to see the ""inspirations"" for '28 Days Later...' rent some Romero, specifically 'The Crazies', or how about Cronenberg's 'Shivers'? Both of those movies are ten times more original and disturbing than this, and probably made on a tenth of the budget."
"Buddy-51","Null","9","17","21 December 2003"," effective atmosphere, derivative story
","`28 Days Later' could easily be the fourth installment in George Romero's `Living Dead' trilogy  only this time the zombies have a bit more get up and go to them.<br/><br/>When Jim wakes up out of a coma one day, he discovers that not only is he the only person in the hospital but virtually the only person left in the entire city of London.  After wandering through the deserted city streets for awhile, he eventually runs into a couple of stalwart survivors who inform him that 28 days earlier a plague began sweeping across the planet  catalyzed by the release of some infected test monkeys  causing people to turn into mindless killing machines and passing on the virus to their victims through their blood.  <br/><br/>Although `28 Days Later' is little more than a rip-off of those earlier zombie classics, director Danny Boyle does bring a certain level of artistry to his handling of the material, particularly with his apocalyptic visions of a London and an English countryside utterly bereft of human beings. There's a real end-of-the-world eeriness to much of what we see on the screen, a product more of suggestiveness than of blatant visualization. Indeed, Boyle shows the zombies as little as possible, a wise move for a couple of reasons: first, because leaving a threat unspecified allows the audience to use its imagination, thereby heightening the suspense and tension, and, second, because, quite frankly, these fleet-footed zombies simply aren't all that terrifying when we get a close-up view of them (certainly not on a level with Romero's lumbering  and truly horrifying - originals).  And that, perhaps, is the biggest complaint I have against the film.  For all the impressiveness of the visuals and the tone, `28 Days Later' just isn't a very scary film in the long run.  The plotting is derivative, the characters not very well developed, and the poorly staged final showdown more laughable than frightening.  Like two many horror films, this one suffers from a weak third act, with the anticipatory windup more impressive than the delivery.<br/><br/>There's a lot to admire and recommend in `28 Days later.'  But it just doesn't get under the skin the way the best horror films do  and the nightmares just don't come."

","Right, to begin with I had no preconceptions when entering this movie.  I heard the words, it's a zombie film that isn't.  Damn right there.<br/><br/>
Point 1: Original, no it is tripe it has ripped off lots of bad plots from other bad apolocalypse films (B-Movie style movies).<br/><br/>Point 2: Some of the camera work is incredible.  A bonus point for the film.<br/><br/>Point 3: Enjoyable, well no, and there are so many plot holes it is difficult to know where to begin, and I have neither the space nor time to detail them all.<br/><br/>Point 4: This film mentions it's two great cliches, the Woman surviors says at one point something to the effect of ""Do you want to Fall in love and screw or start rebuilding the human race"" unfortuantely these are the two things that kind of happen (although the squaddies bit is all the immature Rape fantasy of the writer rather than a madman planning to rebuild the human race)<br/><br/>Point 5: Unnessecary Gore.  Pushing your thumbs into someones eyes is not the fastest way of killing someone (after all speed is of the essence here) strangulation is faster.<br/><br/>Point 6: Desperation.  Actually it is funny when they are in the supermarket as I thought they sould be attacked there, they spend lots of time being uncaring and messing about.  However when in a relatively open area (i.e. refuelling the taxi) they are really cautious.<br/><br/>All in all I advise no one to see this film, watch day of the dead or even Resident Evil (which is similar and has no plot, poor acting and more plot inconsistancies than 28 days later, but I enjoy a whole lot more).  Or even a really poor b-movie called Exterminatiors of the year 3000.<br/><br/>
Thats all I have to say on that."
"teddeman","1","11","22","1 July 2003"," 28 Days Later you will still be trying to forget you wasted $7.50
","What a let down.  I read the myriad of reviews already posted for this movie and was really looking forward to it.  Ugh!  I predict it will be gone from American theaters within 28 days of its release.  The concept is good but the forced themes and predictable plot structure hurt the film.<br/><br/>As a movie patron one is expected to suspend disbelief and allow them to be drawn into the world of the movie.  Unfortunately film writers often push suspension of disbelief so far that even a 5 year old would question what they were seeing.  Welcome to `28 Days Left'; a story that spans 60 days in a world where the mass evacuation of London leaves no abandoned cars anywhere (except in the tunnels), zombies that hide off camera until the film needs some shock value (to wake-up the bored audience) and the `Rage' virus will turn you into a stark raving lunatic within 30 seconds of exposure.<br/><br/>Where did everyone in London go?  Judging by the weekend grosses they were at the Cineplex watching `The Hulk'.  Why are there only dead people in church?  Why don't the zombies get food at all the abandoned grocery stores? Why was this movie ever made?<br/><br/>Some questions are best left unanswered.  The movie did have some good scares but they were merely cheap gags.  There was no tension building, no sense of impending doom, and no sense of fear for the characters wellbeing. There was no gore.  That is right, the `scariest zombie film yet' had less gore and violence than Friday the 13th, on broadcast TV shown in place of Saturday morning cartoons.  By the end of the film I wanted the main characters to be infected with the 'Rage' virus and start killing each other.  Sorry that was spoiler.  The main characters don't kill each other in the final scene.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the ending.  Not since the Keifer Sutherland version of `The Vanishing' has there been a more ridiculous example of a Hollywood happy ending.  The director would have better served the audience by leaving the last 3 minutes of the film on the cutting room floor.  He had an opportunity to give us a 'Jules et Jim' ending and salvage a shred of his integrity.  Instead the audience is force-fed a `Scorpion King' happy ending.<br/><br/>If this review is more incoherent and disjointed than my usual ones, consider it my homage to the film.  Consider it an echo of the plot.  My advice is rent `Night of the Living Dead' (either version) instead."

The acting by main characters was OK, the plot from around halfway through was not, afraid to say. Better the setting should have been kept in London for most of the film, more scope for greater scenes of suspense. Instead we saw the motley bunch of survivors legging it out of the capital ASAP.

Cillian Murphy is the hapless hero, compelled to join forces with a motley band of survivors (including Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Huntley) who run afoul of an Army encampment run by well-meaning - but deluded - military officer Christopher Eccleston, whose rash behavior unleashes a fresh wave of horror. Comparisons with the work of George A.

"david-meldrum","8","3","4","27 June 2019"," 17 Years Later ... Less Scary, But More Disturbing
","Sometimes an experience of watching a film outweighs the quality of the film itself. The first time I saw 28 Days Later ... might have been one of those. My wife and my friend Andy saw it at a late night showing in the wonderful Stratford Picture House in the East End of London on a summer's night in 2002, in the first week of its release. A packed cinema was scared to within an inch of itself; Andy cycled home alone through London's by then deserted streets, a journey he still talks about with the hushed tones of one who never quite felt safe the whole journey. The next morning, England played bitter rivals Argentina in the football World Cup in Japan/South Korea; London came to a standstill during the game, during which my wife drove through empty streets to a meeting; streets eerily reminiscent of the film's famous scenes. Since then the film has acquired near-mythic status for me; a film by my favourite director that was so good and so frightening I couldn't revisit it.<br/><br/>Until this day in 2019, a whole 17 years later. It's remarkable how much of the film I could remember clearly - it really had imprinted itself on me. The post-prologue scenes of Cillian Murphy's character wondering an empty central London remain astonishing and chilling; and as throughout the film, we are reminded here that Danny Boyle is a director who really knows how to use music. The atmosphere of dread is palpable, a sense that is more long-lasting and all-encompassing than the many effectively executed jump scares. Whilst the low budget is occasionally uncomfortably visible, the skewed camera angles and deliberately disordered shot compositions add to a sense of disorientation and surreality. The film is questioning: what's normal anyway? Who gets to say?<br/><br/>Harries and Murphy are both excellent in the central roles; Christopher Eccleston's accent is further disorienting to those familiar with him from other work, throwing us further off centre when the reveal of his group's real agenda finally comes. Whilst the script does creak and strain under expository weight on occasions, the most disturbing moment comes in Eccleston's ""Slow down"" aside to one of his men, the moment it starts to dawn on viewer and protagonist alike how far humanity has fallen in little more than a month, how completely the 'normal' order of things has broken down. These revelations, and the moment when Harries' character watches the wrath executed by Murphy's in the film's closing action sequences (a final act shot through with the tropes of slasher and haunted house movies) point to something else, something we might now term concern about toxic masculinity. In the film's coda, Murphy whispers to Harries, sewing the dress she'd been earlier forced to wear, 'You know, you looked alright in that'; he may not be Infected, but it's possible he carries a similar virus. There are strong suggestions throughout that the Infected look for revenge on the living, but there's enough suggested in sub-text throughout the film to leave us wondering who the really dangerous ones are.<br/><br/>The legacy of this film is significant. It consolidated Murphy and Harries as significant actors in their own right; it turned out to be at the forefront a rebooting of the zombie story to the forefront of popular culture, a wive we're still riding today; most importantly, it relaunched the stellar and varied career of Danny Boyle which was threatening to disappoint after the misfires of The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary. For that, I'm thankful - Danny Boyle's films have rarely failed to speak to me and change me. 17 years on from first viewing, this film did again; less scary, perhaps, but more disturbing and relevant to today's gender discourse than perhaps many of us realised."

","My biggest issue with this one, is that the camera action was too fast, flashing back and forth between the infected and the victims. What's the use of creating awesome FX, if you can't see it because of blinding speed camera action? Anyone wishing to make a successful horror movie, can learn much from classics like Night of the Living Dead, Carnival of Souls, Night of the Demons, to name a few. Slow down the camera action, do away with the shaky camera attempts to create a realistic feel (it's very annoying), and just concentrate on scaring the audience. It's as simple as that, and this one didn't do that for me."

","This is my first review, so bear with me. <br/><br/>I overall liked the movie, but I felt ultimately displeased by the end, especially after reading some of the other reviews. (I created an IMDb account just so I could write this review!) I don't think it's as genius as many think. Sure, fast-moving infected--a type of neo-zombie--is a cool idea, but I just didn't find it very scary. I keep thinking of Day of the Dead, because in it the soldiers all turn crazy, too. <br/><br/>It's like Selena and Jim swap characters in the end. At first, Jim's kinda wimpy but at the end he suddenly turns into a stealth ninja. And Selena is all tough at the beginning but then turns into a helpless damsel in distress for no reason. Seems like there's a lot of incontinuity in this film. I could keep nitpicking, but others already have, and besides, I liked the ""normality"" line a lot. That was thought-provoking (""humans killing humans is the normality"").<br/><br/>It's not about the infected so much as human nature in times of crisis. Instead of working together, they fight to the death. I like these ideas, I just didn't like how it was done. The whole premise of 28 days later is a plot hole, skipping 28 days. And then they do it again at the end! Seems like a very convenient and easy plot device to me. Jim is much more likely to die or get killed in that hospital then wake up and wander. I mean, if the infected have been out for 28 days, you'd think they'd be hungry and lookin' for some meat and find the skinny naked dude. Guess not.<br/><br/>A good movie, I give it an even split right-down-the-middle. Just not my ""cup of tea,"" I s'pose."

Among the better attacks is the opening in the lab where the infected chimps get loose and attack the freedom-fighters freeing them as the hysteria and chaos works nicely whilst the chimps go crazy in the middle of the room, while the other big scenes include the first encounter in the deserted city streets where his confusion after just waking up and seeing them comes off as a great chase scene before he gets saved and the brawling done in the different locations in their journey. Likewise, the scenes at the end in the compound is all sorts of fun where the infected soldiers are loosened on the others resulting in some utterly fun and exciting moments here with the ravenous beings running loose in the complex while the raging thunderstorm carries on outside leaving this with a strong, violent and action-packed series of scenes. Along with the fine gore and make-up effects, it's about all this one has as there's quite a bit of stuff featured here that's not all that enjoyable. One of the biggest issues here is that even though we get off to a rousing start, we don't get anything afterwards for quite a while which leaves a long gap between action. This cuts into the films pace, as we get a great last half with an okay beginning, but that middle part is what really drags. There is way too much exploration of the city and talking amongst the people to really get into the film. We don't need four discussions about the same event at different times, which gets rather boring at times to sit through some of that as there is way too much redundant talking in the movie that throws the pace off. Even worse, there is that dreaded quick- cut style of editing in the film that renders so much of the film barely able to figure out. This style of filming scenes is completely aggravating and doesn't make the scene look good. All we get is a sense of what is going on, as we're just guessing because the editing and camera movements are so erratic and in the end all it does is make the audience confused as to make is actually happening. The other flaw here is the film's tendency to really come up short on logical explanations for everything, leaving the origins or purpose of the contagion a mystery and having the release of it occurring as rather forgone afterthoughts. The soldier's purpose as well makes no sense, and on the whole this leaves far more questions than answers and really lowering this one as a whole.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, full male Nudity, depiction of events in animal testing centers, and children- in-jeopardy."

But an attack on a hen research place wouldn't look so exciting? Artistic/Movie licence I suppose.<br/><br/>Then Jim wakes up in an empty hospital. Nearly everyone else in the whole country has been infected by the Rage virus that the chimps had. Jim meets Selena and Mark who have some fancy petrol bombs all set up. Very handy when the ""infected"" attack. It might seem odd that the infected only seem to attack uninfected people? Oh, but if they attack each other, it would all be over in a few days. Another odd feature is that some of the 'infected' can run like Olympic sprinters, others can barely walk.<br/><br/>The infected can sniff out uninfected like mosquitoes can find me? So, when Jim watches a tape of his parents, the glow from the screen is seen outside. In the ensuing attack, Mark gets infected, so Selena has to kill him within 20 seconds. Next, they meet another survivor Frank and his teenage daughter Hannah. Who needs who most? They need each other. They hear a recorded message on a wind-up radio from an army group offering refuge, but it is hundreds of miles away.<br/><br/>Frank has a London taxi, so off they go. It seems strange that the only weapons they take with them are baseball bats? And then they find an open, undamaged supermarket. Unlikely since the norms of society have crumbled and 'infected' people cannot do the normal things that make civilization work. It would have been stripped ages ago? Will we go through this tunnel? Dumb idea, there are dozens of bridges over the Thames. The taxi charges through abandoned cars without being damaged? Except for getting a flat tyre. They stop to change the wheel. I wouldn't, I'd go like hell and get out of the tunnel first.<br/><br/>Manchester has been burned to the ground - no fire crews to put it out. Scary.<br/><br/>At the blockade where the army is supposed to be, Frank gets infected too, so that leaves Jim, Selena and Hannah who now meet the army guys. A Major and eight men. The men are depicted as ill-disciplined, uncouth and stupid. Unreal, but when one threatens to kill himself because the future is hopeless, the Major promises to get women for them all. Ridiculous. The suicide rate in armed forces is unfortunately quite high in normal times, and no one would suggest 'women' would solve that, although the Japanese did provide ""comfort women"" for their doomed soldiers. Fat- lot of good that did.<br/><br/>Jim of course, sets out to defend the honour of Selena and Hannah, so the soldiers take him outside to kill him, but he escapes and with some help from infected survivors from the city, kills them all.<br/><br/>They get in the taxi and crash through the gates. Fine, if the gate is made of polystyrene? Artistic licence again.<br/><br/>We were told earlier on that Paris and New York also had infections, but Jim sees a con-trail in the sky that suggests that there is hope after all, so they make a huge banner that the planes will see.<br/><br/>And they all lived happily ever after? In spite of the flaws, it's quite a gripping story, and well acted, but there is not one especially good scene and not much in the way of memorable dialogue, so I've only given it a 5."

Both centre around a focal group of people who are hugely isolated and are having to deal with trauma and death, but also play with both philosophy and art. Regarding the former of these two, the idea of what life is actually worth living for is a prevalent theme and the ideas of utilitarianism, and the savagery of the actual humans (not the zombies) are also called into question and help make this film more than just a drama/horror. There are times when one can even question whether the premise of the film is exploring the idea of isolation, with the zombie element simply being a means to allow this (although I think believing the zombies to be an afterthought to the philosophy would be a little naive on my part).<br/><br/>The latter of the similarities is the artistic element to the film. Thrilling action camera shots and the use of Point Of View camera work make the film highly engaging, but are juxtaposed beautifully by the shots of the emptiness what was once the bustling city of London, with the lone figure of Cillian Murphy (who is very compelling as Jim and is yet another similarity between Sunshine and 28) emphasising the epic nature of the images. Musically, John Murphy (I think my final similarity to Sunshine) provides a beautiful score (""In the house, in a heartbeat"" being particularly powerful). <br/><br/>I thought some of the acting was a little weak (namely Megan Burns' 'Hannah', but also some of the army 'banter' was pretty unconvincing - maybe due to poor writing), and I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the ending, but I still highly recommend this film (and Sunshine!) to those who were wary of it simply being a zombie flick; it really is a lot more."
"drmonstereater","8","3","4","17 February 2010"," The Drmonstereater gives his opinion of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later""
","28 Days Later Review It indeed seems at times we live in the most cynical of ages. We often look upon the human race as a walking, talking, autonomous, machine that is without mercy, compassion, or proactive though. A machine that marches through this world, hurting itself, killing itself, and committing crimes against itself and the entirety of the planet. It is often remarked upon that we are one of the only, if not the only, species on our planet that kills out of pure emotional impulse. ""28 Days Later"" gives us an unrelenting, and somewhat cynical look at the most dangerous of human emotions; rage.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" opens to a experimental chimp laboratory in Cambridge. We then see angry animal rights activists sneakily break their way into the laboratory. They then find hysterical chimps running back and forth in confined, Plexiglas cages. As they set to freeing the animals an unknowing scientist walks in and catches them in the act. ""No! Please stop."" he pleads ""The chimps are infected!"" ""With what?"" the activists demand ""Pure, rage."" he answers. Dismissing the scientist's warning they set a chimp free, immediately it attacks and infects both the activists and the scientist. The film then cuts to a man laying in a hospital bed, twenty eight days after the initial infection.<br/><br/>Jim is the name of the man in the hospital bed. Twenty eight days earlier he had been in a bicycle accident that ironically saved his life. Unwittingly he wonders the streets of a now deserted London shouting hello. There is a very despairing and intense scene in which he enters an abandoned church, it is here that he has his first encounter with what the survivors call ""the infected."" Quickly realizing that these are no normal human beings, Jim runs for his life. It is by shear luck that he comes across some properly prepared survivors. Taking him to their small refuge in the London underground they explain to him the current state of England.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" makes many a wise choice when it comes to presenting its story. As I stated in my review of ""Zombieland"" it's extremely hard to make even a mildly compelling zombie movie. This is due simply to the fact this genre has been tread over more times than the Hollywood walk of fame. There is barely an original bone in the genre's body but somehow ""28 Days Later"" makes it seem like something completely fresh. For an example, most zombie movies the infection, curse, etc. Takes anywhere between a few days to a few weeks to take full effect. The disease in ""28 Days Later"" however, takes a maximum of twenty seconds to take full effect. This makes for a harsh, brutal, killing of any infected character and no stereotyped hiding that one is infected.<br/><br/>The second wise choice it makes is the design of its characters. Instead of having an array of characters pick off as it slowly advances it gives us a small group of four, making each death unwanted, and emotionally wrenching, and I mean that in a good way. In addition to this, some of the characters are very cynical of their situation. Take the female side-protagonist Selena for an example. She is, smart, hard headed, and a realist. She gives no chances for anyone lagging behind and often remarks that ""living is as good as it gets."" However, there is optimistic contrast to her bleak personality.<br/><br/>With a hard hitting beginning we expect to film to run downhill as soon as it gets far enough to have a contrived romance between Jim and Selena, and thank goodness ""28 Days Later"" isn't that stupid. Throughout the entire film Selena's relationship with Jim remains positively platonic, less can be said about Jim though. However, he rarely ever manifests his feelings, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>If there is a single major criticism I have for Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" it would be this. The very ending felt contrived. There is a archetype of optimism being shattered by harsh reality, but the end seems to contradict to whole narrative the film had been so carefully crafting. Disappointed with the natural ending I watched the alternate and found myself a world more satisfied. However, I was still able to remind myself that in the other ending, everyone was happy and fine and therefor it just felt like a bleak ""what if"" instead of a harsh reality. Final Rating: 17/20 (good)"

"John_Truby","Null","3","4","7 January 2010"," Horror at a higher level
","Horror is consistently the most popular of all genres. And it is the cheapest type of film to make, so it is the form of choice for indie writers and directors. The problem is that horror is also the lowest form, typically devoid of story. So the question becomes: How do you write a horror script unique enough to sell that will also set you apart as a talented storyteller? To answer that question I took a look at one of the best horror films of recent years, 28 Days Later. Writer Alex Garland succeeds by knowing the form so well he is able to twist some of the key beats to give the traditional zombie story new life.<br/><br/>Mastering the horror genre is more difficult than it appears. You may be surprised to learn that it has more specialized story beats than any other form. So while horror is usually done in the most simplistic way possible - as a killing machine on a rampage - it doesn't have to be.<br/><br/>Horror always shows people being reduced, to an animal or a machine, the lowest levels a person can become short of death. In effect, this genre shows us human devolution. Horror puts character under the most extreme pressure of any form. So it focuses totally on one emotion, fear.<br/><br/>Bad horror plays that one note of fear again and again, and the story is nothing more than permissible sadism. Good horror takes this reduction of characters and makes it positive. It asks: What is human? And can this human quality be maintained in a world where everyone is desperate and induced to be an animal, ie going beyond even immoral behavior to amoral behavior? In short, good horror creates a recognizable human world where people are morally tested in the extreme.<br/><br/>The writer of 28 Days Later understands the crucial requirements of good horror, and he executes them within the parameters of a low budget film. In the set-up, the hero, Jim, wakes up from a coma to find himself in an empty, trashed hospital. Outside, the streets of London are just as deserted. He's walking around in a giant ghost town (no extras to run up this budget).<br/><br/>After meeting up with a couple of other survivors, Jim learns the rules of this new world. Stating the rules of the world is one of the specialized story beats in horror, not only because it tells the hero how to survive in this unique horror world, but also because it suggests to the audience how humanity will be tested. Here, there are two rules: 1, never go anywhere alone and 2, only travel in daylight. One of the survivors, Selena, tells Jim, ""Plans are pointless. Staying alive is as good as it gets."" This is not only the key line in this film, it is the key line in any horror film. From now on, we will see if human behavior is possible or if base animal survival is all we really are.<br/><br/>Garland quickly gives his survivors a desire line, which is to reach a makeshift military outpost some miles away. The characters go on a journey where they defeat a number of attacking zombies. This is typical horror -- giving the audience a few terrifying fights -- and pays the dues of the form.<br/><br/>But then Garland kicks the story up to a higher level, and the film becomes much more interesting. The hero and his allies reach the outpost, a fortified English mansion, and apparent safety. But of course this is another of horror's unique story beats: the place of final refuge is actually the place of greatest horror (for a breakdown of all 15 story beats, see the Horror, Fantasy, and Science Fiction Class or the Blockbuster Horror Software). Our hero soon learns that the platoon plans to rape the women and when he protests, they take him off to be murdered.<br/><br/>Now Garland can compare two kinds of animal: the zombies may be rabid dogs but the soldiers are merciless pack animals who have chosen to discard their humanity in a totally rational, pre-meditated way. A storm hits and the mansion becomes a kind of haunted house where a battle rages between the hero, the soldiers and the zombies. And it becomes impossible to tell who is the most savage.<br/><br/>A lot of horror is laughably silly. But don't underestimate this form. It is the best strategy for writing a breakthrough script. And if you learn the genre well enough, you can write a horror picture that is a powerful, and respected, piece of storytelling.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"
"chains01","8","3","4","12 October 2009"," 28 Days Later...
","Recently Danny Boyle won the best directing Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, a worthy award winner in my opinion. Boyle is a director that never rests on his laurels, recreating genres every time he steps up to the plate. One of his most familiar is the polarizing dramedy Trainspotting, but he's also recreated the sci-fi movie with Sunshine, the kids movie with Millions and so on. Danny Boyle is a filmmaker worthy to be listed among the great auteurs like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and so on. With 28 Days Later... (unfortunately, often referred to as a ""zombie"" movie, though it's not) he tackles horror with excellent precision.<br/><br/>28 Days Later opens with scenes of violence being watched by a monkey on a TV screen as he lays strapped down in a lab. Extremist animal activists break into the lab in an effort to save the animals from being tested on only to find they've been infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage. Disaster leads to death and devastation throughout all of London. Cut to Jim (Cillian Murphy) 28 days later, a bike courier waking up from a coma in an empty hospital. After wandering across London, bewildered by the lack of people, he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) as he's being chased by the infected denizens of the city. After finding other survivors, Frank and Hannah (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns), they hear a radio broadcast from a military installment which houses other horrors for our survivors.<br/><br/>While often considered a zombie movie, and it borrows liberally from many past zombie movies, 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. The infected in this movie are living beings, infected by a virus that similar to Ebola is communicable by blood, and has more affect on the brain than the physicality of a human being. This is important to the message of the movie as the virus represents something that is inherent in all of us and leads to social unrest and the breakdown of modern society, as the virus did in the movie. In this Boyle has done something that he does very well in every one of his movies: creates a great social commentary. Throughout the course of the movie we see that there are those who would fight against a society gone wrong, and those that would exploit it. Yet, while exploring the themes of moral ambiguity, Boyle never handles them with a heavy handed approach.<br/><br/>Having a moral/ social message is important to good horror in this reviewers opinion, but how the movie looks and feels is easily just as important to hold the viewers attention. Boyle chose to shoot the majority of the movie with DV cameras, giving the movie a gritty post apocalyptic type feel while also giving the movie a kind of documentary feel as well. On top of that, the DV camera also allowed for tricks that gives the infected an otherworldly look, making them seem scarier when they're bum rushing their ""prey"". The visuals selected to fill the frame also give you a glimpse at an alien world, a city, or a grocery store that should be buzzing with people, but because of the look of film, it seems even more eerie when you see it emptied of all presence.<br/><br/>The acting of course is top notch, as anyone whose seen Brendan Gleeson act would expect, but the movie really belongs to Cillian Murphy who had his break out performance in this movie. As Jim, a man who went down one day in a bustling city, and woke up the next in an empty city, Murphy shows the pain of a man whose lost everything before he even knew what had happened to him. Cillian gives us a man in the middle of a crisis that we truly believe his arc from a pained and scared man just waking up at the end of the world to a man who will fight through all hell to protect those he cares about. Naomie Harris, who also received great acclaim for this movie, portrays a strong woman struggling with her fear and sorrow, but always holding it in, trying to steel herself from pain to come. Also keep your eyes open for Christopher Eccleston, who will become the future Dr. Who a few years after this movie.<br/><br/>For as great as the movie is though, I do have my nitpicks. Calling the virus Rage seems a little too on the nose for my tastes, but luckily this isn't mentioned too often throughout. At the beginning there are also glaring plot holes in the scheme of today's society. Why is Jim the only patient to not be evacuated from the hospital? And why did they leave a comatose patient naked in the ICU? Why are there no cars left on the streets of London, or along the highways? A lot of this is due to the budget of the film, and can be explained away, but as there are no answers to be found within the actual narrative of the movie they must be left as plot holes. Luckily, as the only plot holes are mainly to be found at the beginning of the movie they do not detract from the movie as a whole, and will be forgotten by most by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>For fans of horror, and movies with a deeper socio-political meaning this is definitely a must watch, but think before you decide to show this to your kids. There is full male nudity, as well as a lot of cursing. But if you're looking for a captivating horror this movie is definitely for you."
"TOMNEL","7","3","4","2 November 2008"," The first hour was fresh and entertaining...then comes the climax and there goes the picture.
","""28 Days Later"" stands above the typical horror movie, and by a lot too. Unfortunately, the average horror movie is so bad, that this would have to be terrible not to be better. This is actually really good for a horror movie. It has realistic acting, characters we care about, scary antagonist zombies that lead to several heart racing scenes and dialogue that's just fine. The climax is what brought this movie down a notch. It was loud, and nonstop, and everything that defined what the first part of the movie is, is not used in the climax.<br/><br/>After an outbreak of an infectious disease, the world's population is moving away from humans and now is being lead by brain dead and blood hungry zombies. Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma 28 days after this disease took hold of the human race. He ends up meeting other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris), a tough woman who will kill anyone infected in a split second, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). These few survivors go off to find more survivors and end up finding a military base where the study these zombie creatures by chaining them up. Chaos ensues when one gets loose.<br/><br/>The first part and good portion of this movie is different from most horror films. It's quiet, except for zombie attacks which will catch you by surprise, and the characters act very reserved, but it's not boring. It's like a character study, and the characters are interesting. Instead of showing lots of zombie violence (which it does have some), it's more about the characters and how they're coping and what they're thinking. Once on the military base, this movie takes a turn for the worse. It grows overly violent, and the climax is equivalent to a bunch of loud screaming while throwing blood and guts at the camera. This type of climax works better in comically violent films, such as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" or Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"", but here it's a step in the wrong direction. Then we get to the ending. It may not be anything new, but it's an effective and good ending.<br/><br/>I enjoyed everything about this movie, except for the climax. But even with a climax like this has, this is an exceptional zombie movie. The acting and writing are realistic and the characters created are ones we care about. The direction is good, as is the camera direction. Much better than the sequel this movie produced. Overall, this is a similar plot (The Omega Man) but it brings enough new to the genre to make it a success.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins. R for violence and language."
"jzappa","8","3","4","28 October 2008"," Above-Average and Character-Driven
","I'm going to start off with my pettiest criticism so that you'll forget how cheap I am by the time you're finished reading: This movie starts off by establishing that animal rights activists are at fault for spreading the ""rage"" virus because they set lab animals free from their cages, only to find out too late that they've been turned into foaming, savage predators. I'm not saying that Alex Garland, the screenwriter, vilified animal rights activists on purpose, but isn't that the overall effect of the scene? That they're ignorant, malevolent anarchists who don't know what they're doing and cause massive destruction? I find that highly contemptible. But the rest of the film is fine.<br/><br/>I remember when this film was released it was a breakthrough for both Cillian Murphy and the use of grainy, gritty digital video cinematography in mainstream movies. By now, we've already been introduced to the latter. When the former awakens in an empty hospital and leaves, he finds a forsaken London. In a sequence of astounding shots, he wanders with not a single person within reach, seeing from old wind-beaten newspapers of a virus that twisted human beings against itself.<br/><br/>So opens this character-driven take on the post-apocalyptic horror movie, which starts as an above-average horror film and continues as an stimulating, however action-packed, inquiry of human nature (and yes, only human. In spite of the fact that this spread from chimps, there don't seem to be any animals that attack or are attacked by the rage-infected).<br/><br/>Though famously indecisive regarding how to end this movie, director Danny Boyle, who by this time had made the enduring contemporary landmark Trainspotting, gives his sci-fi drama an abrupt documentary impression, making the film scarier through being more realistic, while at the same time making the movie less expensive. It makes you wonder about the formula credibility of movies like this: A more expensive film would have had more traditional action heroes, and less screen time in what would be a less patient stride to expand the gradually familial relationship between the unusual characters, each of them being everyday people transformed by inescapable circumstance. Throw enough money into this movie's broad concept, and it would have the penetration of the Resident Evil films or the Dawn of the Dead remake. Garland's script develops characters who seem to have a reality at a distance from their part in the plot, whose behavior determines what they do, where they go, and why.<br/><br/>Naomie Harris's seemingly inscrutable, at first less than approachable black female becomes the bossy member of the intimate cluster, wearing the toughest and least emotional shell, imposing a hardened survivalist boundary. Timid Cillian Murphy would probably have died if he hadn't met her. Sooner or later they find solace with two other survivors: Brendan Gleeson's genial and resourceful father and his teenage daughter Hannah, of whom he is strongly protective. They've overwhelmingly fortified in a high-rise apartment, and use their hand-cranked radio to receive a broadcast from an Army unit near Manchester. Should they count on the broadcast and journey to what is illustrated as a safe haven? After some debate, the group, who seems to bond more and more every minute, resolves that the smartest thing to do is to take the chance.<br/><br/>In a lesser film, and almost certainly an American one, there would be a sex scene between Murphy and Harris, but Boyle and Garland's work finds the fitting pitch in an instant where she pecks him on the cheek, and he's the one that blushes.<br/><br/>The rage-infecteds bring up questions like, How long can one live once infected? Since London seems empty at the beginning, I assume the infecteds we see were survivors until somewhat lately. Another thought: Seeing as they run in hordes, why don't they attack one another? Its driving strand of the zombie-like outbreak seems allegorical, the film punctuates its assertion of a human's most rudimentary self in the climactic scene, which fulfills every ounce of pent-up aggression in you, the viewer, and though the third act does not quite live up to the promise of the first two, this climactic bloodbath is the highest point of the film."

","This is a very well made British horror movie. Everything was near-perfect here. The acting was flawless and the effects were excellent. The storyline was good also, however more toward the end it got a little off centered but that does not ruin this movie. Jim (Cillian Murphy) is a very realistic and likable character, one you would root for. Jim is the sole survivor (or so he believes) of what appears to be the apocalypse. He then journeys to find his parents and then a safe place to stay, and meets a few people along the way: Selena (Naomie Harris), a survival-obsessed, leader-like woman who is with him for most of the film, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), a light-hearted, good-humored guy who probably a SWAT member before the epidemic and has holed up in his apartment with his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns); a shy, quiet girl, Mark (Noah Huntley), a sort-of nervous, side-kick type of guy, and a squad of soldiers at an army base, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). This movie cannot be called a ""zombie"" movie really, because the ""infected"" aren't technically dead. However, people will call this film whatever they want. I give this film a 9/10 and hope horror fans will find this movie as good as I did."

","Zombie movie fan? Forget Dawn of the Dead. Forget Land of the Dead. Forget Night of the living Dead. Resident Evil 1-3. Not so much Evil Dead. 28 Days Later...so much to say. This movie was, and is one of the BEST horror movies to hit the screen. Cilian Murphy was AMAZING as the man who woke up alone in an abandoned town, got up only to find he wasn't alone. The town was eery, scary, lifeless, and the music added to the tension factor. He searches town, finds nothing, has a couple run-ins with the infected, slowly begins to realize what is going on. He meets a group of people who are UN-infected, hoping to gain security and trust with them. They attempt to travel across the state for safety on the other side, only to find that the only military base there only wants the woman so they can breed more human life. Sick, yes, but is an unexpected twist to add to the already confused. It ends with them escaping, and the ending is somewhat heartfelt and powerful. The zombies are unlike any you've seen in previous movies. Their genuine shape and face is like a normal being, except with white, lifeless eyes, and fangs as sharp as shark teeth. And with the power to move, sense, jump, and eat with superhuman ability just makes you fear for the characters more. The character development is also great, even they form a special bond with each other through fighting the zombies, and become sort of like a small family so its devastating when they are broken up. If you haven't seen this movie, see it. If you have, watch it again. If you feel the same way i do, touché!"

It's different than most zombie movies because this time around, somebody placed adrenaline on these creatures to make them more scary than before.<br/><br/>The film begins after a protest outside of London, England where a bunch of PETA freaks decide to let loose a bunch of caged experiment chimps where they don't know what they've been infected with until one of them catches the disease where all hell starts to begin.<br/><br/>28 Days Later after the incident, there's not a single soul walking around the streets or bridges of London.

","I was totally blown away by this movie. I went into the movie knowing that is not just another zombie film, but that still did not prepare me for what I saw. From the opening scene with monkey in a clockwork orange chair, it kept me smiling at how intelligent the film was. Cillian Murphy gave an outstanding performance and I would love to see what this guy is capable of in the future. The opening in the hospital and the empty streets of London really made the whole atmosphere of the movie. The zombies were not scary, but I don't think of zombies as scary. The best thing about the movie was that I would have welcomed a death at the hands of the zombies instead of death at one of the humans (especially if I was a woman). First of all when I learned the intent of the army guys that is when the movie actually got scary. The rest of the movie was a perfect build up to man reacting to man. Not man reacting to zombies. But man reacting to the horrible nature of man. Not that the man react in a good way, but boy did he react. I reminded me of Rambo first blood, but instead of a big muscle bound guy it was a skinny little guy who was as scarier than any zombie. The social commentary was great and it really brought up the question of how many reacts under pressure. I loved how Cillain Murphy did not have to shoot anyone and literally ripped one of the guys apart with his bare hands. The ending was whatever, but boy was that a great movie. The only reason I did not give it a ten was I was not a fan of the female character even if she was really well acted, I did not think she was necessary. I actually think it would have been more powerful if the little girl was the only one who made it out alive. Great movie though. Creepy, but not because of the zombies, but because of the crazy things humans do to each other."

After one bite, one scratch, one drop of blood, a person is infected and within seconds becomes a deranged, outraged monster that only knows one thing- to attack.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle keeps the action and the pacing frightening and totally believable in this British apocalyptic thriller. Cillian Murphy is intriguing as Jim, who befriends Selena, a woman who survived the initial outbreak. Together they find more survivors and must stay alive on their journey to a military base where they can only hope there is anybody alive- that is, without the infection.<br/><br/>The zombies are fast and truly scary, with some great gore effects and the movie ties together nicely for a really satisfying climax.

"zombiegal13","9","3","4","14 January 2008"," 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later vs. Other Zombie Movies
","I must say I am a big fan of most zombie, ""living dead"", and undead movies; some of my favorites include Shaun of the Dead & the Resident Evil series, but I particularly like 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later for their adaptation of zombies. I really liked the idea of the ""zombie virus"" being more of an insanity virus verses a ""living dead virus"". It honestly seemed a lot more believable than some people dying and coming back to life.<br/><br/>Of the two ""28 _____ later"" movies, I prefer 28 Days Later. Simply because it is less of a popcorn movie, and not constantly gory. I mean, it does definitely have its moments of bloodiness; but it wasn't one person being killed off after another. 28 Weeks Later was interesting as well, but it was one of those movies where you just sat there and wondered, ""Why?"" Why would you put hundreds of people in small rooms during a zombie virus breakout?"

","Not since the original 1978 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" have I seen such a fine movie for this genre. The cast of lesser-known actors shows that great films don't need star power to succeed. I was completely drawn into the story and unlike most other films didn't find myself guessing when the hero was going to save the day. The plot development doesn't rely on the formulaic buildup of the hero but instead concentrates on the harsh cold realities of such an outbreak. It carries the film and makes it easy to sustain your disbelief as the story unfolds. This is the kind of film, like ""Trainspotting"", also a UK film, that defies the homogenized Hollywood motion picture machine concept. In short, another great film from the UK. I highly recommend it. Also, don't forget to watch the sequel ""28 Weeks later"" which is almost as good and stars Robert Carlyle."

","Finally a ""zombie"" movie to make George A. Romero proud with the new generation of directors and writers. Between hundreds of zombie movies that popped theaters for the last few years, there're no doubts that 28 Days Later together with Romero's second ""dead"" trilogy produced (and being in production) during this decade are by far the best ones already produced. The most funny thing is that this movie is directed by the most improbable of the directors to direct something for this genre: Danny Boyle. Yes, the Trainspotting one. The interesting thing about him is that he likes to handle with human limits, and this movie couldn't be different.<br/><br/>Screenplay is signed by Alex Garland, and it's fantastic because it follows almost the same steps of Romero's movies, where a virus and zombies are just camouflages, trying to explain over metaphors and allegories a reality possible to happen in some near future. The criticism is always there, all the time, disguised as entertainment. It's truly a movie to make Romero proud with those ones that one day were watching his movies and are now being inspired by him.<br/><br/>It's also interesting when we finally understand that the budget of a movie isn't responsible for its quality. 28 Days Later cost US$ 8 mil and had a US$48 mil gross, while the shameful Resident Evil trilogy cost US$ 200 mil and its gross hadn't achieved even the double of its total budget. These brutal differences should make producers, directors and studios responsible for trashes like Resident Evil feel ashamed of their selves. With Romero's words ""The best horror films are the ones that are much less endowed"".<br/><br/>This movie is a precious gem among horror and sci-fi modern productions and certainly can already be consider a classic for the fact that it's based on classics."
"LoneWolfAndCub","9","3","4","16 November 2007"," Boyle re-invents the zombie genre!
","Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach, Shallow Grave) is an amazing and visionary director. You may ask, what separates 28 Days Later from any other zombie film, isn't it just about a group of survivors trying to escape the hordes of infected? One thing, this doesn't focus on blood and gore, flashy MTV style editing and heavy metal music to scare the audience. 28 Days Later focuses more on the eerie, emotional and unsettling to involve the audience.<br/><br/>A group of animal activists accidentally release an incurable virus into England. This virus causes the infected to be filled with rage and become hungry for blood. Four weeks later and England is virtually empty, their are handfuls of survivors around the place. Four survivors team up and try to find sanctuary while fending off hordes of the infected.<br/><br/>Aside from the amazing acting (especially by Cillian Murphy), the awesome camera-work and beautiful cinematography this movie has some great messages (much like Romero's zombie movies). Although this movie is about a rage virus, rage is a human emotion and this is evident towards the end when our protagonist goes a rampage, killing everyone in sight. He isn't infected, however, and what tops this perfect scene off is one of the other survivors mistakes him for one of the infected (but doesn't kill him).<br/><br/>Our society is plagued by violence and rage and Danny Boyle is the perfect man to show us this using cinema. 28 Days Later is an amazing and terrifying horror movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>4½/5"
"gavin6942","7","3","4","17 March 2007"," A Tightrope Between Matheson and Walking Dead
","After waking up from a coma, a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) discovers that the entire city of London and maybe the world has been taken over by a virus that causes people to go into a rage. Now, he is left with only two things to do: find others like himself and learn to survive.<br/><br/>This film can be seen as a tightrope connecting ""I Am Legend"" (any version you want) and ""The Walking Dead"". Like the former, you have one man alone against a world of post-human monsters in an evacuated large city. He is looking for a cure, or at least a way to survive, and he finds a female companion to share the journey. The differences between the films are relatively minor in the context of the overall plot.<br/><br/>And then we have the latter. While the ""Walking Dead"" comic or television series could be compared to any zombie apocalypse film, it again features one man alone in a big city (Rick in Atlanta as opposed to Jim in London). Most notably, both start in a hospital. Major West could also be compared to the Governor. This may be a coincidence, or it may be an homage -- according to Robert Kirkman, he had the comic plotted out before he had seen this film.<br/><br/>We are given this horrific vision by director Danny Boyle (best known at this point for ""Trainspotting"" before getting even bigger with ""Slumdog Millionaire""), and he does a fine job. By saying this film takes elements from predecessors, it may sound like I am being condescending or trying to sell the film short. I am not. Boyle does a wonderful job of showing a desolate city, a man isolated in London (the last place he would expect to be alone) and people infected with the rage virus. Much of horror cinema is not so much being original (a very, very rare thing these days) but taking a well-trod archetype and making it your own.<br/><br/>One brave decision that was made was the casting of no-name actors, or at least no actors that stand out for Americans (this is before the ""Doctor Who"" franchise took off in the States). Any name actor (such as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio as was rumored) would distract from the grand vision, I feel. It shifts the focus from the story of all humanity to the story of one man. Interestingly, Cillian Murphy has since become a huge star in his own right -- watching the film now (2013) is different than when it first came out because of this.<br/><br/>The heart of the film is Brendan Gleeson, who plays Frank. It takes it from a horror or survival film to a story of the goodness of humanity. The saying that sometimes the worst brings out the best in people is exemplified in Frank. His good nature and altruism shine and have a positive effect on those around him.<br/><br/>Many consider this a ""zombie"" film, while others try to differentiate it from that group (Boyle himself has called it a zombie film). I think there is a distinct difference between a virus that affects the living and the walking dead (even when the walking dead are brought back by a virus). This is, really, just a tale of survival that could have been portrayed similarly as rabies or AIDS. This is another way the film is influential; hundreds of zombie films have come out over the past decade (most of which are terrible), but the rise of the ""infection"" film owes its genesis to ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>The only real complaint is the suspension of disbelief we have to have about Jim's beginnings. Waking up from a coma that he was in for at least three weeks, he is able to run easily without muscle atrophy or fatigue. He also survived in a hospital where no one else did. And most amazing of all, he seems to have not urinated or defecated in the bed. But all horror and science fiction films require a little bit of magic, so I think we can mark this off as being in that category.<br/><br/>The film is heavy on the survival aspects, moderate on the action, moderate on the gore by ""zombie"" standards. And very light on the romance, which I am pleased about (that is one advantage it has over ""Omega Man""). The film is all about trying to make it out alive, and that is something I can see more of -- ""survival horror"". While I would not recommend seeing this until after seeing ""Omega Man"" and ""Last Man on Earth"" just to put it in perspective, this is a very good addition to the line of films coming out with these themes."
"AT-AT","7","3","4","11 October 2006"," Effective and creepy flick
","Shooting this on digital video was the best move Danny Boyle made with this violent and quite creepy movie. It gives the movie a look as bleak and oppressive as the story it tells. Its vicious looking, cold and picks up on every detail. It puts the action, and every drop of blood, right in your face, and that sets it apart from (and lifts it above) the standard set by most Hollywood movies in its genre (Dawn of the Dead remake, Land of the Dead). The hand-held 'shaky-cam' makes for an extremely hyper-kinetic cinematography, and that conveys to the attacks by the 'infected' in their unstoppable rage. And to the desperation so well portrayed by the actors both during safety, but also during fights. Selena hacking away at an infected with a machete is particularly nasty.<br/><br/>Personally I have always preferred slow zombies over fast moving like the ones from Nightmare City or the new Dawn remake, as the slow make for more hopeless situation and desperation. (you can run, but you cannot hide) The ability to outrun zombies makes for a perfect sense of safety even though there is none.<br/><br/>Although the 'infected' are not zombies, they are in the same ballpark. In this case their ability to move fast and make chase only help empathize the force that drives them. Pure rage. Any other emotion and self perseverance is completely gone, and that makes for some truly psychotic and terrifying antagonists. Times have changed (unfortunately) and extras aren't a buck a dozen anymore, and due to the films small budget, we never get a massive amount of 'infected' on screen at any one time and that takes away at the apocalyptic feel of the film unfortunately. But the ones that get on screen lifts the action and tension up to whole new highs.<br/><br/>The acting are all you could wish for from Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Naomie Harris. Their behavior and choices are well founded, and when in panic, you totally forget to 'know better'. Never did I think ""why didn't they do that or this"" or ""how come..."" because the desperation is transferred so well. And heres the exception. The kid actor! How come 9 out of 10 kid actors suck? And how come directors never see it, or do something about it if they do? Megan Burns fortunately has few important scenes, but the ones she has, she sinks with bravura. Everything she says is in a monotone voice and her body language is about as lively as a corpse's. The soldiers roles calls for some depth also. They are stereotyped, somewhat due to their simple dialogue, but also in the role they play in this story. But they do it convincingly enough, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Overall an effective and creepy flick but remember; movies should be seen on the big screen in the darkness. Especially this one benefits from that."

I am upset that I didn't see any trailers for this movie- and it was hardly advertised in London when it came out-unless I was just caught up in my busy schedule to notice!<br/><br/>Anyway it didn't scare me at all- but I was completely gripped- The emptiness of London felt real and very eerie being a Londoner myself. I identified with Selena's character- suave qui peut- me 100% if I got into that situation. There was gore- but it wasn't overdone like in most films of this genre- there was only one scene in the beginning when I looked away when the 1st infected human vomited blood- it was too much too soon- I hadn't warmed up yet-so to speak.<br/><br/>I liked the relationship between Jim and Selena. She was the protector -but they complemented each other- in the end she became more human."

","*Includes spoilers*<br/><br/>Went into watching this film hopeful, but not expectant. I was, however, very pleasantly surprised. The suspense doesn't let up until the end, it has some genuinely scary parts, and the adrenaline really was pumping when Jim goes mental toward the end. Added to that Danny Boyle's excellent cinematography and John Murphy's excellent score (with a nice nod to Brian Eno - always slightly chilling in every sense of the word), I found this film extremely enjoyable. Granted, as some have said, it borrows very heavily from other movies of the genre, but there's been no attempt to cover this up... in fact, I expect many shots are meant to be in homage.<br/><br/>Just a couple of things I'd like to clear up...<br/><br/>In reply to those that seem to believe that the entire world is meant to be infected, you must have been out of the room during the reference to how Britain had been quarantined. That's why right at the end we see the infected starving, and an American jet flys over and finds the survivors. The infection stops there.<br/><br/>Another comment made here is that the soldier's desperation to procreate makes no sense because of this. Again, I think you've missed the point... they weren't so much desperate to procreate, as to simply get their ends away... just like any other rapist, really. It raises some very poignant issues about humanity in general: the enemy is often within... while the infected have no choice but to attack, the uninfected soldiers had a choice. It's a scary prospect.<br/><br/>Anyway, have a watch if you fancy a stylish and often scary thriller/horror with that inimitably British Boyle edge."

The violence, in terms of a supernatural movie, was necessary and realistic.  Then.....<br/><br/>The second half of this movie loses it's way and loses it big time.

"hptmbedra","2","4","6","13 March 2014"," What is the reason for 7.7 ?
","I've got to stop watching the ratings first. It's the best option to avoid the big movie let downs. Same story here, attracted by the ratings, I was looking forward to see ""28 days later"" impatiently.<br/><br/>First minutes looked promising (except the monkeys situation). I like the sequences with individuals walking around while nobody else is there. The film looked cheap, but that is not a big issue from my point of view. Now, the biggest problem is the actual plot. There are way too many holes. Im prepared to take some amount of nonsensical scenes while watching this kind of movies but this film went over my limits. Among the most obvious (I am sure that one could count over one hundred idiotic sequences here but i will be brief): <br/><br/>-The Selena is tough as nails from the beginning, girl with no problem killing her partner. She is prepared to let others in a trouble in order to survive but later on she turns out to be sensitive and pretty weak little girl. On the other hand, the weak and confused bicycle courier Jim becomes strong and battle experienced at the end and takes out the evil military squad by using his hands and unleashing the zombie in order to save the girls(what ???). And I almost forgot that when he finds a gun, he gets rid of it, because his hands are so much more effective against trained soldiers.<br/><br/>-After saving Jim's life Mark tells him there is no electricity right? So how is it possible that 3 minutes later Jim watches a video tape? And where the light in the store came from? Did someone at least read the script before making this movie?<br/><br/>-Why have all the people abandoned all protection clothes at the beginning? (Mark and Selena, Daddy, Soldiers, all of them were protected as we saw them first time) If the Daddy would have kept at least the goggles, he could live.<br/><br/>-Jim continues to do stupid decisions. What was the reason he went inside the gas station? It was completely unnecessary and he was risking his life just to feel free or what. And why did they take the tunnel shortcut? The Daddy was inconsistent here. First time we saw him, he was a man dedicated to protection of his daughter, but now he was risking lives of his crew and almost got caught by zombies and then made fun of it.<br/><br/>-Why the soldiers show up on the road block so late, I mean after the Daddy gets infected? Wouldn't it be better to say 'Hello' as soon as possible and avoid problems? While the infected were moving every time like freaks on a speed, I wouldn't have a hard time telling the infected and healthy apart.<br/><br/>-Strange that the soldiers got crazy so early. The evac took place one month ago, that is a short time to become a psycho with sex as the only thing you care about.<br/><br/>-Looking at the infected soldier on the chain I had the feeling it wasn't a good idea mainly if you walk through wrong door at night to take a leak. When they watched the infected soldier, they didn't keep any safe distance which should avoid landing infected blood on their faces.<br/><br/>-Considering their survival situation, why were the soldiers wasting bullets while looking for Jim just to make sure he isn't for example in a tent over there instead of making few steps forward? The execution of Jim and sarge was stupid too. I think the major needed every man able to fire a weapon to increase their chances to survive.<br/><br/>I have another 99 problems with that but let me skip it. Big let down considering the film looked good at the beginning and the promising ratings here."
"brando647","8","4","6","27 December 2009"," A Modern Take on the Classic Zombie Genre
","Zombie movies need something fresh to keep my attention and Danny Boyle has done just that. Instead of the stereotypical shambling undead, Boyle has put his own spin on the genre, avoiding complete cliché while still paying homage to the zombie masters that came before him. The film establishes itself 28 days following an outbreak in London of the rage virus, a mutated form of Ebola passed through blood and saliva in which afflicted become mindlessly violent. The infected are still living and fully mobile, but they appear to lose all higher brain functions and rely solely on aggressive instinct. So, the ""zombies"" in Boyle's film retain some of the classic attributes (such as their brainless nature and the attacks on the uninfected) while integrating a modern scientific angle, playing on the current societal fears of disease and biological weapons.<br/><br/>While the movie can be considered a zombie film, I would classify it more as a survival thriller. The focus isn't as much as surviving waves of infected, but follows a group of four as they make their way through a desolate English landscape, avoiding the infected as best as possible and dealing with an even greater danger when they encounter an isolated military outpost. The concept of humans being more dangerous than the infected isn't new, but Boyle does a great job here and it creates a tense final act to the film.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy was great as the main character, Jim, who we first discover as he awakes from a coma and finds the entire city eerily deserted (making for one of the coolest sequences in the film). He is soon joined by Selena (Naomie Harris), Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and Frank's daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Gleeson always makes for a great film presence and Harris was a strong counter to Murphy's optimistic outlook. I found the greatest performance came from Christopher Eccleston as Major Henry West, the head of the military outpost. He comes off as charming and you want to trust him in his position of authority but you soon find he is as corrupt as those who follow his orders.<br/><br/>Boyle's film is a zombie film without being a zombie film. The cast do a good job of creating complex characters and you always find yourself hoping they pull through. Boyle's film helped pave the way for the modern zombie cinema, in which the iconic masses aren't necessarily slow-shambling flesh-eaters, but frighteningly effective animals. 28 DAYS LATER is light on scares, but instead focuses on the suspense and tension around finding yourself in such an apocalyptic scenario and for that, I think it's great."

","After a group of activists unleash rage infected apes, Britain becomes home to those infected with the virus, wiping out everybody in their way and for a group of survivors, they must do anything to survive.<br/><br/>28 days later is a mix of strong intelligent thinking, an artistic approach to direction and an endless spinning narrative that engages viewers right in to the very core of the gritty and energetic film that is Danny Boyle's work of genius.<br/><br/>A horror is a horror usually for the appearance of an abnormal being or 'monster' and here we see a human preaching concept of animal rights gone horribly wrong when the 'rage' virus affects people. What the cross brings are humans with blood thirsty traits, an inability to go out in daylight and constant appetite. Many have argued the creatures are zombies but these creations feel more personal and have way too much energy and thirst to be stereotyped as such creatures. The fact that they can affect a person by way of simple touch is scary and whilst this isn't as gripping as it had the potential to be, the physiological effect of these beings is sustained throughout the two hours.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle is a genius. The recent Oscar winner (Slumdog Millionaire) is able to maintain the thrill factor whilst also capturing the scenes in an unforgivably picturesque way. The filming of this picture is perhaps the finest ever made in Britain. The M1 had to be closed, the main road near Big Ben was shut and these are just a few examples of effort the team went in and considering these shots are only a couple of minutes long, it goes to show how appreciative and remarkable this film is.<br/><br/>The scenery is unbelievable. Who would have though our country could have been so picturesque? Boyle's sweeping landscape shots are to die for and the thrill factor in the chases is to live for, consistent and perhaps one of the finest directed British films.<br/><br/>Murphy, Harris, Gleeson and Burns all do themselves justice without being too screamy and abnormal as most protagonists in the genre today.<br/><br/>The sequel 28 weeks later though not directed by Boyle maintains that level of sublime scenery and adrenaline soaked excitement with a core desperate and energetic storyline whereas this 2002 hit carries a feeling of drama with the line of characters and their lives in the new world.<br/><br/>Whereas there are lapses and the end feels rushed 28 days is exciting and penetrates the mind with some unbelievable direction and location with the writing on top form."

The only reason I can see is that, although they're British, they're relatively professional-looking.<br/><br/>The characters are almost invariably stick people, badly defined and never straying from the definition they're given when they first appear.<br/><br/>The exciting stuff (a corpse, some smack or a bunch of red-eyed crazies) is always presented in such a way that it's obviously intended to be clever, even when it patently isn't.<br/><br/>I actually agree with many of the common complaints about this movie. There wasn't much action - which is fine if you're making a horror flick, but it's not scary. Or a character drama, but the characters are laughable (unless they're played by Christopher Ecclestone, and then only because Ecclestone rocks). Or a gore flick, but there wasn't any.<br/><br/>The ending is facile, and the re-made ending is just a joke.<br/><br/>I payed 50p for this on second hand VHS, but I still felt like I wasted my money.<br/><br/>All your Brits out there who loved this, be honest -- did you give it a few bonus points for being British? Or more than a few...? This is maybe fun if you're new to the horror genre, but it's hardly a worthy successor to the classics by Romero or Cronenberg which have dealt much more powerfully (and originally) with similar themes.<br/><br/>So, instead of watching this, go rock ""Shivers"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"" - even the debut films of these two great directors can dish out a weighty slap to this substanceless piece of cheap nonsense."

And while the ads boast ""scary as hell,"" I'd have to say it's anything but. Not one moment in this film was truly scary. As for the cast, they did okay. It's always good to see Brendan Gleeson in another role, and Christopher Eccleston, while his character was a bit lacking, did good with what he had to work with as well. The other newcomers weren't bad, but it won't be a breakthrough role for any of them. This seems to be the Blair Witch of this year. People want a good scary movie, and word-of-mouth is pushing this one, but it's mind-boggling to figure out who it is that thinks this is good. Was it a horrible movie? No. But it's nothing I'll ever care to see again. I'll take my clichéd American horror movies over this any day, thank you.<br/><br/>As for the ""alternate ending""... What a joke.

","I thought this movie was EXCELLENT! There have been very few 'zombie' movies coming out in recent years that are worth the price of the movie ticket, but this movie goes above and beyond my expectations. Unlike many zombie movies, this movie is actually emotional. The suspense and focus of the movie is not based on the gore, but on the characters themselves. The character's feeling influence your own in some ways, and add to the suspense.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautifully done, and some shots add to the suspense/horror without the aid of cheesy and outdated methods or corny music.<br/><br/>Some complain that the storyline is unoriginal or uninspired, but halfway through the movie the plot is reversed as the main characters' problems shift from the zombies to the barbaric soldiers holding them hostage. I agree, the whole virus thing has been done, but seriously, how many somewhat reasonable ways are there to bring about a worldwide zombie outbreak?? The reason for the zombies being there is not something new, but the rest of the plot is imaginative.<br/><br/>Also, critics may claim that some parts are unrealistic without thinking things through. Why would the Manchester fire drive the infected out if light attracts them? The infected can be killed by conventional means, so the smoke would suffocate them. Isn't it unrealistic that Cillian Murphy, upon realizing that the entire city is abandoned would be so calm? Well, not everyone would go into hysterics and start crying and screaming. Being scared doesn't always impair one's ability to think ahead, hence Cillian picking up Pepsi for later, realizing that if everything is abandoned he might get thirsty later. Why is Cillian able to walk the streets for hours without seeing a single zombie if everyone is infected? The zombies are afraid of light; as Selena and Mark said, they can travel only by day. So before making judgments people should think things through. Either way, this is a ZOMBIE movie, how can anyone really expect it to be extremely realistic? <br/><br/>I have heard people complain that the movie is boring. 28 Days Later is not a conventional zombie movie. That is what sets it apart. Some parts reflect the horror genre, and some reflect something other than the aspects of just a zombie movie. This is NOT another Dawn of the Dead. This is a great movie, but people need to realize that it is different, and must be appreciated for that. Sure, its not perfect, but it is as close to perfection as a zombie movie can get."

","I don't know exactly what stops me from enjoying 28 Days Later, but it just doesn't strike me as being nearly as good as others have made out. Maybe it is the inordinately slow pace. I really don't know. I think part of the problem is that the characters carry about the same level of importance to the average viewer as a badly-articulated marionette. In any case, 28 Days Later could really have been titled 28 Days Long, because it certainly takes its sweet time to get anywhere.<br/><br/>The introductory sequence in the research lab was a nice touch, and it started the film off on a great note. We've grown all too used to film scenarios in which some kind of army biological weapon brings about the destruction of the world. 28 Days Later takes the heroic step of placing the blame where it really belongs, in the hands of ignorant activists who care nothing for the consequences of their actions, so long as the world is brought into line with their backwards, retrofit philosophy. The real problem begins after the outbreak, when we're following our rather scruffy hero around the empty city.<br/><br/>I don't think it was such a good idea to use music over the top of most every shot, for one thing. Films like C'era una volta il West managed to effectively use near silence in order to induce strong feelings, but it appears that today's directors just don't understand the value of a mood or how effective silence can be when it comes to inducing it. Another significant problem lies in the characters. We see them do terrible, even unforgivable things, but very little in the way of explanation is given. The audio commentary refers to keeping the exposition short and relying on the audience to fill in the gaps. The problem here is that the director and writer do too much of this. They also rely upon the viewer to find excitement or interest where there are none.<br/><br/>It was a bold move to not have any Hollywood A-list stars in the film at all, although this was probably more because of a small budget rather than any artistic concern. Cillian Murphy is an excellent protagonist, combining a certain naïvete with a decisiveness you don't normally expect after seeing the character's other qualities. He is a more believable version of the characters that populate films like Resident Evil, to put it bluntly. Indeed, it is caring what happens to this guy next that keeps the audience watching.<br/><br/>It is when we meet the soldiers that things start going downhill. Up to this point, regardless of what one might think of the central characters, they all had redeeming qualities that made them seem like human beings rather than pieces in a game of plot chess. The soldiers, on the other hand, have no such qualities. They are as interesting as a bag of hammers, and generally about as intelligent.<br/><br/>You will note that I haven't said anything about the fast-moving zombies. I think the writer deserves kudos for getting around that problem by making the story about an outbreak with traceable biological causes, as opposed to the usual mysterious causes for zombie outbreaks. The normally incongruous moments when the zombies are running faster than the living are deftly explained away by this setup, something that would have made the Dawn Of The Dead remake work substantially better if they'd even tried it.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave 28 Days Later a six out of ten. It has enough intriguing concepts or foundation to keep the viewer interested for the first viewing, but it doesn't have the legs to keep up a lasting viewing experience. The writer and director sum it up brilliantly when they talk about how they set up a whole heap of rules for their story, then ignored them at will."

","Got this movie on a recommendation that it was ""My favorite movie of all time""........ Impressed with the start and it reminded me of a 70/80's series i think called survivor....The London scenes worked well and i for a time thought i might be in for a chiller about what you would do if a handful of people were left.... The music gave the clue that all was not well and what was promising fell apart when they contacted the Army north of Manchester...In the face of attacks by the infected would an army unit act in such a way...i don't think they would...add an unresolved ending and it was a mess. As a zombie movie fine..but after such a good start a waste of a subject that hasn't been taken to a conclusion of what you would do if you were left alone...that would be more spooky."
"vaudevillejones","Null","4","6","11 July 2004"," Frightening Britflick that plays with all expectations.
","This is definitely a film where you have to think. This is a drawback if you're expecting a brainless zombie flick, as many of the reviewers on here clearly were. In response to some of the questions people have posed in previous reviews: - London is empty because it has been evacuated, save for those who have come under siege from the Infected. There are no cars about because frankly, if nobody was coming into work, seeing the sights or going clubbing, there would be nobody in Central London (hardly anyone actually lives around Westminster these days). - Why do the zombies only come out at night? Well, they don't (see Mailer). They prefer the night because they can catch people more easily. - Why the jet fighter? It might not have come from Britain. There are British soldiers elsewhere in the world. Anyway, the movie itself. This is one of the finest examples of the post-apocalyptic genre I have ever seen. The writer, Alex Garland, is not a sci-fi man, and this works in the film's favour. Like 'Night of the Living Dead', there's relatively little gore and the focus is on the actual people. Garland and Boyle give us a world of real people, with their good and bad qualities (SPOILER: An outstanding example of this is Jim's sadistic rampage towards the end). You really care for the characters and, thanks to the death of one sympathetic character early on, you really fear for them. The film plays with your expectations throughout (SPOILERS COMING). The animal rights protestors break into a research complex with good intentions and cause the outbreak. Our heroes make it to the safety of the military complex only to discover that the soldiers are basically planning to rape Selina and Hannah and execute anyone who stands in their way. The Infected help our heroes to escape. The world has apparently ended, but then Jim sees a jet fighter that suggests Britain is alone. To those who believe the ending of the film to be overly sweet, let's not forget that so far nothing has been as it seems- the airforce might be planning to come round and gun them down as a disease hazard. And then there's the images that will have particular resonance to anyone living in Britain- London deserted, the M1 motorway traffic-free and blockaded, Manchester burning. The images are both recognisable and unrecognisable. The camerawork and lighting gives the film a feel that is closer to 'Trainspotting' (another Boyle film) than 'Dawn of the Dead', which is more effective than any big-budget sci-fi blockbuster in conveying the chilling nature of the crisis. If you want lots of gore, put a camera in a bucket of blood for two hours. This film is more than a dumb slasher flick. There are three problems with the film (aside from nitpicks). Firstly, I find it difficult to believe that any disease could be so effective in 10-20 seconds. Secondly, some of the dialogue feels a bit clunky, relying too much on speeches to explain events. Thirdly, the image of Manchester burning is only there for a couple of seconds at the top of the screen, which feels like a cop-out after the bombshell of deserted London. Overall, I'd agree that this is a thinking person's horror movie. 9/10, with a point only deducted for the above points."
"xredsunrisesx","10","4","6","24 February 2004"," Fantastic New Horror Film from Director Danny Boyle, the new Zombie standard
","Let me first say that  28 Days Later  is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. From the director of Trainspotting, The Beach and Shallow Grave Danny Boyle delivers an edge of your seat Horror movie that will have you leaving the lights on at night and checking the locks on your doors.  The Film is grainy, fast paced and has a  powerful soundtrack  which adds to the very chaotic feel to the movie. This is not a typical `Zombie' movie, the `Infected' in the film are quick, smart and unrelenting this is a nice change from other slow paced sometimes non climatic zombie films such as the classics: Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The Dead and other films of this genre. Not to say these movies are not up to Zombie par but the heart pumping vision of Danny Boyle's film will make you short of breath rather than fighting to stay awake.<br/><br/> All around great acting especially from new comer Cillian Murphy who portrays the lead character `Jim'. From start to finish this character is never really resting running from one scenario to another . Meeting up with interesting characters along the way the small yet effective cast makes it a compelling story.<br/><br/>Although the general `last man on earth' concept has been done I believe this film still makes it unique and never boring. So if you're a Horror\Thriller fan and have a strong stomach for some well placed gore than I would strongly suggest giving 28 Days Later a test run, for true Zombie movie fans I think you'll find this a nice twist."
"Snake-666","8","4","6","7 June 2003"," Fine British horror!
","Coming from England I have been very excited about the recent resurgence in British horror to hit the market. Dog Soldiers' was easily my favourite movie of last year and recently I got the chance to watch Britain's other main horror from 2002  28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Some people have been calling this a rip-off of Resident Evil' but those people should know that the script for 28 Days Later' was written before Resident Evil' and therefore any similarities are purely coincidental. That's not to say that '28 Days Later' hasn't taken influences from elsewhere, some of the scenes are reminiscent of horror classics such as Day of the Dead'.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie we see a group of animal rights activists break into an animal research laboratory to release some monkeys. During the break in a laboratory worker catches them in the act but the activists prevent him from doing anything about the break in. The laboratory worker pleads with the activists to stop and informs them that all the monkeys are infected with `rage'. They don't listen and free a monkey anyway, to their misfortune. 28 days later Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from the hospital bed he has been in for the past month or so and realises that something is very wrong, the city of London is completely deserted. After wandering around he discovers `the infected' as well as a few survivors. With only a handful of survivors the days of the human race look numbered, is there any hope for survival?<br/><br/>What we have here is a very well written and thought provoking horror movie with some rather deep and meaningful subtexts. The movie is not as straight forward as what it seems at first, there are points made in the movie about society as a whole which require some thought about before they can be fully understood and appreciated. These sentiments are much like those found in Cannibal Holocaust' but not against a morally-corrupt backdrop like CH so therefore they have more meaning and purpose to them.<br/><br/>There is some good acting in the film too, particularly from the young Megan Burns who plays her character, Hannah, as if she were an experienced young actress. Hannah invokes feelings of sympathy in the viewer because of all the hell she's been through; after all she's just a child. Her performance is powerful and realistic and should be given the credit it deserves. Cillian Murphy is also good as Jim, though one must question whether the dialogue written for him was realistic; there are certain scenes where it becomes hard to suspend your disbelief. Viewers are also treated to some quality direction from Danny Boyle of 'Trainspotting' fame.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I feel that the second part of the film became its downfall. The plot suddenly seemed to shift away from the original subject matter and changed into more of a story about humanity's own self-destructive nature. While I agree that some of the issues tackled in the second half were exciting, intriguing and thought provoking I feel that they should not have made such dramatic changes in the storyline.<br/><br/>One thing that works brilliantly for the story though is the virtual lack of character development. Normally I feel that a good movie should include a lot of information about the characters history yet here it doesn't. We know hardly anything about the characters that we are watching. How does that improve the film? Because the virtual destruction of humanity is being portrayed and those people who have survived don't have the time to get to know each other as they must concentrate on what is going on around them. The short bits of character history that are released into the film are all of interest to the viewer and keep the isolated and desperate feel of the film going. By not knowing who these people are we are placing blind trust in their arms. Before the outbreak of the virus they could have been serial killers, burglars, car thieves or some sort of general social scum, all of which is irrelevant now as they must join forces or they are finished. This point is similar in ways to the points made in the original Night of the Living Dead' about joining together to work for a common goal.<br/><br/>Less the slight inconsistencies and minor deterioration of the second half we are still left with a very good, thought provoking movie that is definitely worth watching. Fans of the horror genre should enjoy this and also fans of Dog Soldiers' as both movies create a similar atmosphere. My rating for '28 Days Later'  7.5/10"

","*** MINOR SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>This movie _could_ have been much better than it actually turned out to be. A story by acclaimed novelist Alex Garland, set in a postapocalyptic (disease) Britain, good cast and a successful director.<br/><br/>However, though the result is by no means a poor movie, 28 Days Later has a script that is way too flawed to not be irritated by. Watching this with a friend, we were continuously remarking ""Why on earth are they doing that"" and ""why don't they just do something obvious. It also made me wonder why the writer nor director nor even actors had noticed the same things. Or if they had, why they chose not to make any changes. Also, the whole soldier-would-be-rapists crew thing is just not believable. This movie had the potential to say something about human reaction and conduct in such a situation, but wasted it with that whole plot twist.<br/><br/>In the end, if you like postapocalyptic stories, and can look the other way on all the annoyingly stupid moves by many of the characters and generally implausible turn of events, you should find this movie entertaining."

The scenes in London were good where it was totally deserted (apparently the scenes been shot in British Summer time in the early hours of morning) and the main character stumbled round trying to make sense of what had happened. <br/><br/>But what doesn't bode well with me is the idea that of these few people alive, they don't feel almost ready to die, been the last people walking around and with no one and nothing to live for apart from each other. There is no moments of hysterical 'What do we have to live for?' really.<br/><br/>By the time they got to the military part my eyes had begun to grow tired and was no longer concentrating on the film.

You get infected through a bite or absorption through breaks in your skin of blood/fluid from the berserkers...so the quick fall of London can be accepted. Thing is, the berserkers are not zombies because I did not see them consume the flesh of their victims. And they're not invulnerable...a well place baseball bat, hatchet, or bullet can do them in. So it confused me that after the first 2 weeks of mayhem, the British military or UN would have caught on, quarantined London, and then send in troops in bio-hazard suits complete with tanks, flamethrowers, etc. to mop up the berserkers. In other words, a tighter time-line, a tighter script.<br/><br/>Now mind you, having a red eyed, banshee screaming nut job coming at you full tilt is a refreshing change from the usual shuffling zombie gig, and the grisly reality of what to do with a bitten companion before they turn berserker gets you on the edge of your seat...but this film just lacked the claustrophobic atmosphere of any decent ""zombie"" flick ..... the interpersonal reactions between various characters just didn't hold my interest, and the obvious ""villainous turn"" by some of the survivors was too obvious to surprise me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: hype sold this film, but hype won't keep your interest in it."

","Wow, here's a real surprise...yet another film nowadays is nothing compared to the hype. ""Scariest film since ""The Exorcist?"" Listen people, here's the truth. ""28 Days Later"" is NOT scary in any way, shape or form. Not a bit whatsoever.<br/><br/>The film is a huge letdown. It's a poor excuse for a zombie movie, ""end of the world"" movie, and all the other kinds of films it unsuccessfully apes. Now, you don't have to be original to make a good film. Even ""Star Wars"" has plenty of influences and many direct steals, as Lucas always freely admitted. So seeing ""28 Days Later"" rip off so many films is not the problem, it's just that it does it so poorly.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film isn't ""amazing"" or anything special. It's a typically mainstream horror film beginning of a lame movie, that's all. From then on, the film drags and drags, until the last half hour, where a few interesting things actually begin to happen. Until then, it's a sleep-enducer.<br/><br/>No, it isn't ""deep"" and it isn't ""profound."" it isn't ""intellectual"" and it isn't over anyone's head. It's simply dull.<br/><br/>The script is horrible with countless holes and lapses of sense, and the actual filming and editing leaves a lot to be desired. Another reviewer pointed out that you really can't get scared because the editing is so poorly done when the zombies are around, you just simply don't get scared.<br/><br/>Even a scene that started out decently, the tire-changing scene, turns into crap because when the zombies come around, the editing starts doing all the ""MTV video-style"" garbage. There's a real lot of that throughout the entire film. It doesn't add 'realism"" or make anyone scared. All it does is make the film look worse than it already is.<br/><br/>There is one brief scene which is halfway decent, the ""mirror"" scene, and even that isn't scary at all, just a little suspenseful. But to be fair, a decent minute out of the film.<br/><br/>It's not a matter of ""getting it"" or any crap like that. Plenty of films have done all the same things much, much better that ""28 Days Later"" strains so hard to do, and more profoundly even, if that's what you are looking for. ""28 Days Later"" is just simply a bad film that strains and tries WAAAY too hard.<br/><br/>Really, this movie is just another reason why films on the whole are turning into garbage. The nicest thing I can say about this slop is that it is better than ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which was the biggest scam in movie history. (The scam being the cleverness in getting people in the theater to see that complete mess of a ""movie."" Can't anyone make a decent horror film anymore??"

In an earlier scene she didn't hesitate two seconds to totally chop up a comrade when he had a cut on his arm. Another part that was retarded is he let loose the chained up mindless mutant in the compound. I guess he knew that it would kill everyone except the two females. Don't know how he knew that one since the mutants kill everything in sight but kudos anyway. Overall the movie had potential but they obviously went the wrong way and I guess the leading guy likes showing off his butt since you see it in three different parts of the movie.

","28 Days is really a strange movie. Its good though and it has some good acting from its actors including Brendan Gleeson, Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, and Christopher Eccleston. The film has some good music and fits the film well. Whenever the infected people or zombies attack is really amazing. They come running fast like mad men shown with awesome Gladiator type camera shots. Whenever the killers are on screen get ready for a tasty horror feast! There is one scene in the film near the end that I haven't seen to many of and the other one that comes to mind is in Marked for Death starring Steven Seagal. Speaking of the end, The VHS version has an alternate ending after the end credits. 28 Days is good film and its quite different to watch and isn't too gory but isn't without it either so for horror and zombie fans, I strongly recommend this film!"

"brchthethird","5","3","5","5 May 2016"," ""Documentary realism"" take on the zombie genre which is a little boring
","The zombie genre, honestly, is an overpopulated one. What, with THE WALKING DEAD and numerous recent attempts to cash in on the craze, it's a little hard to separate oneself from the crowd when in the shadow of what George Romero already did. 28 DAYS LATER came at the early end of this recent uptick in zombie films and does manage to differentiate itself, mainly through a straightforward, ""realistic"" take that recasts zombies as humans infected with a virus. The only problem I found with this approach is that it robs the material of much potential for social commentary. I also found the choice to film on digital video a rather irritating one, giving the film a gritty, but cheap, look. At times, even the dialogue was difficult to make out. I also had took issue with the pacing, as roughly the first half of the film could have been streamlined a little bit in order to get Cillian Murphy's character from the hospital where we find him, to the family meets, and finally to the military base where second half takes place. Quite frankly, the film is kind of boring until he meets other survivors. For me, the second half is where the real meat of the film lies, and you get to see how in the event of a massive traumatic event, humanity reverts to brute (and uncouth) methods of survival. Here, Christopher Eccleston as the base commander, delivers what I think is the best performance of the film. The other cast members do fine, but there was little to latch onto as far as character development was concerned. As for the horror elements, I thought action and gore were well-handled, but the frame-dropping or speed-ramping was a little bit annoying. There was also some tricky editing going on to make things seem more intense than they really were. Some people might like that, but I typically don't. Ultimately, I ended up with about half of a good movie. It's not terrible, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the results either."

"christophe92300","6","3","5","26 February 2013"," Almost felt like two different movies
","28 Days Later is clearly composed of two distinctive parts. The first part deals, in a very dynamic and effective way, of the survival itself after the catastrophe, and one gets easily carried away by the journey of the group. Then, as soon as they get to the military ""base"", the scenario takes a turn, the rhythm, the tension drop, and the atmosphere of the movie shifts completely, not necessarily in a good way, with this storyline of a chaotic society capable of the worst atrocities.<br/><br/>While the first part seems rather better than the second, the brutal transition between the two is what stands out, so much that it seems like two different movies. The outcome also turns out to be a bit abrupt and would have deserved a lit more thinking and a better integration with the rest of the plot. It is a shame because there certainly was a more subtle way of associating these elements to create a more logical, fluid and homogeneous movie.<br/><br/>Finally, it should be noted that this feature was shot using DV cameras (except for the last few minutes at the cottage) which explains the roughness of the image and its lack of detail."
"macky_topsecret","5","3","5","16 November 2005"," I'm disappointed
","Me and my sisters were kind of excited about 28 Days Later when we first saw its trailer. We thought that finally, there's a movie about zombies and biological epidemics that actually made sense. But we were highly disappointed when we finally saw its content.<br/><br/>There are a lot of unexplained actions in scenes scattered throughout the movie. First let's get to the cause : a virus called ""rage"" which causes the infected to be well...enraged. But that's it, the infected are enraged, period. No more explanations (not even a scientific one), but in my opinion it's kind of senseless, a virus transmitted by blood, causes the infected to be enraged, it seems more likely that this concept be adapted to a psychological thriller movie. And transmission ""takes about 10-20 seconds""-according to the character of Selena, I don't think that a virus could blend with the blood in a very short span of time as that. The origin itself is very questionable, how could an ape in captivity forced to watch violent scenes from TVs harbor a virus transmitted by blood??? It seems quite impossible to me. The infected vomiting a mass of blood seems also baseless.<br/><br/>The story is very short for me, not to mention that most of the scenes are not connected to each other. When Jim, Selena and Hannah found their way to a group of soldiers who promised a cure, Jim finds out that these soldiers only wanted women to have sex with, because they're stressed out with the situation. I mean, that's one big leap from the big problem of infection. And I think that the word ""infection"" is inappropriate an overused.<br/><br/>Not to mention that there are a lot of goofs in the movie. It shouldn't be called a zombie movie, you can't call them that because the infected are alive, a zombie is dead-turned-alive. And how the streets are empty, wouldn't it be more believable if there was at least one dead body outside? But what puzzles me most is how the whole city lost electricity, water and radio signals, for these to be available, machines are used so that people don't have to manually work these out. So how could electricity, water and radio signals disappear with the people? Or in the beginning of the movie, how could a group of activists penetrate a facility of that nature? And why is it left without any security? Or why when they stopped in the grocery, from the outside it could be seen to be in complete darkness, but when they get inside, the whole place is bright because all the lights are on, when there wasn't supposed to be any electricity. Or the scene where Selena was giving Hannah pills saying ""I'm making you not get it"" not get what? Definitely not the infection because apparently there's no cure. Hannah didn't take it because the soldier came in before she got the chance to put it in her mouth, but she behaves like a drugged person after, but then she sobers up when she sees her family picture.<br/><br/>I think what caused the disappointment for me is the lack of explanation and reason. There was no explanation behind the origin and activity of the virus. There was no understanding of anything at the end of the movie. It's more like another excuse to see gore, or to blow up a building (a gasoline station in this movie) or to enter a grocery store and take everything you want without paying.<br/><br/>But I do praise Cillian Murphy's acting abilities. And also that who played the soldier's leader (I forgot the name) and Selena - she played her part of a sexy, attractive, tough female with angst very nicely. Though I think that Megan Burns(Hannah) got a little more credit for her small part."

I really liked the characters. The girl is a good actor. The other actors are also very good. It's a zombie movie for the 21st century. It is also a great fantasy movie with very interesting spiritual twists, and not only violence. The scene where he walks around in London reminded me of my own day in London where I was all alone, and only managed to walk a little around the bridges.

And all that death in a city the size of London would likely stink fifty miles away, from masses of rotting food, etc., as well as the dead. Clearly the reason for these omissions was to prolong the character's state of confusion. (And to pay a bit of homage to ""The Omega Man"") And it is never explained why the infected do not attack one another. And there was something weird about the photography that was quite irritating.

Filmmaker Danny Boyle plumbs the dank, spooky depths of an Apocalyptic thriller cum zombie horror film and delivers the goods with dark élan in this smart, sharply drawn cautionary (and so timely) parable about a lethal virus unleashed on London wiping out the general populace except for a young man (Murphy) who awakens from a coma after a month and realizing he is one of the few human sole survivors while rapidly moving, red-eyed bloodthirsty victims run rampant. Among the people he meets and teams up with to find a way out of the hell on earth is tough yet vulnerable Harris, father and daughter Gleeson and Burns and an unlikely savior in the form of a military officer (Eccleston). A hybrid of a George A. Romero genre thriller via Kubrickian morality tale with a turgid taste of black humor mix into a highly intoxicating cocktail of lurid emotionally fused melodrama. Excellent cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle gives the film a truly otherworldly look. A rare treat: horror movie and social fable intertwined."

"paulg-67221","8","2","3","15 July 2015"," 7.5 is a fair score
","I feel that 7.5 is a fair score for this film (at the time of writing the score is currently 7.6).<br/><br/>The story is simple: Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma to find London abandoned and to discover that a blood-borne infection has spread throughout the United Kingdom. <br/><br/>It is widely known that Danny Boyle had used standard definition digital cameras to film this. Although this means that the film is perhaps not worth getting on blu-ray (I have only seen this film on DVD so I cannot judge blu-ray quality), I like the look of it. I feel the look fits the film perfectly while giving it an interesting aesthetic. <br/><br/>On a personal note, I feel the opening explanation of animal activists releasing rage- infected monkeys was not needed. I personally felt the film was more of a survivor story and do not believe the explanation was needed. This is personal preference and does not affect the overall quality of the film.<br/><br/>I feel the film loses quality for two things: the girl's (Hannah) acting and the ending. It is widely known that child actors are usually bad but when objectively reviewing this film, her emotionless delivery of lines impacts the film such as the scene of her father's (Frank) death. That scene was one of the best moments of the film, the music was well used and Brendan Gleason's acting skills are very good. However, the moment when she says ""Dad"" took me out of the moment due to being poorly delivered when she should have been highly emotional after losing a father.<br/><br/>The ending was out of place. Not only was it obviously shot on film so it was visually out of place but the scene's tone does not match the rest of the film. In it Hannah, Selena and Jim are shown at a cottage where they try to signal a plane to rescue them. The original ending showed Jim dying after being shot and Hannah and Selena leaving to survive on their own. I don't hate happy endings but in the case of this film I thought the original ending was much better, even Danny Boyle believed this to be the superior ending. <br/><br/>Despite this, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and watch it often. The concept is good, I like the aesthetic, the music is excellent and it succeeded at making me care for the characters (something very few horrors do). I highly recommend this film."

It still doesn't quite rise to being a great movie, through a combination of not really exploring the many political and social themes it hints at (George Romero takes that further), and pushing its internal logic pretty far at times. But it's always entertaining, has a lot of genuine suspense, and isn't over- reliant on easy scares and shocks.

","28 days later has cannibalistic people infected by a virus spreading through bites, who mindlessly chases the few uninfected people for their flesh. Seen this before? You are bound to have. With the increasing popularity of the zombie genre, it can often feel like you've watched a zombie flick before it has barely begun. However, for this very reason, a lot of the more recent zombie movies try to add something unique to their movie to make it stand out of the crowd. For this particular movie, the repeated use of hope as a factor that keeps the characters fighting on, has worked out really well. The movie also adds an additional danger, just as the characters starts to feel safe from the infected, to make sure the viewers stays at the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>Why should you watch this movie?<br/><br/>Well the characters are very all very well done, and in spite of the relatively low budget this movie had, the characters are very believable. Cillian Murphy does a great job as Jim, the main character, who goes through the process of being completely unaware of what has happened around him, to becoming a strong yet vengeful man.

","Danny Boyle's film 28 days later is about an infection that spreads across the nation, all starting from people rescuing chimpanzees from being tested in labs, from that, the infections unravels into being a few people to eventually almost everyone infected. I found the film enjoyable with more twist and turns then I was expecting. What lacked in the film for me was strong visuals and film work, I understood the filming techniques that were done and why for example the reputation of speed up zombies when they came into the scenes, where to add fear and tension but It really didn't work. Along with the zombies I found there was no shots in the film that left me thinking that looks great or that's so well done. Luckily I found the storyline interesting and kept me on edge a lot of time. Even though Im not the biggest zombie fan ( apart from Walking Dead ) I did like this film, I think it could of been a lot better with better shots but overall it was a decent film. I give it 7."
"Leofwine_draca","7","2","3","20 January 2013"," Boyle's best by far
","Despite the clichés, this is a fairly effective and gripping thriller from TRAINSPOTTING's Danny Boyle, an edgy film with enough ambiance and shocks to make it worthwhile. Although working on a noticeable low budget (the scene with the car driving past those superimposed air turbines is laughable), Boyle creates an authentic and gritty post-apocalyptic vision which follows through with the shocks in many places that Hollywood wouldn't dare. The opening sequence, in which Cillian Murphy's sole survivor aimlessly wanders through an evacuated London, is especially noteworthy and one of the eeriest moments in a film I've seen in a long time. Although we all know that Boyle achieved his aim by filming early and closing off areas of the city, it works perfectly and nicely sets up the following events which take place in darker, cheaper sets and locations. Shooting on digital video gives the film an added edge of gritty realism especially during the in-your-face zombie attacks.<br/><br/>I say zombie because this film is, by all accounts, a straightforward zombie film. The survivors may still be alive but any thought processes are dead and they still attack as ferociously as any of Romero's creations. Boyle gives us some very dark and graphic violence in such attacks, full of sickening spraying blood and chopped limbs shown in quick disturbing flashes. For once the camera doesn't cut away and we're left feeling pretty queasy about it all. But things get worse before they get better, with a climax involving gouged eyes and even worse things happening. One of the problems that this film has is that its extremely bleak and heavy going (at least until the tacked-on ending) and thus may well be off-putting to many viewers who can't stand the too-realistic narrative, which has no time for Hollywood sentimentality.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from the solid to the less than impressive, the latter in the case of Megan Burns as the young Hannah. Young child actors are always unwise decisions in adult-orientated films such as this and Burns doesn't quite gel in her role as the unlucky youth. On the other hand, there are some nicely dependable supporting performances, including Naomie Harris as the self-sufficient ex-chemist now turned survivalist, who has brutal ways of dealing with the infected. Brendan Gleeson steals the film with his performance as the warm-hearted father but unfortunately he gets all too little screen time. I have mixed feelings about Cillian Murphy, the relative Irish newcomer who takes the lead. His performance is definitely spot on in places but not at all charismatic, therefore we are unable to identify with him throughout the movie and especially during the gruesome climax.<br/><br/>The latter half of the film turns into an open reworking of Romero's classic DAY OF THE DEAD, complete with a chained-up zombie a la Bub and an isolated bunch of soldiers led by a madman – this time played by Christopher Eccleston, giving some gravitas to the proceedings. Although the playout is fairly predictable, there are plenty of scary things going on in the climatic thunderstorm, making for uncomfortable viewing and a fair few jump-in-your-seat shocks for nervous audience goers. As the film generally works as a whole (despite the abundance of ups and downs) I consider it to be a success, although as I mentioned before definitely not to everybody's taste."
"axlrhodes","7","2","3","14 August 2012"," 10 years later...
","Ten years later and Danny Boyle's lo-fi post apocalyptic horror plays as a mixed bag of success' and failures. Filmed on digital video cameras, the film has a raw quality that compliments the visceral tone stated strongly from the offset. Almost creating a zombie sub-genre of it's own, '28 Days' tips it's cap to George Romero (a shopping scene) and most strikingly, Day Of The Triffids. It's simple stuff, a virus breaks out that's transmitted via blood and saliva which causes it's hosts to become blood curdling zombies on speed. We see the world through the eyes of Jim (Cillian Muprhy) who after having recently woken from a coma, stumbles across an iconic London landscape bereft of human life. If there's a money shot, then this is it. It's a haunting sight that sets the film off with some strikingly memorable imagery. Like any film akin to the zombie genre, what follows is a tale of survival against everything and everyone. 28 Days is at it's best when exploring the world left behind but sadly falls short on character development. Brendan Gleeson's warmth is a welcome and likable addition, but Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy aren't able to muster much, while Megan Burns playing the teen child of the group is career-endingly awful. What's most disappointing is the third act which starts promisingly but becomes all too formulaic and feels rushed and tacked on.

","It was genuinely a great movie! I was surprised several times in this film, and I thought I had seen every zombie movie ever made! First off was the believable introduction. Like HIV, the Rage virus came from monkeys. Who wouldn't believe some scientist somewhere had a psychotic virus, and I'm sure those radical save-the-animalists would be the first to die from it! The second part that threw me was the church of zombies! I thought, ""oh, he just kicked the bees' hive, didn't he?"" Third was how the dad got turned into one! Just a drop of blood! I never saw that coming! I knew he was getting turned, but I was expecting one to just jump out and bite him, not just a measly drop of blood! Lastly, what I thought was the best part,the most evil creatures in this movie weren't actually the zombies but the soldiers! Overall, I have to say this is the best of the genre! A must see for any zombie fan!"
"gigan-92","10","2","3","4 July 2011"," Pinnacle of Horror
","Director Danny Boyle's creation is one of true genius. He's done what so few horror films have ever done, cementing the characters in the audience's hearts. The movie is not so much a zombie-flick but more of a drama infused with horror while telling a tale of the all-too real fall of man. Cillian Murphy was awesome, along with Naomie Harris and really the whole small cast is just overwhelmingly great. The characters are built up enough to feel a cringe in your heart when their in peril, and yes, this film will nauseate you with it's not just its gore but its horrifying look at humanity. It's not only a survival story, but one that questions mankind's place in this world.<br/><br/>Not to mention John Murphy's score is absolutely stunning. It literally gives one chills, encompassing fear, pain and over all savagery. The film's moments of silence are even more unrelenting in their magnificence and quiet terror. It really stands out as a different type of horror that some main stream audiences may not like because it actually has plot, which is turn off to most popcorn movie goers. However I can't stress enough that this movie is definitely worth seeing and I will amaze you."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","3","17 July 2010"," The world can end in a heartbeat
","This is intense right off the bat. We are quickly given the backstory, and then we wake up in abandoned, post-apocalyptic UK. The atmosphere and tension grow as we realize what the situation is. While the third act is unexpected and different from(not worse than, mind you) the first two, this is excellent throughout. It is a long trip down a dark tunnel with the occasional crack that lets in a little light, without removing the fear that you won't make it out. This focuses on a small group of characters, and uses that well, developing them and the relationships between them, letting us connect to them. The acting is great; Murphy throws himself at this and explores a wide range of emotional states. This doesn't overstimulate the viewer, but it does come pretty close, as it is rather bleak. The pace is even, and this isn't moves smoothly. Not always fast(well, the story does), but there is a constant real sense of threat and danger. This is one of the three times Garland and Boyle work together(The Beach and Sunshine), and they compliment each other well each time. The energetic visual style of Danny has your eyes glued to the screen, and this, shot on DV(for a grainy, ""authentic"" picture quality... except for a flashback, that they used Super 8 for... brilliant) puts you right in the situations with hand-held and dynamic cinematography(and the Infected are filmed in a specific manner, rendering them far creepier). This was on a budget, and they faced their limitations, not taking on anything they couldn't accomplish. If you don't know, you can't really tell that this was looking like they might not have enough money to complete it. The music tends to fit the mood where it is used. There is a little humor, and the dialog is natural and well-written. This is psychologically accurate. As this kind of movie ought to, this brings up some philosophical ideas and isn't just about ""boy, don't you hope these people live"". It was smart of them to choose vira as the source, as those are scary today, and the concept here is a mental, not physical, change. They applied a lot of research about people in extremis. Is this a zombie flick? Depends on how strict your definition of that is. It's changed(have you seen one from before Romero began his trilogy?) before. You could call it a reinterpretation of them, or action/survival horror. There is a lot of disturbing content, a bit of blood and violence(little gore or brutality to it, and it mostly isn't as direct as is often the case today), a moderate amount of strong language in this and brief male nudity including full frontal. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 8/10"

","Twenty-eight days after a powerful virus known as 'rage' escapes from an animal experimentation lab, injured cycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma to discover that, while he has been asleep, the country has been overwhelmed by the infected, who are crazed, bloodthirsty, and surprisingly fleet of foot.<br/><br/>Although I'm not the biggest fan of Danny Boyle's oeuvre as a whole, I do love me a good zombie film, and 28 Days Later is one of the finest examples that the genre has to offer (OK, I know that they are not technically zombies, but as poet James Whitcomb Riley once wrote, ""when I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck).<br/><br/>Not only does the film offer intense horror by the bucket-load, but it also manages to deliver heart-rending pathos, dark comedy and nail-biting action, thanks to a raft of central characters you actually give a damn about, a gripping script from Alex Garland that wisely keeps matters within the realms of believability, and Boyle's stylish direction that combines stunning cinematography (considering the digital format on which it was shot) with frantic, hand-held footage of the type that often sends me into fits of rage myself, but which works brilliantly in this instance. Also adding immensely to the overall atmosphere is the excellent original music by John Murphy, which works particularly well in the early scene in which Jim wanders the deserted streets of London, the score building to a crescendo as he gradually comes to understand his predicament.<br/><br/>I know it's highly unlikely, now that Boyle has snagged himself Academy Award for Best Director, but I reckon the guy should tackle more horror (but NOT sci-fi/horror: Sunshine sucked!)."

"johnnyboyz","9","2","3","3 December 2009"," Shocks; scares; an excellent attitude to horror as a genre and some excellent character observations render 28 Days Later one of the greats.
","The streets are empty; the nation is crumbling, with cities either deserted or on fire; whatever event that has rendered the enemies of the film of the uncanny variety has been unleashed; only a small band of human survivors remain and nobody seems to have much of a plan. So arrived in cinemas back in 2002 a relatively familiar premise for a horror film, to be shot on digital video and staring a ragtag bunch of unfamiliar acting talent attempting to get across the raw fear and sensations of finding oneself in this predicament. The film was helmed by Englishman Danny Boyle; who was getting back to scuzzy, low level based pictures much in the vein of his earlier feature Trainspotting, this following the bleached out and visually alluring 2000 effort The Beach. It's to everyone's great credit that 28 Days Later holds up as one of my favourite horror films, and one of my favourite overall films of the decade.<br/><br/>With a 2007 sequel following it; a cast of actors who have since gone on to bigger and richer things as well as a director who has consequently churned out equally nourishing film-going experiences in Sunshine and Slumdog Millionaire, revisiting 28 Days Later after however long it's been is strangely humbling. Set on the ""diseased, decaying island"", as one character calls it, that is Britain; 28 Days Later gets across scares; knows when to provide the sequences of gore; is able to provide an adequate number of suspenseful set-pieces; knows how to pace and where to place its scenes of terror and realisation of the overall situation while its instances of comedy and attention to character are equally seamlessly woven in.<br/><br/>The film carries a very broad, quite epic feel to it. While similar in genre and premise, the film is the polar opposite to something like 2002's Resident Evil, or that respective film's first sequel. For all the money and gimmicks thrown at the screen in those films, what with their vast and expansive underground laboratory locales; lots of attention to fight scene aesthetics; inclusion of all things scientific and 'smart' sounding; nonsense narratives that flesh out into company cover-ups and so on, 28 Days Later works ten times as better with its stripped down and simplistic sense. It's to Boyle's great credit he achieves this with limited money and a shooting format more akin to student pieces than feature films due for cinematic release are. All the film does in vacate a location; spread a few discarded props here and there and bingo: you've got something is so simple yet so effective.<br/><br/>The film begins with found footage of riots; if we go into the film with knowledge of the premise, we might feel a little underwhelmed at the use of such footage to 'act' as a representation that the 'zombies' are taking over and that the world is falling apart. But no, these are VT's being pumped into the minds of chimps as a new 'rage' virus is tested in a science lab somewhere in England. Animal activists, however, have different ideas and when an infected chimp gets out – all Hell breaks loose. When we first see Irish protagonist Jim (Murphy), he is lying stark naked on a hospital bed, all by himself, with wires and tubes coming out of him from every which way. Jim's progression from vulnerable and somewhat pathetic looking individual; to hospital cloak-clad scavenger; to naive 'infected' thwarter; to someone who gets a grip on the situation, is developed flawlessly by Boyle in the opening half an hour or so. Jim's initial contact with an 'infected' sees him take an instinctive swipe at it – it's an instinctive trait that'll see him survive to the best of his ability. The study of Jim and his progression into a bigger and more brutal character is one of the film's many sequences of well observed substantial passages linked to character.<br/><br/>28 Days Later knows how to stop and it knows how to slow down in order give its characters room to breath and time to absorb their situation. Rather than opt for Resident Evil's kinetic energy, during which no one in the audience ever really feels as if any of the characters are in any danger of any kind, the film is driven by characters and their decisions. One is a male Irish lead and the other is his black, of Carribbean descent, female equal. She is Selena (Harris), a tough; hard-bodied; machete wielding foil to Jim whom saves his life twice and is begged a third time on a flight of stairs to do so again. We don't figure Selena to have been like this prior to the apocalypse, so a great deal has already happened to get her to this point. She is only ever really 'put in her place' when encountering figures whom represent the anti-thesis of feminism; that is to say, archetypes who want her to serve as someone that is useful for merely cooking and reproducing, as the re-population of Britain begins again from a disturbingly primitive starting point.<br/><br/>Regarding these types, those that drive the final third, their presence meekly calls to mind that somewhat interesting theory which I'm told inhabited James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens; that of the monsters being of one 'sort' of evil whereas certain human-beings representing another. In 28 Days Later, those that display levels of intellect or oppositional ideologies are shunned as the aforementioned ideas of a woman's ""rightful"" role in the world are played out as well – it all builds to a frightening climax. What with all this fascinating attention to character, role and predicament; Boyle remembers its genre cinema he's dealing with here and offers a number of scares and shocks anyway, giving the film a rounded sense. The film presents us with a familiar premise, but it's executed with such punch and such freshness that results in it just coming across as superb."

"thesar-2","Null","2","3","2 November 2009"," I've had rage, but not like this before...
","Recently, I re-watched one of my favorite ""zombie movies"" ever: 2004's 'Dawn of the Dead' thinking/reviewing it as my favorite zombie movie. It may very well be, still, but '28 Days Later' was 10x better. Luckily, I can keep my statements in tack: 'Dead' was, in fact, a ""zombie"" movie, whereas 'Later' was a movie about ""the infected,"" making it oodles more realistic and scary. 'Later' started off with an awesome concept: ignorant ""Animal Lovers"" inadvertently release the ""Rage"" virus, something so brutal, it makes all other diseases (AIDS, cancer, that ""swine flu"" so-called epidemic) look like child's play. Well, wouldn't you know it, but ""28 days later"" a man awakes in an abandoned hospital and finds a new, empty world. Quickly, he's both pursued by ""the infected"" but also rescued by survivors. He must now cope with the reality that surrounds him. It's an extremely unique and original concept, even by today's standards and the acting, dialogue, grimness were all above average. I loved this movie. It's not for everyone, as it is both incredibly depressing and graphic/gory, but it's a real eye-opener on how humans really behave. With or without flesh-eating ""infected"" ruling the world. Now, the movie's not 100% perfect: there's the usual ""slow-down and have fun"" scene practically every zombie, er, sorry, ""infectious disease"" movie has, it's slow in spots and it does contain its plot holes, such as this is an extremely fast moving virus – one drop of blood/saliva will transform you into a monster in 2 seconds, yet, it seems to make it from London to NYC. After watching these infected people run and cause chaos, it's hard to imagine one sitting still on a boat or plane trip overseas. Regardless, it's 100% recommended for fans of the genre."
"happyendingrocks","7","2","3","8 August 2009"," If only this was 70 minutes long...
","Danny Boyle's apocalyptic postcard is as frustrating as it is brilliant. While the film's first two acts seem to suggest a classic in the making, the detour into redundancy climax and the limp ending derail the momentum Boyle builds throughout this often tense and truly scary visual delight. Perhaps there isn't a way to effectively pay off the superb opening salvos of 28 Days Later's set-up (I certainly can't think of one), but one can't help but wonder why Boyle chose to conclude such a thrilling and original concept with ""man is the true monster"" themes that George Romero guided to perfection decades earlier.<br/><br/>If this film is a disaster, however, it's a gorgeously realized disaster. The shots of Cillian Murphy's Jim wandering through deserted and decimated London streets are worth the film alone, and it's impossible not to marvel at how Boyle orchestrated such powerful and bleak images within a city that is always teeming with life. The digital camera work here was unparalleled at the time, and the infancy of the format lends a sense of documentary-style realism to every image that serves the plausibility of the entire scenario very well.<br/><br/>While most zombie-philes cried foul at the notion of the ""creatures"" in this film running at track-meet speeds toward their prey, this bit of criticism is the most undeserved. Firstly, there are no zombies in 28 Days Later. We are dealing with humans infected with a virus, which sort of negates all of the rules of the zombie epic. Secondly, if Boyle did somehow violate the mandates of zombie cinema (despite the fact this is not a zombie film), he certainly wasn't the first. Haven't these people seen Nightmare City? And the frenzied scene in the tunnel is one of the most exhilarating sequences in any horror film, ever, so it's hard to be too upset about Boyle's decision to think outside the lumbering box.<br/><br/>What Boyle is guilty of is taking such an incredibly well-realized concept and squandering it by diffusing every bit of tension he built along the way in the film's silly and disjointed third act. This film loses every shred of power it has when our weary survivors meet up with the military meatheads who end up being the ultimate antagonists of the film. 28 Days Later ceases being a horror film at this point and morphs into a standard revenge flick, in which we have to accept the transformation of a lowly bike messenger into a clever angel of death capable of overcoming trained military personnel armed with automatic weapons, who also somehow has the wherewithal to maneuver his way through the series of land mines and repellent safeguards we are introduced to during his visit.<br/><br/>It's also quite discomforting to learn that the impetus for these soldiers to turn from defenders of their country into Neanderthals devoid of moral fiber is something as base and animalistic as lust. It seems that even as the world around them is crumbling, the primary concern of this handful of people lucky enough to survive is getting laid. So much so that they are willing to murder innocents and disregard their humanity for a chance at some elusive nookie. Seeing them focus in on a girl who looks to be about 13 during this process adds an unsettling and sleazy undercurrent that is more than a bit uncomfortable to digest, as well. This entire subplot shifts the focus of the film so drastically it never recovers. Even the last bits of Rage-infected mayhem seem tacked on as an afterthought, and like the underlying theme, are lifted straight from Day Of The Dead.<br/><br/>Though the DVD offers three different endings to the affair, none of them bring this promising tale to a satisfying conclusion. The ""bleak"" ending seems to fit the tone of the film most effectively, but it's telling that Boyle originally opted for an upbeat and joyous finale that finds our heroes about to be rescued by what appears to be a military aircraft (because their experience with the military worked out so well before?). This scenario confuses the message even further. If man is the greatest of all evils, why are our survivors so ecstatic to find themselves delivered into the arms of a group of men the same class as those who, left to their devices, would have murdered the dissenting Jim and raped his two female counterparts? <br/><br/>So, this is definitely a film rife with flaws. But, for more than an hour, the world Boyle plunges us into is engrossing, realistic, and dramatically terrifying. The destination may be ugly, but the road getting there is full of beauty, and despite the ultimate implosion of the movie's immense promise, there are certainly enough flashes of brilliance here to recommend this film on many levels. It's just a shame that Boyle let such a near-classic slip through his fingers."
"mrspasm","8","2","3","21 July 2009"," Scary dary.
","It is a well known fact that I actually had my own draft of this movie written before Danny Boy decided to make it. It was about 5 years (or 1825 days to keep with the mood of the review) before this film was made that I had a dream. Actually a nightmare. There are some differences, and some similarities. His is set in present day, mine seemed to be set in a near future. In mine an experiment with chimps led to a deadly virus which turned humans into bloodthirsty rage fulled monsters. And these creatures had red eyes. Very similar, eh? Well, my creatures could shoot fire from their mouths, lasers from their eyes, and vomit acid. And also in mine, some of the creatures began to evolve, remember how to speak, and remember their past lives. In fact the only thing which gave them away was their eyes, so they all started to wear shades to cover the redness. There was a shock ending also, which I will not reveal. Anyway, I was surprised when I saw the trailer for this and though hey! They've nicked my idea! But obviously these are just coincidences and no-one ever read my script anyway. I thought it looked good and as I'd liked Boy's earlier effort Gravespotting I thought I'd give it a go.<br/><br/>Thebest thing is this; my dream was primarily about man's self destructive nature, and how abusing our forefathers (chimps) like many people in the world now do will only lead to chaos. Boy's film also shows this. I have seen a disturbing trend recently in movies which try to show that monkeys spread disease, that monkeys kill people, or that they are idiots. None of these are true. Monkeys are the best, most intelligent creatures on out planet and we should revere them. Sure in the future they're probably going to be our masters but that is all the more reason to love them now so that they befriend, rather than enslave us. Ha ha, only joking. That was a reference to another terrible film which portrays monkeys as evil. I want to see more films which show primates (that's the scientific term) as benevolent, harmless, peaceful, fun-loving dudes.The world would be a better place if we all monkeyed about a bit more. Spiders on the other hand are the spawn of Satan, and must be crushed on sight.<br/><br/>This film has some scareful bits, and a few excitement moments where you're not sure whether to scream or not. The bit where the monsters are chasing the fools through the tunnel and the bit where Silly-Ann Murphy is walking round London by himself. He should have just went to Harrods and McDonalds and made out like bandits. He wakes to find the world is empty, Day of The Tulips style, but eventually is chased by the creatures. He meets up with a small group of survivors who explain what's going on, and they try to travel to Glasgow where there are other survivors, and better runways to escape on a plane from. They meet evil army men, they fight with the creatures, and generally have an exciting time. It's not the best horror film I've seen, but considering how awesome horror films are these days it really needed more scary bits and killings. However, as I am usually too scared by horror movies I though this was just right.<br/><br/>Best Scene: When Murray is exploring Olde London Town and he looks into a car window- BOOM! A dead body falls by the window inside the car. Everyone jumped at that in my house!"

It has some quite intense moments and some brilliant memorable shots: the deserted streets of London in particular. The acting was quite good from a cast of relative unknowns (at the time). Special mentions must go to the evocative music and how the rain was filmed. It looked amazing and contributed strongly to the atmosphere.

","28 Days Later is a good horror thriller that is sure to please any fan of the genre. With a cast of relatively unknown actors at the time (except for Brendan Gleeson) director Danny Boyle effectively brings to life the horrific aftermath of a virus that decimates London turning the infected into smart and cunning zombie like creatures full of rage. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I wont tell you anything else other than that. 28 Days Later is much better than some other ones that have come out recently disguised as horror films. (One Missed Call, Shutter, and The Happening to name a few) The cast of unknowns including Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccelston and Megan Burns are good in their roles of characters struggling to survive the horror of a virus that has destroyed their home. Brendan Gleason is great in the small role he does have in the film. He provides some comic relief and his character eventually becomes a father figure to all of them. Gleason may not have a big part in it since (spoiler) his role is cut short abut half way through or so but he does a great job with it. Well done. The make up and effects for the infected were fantastic and it made them look absolutely terrifying up close. The music was also good adding suspense and it seemed to sync well with the tone of the movie. Overall 28 Days Later is an effective horror thriller that was much better than I thought it would be. If you're a fan of these kinds of films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too."

","Tuesday evening, 2nd of March, 2009. I'm sitting behind my desk wondering about what film I would write the review we were supposed to hand in the next day. Last week was bound to be a horrible one because all of my friends were on holidays and I had to stay home ill, so I saw more films than one sees in a lifetime. That made should have made the choice quite difficult to make, but it turned out to be rather the opposite. After a week full of good price-winning films, there was only one that really kept haunting me; 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is a zombie-flick, not my kind of film, but when I saw it was directed by the great Danny Boyle, the 'Trainspotting'-genius, and written by Alex Garland, I knew it had to be different. And it was. The beautiful but grim images of a deserted England have a strange breathtaking and even magical aura that doesn't let you go easily. The characters are really profound and they evolve during the story, and it all feels really natural, as if the actors were really experiencing the loneliness and all the hazards, unlike in many other films in this genre. I don't want to forget the actors who played the infected people, because I once saw a guy go berserk and the resemblances are astonishing. What I also specifically liked were the special effects. They were very convincing and spectacular at the same time, a good mix for a film like this one.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to everyone, and I think I'm not the only one who does so seeing the amount of prices and nominations it's got. And if you don't like action, the film really makes you think about our society and it's got fantastically beautiful images. I am a bit sceptically about the sequel though, but I intend to see it as soon as possible nevertheless, and I think you will too once you've seen this film."
"grnhair2001","9","2","3","19 February 2009"," Not a horror film, but very good
","I don't see this as a horror film. That they marketed it as one meant I never paid to see it, paid to rent it, or considered buying it. Only that I use a public library to watch films I'd never bother seeing otherwise led me to this film, and I felt cheated by the PR department for making me miss it originally. This is not a zombie film for teens. This is a grown-up film that explores an interesting idea or set of ideas.<br/><br/>In addition to being intellectually engaging, in addition to keeping me worried about the fate of our protagonists, the film was just gorgeous. There are easily two dozen shots that could be paintings in the world's great museums. I was blown away by this and did not anticipate it, so it was one of those truly pleasant surprises (the opposite of what I usually get from films, where people tell me how wonderful a film is and then I say ""ehhh, not awful."" Those pushing the film itself made me think, ""this is going to be junk,"" and it was far from that.<br/><br/>I have to wonder what they were thinking. I suppose since teens spend most money on films, marketing it in a way that attracts that spendy audience would guarantee some minimal gross. But here I am, a real lover of artistically done films about serious subjects, an educated adult over 50, and this movie was really for me. Because of the marketing, I would have never known this were it not for the accident of the library being out of anything I thought I wished to see. Admittedly, I'm no expert on film marketing, but it seemed to me they missed their real audience.<br/><br/>Also, Brendan Gleeson is in it, and I like him so much, I could probably watch him make out a grocery list for fifteen minutes on film. He does much more, of course, but his presence added to the experience for me."

An empty city, a virus running amok, people dropping like flies every other minute: a true recipe for fright in my book. But I wish people would stop referring to this movie's creatures as zombies. And now I would like to clarify something that I don't think anyone quite believes: There are no actual zombies in this movie! The virus carriers in this film aren't really dead, despite not eating or drinking anything for weeks and spewing blood by the gallon. A true zombie is a dead body that has been reanimated by any number of off-the-wall methods, while the creatures here are still alive, the unfortunate victims of a biological accident.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten that off my chest......I enjoyed this movie very much. For me, the bulk of the horror came from the realization that something like this could happen in real life. Maybe not on such a gruesome scale, but it's still inside the realm of possibility. And now I bid you all a fond farewell."
"michaeljharvey","9","2","3","18 January 2009"," Strangely enough, a stylish and beautiful zombie film
","28 Days Later is not based on a stunningly original premise. A virus breaks out, it turns people into bloodthirsty ""zombies"", and we quickly have an end-of-the-world scenario on our hands. A band of survivors must go on a dangerous road trip, hoping to find salvation. Anyone who has watched a few horror or sci-fi movies has certainly seen something similar.<br/><br/>However, what sets this movie apart is the brilliant direction of Danny Boyle and absolutely amazing cinematography and camera work. The lighting of every scene is beautifully considered. There isn't one amateurish shot that breaks the dark, somber mood of the film. The camera is almost always put at an unexpected angle or in an unusual position, making even the most mundane scene seem special. Every filming location is perfectly considered, from inner-city London to the British countryside. Even the eccentric soundtrack helps to accent this wonderfully atmospheric film.<br/><br/>The characters and plot are fairly simplistic, but they work well here. Some overarching themes of mankind's need for hope and humanity's dark nature are explored, which does help to add a little meat to the rather basic story. It's strange to say, but this is an artistic and thoughtful zombie film. Horror fans expecting the traditional cheap tactics (gore, female nudity, jump scares, etc...) should avoid at all costs. This is a stylish horror film that transcends the genre to become a modern classic."

"cchase","9","2","3","4 December 2008"," Not Your Average 'Zombie' Flick...
","Danny Boyle is a true gem: a director who gives you no idea what he's going to come up with next. Crossing over with an eerie ease from Hitchcockian thriller (SHALLOW GRAVE) to a funny, gritty, nauseatingly disturbing drama about addiction (TRAINSPOTTING), when I heard that he might be doing a 'horror' film, I couldn't wait to see the result. Actually, with the exception of the startling trailer for the movie, which gave surprisingly little away, I thought I was all ready to tackle Boyle's version of zombie culture.<br/><br/>As it turns out, I wasn't.<br/><br/>I don't remember the last time I gasped and cringed that much at a movie, much less jumped out of my seat, (which I did several times - something that happens VERY rarely these days.) Much in the way that he less channeled Hitchcock in SHALLOW GRAVE than redefined that director's paradigm of what a suspense thriller is, 28 DAYS LATER doesn't really ape the work of George Romero or Lucio Fulci. Rather it re-energizes the genre by giving us something that, technically speaking, really isn't a ""zombie"" film more than it is a 'plague' movie. Relocate Stephen King's THE STAND in present-day London, and re-populate it with British characters and you're almost close to the feel of what it is.<br/><br/>Written by Alex Garland (author of Boyle's ambitiously flawed THE BEACH), LATER'S opening takes its cues from both the Romero and Roger Corman playbooks. Three wrongheaded militant animal activists break into a science lab with the intention of freeing the animals there from the barbarity of medical experimentation. What they don't realize is that they're not only too late, but they are about to loose something upon the world that was never meant to get out...<br/><br/>And then, 28 DAYS LATER -<br/><br/>A young patient in hospital named Jim (Cillian Murphy in his first major role) awakens in his hospital bed to find himself alone. Not just in his room, but in the hospital, in the surrounding neighborhood, in the city...maybe even in the country. THE WORLD, perhaps. You are as disoriented, startled and scared as he is, and concerned FOR him as Boyle allows you to practically walk in his shoes for a bit and wonder what you would do in his place.<br/><br/>Jim goes looking for other people. And he does find them, as they also find him. But the first ones he sees moving about aren't really people anymore...<br/><br/>To say more is to spoil the industrial-strength effect this movie will have on your nerves if you haven't seen it before. All you need to know is that there are two kinds of people in this terrifying new world: the infected and the uninfected. And the line between the two groups is as fragile as a drop of blood...<br/><br/>It adds to the sense of heightened realism that the cast (much like famed horror classics like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) is comprised almost entirely of unknown actors. Murphy was only a few years away from RED EYE and BATMAN BEGINS, and Naomie Harris's breakout role in the ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" sequel was still in the not-too-distant future. Only HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleason is sort of recognizable, and robust as ever as a survivor trying to protect his daughter from the ravages of what has become Hell on Earth.<br/><br/>Zombie film or not, whatever you want to classify it as, 28 DAYS LATER is definitely not for the squeamish. Fast, frightening and ferocious, there are scenes of brutality that are not gratuitous by any means, but they're strategically placed at parts of the story when you will least expect them, and they have all the more impact as you come to learn about Jim and his new ""friends"", and you start to give a damn about what happens to them.<br/><br/>True, as noted in other reviews, the movie does start to lose steam around the middle of Act Three, and the controversial ending may leave some of you feeling unsatisfied. (Don't forget to review the alternative endings on the comprehensive DVD.)<br/><br/>But this is still worth more than just a passing glance. It might very well qualify as a present- day classic. And though Boyle has drifted away from horror again for the moment, I can't wait to see what he cooks up when he returns to it..."

","Having seen the sequel first and being disappointed with it, I viewed this movie with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised and wound up enjoying most of the movie. The hero (actually more like the anti-hero)was an annoying weakling throughout the movie but this is what makes the movie OK. In real life, not everyone is ""Rambo"" and it was refreshing to see the hero more helpless than helpful. As far as zombie movies goes, there's nothing really surprising. There are the usual chase/escape scenes and kill or be killed scenes. The gore is minimal, and left mostly to the imagination (which isn't a bad thing).<br/><br/>My main complaint about the movie happens towards the latter portions of the movie where the story takes a left turn into the dregs of humanity. Even so, it doesn't detracted too much from the overall entertainment value of the movie.<br/><br/>Watch this one but skip the sequel."

","There are some themes, like the end of the world, that works of the imagination keep returning to over and over again. Rod Taylor in the 1959 classic film ""The Time Machine"" sees the human race destroying itself in a nuclear war only to reemerge with subterranean carnivorous morlocks farming a race of dumb blondes as a source of food while they greenly lurk underground. Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" hides out in a heavily fortified compound, cruising the empty streets of the heavily fortified city while crazed, light-averse survivors of a plague wait until dark to pounce and destroy. Stephen King's film adaptation of his book ""The Stand"" shows us a world decimated by a killer influenza which has the survivors ending up in Las Vegas. And Michael Crichton has the demon agent coming from outer space in ""The Andromeda Strain"" and doing bad things to rubber and turning human blood to red dust. And now once again in the UK this time, ""28 Days After"" those generally untrustworthy scientists in secret labs are playing deadly games with germ warfare agents only to be unwittingly set free by animal rights guerillas. Having seen so many of these films before, I think ""28 Days Later"" does an excellent job of conveying the weird and horrible world of survivors of a holocaust.<br/><br/>As a microbiologist I am in a somewhat better than average position to judge the scientific merits of such events. Certainly viruses and plagues have decimated populations in the past, from the Black Plagues of the middle ages, to the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the AIDS pandemic of today. The Ebola outbreaks of central Africa are perhaps the most mysterious and horrifying in recent memory, and in this era of worldwide air travel or of natural migrations of infected birds, it isn't far from reality. It is a good thing that public health officials maintain a certain vigilance.<br/><br/>What sets ""28 Days Later"" apart is its ""realism"" (while of course being quite a work of imagination) however the virus is not the only heavy of the piece. While I could have told them not to take the tunnel, and would have probably put the car in reverse at the sight of all the wrecked cars underneath, and tried a bridge, and while I wonder at the tendency of contagion to turn normal people into murdering zombies who like rabid dogs attack and infect others, the curious turns of the plot where the characters make their way through a post-apocalyptic world where not all the villains are ""the infecteds"" made it a truly effective film in the horror genre. It was an excellent film."

Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realizing that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.<br/><br/>This is one of the best horror films I've ever seen, let alone one of the best, if I must, ""zombie"" movies I've ever seen. What makes this movie different from the other zombie movies out there? Well, there's a sense of humanism in here, which you would rarely find in horror movies. The movie has such great characters to care and cheer for. I just love it.<br/><br/>Another thing that I liked about this movie is that the action scenes used in here helps us understand about human nature in such a state of crisis. I also love the unpredictable-ness in the film. You won't know what happen and who dies when, which is also rare in a horror film. Everything else in here is a ride.<br/><br/>The performances by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris are great. The movie is also different in a way because it's never always depressing.

","The director/producer team that created Trainspotting turn their dynamic cinematic imaginations to the classic science fiction scenario of the last people on Earth. Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find London deserted--until he runs into a mob of crazed plague victims. He gradually finds other still-human survivors (including Naomie Harris), with whom he heads off across the abandoned countryside to find the source of a radio broadcast that promises salvation. 28 Days Later is basically an updated version of The Omega Man and other post-apocalyptic visions; but while the movie may lack originality, it makes up for it in vivid details and creepy paranoid atmosphere. 28 Days Later's portrait of how people behave in extreme circumstances--written by novelist Alex Garland (The Beach)--will haunt you afterward. Also featuring Brendan Gleeson (The General, Gangs of New York) and Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, The Others)."
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","2","3","15 April 2008"," Not bad...
","It should be noted that 28 Days Later is not a horror film, it's a pretty clear cut science fiction film, with some horror elements. The movie starts with a half-witted premise, a bunch of animal rights activists break into a lab and release some monkeys, on which apparently horrible tests are being conducted. What they don't realize, and don't allow one desperate scientist to explain, is that the monkeys are infected with ""Rage,"" which turns out to be an astonishing disease. The minute the first monkey is free, it screams and spits and bites the first person it comes into contact with, causing her to seemingly start to spit out her insides.<br/><br/>Sounds pleasing, right? The infections scenes are done really well, it's the implication that this is going to turn into a zombie movie that may cause the eyes to glaze over. But the 28 days in the title refers to when the movie takes place. It seems that a London bicycle courier named Jim (played effectively by Cillian Murphy) has suffered a near fatal traffic accident and woke up in the hospital, 28 days after the accidental release of the rage virus. The London that he finds as he wanders out of the empty hospital is, of course, very different from the one that he left.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that was wisely shot on a different medium than is generally used for modern films. Director Danny Boyle opted to shoot the movie on digital video rather than film, which not only made the film much more affordable (a huge budget, after all, could very well have ruined it), but also gave the movie that gritty, realistic feel that movies like this should have. <br/><br/>There are standard rules applied to the infection, such as that if someone becomes infected you have about 20 seconds to kill them before they kill you. Basically, the virus created was meant to be sort of a counteractive drug to combat rage. The ultimate anger management, if you will. But unfortunately, in order to fight rage, the scientists had to create pure rage in their test subjects, the monkeys, and then try to fight it. Unfortunately, rather than reducing pure, unfiltered anger, they turned it into an infectious disease. Oops. <br/><br/>Before long, Jim is traveling with Selina, a hardened survivor who has learned to detach all emotional connections with other people in case she suddenly finds herself faced with the decision to die or kill someone close to her in less than 20 seconds. They meet up with a big tender man named Frank and his daughter, holed up in a high-rise apartment building, and ultimately the four of them decide to try to drive in Frank's London taxi cab toward what a mysterious broadcast on the radio claims is a safe zone.<br/><br/>Obviously, there's no way of knowing whether the message is reliable or not (and yes, the mysterious broadcast is one of the most routine, redundant plot devices in the movie, which is a big statement, given that post-apocalyptic zombie movies tend to generally be driven by routine, redundant plot devices), but they take the risk. Life in a high rise apartment building may get real old real quick.<br/><br/>What follows is probably the dumbest scene in the entire movie, where the car careens effortlessly over a jam of gridlocked cars in a tunnel. The scene is so improbable and so incongruous to the relative realism (so to speak) of the rest of the movie that I can only guess that it's some kind of in joke which only Londoners, and maybe even only London taxi drivers, would know or understand. <br/><br/>Then come the plot holes. <br/><br/>When Jim first walked out of that hospital, he found London totally deserted. There was NO ONE in the city. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the astonishing sight of London really deserted (they really cleared the streets for those shots), which may lead you to forget that, since no one is around, presumably everyone who was infected is not only dead, but their scattered carcasses have been cleaned up by someone. Once infected, how long can the host expect to live? 20 minutes? A day? A month? Or maybe they just went into hiding like in I Am Legend. Attributing an intolerance of daylight would not be the only zombie or vampire-like quality attributed to those infected with rage in this movie. <br/><br/>In the political and military climate into which the movie was released, it makes a strong comment on the possibility and danger of biological warfare, so much so that it may even seem to be cashing in on this fear. But not only does it call our attention to this possibility, even more than it might already have been there, it also forces us to consider what the world would be like after such an attack. I doubt it would be much like it is in the movie, but I also have a feeling that most people imagine what such an attack would look like, rather than what it would look like 28 days later."

","This movie is amazing. i've seen people on IMDb complaining about apparent flaws in 28 days later such as why is London so clean and why are there hardly any zombies for a population of 7 million. Well for a start after a bout 3-5 weeks you die of starvation which explains why after 28 days there aernt many zombies. The reason why the streets are quite bare is because most people evacuated to the airport where all the carnage happened im guessing. And amybe no one bothered going into the budgens shop as they were too concerned with getting to the airport which is why its not trashed.

","plot holes:1: the cod science about developing a virus that creates an extreme psychosis in the host, you cannot create a virus by showing violent images to an ape then 'farming' the blood. 2.Its doubtful despair would set in so quickly with the soldiers( 28 days) especially under the command of Major Henry West ( Christopher Eccelston) who is authoritative, and respected and enough by his men to stop them from raping the woman with a few words.Its more likely they would have set up an international communication radio, signalled for help, been given orders by the many British military generals serving in other country's and calmly waited for back up whilst broadcasting a help and advice signal for any survivors. It is further doubtful a virus passed on through the blood could have wiped out a government in 28 days, the infected are dangerous but they aren't organised and cant use weapons, but they can be killed or, one presumes rounded up and caged till a treatment can be found 8.The Cillian Murphy character is about 8 stone soaking wet and has just woken up from a coma, yet manages to kill four trained, armed soldiers who use army fighting techniques on him earlier showing they know how to do it!. It does have some plus points however, good effects, reasonable tension and good acting from stalwarts like Brendan Gleeson and Chris Eccleston.But for me the huge problems with the script meant i spent my time pointing out the plot holes rather than watching it."

","28 Days Later is a zombie film that really doesn't have much of anything remarkable about it. It's certainly not terrific, but it's certainly not awful either. It's just kind of there. The film has a fascinating premise, some startling visuals and a few moments of mild terror. But it never really rises above the mundane, there's nothing that makes it truly stand out from the pack.<br/><br/>28 Days Later follows Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who awakes from a 28-day coma to find London completely deserted. The shots of the deserted city, with the perfect music to match, are haunting, probably the most memorable thing about the film. Jim will soon find the city is in fact not completely deserted as he comes upon a pack of zombies with murderous intentions. Rescued by a young man and woman, Jim will learn that all of London, indeed it seems all of Britain and possibly the world, has been infected with a rage virus that turns them into these murderous creatures. We soon meet a father and a daughter who have also managed to survive. The father is played by Brendan Gleeson, the most recognizable face in a film featuring mainly unknowns.<br/><br/>The small band of survivors eventually make their way to Manchester where the film gets somewhat bogged down. It's almost as if the zombies become forgotten and we acquire some new villains who are all too human, all too normal and all too dull. Eventually things begin to move towards what is ultimately a rather unsatisfying conclusion. The film has some great visuals, some fine performances, including that of relative unknown Naomie Harris as Selena, one of Jim's companions on his journey, and a great story to tell. But what started with a great premise and the promise of some genuine thrills in the end falls rather flat. 28 Days Later goes out not with a bang but with a whimper."

","I can suspend my disbelief about certain scientific facts that were totally ignored. The ""Rage"" is really bonky. Makes people homicidal but only homicidal enough to bite others so they can turn...maybe if the zombies tried to eat and kill each other and everything, i could accept it as the ""Rage"".(But hey it's another spin on the zombie movie :P )<br/><br/>Why is it disappointing you ask me? Simply because the actions of the characters were supremely ludicrous and pretty much made no friggin sense.<br/><br/>The animal activists...not even they are stupid enough to do what they did when they were told that the animals were infected, and the evidence being right in front of them.<br/><br/>The total change of character from tough cookie to helpless creampuff for the black girl. <br/><br/>Jim the ex-comatose patient morphing into Rambo.<br/><br/>Why would Jim bayonet the soldier cook and then leave his nice full auto rifle on the floor so he could run around as unarmed zombie bait? How many times have you seen a character disable the monster/enemy and then run alway leaving their weapons so the monster/enemy can get back up, pick the weapon up and then chase them again. <br/><br/>The pathetic helplessness of the soldiers who supposedly survived as long as they did. They seemed tough at first then in the end started cowering...dropping weapons...etc. Too out of character.<br/><br/>The fact that none of them attempted to get off the island. Remember what the Sargeant said in captivity? Soldiers do have some common sense in the real world. At least in Romero's zombie flicks, they tried to get off into the sea to look for some measure of hope.<br/><br/>28 days later...how can those apples be fresh and pristine?

"cordelia1","Null","2","3","5 May 2004"," Disjointed, cliched and forgettable
","I first heard about this film via a film magazine, where I was treated to a free mini-dvd containing the first 10 minutes. After watching the entire film, i now know why they chose to entice us with the first 10 minutes - because that was basically the  high point of the entire film.<br/><br/>The trouble with this film is the characterisation and script. At the point where the main characters pash (their names are?), i was cringing. The love story is so pathetic and predictable that I felt like flagging the rest of the film...'ok, i'm gonna want to pash someone in the middle of an apocalypse, when we risk attack from zombies at every corner'. They are in fact a neo Adam and Eve , which I felt was not explained properly.<br/><br/>The actors suffer from a stupid, hackneyed script ...the characters are unbelieveable as traumatised individuals, for example, the young woman shouts - ""rise and shine sleepyhead"". The picnic and supermarket scenes were abolsutely appauling. So, like, the whole human race has only been wiped out by disease, but who cares, lets go whoop it up on supermarket trolleys to a rock soundtrack!  The picnic scene is very lame too - so, let's eat and we'll forget all the rubbish that has gone down with one bite of a hamburger!  And let's watch the horsies run in the fields and admire their freedom!   ggrrrr.... They also wander stupidly around, risking attack from zombies. My friends and I found ourselves yelling at the tv ...this film is indeed fustrating.  It implies, with the death of the little girl's father, that she was the only person who suffered the traumatising effects of family loss. In fact, the entire nation/world was supposedly wiped out. Um....<br/><br/>However, what 28 days later benefits from is some stark, disturbing imagery. I felt especially queasy when there is a long shot of the church interior with bodies piled up in the rows.  The morning shots of an isolated London are especially praise-worthy.<br/><br/>What I found most irritating however was the apparent lack of sympathy for human life (from the main characters... even though they  are tricked by the military personnel, they show no remorse for them when they are subsequently attacked by zombies). For example,  the girl pushes the head army officer out of the car into the mass of flesh eaters. This was unnessessary, and gratuitous. The film turns into some gratuitously plotted, girl-power plagued 'Survivor: apocalyptic London'.<br/><br/>I have heard this film described as a fresh take on the zombie genre. Um...yes and no. The first half hour is the only reason why one should watch this film. Ultimately, the plot is disjointed and it feels like the second half is a different cinematic outing altogether.  I thought the acting was fine, but the writers didn't exactly give Cillian murphy etc etc much to work with.  Filmmakers never seem to learn that A. integrating a stupid romance into an action film will never work ; and B. when they treat us to the predictable demise of lesser characters, it is just plain dumb.<br/><br/>I am glad this film is British, because it would have been absolute rubbish if it been American (no offence to any yankies reading this).  Oh, wait, it was a pile of cowpats anyway. I thought one interesting ideological question raised was that of the randy soldiers versus the imprisoned women. There are two females left alive, so the soldiers try to forcibly impregnate them to carry on the human race.  This idea should have been examined further.<br/><br/>I've been pretty harsh, so if any of you out there liked this film, i say fair enough..this is just my opinion. Just don't do anything stupid like buy the dvd. You won't be watching it twice."

","You see this trend in a lot of films these days. Technology has made it possible to have very cool effects in movies and you see filmmakers relying heavily on these special effects to fill up the minutes in their film. However, you're left watching the movie simply for the effects, like a video game without any caring for the characters and the development of the story. I just finished watching 28 Days Later. There'd been a lot of hype on it, so I figured I give it a shot. Absolutely no emotional connection with this flick. Visually, it played like a long Marilyn Manson video with zombies. Sure there were a couple of jolts in the flick that startle you but that hardly qualifys as true horror. The Blair Witch Project (though hardly a fully realized film and not a movie I particularly liked) provided way more horror without the use of one special effect. Simply a dark forest and a flashlight was able to raise the hair on the back of people's necks in that flick. If you're in the mood to get scared, skip this movie and rent ALIEN instead."

The movie started good and the idea of the ""rage virus"" is good.  When the guy woke up and was all alone, it was interesting.  But then I think the filmmakers must have realized they were failing to follow the tried and true and oft repeated so went with a substandard telling of the zombies and last men on earth storyline.  Even the encounter with the troops was tired and predictable from the start. <br/><br/>

","This movie rates as one of the very worst that I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. To say that 28 Days Later has a low-budget look would be generous. A no-budget look is more like it. This movie looks worse than my aunt's old 8mm home movies. It also has the most annoying use of a hand held camera since The Blair Witch Project. But at least that movie was supposed to look like it was shot with a camcorder. This movie also has the worse use of rapid-fire, quick-cut editing that I have ever seen in ANY movie. For example, when the zombies attack, you have absolutely no idea what is happening because the editing is so jumpy. Another problem is that this is one of those horror movies where everyone acts stupid because if they didn't act stupid, there would be no suspense. Not that there actually IS any suspense. There isn't even one mildly scary scene in this movie. It isn't scary. It's just ugly, stupid and boring. 1 out of 10"

After meeting up with the father/daughter pair it's clear that the writer, the director and anybody else responsible for this production didn't have a clue what to do next. So they started making it up as they went along.

People all over have been bashing the far better RESIDENT EVIL and then complimenting this film as if it was one of the better films of the year. This movie was totally horrid.<br/><br/>The camerawork is very nice, the special effects were actually pretty good, but the story needed to be worked on. A lot. *SPOILERS TO FOLLOW*<br/><br/>The introduction and demise of characters doesn't work at all. I thought John Carpenter's GHOSTS OF MARS was bad at that, but this film is far worse. Brendan Gleeson is introduced about a half hour into the movie and disappears about a half hour before the end. Other characters that have a lot to do with the end of the film are not introduced until much later in the film and the ending was completely out of sync with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The zombie story of it all is only about half the movie. In fact, they're not even zombies. They're just people with a virus that makes them go crazy. These mutants aren't even explained good enough. What do they do? Do they eat the victims? We never find out. The movie leaves an impression on you, but not the one you were hoping for. The film is incoherent and lazy. It had a great premise going for it, and it was moving up on the list to being one of the best zombie films I've ever seen. But it all lost it towards the end.<br/><br/>
Major Spoilers Ahead: So these army guys get really horny because all the women in the near vacinity are dead and they haven't had sex in about a month. These guys are ready to go insane. They need women!! This little sub-plot of the film basically ruins the whole damn thing. It takes on all the attention of the movie for about a half hour and it bored the hell out of me.

","I just got back from seeing this movie with my brother. I never post on these forums but just cannot believe people are praising this movie. I can care less that it is British, that is irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that this movie made no sense, had a terrible plot and was completely pointless and boring. Here are the reasons I think it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>1. Why did the infected overlook a defenseless coma patient, seems like easy prey to me?<br/><br/>2. Why did the infected only come out at night? They were not the undead or zombies? They seemed quite mindless and enraged. At points they were seen in the daylight so obviously it was not a sensitivity to light.<br/><br/>
3. What did the infected eat? It seems all they did was attack you and vomit blood on you which would cause infection, they never showed them eating people. So, what at all did they eat. That makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>
4. Also, shouldn't there have .been hordes of infected canines and felines and rats and whatever else running around. Unless the virus could only infect humans and chimps, but they never explained any of that. But since Jim made a comment about the horses being infected one would assume that other species could be, then again Jim wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.<br/><br/>
5. Out of the millions of people in the London metro area I can't believe there wouldn't be many more survivors. How could Frank fend off thousands of infected terrorizing the city. If he was able to do it then thousands of others should have been able to as well. And not too smart Frank advertising with blinking lights to the infected exactly where you lived, he must like fighting infected.<br/><br/>6. Why would they choose and old crummy car to flee in when there were plenty of brand new mercedes parked everywhere. I won't even comment on the tunnel scene because it was obvioulsy so contrived. I think they could have risked driving a few hundred more feet to change the tire, come on!<br/><br/>
7. Hey let's have a picnic and sleep in the great outdoors when infected were roaming the land, maybe it would have been a better idea to take shifts driving and sleeping and timing gas stops during the morning hours.<br/><br/>

""Scary as hell""??? Huh? ""Thinking man's horror movie""??? Puh-leez. First of all, STOP calling it a ""zombie movie"". There isn't a single zombie in the entire flick. A zombie is a reanimated corpse. The infected victims in this movie don't die and then come back to life; they are simply consumed by an uncontrollable rage. Other ""thinking"" critics describe the infected as being ""zombie cannibals"" or ""flesh-eating zombies"" when it is never established that the infected actually ate human flesh--or ate anything for that matter. They may very well BITE in the same way that a raging dog will but do they even think to eat? Or are they so utterly consumed with rage that they don't notice or recognize hunger? An early scene in which two of the infected are set afire while chasing the protaganist and yet don't waver in their pursuit pretty much establishes that their instinct for self-preservation is gone.<br/><br/>And why don't they attack each other? They seemed to ""hunt"" in packs which is something that a social animal would do and yet these monsters are infected with a very antisocial rage; a rage so intense that swarms of rats flee the infecteds' approach. Yet the infected operate almost like a gang. People who need people...<br/><br/>As for the film's ""man's inhumanity to man"" subtext or its exploration of our darker nature and instincts,blah,blah,blah...so what? Haven't you people ever seen a war movie--particularly a Vietnam war movie. These are not new themes and they are not handled with any real panache or originality in this movie. And why do the people in this movie assume that the virus has gone global and that there is ""no future"". It would be next to impossible for a virus that manifests itself quite vividly within seconds to jump from an island nation like Great Britain to ""Paris and New York"". Only one character in the entire movie questions the possibility of this and he is a minor character who is chained to a radiator, ignored, and eventually killed. The predicament of the two female characters, who are surrounded by men, hinges on this perception of ""no future"". It is a perception that the movie failed to acutely convey, in my opinion and I couldn't understand why the characters seemed to have a last-people-on-earth mentality. It seemed inevitable that some ""uninfected"" country would eventually come to the rescue--as they in fact do. In the meantime, the ""infected"" become almost peripheral to the numbing story that is being told and I can't figure out for the life of me what people found so scary about this movie. Spare us the sequel."

If you've seen The Beach, it's the same kind of turning point that happened when Leo DiCaprio started running around crazy in the woods.<br/><br/>

Having seen '28 Days Later,' I'd like to know what film they were actually watching because it couldn't have been the same one I saw.  The 'shocks' were signposted so far ahead that even one of the 'infected' could have spotted them.  I actually found the violence and gore boring.  The use of jumpy DV didn't help either as it was impossible to follow the action anyway.<br/><br/>This film really is a mess with not one original idea in its two hour running time.  Borrowing heavily from such sci-fi and horror classics as 'The Day Of The Triffids,' 'The Omega Man' and Romero's films including his oft-forgotten 'The Crazies,' the film lurches from one idea to another like a cinematic magpie, but adds nothing to the whole.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, but the characters remain undeveloped for the most part with the exception of Frank (Gleeson) who is believable and rounded, but unfortunately he is killed off too early on.<br/><br/>The plot is really the weakest point.  It is so full of holes that I began to wonder if the bus Jim comes across had fallen through one.  The virus acts too quickly.  Even Romero's zombies took a while to get going after they'd been bitten.  We are supposed to marvel at how clever Boyle et al were in filming an empty London, but I'm afraid to say it is as eerie and menacing as Belfast on any Sunday morning (actually less so, because there are more 'zombies' in Belfast at 6am on a Sunday morning).  Where are all the bodies and debris?  Why is there no evidence of looting?  Why have the survivors even remained in the city at all, wouldn't it be just too dangerous with all the corpses?  And what is it with that taxi?  I'd get myself a big diesel four-wheel drive and be out of there to the mountains. And why was there no twenty-mile traffic jam stretching back from Eccleston's blockade?  Two cars?  Some roadblock, most of the survivors must be in Scotland.  I suppose that's where the plane at the end has come from. Don't even start me on the ending...<br/><br/>This had the potential to be a brilliant British sci-fi film in the vein of Nigel Kneale or Terry Nation, but instead it is just a third-rate shock flick made on a shoestring.

Only to later realize that humanity is almost extinct thanks to a deadly virus.<br/><br/>Alex Garland, writer of this movie and others like Annihilation or Ex Machina, does a great job as always by creating a more realistic and planned version than other conventional ""zombie"" films. And the recommendation is thanks to the originality of the script, since when you see it and remembering the current situation, you don't feel so detached from reality.<br/><br/>As it is usual to see in dangerous situations, and as in other post-apocalyptic movies, humanity's greatest danger is itself, people stop trusting, attack and lose their minds. It has been seen many times, but as this film is an ancestor of many, it is not a repetition.<br/><br/>The direction can be suffocating on many occasions, not as current as other films released in that year that are still relevant, and you can see the low budget in that regard, but the history, as well as the performances are so well worked that they make it impressive in several scenes. By impressive I mean situations that are very difficult to see, heartbreaking in the sense that living that would make anyone's throat lump.<br/><br/>Unlike other films of the type, among the protagonists there are no characters that are annoying to the audience. It is very entertaining to see them and I highlight the Brendan Gleeson character ""Frank"" which broke my heart.<br/><br/>There are 10 seasons of The Walking Dead and it is impossible how it continues to be justified, unlike this movie, and although both are in fiction, you can notice a great difference between what is closer to reality than to fiction.<br/><br/>In conclusion 28 days later, it is a film that has an original vision of a pandemic, and life after death for the entire world.

","28 Days Later is, for me, I strange blend of things I love in the horror genre and things I really can't stand.<br/><br/>The basic premise is this: Jim and Selena are two survivors of a viral plague that is incredibly infectious and turns people into foaming-at-the-mouth killers. This plague has devastated Britain. They must find a way to survive.<br/><br/>First of all, the post-apocalyptic Britain setting is right up my street. I'm slightly biased as a Brit, but I love seeing the deserted streets of my home nation's capital. The movie does a really good job of selling the feel of a world gone to ruin, even if some of the street shots are suspiciously clean and tidy (where are all the corpses?!)<br/><br/>The mere technical achievement of shutting down blocks of London to film is in itself impressive.<br/><br/>I'd go as far as to say the first half of the film is 10/10 fantastic, up to and including the part where the survivors meet Frank and his daughter. The characters are relatable and likeable, they behave sensibly and the innovative concept (at the time) of fast, extremely infectious ""faux-zombies"" is terrifying. Up until this point, the script is smart.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is, for me, where we start taking a very heavy detour away from fresh post-apocalyptic survival tale into tiresome horror cliche and some very lazy writing. It feels like the backend of a worse movie was sort of welded on for the second and third act.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters start acting stupidly, like they're in a terrible 80's teen slasher. Frank insists that they need to leave the safe, secure block of flats due to lack of food and rainfall, even though we've just seen Jim and Selena return from a convenience store that was absolutely stuffed with food and drink.<br/><br/>He also complains there has been no rainfall for 10 days...this is very unusual in England, so why not simply wait another day or two sipping Pepsis and get the inevitable deluge of fresh water that is surely on the way?<br/><br/>Instead, Frank and the others decide to leave their highly effective police riot gear behind and get into a completely vulnerable taxi cab, before driving through a pitch black tunnel filled with wrecked cars, infected citizens and corpses.<br/><br/>One of the characters even comments repeatedly on how utterly idiotic this idea is, as if that somehow excuses the writers for making the characters take this ludicrous course of action that no person in their right mind would ever do.<br/><br/>While the film is ratcheting up this false tension, the characters being *laughing*. Yes, that's right, because the process of driving recklessly over ruined cars while packs of screaming lunatics chase after you, intent on gouging your eyes out is...funny?<br/><br/>I've re-watched this scene several times and I still just can't understand what they were going for here. Maybe that sort of relief-laughter people sometimes do? But the actors seem genuinely happy, like they're laughing with boundless mirth at the prospect of their imminent agonising death. It's bizarre, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>Frank then gets infected screaming at some crows that are feasting on infected corpses. He was a great character and I think it was a mistake cutting him from the film so shortly after his first appearance. Even more annoyingly, he would have been fine if he'd been wearing his riot helmet that he had about 5 scenes ago, but the script is dropping in quality by this point so we're not supposed to think about it.<br/><br/>The final act for me kind of ruins the rest of the film further. It's intense, the soundtrack is good and there are some interesting scenes, but the portrayal of almost all of the soldiers as lunatic rapist psychopaths is too silly for me to really maintain my suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>It's clear, perhaps too clear, that the intention was a ""human nature is the real evil"" kind of epilogue to the story. This was also a theme during the ""chimps watching humans being violent"" scene. But it's done so clumsily in the third act.<br/><br/>Somehow normal people with no military or survival training are mentally competent and sane after 28 days in post-Infection Britain. But mentally hardened, trained soldiers with the ability to defend themselves and good friends by their side are for some reason utterly insane by this point, to the point that they're convinced they need to rape and murder their way to a new society.<br/><br/>*After 28 days.* Let's not forget soldiers have fought for years in WW1 conditions, watching all their friends die, and still not experienced such a
drastic slide into degenerate psychopathic madness as these guys had in less than a month.<br/><br/>Again, with some creative scriptwriting this could have been plausible. Maybe the soldiers were rookie recruits, or they were failed soldiers awaiting court martial when they escaped during the outbreak. But it's never even touched on.<br/><br/>And that's the story of 28 Days Later; a fantastic first act, a middling second act and then a rather disappointing and rote conclusion. It's a watchable film with some interesting social commentary, it's just a shame they got lazy with the script towards the end.<br/><br/>7/10 for the first act alone, really."

"willians_franco","5","1","1","16 August 2019"," A reasonable movie about zombi
","The movie explores a post-apocalyptic vision. A group of people tries to survive the chaos caused by a worldwide epidemic of a type of rabies virus, and try to find a place to live under the threat of insatiable zombies.
Although many find this movie one of the best movies about zombies, I disagree. For me, it is just watchable and average, and the value they attach to it is overestimated. It's not scary at all. It's a bit like ""The Walking Dead"". The outcome of the film leaves much to be desired. There is a lack of logic and coherence in many passages due to defects in the script. The shallow performance of some of the characters does not give credibility to an apocalyptic situation of this magnitude. Some passages are dragged and monotonous. A possible highlight is a post-apocalyptic scenario in London, showing the city, streets and deserted avenues.
Movie indicated especially for the fans of the series ""The Walking Dead"". In particular, I don't recommend it, and I give it an average grade."

There is so much shaky cam and poor lighting it's impossible to tell what's going on. A gun will shoot then the camera will flail and you won't know what happened. The lighting is off. It's often too Bright or too dark. I'm not nitpicking. It was legitimately hard to follow what was happening.

","Back in England many years ago, when Radio was still vibrant and important, there was a serial program that was very like this movie.<br/><br/>I can't remember the reason why most people had been killed off, but there were a few who for one reason or another had survived and they set off out of London when they heard of a safe zone in the English Lake District (ring any bells yet) On the way they encountered all sorts of problems and losses, till eventually they arrived at the stronghold in the Lake District. But there were other strongholds in the area who had ideas of taking over the resources and women of our groups stronghold.<br/><br/>That is all I can remember of the program except that as a young boy about 10 year old it fired my imagination and later when I used to go rambling and camping around the Lake District I would look for good valleys to defend and springs for water etc.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me very much of that series. I found the infected people a little over the top for my taste. I also could not understand why Jim did not get guns etc. from gun-shops in London to defend himself. A baseball bat may be OK for a deli owner but not to keep alive against hoards of biting maniacs.<br/><br/>All in all a slightly disappointing movie that could have been better with more realistic events during their travels north and cleverer use of infected peoples.

","~Spoiler~ <br/><br/>How is it that a movie can have such critical success, and yet horror fans are not pleased?  How is this film so incredibly different from Romero's own zombie films.  Yes, I'm aware that it's not a zombie film (regardless of what the back of the DVD claims) but it still parallels the classics.  28 Days Later reminded me so much of Dawn/Day of the Dead that I had to love it.  The scene where they enter a supermarket and go on a shopping spree: Dawn of the Dead.  The scene with Mailer, an infected soldier, chained to a wall: Day of the Dead.  Jim killing the kid at the gas station: more Dawn. The evil military: more Day.  I for one loved this movie.  I dug it mainly because it had solid characters, characters I cared about in a horrific situation.  Jim is the everyman.  He's a character that every person should be able to identify with.  Jim awakes from a coma to find his world empty. Or so he thinks.  A rage virus has overcome the city of London (perhaps more) and it has left infected, zombie-like creatures in its wake.  The virus is in the blood; one bite or scratch and it's curtains for you.  Jim is played brilliantly by Cillian Murphy (Jeremy Sisto's English cousin??). I hope to see more of this young actor.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well.  Naomie Harris IS her character, Christopher Eccleston and Brenden Gleesen are incredible as well, and this is only Megan Burns' second film. Plus, the film had an undeniably ""real life"" feel to it.  I believe this situation is possible. And that scares me.  This film hit theaters during the SARS epidemic and that only adds to the chilling and effective atmosphere the movie creates.  The digital filmmaking also adds to this sense of realism and compliments the film magically.  Another thing going for it was the empty city of London.  I could keep going with what I feel are ""positives"" but let me talk about questions that the film has raised. One such question is if the Rage Virus causes uncontrollable anger, then why don't the infected kill each other?  Why didn't Romero's zombie attack each other?  The infected ""recognize"" one another (perhaps through pheromones or maybe just animal instincts) and have a strong to desire to spread the virus.  The virus is trying its best to survive (like any living creature) and the infected attacking the infected would be pointless.  That's the best explanation that I could come up with.  I think Danny Boyle (who impressed me more with Shallow Grave) and Alex Garland did a hell of a job on this thing."

","I rented this DVD with the hope of seeing an incredibly scary film. As usual, the film did not live up to the hype. I LOVE movies dealing with the horrors of biological weapons, but this one was so weak it hurts.<br/><br/>This film BORED me to death. It's a series of cliche, predictable zombie/end-of-the-world scenes stolen from several other films. A complete WASTE of time. <br/><br/>The first half of the film (stolen from ""Resident Evil"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", etc., etc., etc.) consists of a cast of dull, irritating characters wandering aorund the city staring into space. Then, every once in a while some ""infected"" people would chase them. And NONE of the infected people are scary -- or even mildly frightening. They're just a bunch of slobbering, prancing, red-eyed psychotics who are easily dispatched.<br/><br/>Been there. Done that. Thank you very much. <br/><br/>The second half of the film (stolen from ""Day of the Dead"") is just plain stupid. You knew the MOMENT the main characters arrived at the military installation that the soldiers were going to try and rape the women. They might as well have worn signs around their necks. You also knew the main guy (I don't even remember his name because I didn't care) was going to stop the soldiers by releasing the infected soldier chained up in back.<br/><br/>And the ending was the worst of all! It's a sugar-coated finale that doesn't even fit the mood of the rest of the film. It's obvious they tested the film with audiences and some idiots in the studio marketing department forced them to tack on a ""happy ending"". <br/><br/>PLEASE! Save me from ""happy endings"". <br/><br/>Take a look at the alternative endings in on the DVD. The one where the main guy dies in the hospital and the two women walk off down the hall is exactly where it should have ended. Better yet, they should have filmed the proposed third alternative ending that eliminates the idotic solder story line all together.<br/><br/>Actually, they should have just saved their time and money and NOT made this film at all. <br/><br/>I see that Danny Boyle, the director, passed on making ""Alien 4"".

","I guess the only appeal of this film is that it has a distinct nihilist flavour, delighting in the annihilation of everything. Maybe what a lot of people understand intuitively - that our civilization is terminally ill, is what makes us enjoy some of the scenes in which all the filth seems to have been swept away, so we can start anew. 
Still, the film repeats all the cliches from the zombie genre, and has few original moments. What was somewhat original was that the zombies were fast and agile. But the characters are dull, their actions are absurd most of the time, and the climax is illogical and forced. I felt really let down when it was over. One more thing: zombie or not, no one can run like crazy for days and weeks without a break. Especially since the film makes a point that the infection is biological and not supernatural. Running zombies would have passed out and died much sooner than the film imagines."

"n-s-bondi","3","3","6","24 February 2012"," A terrible movie by a great director
","I really can't see how people can actually say that the movie's ""one of the best of its genre"". It starts off okay and builds up a lot of tension throughout the first half of the movie, for example I found the encounter with the infected priest pretty good and the scene in which the ""zombies"" if you will, chase the main heroes up the stairway was kinda intense too, but nothing about it was really scaring me at any point and that is, in my opinion a K.O. argument for a horror movie, except maybe if the premise and overall plot is good. And in 28 Days later it isn't.<br/><br/>To be fair, this is ""just"" a zombie movie and I can imagine that it is pretty hard to come up with an original, inspired plot for that genre, but in the first half of the movie, everything that happens you have seen in any shitty zombie movie before. I mean don't get me wrong - it's not a terrible story, but it's nothing special. It's just okay. And ""okay"" can sometimes be much worse than ""terrible"". Not only the story, but also the characters are very shallow. Literally no one in this film, I can recall having a personality and thus the very predictable romance isn't very captivating as well.<br/><br/>But that all changes about 60 minutes into the movie, because then the movie decides to become a character study all of the sudden. And you know what? It failed and I might even go on and say that the second half is the worst part about the film and therefore ruins the entire movie. If you wanna see a character study of these people you could as well just study the social behavior of brooms during mating season.<br/><br/>Another really big problem is the camera. Again in the first half it wasn't anything Oscar-worthy, but it never stood out in a negative way. Now in the second half either the cameraman had a seizure or (and that's the more likely theory) they just stopped giving a damn. It's even worse than in Quantum of Solace or Transformers. I just couldn't figure out what was going on on the screen.<br/><br/>So if it hadn't been for the last 50 minutes I'd say give it a watch, but I literally have rarely seen a film that degrades so much the longer you're watching. If you want to watch a good recent zombie film you should check out Dawn of the Dead (2004), (REC), or 21 Weeks Later which is the much better sequel to 21 Days Later. So do yourself a favour and avoid this movie, it is not even worth the time opening the DVD case of it."
"freemantle_uk","9","3","6","14 February 2010"," How a horror film should be done
","Danny Boyle has proved to be a director who can do almost any genre. He has done dark-comedy, crime, drugs, sci-fi and a children's film, and with 28 Days Later he shows he can do a horror/post-apocalyptic film with chilling consequences. This was also a big success for Fox Spotlight (the only good wing of Fox at the moment): with a $5 Million it made nearly $83 Million and was even more successful in the United States then it was in it's nation UK.<br/><br/>28 Days after the release of the rage virus, Britain has become devastated. Main cities are deserted, the inflected, pretty much zombie like people, roam the streets. In London a bike courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma, and is shocked to find London is empty and has no knowledge of the event that has happened. He meets up with two other survivors, Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who tell him everything that happens. After being chased by inflected, Jim and Selena go to a tower block and meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). They hear an emergency broadcast from the army to go Manchester and the group quickly head-off. But it not just the inflected that the survivors have to worry about.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle teamed up with Alex Garland, a successful novelist, to make a bleak, haunting film about the end of the world. They are strong scenes, like the deserted London, with only hints of what happens. They don't show the collapse of Britain, so leave it up to the audience's imagination. Boyle and Garland also focus on the most important factor in storytelling: character. There are interesting and believable, who have different views about live and the world. Selena is a pessimistic woman who has to be violence to survivor, Jim is a man who thrown into an extraordinary position, and the compelling father daughter relationship between Frank and Hannah. Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) and the army also show what man can do at it's worst. Danny Boyle shows his skill behind camera, using an effective hand-held camera, giving the film a more gritty, realistic felt, adding to the horror of the events. He shows he has a good sense for action, scares and more tender moments, allowing character interaction and revel who people really are. As a horror film it is very effective, even to people who don't like the genre. Boyle and Garland also add some moments of dark comedy to relax the film a tiny bit.<br/><br/>They is also a good cast in the film. 28 Days Later brought Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris to the public, and the two have stared in Batman Begins and the second and third Pirates films. But it was Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston who offered the experience the film needed, particularly Christopher Eccleston as a near mad army officer, like Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Garland and Boyle were also influenced by George A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy, with the collapse of society in Dawn of the Dead, the siege environment of Dawn and Night of the Living Dead, and the relationship between the army and civilians was like in Day of the Dead.<br/><br/>An excellent horror film."

I mean, basically very little original is in the story and the movie actually 'borrows' a lot from much earlier genre movies. Yet ""28 Days Later..."" could and should be regarded as a totally original genre, mostly due to its approach.<br/><br/>Leave it up to director Danny Boyle to deliver a good movie with also lots of style and originality. This movie does not pick a classic horror approach in which our main heroes are running from the evil killer zombies, the story is much more layered than that and there are some deeper meanings to the story. For instance in the second halve it becomes apparent that perhaps not the infected are the worst and most dangerous villains around but mankind is actually much more vicious and evil some under circumstances. This is also why I really liked the second halve of the movie, even though it was quite different from the first halve of the movie. I always like movies that completely turn 180 degrees after they are halve way through, at least if its done in a good manner of course.<br/><br/>The movie its approach is totally realistic, which also can be seen back in the movie its gritty and dynamic camera-work and the way the overall story progresses and the characters are being developed. I'm also pretty sure that this movie shows an accurate portrayal of the case when an actual epidemic such as this would break out on a large scale. Nothing in this movie ever makes you think; oh that's really not possible or believable! Even though the movie of course features brain dead murderous 'zombies'.<br/><br/>But hardened horror fans don't worry. The movie still features plenty of gore and graphic killings for you to enjoy. This movie welcomes a new group of people to the genre but at the same time knows to maintain and please the 'old fashioned' horror-lovers.<br/><br/>The movie is also good looking with its settings, which truly enhances the movie its atmosphere. There is nothing scarier than watching a completely deserted London.<br/><br/>There are some fine actors in the movie that are all giving some fine and realistic performances. Cillian Murphy can basically play anything and it was this movie that marked his big breakthrough. I'm not a too big fan of Naomie Harris but she is simply good in this movie and plays her role very natural and therefor credible. Further more Brendan Gleeson also plays a fine smaller role. Megan Burns on the other hand is just downward horrible. Pure and simply, she just can't act. It seriously ruins some of the realism and tension of the movie at times. Thank goodness she also hasn't acted in anything every since.

"integralesixteenvalve","10","3","6","6 January 2008"," Brilliant, but NOT a Zombie movie
","Let's get one thing straight first of all. Many reviewers have referred to 'zombies' in this film. It's an easy mistake to make but does colour one's opinion before they have even seen this genuinely frightening tale. Zombies are dead people bought back to life. The 'monsters' in 28 Days Later are still very much alive but infected with the 'Rage Virus', a strange man-made virus that looks like a nasty mixture of rabies and ebola (especially in the way it's passed on).<br/><br/>28 Days Later ranks as one of the most disturbing and genuinely unsettling films I have ever seen, a horror story in the true sense of the word. Other's have drawn parallels with Biohazard, the Romero 'zombie' series and Resident Evil. However, if this film has any real debt for it's inspiration, it must lie with the equally disturbing BBC sci-fi/environmental horror serials of the 1970's: Survivors, The Mad Death, and The Day Of The Triffids. The scene where Jim wakes up in hospital and then walks out into a depopulated and devastated London owes so much to John Duttine's similar journey in Douglas Livingston's superb adaptation of Triffids.<br/><br/>What made this such an unsettling tale was it's relative believability compared with most horror tales. One can imagine the 'Rage Virus' doing it's worst in real life and anyone who can remember how fast the panic over last Summer's Foot and Mouth outbreak spread can identify with much of this story. Viruses, from Ebola to HIV to Rabies and others are genuinely frightening because the spread so fast and infect at will without us puny humans being able to do much to prevent it. While 'Rage' is purely fictional and the premise of man against nature is an old plot, Alex Garland and Danny Boyle have brought more than a few new wrinkles to the table. Together with Matthew Tildsley's superb production design and excellent performances from the cast, 28 Days Later is an effective and chilling film that MUST be seen. Once seen, it won't be forgotten easily. Especially if you watch back to back with the equally impressive (although slightly sillier) sequel 28 Weeks Later."

","A trio of well-meaning animal rights activists break into an experimental lab somewhere in England, intent on freeing the monkeys within. The only problem is that the monkeys, cruelly wired up and forced to watch loops of violent images, have been injected with ""rage,"" a neuro-stimulant which produces uncontrollable homicidal anger. Within seconds, one of the activists has been infected by a monkey bite. 28 Days Later (a ha, we have a title!) nearly all of England, and possibly the rest of the world, has been decimated.<br/><br/>Enter Jim, a young bicycle courier whose last memory was being struck by a car. He wakes up in an empty hospital and soon wanders out into the wasteland that Britain has become with no idea of what has happened while he was asleep. He soon comes face to face with the hordes of infected, as well as with a handful of survivors, including a tough, pretty girl named Selena and a father and daughter who have turned their London flat into a fortress. <br/><br/>I have heard ""28 Days Later"" compared to ""Dawn of the Dead"" (the 1978 version) more than once, although ""28 Days Later"" is not a zombie film, per se. It is indeed a ""plague apocalypse"" film, and a damn good one at that. The infected definitely do resemble zombies...really incredibly FAST zombies; no shuffling Fulci monsters here. The virus spreads quickly and is most often spread by bites from an infected, not unlike the zombie contagion. There's even a free shopping spree scene a la ""Dawn of the Dead."" But there's also a scene like that in ""Night of the Comet"" and I don't hear as many comparisons drawn between that film and DOTD as this one. ""28 Days Later"" is an intelligent, tense and powerful film, more than able to stand on its own no matter what it may or may not have been inspired by. The second half of the film, which finds our small band of heroes ensconced within a pseudo-military base with a handful of crude and desperate soldiers, is more harrowing and tense than any scene up to that point. Once again, it is the humans who are to be feared, not the monsters outside, and a deadly three-way battle between humans, soldiers and infected was both frightening and exhausting to watch. Everyone turns in an excellent performance, and a highly satisfactory ending left me exhilarated.<br/><br/>This is truly one of the best and most original new horror movies I have yet seen."

","this is the first movie i'm rating on imdb because i think it deserves enormous praise.  in my opinion as a student who studies media arts, it is the best movie to come out in the last 3 years at least.<br/><br/>the movie, like any other, isn't without faults, but they are largely too insignificant to detract from this brilliant movie.<br/><br/>most people know danny boyle is a highly regarded director, but he also lucked out in other areas with this movie.  the most important aspect of a work of art will always be the substance, the content.  28 days later is grounded in an exciting and emotional plot.  i thought it was also clever that the makers included 2 filmed endings and 1 storyboard ending.  this way, people that liked the movie and didn't like the way a certain ending sat with them, could watch another one.  if a viewer doesn't like the ending of a movie for some reason or another, it will often put a bad taste in their mouth when reflecting on the movie as a whole.  the plot is untraditional in its organization giving it more interest.  unlike most movies being made right now, the beginning is relatively slow and still, a nice change.  Viewer interpretation is in the forefront instead of concrete plot turns.  on being a horror movie:  this is not your typical horror movie.  there's relatively little gore, but it's scarier than many recent horror movies because of the combined effects of great camera work, unconventional movement and interesting settings.  one of my favorite things boyle does in his movies is he brings it down to a very human, tangible, realistic level.  at one point, jim has to shave without water, and viewers feel his pain and unhappiness.  boyle also seems to love juxtaposition. (examples are the christmas lights in the middle of disheveled london, the countryside where they sleep vs. the city, the red dresses inside the evil, dark house.)  i really like the symbolism used (""HELL...HELP"", white horses)--they hit you much harder than any other method can.  you get a very organic understanding and construction of the emotions of the characters. you'll be surprised how your feelings about jim change from the beginning from the movie to the end.  boyle knows when to follow the rules and when to break them.  one of the rules that is used because it WORKS is the struggle between good and evil.  you know it's being traditional as you watch certain parts of the movie, but you LIKE it.  certain parts closer to the end are conciously traditional (rain when jim struggles). i personally liked the ""damsel in distress"" feeling near the end of the movie.  that motif emotionally satisfies something in the average viewer.  in the end, most women want to be protected because they are loved.  most men like feeling of being needed and being the hero.  enough of that.  those are the highpoints of the plot, characters, story.<br/><br/>
the cast for this movie is perfect.  i had never heard of any of the actors before the movie, but they are far more talented than many run-of-the-mill actors.  boyle was smart to cast appealing looking, but not ""pretty"" people. this makes for a more realistic and engaging movie.<br/><br/>almost everyone who watches this movie is astonished by the beautiful, powerful, interesting camera work.  you can look up the guy's name on the 28 days later website.  without those shots, this movie would not be the work of art many people consider it to be.  certain shots are incredibly lonely and cold, others are terrifying.  it's a visually exciting movie to watch.<br/><br/>
you have to see it to believe it."

","28 Days Later... starts as three animal activists break into 'Cambridge Primate Research Center' & deliberately set loose some caged monkeys, unfortunately unknown to them these monkeys are infected with a highly contagious 'rage' virus which turns the carrier into a ravenous crazy red-eyed zombies... Jump forward '28 Days Later' & Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital bed from a coma, he discovers the hospital & central London completely deserted. Jim is attacked by some of the infected & is saved by Mark (Noah Huntley) & Selena (Naomie Harris) who inform Jim that the entire country has been overrun by infected people who do nothing but kill & spread the virus. Survival is hard & Mark is killed when he becomes infected, with just Jim & Selena left they meet a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) & his young daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) who are also having trouble surviving in London. While trying to listen to the radio they hear a message from a group of soldiers just outside Manchester, the four decide to try & find them & seek help & shelter...<br/><br/>This English French co-production was directed by Danny Boyle & I thought it was OK at best & excruciatingly dull at worst. The script by Alex Garland takes itself 100% seriously & is slow, isn't properly fleshed out & dull. The film felt like it was hours long & it took me three attempts to get through it over two days as it just wasn't holding my interest at all. I hated all the character's, I hated way it was shot, I hated the story & I hated the fact it rips off so many better horror films right down to individual scenes from the likes of The Day of the Trffids (1962) where Jim wakes up in hospital facing a post apocalyptic world, Dawn of the Dead (1978) with the shopping center bit & the zombie kid & Day of the Dead (1985) with the chained up zombie, there are loads more besides. Not enough information about the virus or zombie sis given, in fact we learn virtually nothing about either. The film failed to excite me on any level, I simply didn't care what happened which is why I wasn't bothered about seeing it in one go. For most of the film Jim is passive & rather static until the end when he suddenly turns into a bare chested superhero & takes out an entire army platoon on his own & avoids all the infected zombies running around everywhere, it's far too clichéd & is just a totally unconvincing change in his character. The happy 'Hollywood' ending is also hard to swallow, where exactly did that plane come from? It's only Britian that is infected? It states early in the film that the virus had spread to Paris & New York, if the rest of the world was still 'OK' I cannot believe for the life of me that a highly trained platoon of soldiers wouldn't have radio equipment to contact the outside world, I mean if my cheap mobile can call the opposite side of the world surely they had the equipment to radio for help or at least know that other countries were infection free. After the end credits had finished on the version I saw it said 'What If...' which turns out to be an alternative ending in which Selena & Hannah try to save Jim's life in a hospital but fail & just walk off, this is a slightly more realistic downbeat ending that some may prefer while other's may not. Having said that it's well made & it's watchable on a basic level but it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Director Boyle does his best to ruin the thing, it was shot on a digital camera so it looks grubby & cheap while he totally messes up the horror scenes, why do directors use really fast cuts? You know the sort of thing, scenes which are just annoying hand-held jerky camera movements, a jumble of jump cuts & individual shots that last for less then a second which confuses, frustrates & doesn't allow the audience to see anything. A lot of films are guilty of it & I really don't know why, I don't know a single person who says they like this particular editing technique, not one so why filmmakers continue to use it in abundance I'll never know. Forget about any effective gore as it's blink & you'll miss it stuff because of the fast editing, the most you can make out is some spurting blood. The early scenes set in a deserted London have a certain effective eeriness to them but that's as good as 28 days Later... gets.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 28 Days Later... is well made for what it is but it's not that stylish. The acting from a largely unknown cast is OK but I absolutely hated all the character's in the thing which made it impossible to like the film or care about them.<br/><br/>28 Days Later... was hugely disappointing, I was expecting a lot but I felt let down in every area. I will still give it a decent score as it's OK but there are just too many things about it I didn't like. Worth a watch but just don't expect a masterpiece."

","How can the maker of superb films like Trainspotting and Shallow Grave make something as bad as this? I started with high hopes, based on good reviews, but it all began to fall apart within the first few minutes, with Cillian Murphy wandering through an empty London in silly green pyjamas, shouting ""hello"". And it went rapidly downhill after that. The earlier London scenes were splattered with inconsistencies, such as bodies and warning notices everywhere, although both had been conspicuously absent during Murphy's initial bewildered stroll through London.<br/><br/>The later scenes, with brutal squaddies in a stately home near Manchester, got even sillier, descending to the absurdities of the two females in ball gowns, while Murphy, bare-chested, turns super-hero. The final scene, echoing the early ""hello"", must be one of the most pathetic endings in British cinema - I'm just surprised I stayed with the movie long enough for this final disappointment."
"BSchin2188","1","3","7","22 March 2004"," How NOT to make a horror film...
","Many people say that Danny Boyle is a gifted film maker.  I will say that his directing in this movie is pretty good, and there were some good ideas. But all in all, I think that this movie would be better used as a torture method on prisoners of war.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the beginning.  The massive virus outbreak being started by environmental activists?  Pure genius.  A great touch of irony here.  Some other things that I liked were the freaky zombies, and the all around good acting.<br/><br/>Now, for what I didn't like.  This may take a bit...<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was the music.  During a horror movie, when the scary stuff starts to fly and the action runs high, it's typical that you play scary music.  Now, I'm all for breaking the norms in movies for something good, but playing classical/opera music during the horror scenes was a terrible idea.  I am convinced that someone forgot to take their medication when the musical score was being selected.  Not only did the director choose opera music for zombie food-fests, but it wasn't even scary opera music. Something cool and creepy like Bach's Tocatta and Fugue, D minor would have worked.  But Boyle chose to go with nice, happy classical music, thus negating any and all potential terror to be had.<br/><br/>Next, the military men being type-casted once again as sex-craved maniacs. Sure, they disguised this stereotype with ""the need for procreation"", but the military is already seen as sex-crazed, horny people with guns.  My friends and myself all saw this turn a long way coming, and I could literally hear people in the theatre audience complaining.  One woman behind me said to her boyfriend ""What?  More horny, evil army guys?  I thought that this film was going to be something original!"".  So much for her wishes, huh?<br/><br/>And Jim, for an average guy with no mentioned military training, was pretty good at taking out those army people.  He never missed a shot, out-foxed them all, and would put a 6-man Delta Force to shame.  Hand this guy a contract and send him to airborne school!  A naturally born special forces op, what are the odds?<br/><br/>Well, my list of gripes is getting pretty long, so I will cut to the chase. There was no need for the poor musical selection, I saw the ""big plot twist"" coming shortly after the opening credits wrapped, and an entire military force missing one guy that just grabbed a gun and started shooting.  Save your time, and watch ""Night of the Living Dead"" instead.  Now, that's a zombie movie!"
"Iesius","1","3","7","23 January 2004"," This Movie Stinks
","The premise behind this film fails to keep my interests because what goes on after the initial virus hit is so unrealistic that it cannot induce fear in me.  A virus turns ordinary people into rage-filled zombies killing most of England's population.  Fair enough.  The power there goes out and contact with the outside world is lost.  The characters assume the worst, they think the rest of the world has suffered the same fate as England, and don't even try to get off the island.  Unfortunately for the story writer no one ever told him about things like that radios still pick up signals from France or that a smart character, you know, the kind you care about, might try to use a boat to get off the island.  What about the Chunnel? Heck some people can swim across the English Channel.  Instead the characters listen to their radio which tells them to come to the British Army...and what a great army it is, because after only one month they have degenerated into a bunch of power-driven thieving rapists -- doesn't Brittan have one of the top 5 armies in the world!??! Yet in the film they can't keep discipline for 4 weeks...unbelievable.  Pepsi is everywhere, annoying!  And odd seeing as the stuff is hard to find in England.  So poorly written, and as for the tagline on the commercials ""scariest movie since the exorcist.""  Wow, they want the viewer to think taking a digital cam quarter and zooming in and out again really fast is scary?  Or that people making some of the dumbest decisions ever, and paying for them with their lives is scary? Now I know why I haven't been scared of a movie since I was a kid.  Movies like this make me dead inside."

It has all been done before, many times.<br/><br/> It is interesting to figure out how under such duress the characters in this movie can continuously come up with nice new fashion outfits, all while they are fleeing for their lives in absolute terror.They must be consumer zombies, which is kind of horrifying, but not at all in the way I had wanted, or expected. Sure,it's the end of the world, but why stop shopping?<br/><br/> In the end, the movie puts forward the idea that the army guys that are there to protect them, are the real monsters, worse even than the murderous hoards.  I reckon that is what some people prefer to believe, and you have to hope that they never have the opportunity to test out their theories in a truly bad situation, where things have fallen apart and they need help.

"wavelengthgames","1","3","7","30 June 2003"," So many holes, so little time.
","Spoilers Warning.  If you haven't seen it, all you need to know is that it's dumb, loud, semi-gory, and souless.  If you still want to see it, then don't read on because I'll ""spoil"" (if it's possible to ruin this movie further) the plotline and ending.<br/><br/>First of all, there is no empathy for any of the main characters.  Life is so cheapened, virutally from the opening scenes when ""Mark"" is remorselessly hacked up by his companion Selena (within minutes of us getting to know him), that you accept the other characters are just so much fodder.  The feeble attempt to establish humanity for Jim by trekking to his parents house only made him more contempable.  He's a bicycle messenger who sponges off his parents and his ""flashback"" consists of guzzling their orange juice straight from the carton.  Oops, sorry Dad, I drank it all!  Sniff, Sniff.<br/><br/>The only character with any sort of humanity, Frank, is then killed off in a stupid fashion, with a single drop of zombie blood hitting his eye.  This, after all of them have had countless hackfests with bloodspurting zombies and never managing to get a drop in their mouth or eyes - come on.<br/><br/>His loving, devoted daughter shows about as much remorse for Frank's death as Selena did when she hacked Mark into cordwood.  Even Selena has to remind Jim, ""How do you think she feels, she just lost her dad"".  I was with Jim on this one, I couldn't tell how she felt either.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the Zombies.  Why exactly would they go seeking out only the uninfected?  Why wouldn't they fight each other?  They don't attack for food, just sport, so why wouldn't another Zombie make a good target?  The scene in the military courtyard is just too much.  Here's a chained up Zombie just looking to get at the commander and what does he do - he pukes on the ground.  Didn't he see the excorcist?  He could have just hurled at him!  Or at least spit - and the commander obliges by even putting his face right down next to the enraged Zombie.<br/><br/>Then there's the forced relationship between Jim and Selena, which culminates in a zombie bloodied kiss. (you can't tell me they didn't get infected on that kiss). You never get the idea that they really care for each other so much as they want to stay on each others good side.  So, the characters are not sympathetic.  To me, if you're going to be scared, you have to care about who's being threatened.  In the case of 28 days, you never care.<br/><br/>Since I didn't know the ending of the movie going in, I was sort of surprised.  I see by reading other reviews that some people still don't get it.  *SPOILER WARNING*  The virus is contained to the UK! Ok, so that might make for a good plot had the movie been well made, but here's the problem. Jim is made wise to the fact that the UK has been quarantined by the ravings of the Sargent, and then by seeing the plane go overhead.  You can't tell me, that in 28 days, the other survivors did not see or hear a plane go overhead!  C'mon people, the world was supposed to be reduced to savages. How many regularly scheduled planes would fly over UK airspace on a normal day?   That and the fact that the military was obviously searching for the uninfected.<br/><br/>So, in summary, the characters are wooden, the plot is full of holes and it's not scary."
"126steve","1","3","7","12 November 2002"," Seen it before and done much better
","It's a very basic plot. Our hero awakes from some sort of sleep or coma to find that the entire human race has been wiped out. Surely, you're on to a winner straight away. H. G. Wells thought so, John Wyndham thought so, Matthew Graham thought so, Clive Exton thought so, Steven King thought so!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Need I go on? Now Alex Garland thinks so and he's right. He has written a very nice screenplay indeed. It could have been made into a great film. But it wasn't.<br/><br/>I hate being harsh and a critic in the worse sense of the word but this film is shocking (and not in the way they wanted it to be).<br/><br/>
As illustrated above we have seen this idea many, many times but that in itself isn't a problem. What is a problem is that all the opportunities that the script gave for suspense were missed. I was left with the feeling that the direction was a triumph of style over substance. Worst than that, the style obliterated the substance.<br/><br/>The start of the film feels like very average TV fare, and by the end, it (and I honestly hate to be so harsh) descends into a first year student film. It isn't helped in this respect by the acting (which isn't helped by the casting). I must say at this point that I am not referring to the above the line cast who were by and large fine (Brendan Gleeson is first rate - the only part of the film that has any poignancy). I won't go into story details but the second half of the film involves a platoon of soldiers. It is here when we lose any semblance of reality. I know that we are of course dealing with a fantasy and practical reality isn't always necessary for that but for any drama to work you have to have emotional reality- you have to believe in these characters in this situation, however fantastical. You can be sure that when Mr. Garland was sat at his keyboard creating these soldiers, he could see how scary and threatening they could be if we believed in them. Unfortunately, due to some (sorry) terrible acting, miscasting, and weak actor direction, we can't. They become a joke, (Not the Scots Sergeant, he comes out of it OK), so we lose the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>All in all I would rather have been at home watching Holby City."

","***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** Obviously, I'm going to write a negative review here. Much of what I'd like to say already has been in the negative review section, so I'll get in some other points in addition to the old stand-by complaints.<br/><br/>This is definitely the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. Some people may not like Resident Evil, but at least the T-Virus made sense in that movie. The Rage Virus is retarded. Why do the infected only attack non-infected? Why are the streets and highways almost entirely devoid of cars? Why would the Manchester fire drive the zombies out if they are attracted to light? There are so many common-sense aspects that are fouled up because the creators stretch suspension of disbelief miles beyond the breaking point.<br/><br/>It was interesting for me to look at this movie from the point of view of a film student. At points, the acting was not too bad. There were some interesting camera angles, and I admire some of the imagery, but this makes the wastefulness of the film all the more apparent. I commend the film crew's ability to make a major city appear vacant. Unfortunately, I believe the reason the streets were shown so bare was as a way of showing off technical ability while it completely raped reality. You know what I call that? I call it a waste of money and special effects. The streets should have been crammed with cars filled with mutilated bodies. That would have shown off special effects and made much more sense.<br/><br/>Many have complained that the movie is boring. If you realize this but can't quite place your finger on why, I'll tell you. Shot duration. The amount of time spent on looking at uninteresting things is unreal. This is one of the most elementary components to movie making, and apparently Danny Boyle just doesn't get it. IT'S BLOODY BORING TO WATCH SOME IDIOT WANDER AROUND THE STREETS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A ROOF FOR ABOUT 35 SECONDS, DANNY! Also the script was very poorly written. I'm not averse to movies that contain necessary cursing (such as in war movies and the like). But when 3/4 of a script is the F-word, it just sounds unintelligent and shoddy. The other quarter of the talking was either unoriginal story lines or someone mumbling such gems as: ""So, but... Um, yeah. Okay."" The real tragedy here is that now this concept has already been used. Even if someone would use the better ideas that formed part of the concept of the movie and made a good show with it, people would say that they were copying off this pile of crap.<br/><br/>The only thing I learned is that enviro-wackos will be the death of us all."

Also Brendan Gleeson stars as one of the survivors, and Christopher Eccleston as the military squad leader.<br/><br/>The team of director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland has given us an exciting, action packed, and eerily atmosphere horror movie.

I wish it could of being a little longer but not dragged out at the end and making the film happy. Some scenes upset me especially when the young girls Dad had to be killed after getting the virus.

","28 days later is a sci-fi horror film directed by Danny Boyle and produced by Andrew MacDonald. I did not see it when it came out because i was not that much into horror at that time. I saw it for the first time a few years ago and watched it again just before writing this review.<br/><br/>This is one of my top 100 favorite movies of all time for sure. Although the actors are not that known they do an excellent job. The action is tense and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot is well structured and has no gaps or what so ever.<br/><br/>What makes this film so unique is that it introduces us a new ""zombie race"". These ""infected people"" don't resemble at all the classical Romero style of zombies. The infected people can run very fast and be killed more easily. They also need to remain in a dark place since they cannot stand sunlight.<br/><br/>This movie is also one of the only horror movies that try to send a message to the audience. In this case we are warned that infections and viruses are not taken too seriously and that they can develop into something similar to what's shown in the film: spreading fast and killing people.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the best 21th century horror films. I recommend this film to zombie fans since it has got loads of them and also horror fans that are looking for a modern classic.<br/><br/>9/10"
"imdbbl","Null","2","4","5 December 2009"," Nice British post-apocalyptic tale
","28 Days Later is a British post-apocalyptic horror/science fiction film that depicts the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors to cope with the ruination of the life they once knew. Although a critical and commercial success, I only got the chance to watch this today. I was quite surprised with this film. The director Danny Boyle, who is now best known for the multiple Oscar winning film, Slumdog Millionaire, showed a very interesting and unique vision. His post-apocalyptic tale borrows some elements from other films but at the same time its like no other. The first act is definitely the best; a disorientated Jim (Cilian Murpy) wakes up in the hospital only to find out that he's alone. There's not one single person in the hospital or outside. Jim has no idea of what happen or of what's going on and as he wanders in the streets we get to see several shots of a deserted London accompanied by atmospheric instrumental music and it makes for a very cool and effective scene. At some point Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomi Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley).They break it down to Jim, a contagious virus was accidentally released and most of the population is either infected or dead. The infected ( they're basically zombies ) show no sign of human behavior and only care about killing. Later on Mark gets killed and Jim and Selena are joined by Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The four of them desperately try to stay alive and after hearing a transmission on the radio they decide to go to Manchester where supposedly are a group of survivors. There is some violence and gore, but apart from a scene towards the end, nothing too strong or particularly disgusting. Cilian Murphy is tremendous as the lead character and he's the only actor worth mentioning because the others don't get that much screen time or attention. The film reminds me a lot of The Last Man On Earth, and the third act, which involves some moral dilemmas, reminds me a bit of Blindness but, remember, both this films came after Boyle's film. Overall, 28 Days Later is an original, tense and thrilling film with a very unique vision.<br/><br/>7/10"
"bobbyallright","5","2","4","10 December 2007"," great idea but then it bombs
","I give it half points because the movie started out great and then nose dived during the second half. All the excitement over this movie shows that people really bought into the idea of a virus killing most of the population and there being only a few survivors running and fighting against it. The idea is really good. Even the beginning where they explain how the virus stared with scientific experiments with chips. Then the introduction of our character awaking in a hospital very uncertain as to where all the people have gone and what has happened to them. Then meeting up with other survivors and coming across the army transmission and the their new mission to find the military camp of supposed safety. All of this was great. But then when they finally got to the soldiers camp the movie just lost it. It's as if the writers didn't know what to do next so they threw up their hands and drove the movie right into the ground. Sort of like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" where you have a story line going and then in the 2nd half of the movie you bring in the cheap idiot script to finish the movie because you haven't thought that far ahead. In both movies you have this journey to a specific place, and then once that place is reached you can't just end the movie because you need to fill in one more hour of filming. So slash everyone to pieces with senseless gore. In 28 Days the supposedly safe military guys turn evil and want to rape the women and there are then fights within the camp and along with the infected that eventually get access to the inside. Completely and unbelievably stupid. The sequel 28 Weeks Later did a better job of not destroying the 2nd half and for that I commend them. But I must bash the sequel for its stupid and unbelievable characters. The first movie did a better job with developing the characters and making them believable (the first half of the movie that is). So finally I can say that the movie has a great idea , but they just did a terrible job with it in both movies for different reasons."

","28 DAYS LATER is not a ""zombie"" film per se, it is actually about people who become infected with a virus that makes them act zombie-like. The story centers around a small group of people who have managed to dodge the virus and look for safety in a city that is quickly becoming over-run with these ""things"". When the group finds that there is really no safe place in the city, they decide to make a mad dash for supplies and then to run for the country-side, hoping that there will be less of a virus-riddled population there. They then come upon a military installation who vow to protect them, but being that one of the group is the only female to be found, things quickly turn sour.<br/><br/>Very little to complain about in 28 DAYS LATER. The one big problem I had is how the ""action"" sequences were filmed. Whenever any violence was shown on film, the camera would shake uncontrollably, and you could see no details of what was happening. This tends to annoy the sh!t out of me, because I like to see the graphic action up-close without the ""cut-aways"" or shaky camera tricks. I realize that it seems to be the trend nowdays to do weird camera tricks, but I still hate it. Not enough to ruin the film, but knocked it down a point in my book. Pretty original story, great performances - an all-around winner. Check this one out...8/10"
"trillian28","9","2","4","6 September 2005"," Intelligent Zombie-like Horror
","Usually, when a genre begins to spoof and make meta-comments about itself, it means that the genre is dying. This was the case with Westerns and musicals, but somehow, the meta-flick ""Scream"" and the spoof series ""Scary Movie"" seem to have revitalized the horror genre. The last few years have seen a number of fresh new angles on the horror archetypes, including ""The Others,"" ""The Ring"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."" The best of the new crop of re-energized horror/thrillers is definitely ""28 Days Later."" The premise of the film is that a bio-engineered virus turns regular humans into mindless, hungry killers, turning England into a post-apocalyptic war zone in the space of 28 days. During this time, Jim (Cillian Murphy, of ""Batman"") has been in a coma. He wakes up in this nightmare, and with the help of some fellow survivors tries to find a way to escape.<br/><br/>The movie was criticized by ""Shaun of the Dead"" (also brilliant) for not being a true zombie movie: the zombie-like monsters are not dead, and they move with uncharacteristic speed. Still, the premise of the comatose hero was stolen gracefully in Robert Kirkman's ""Walking Dead"" comic, and in the forward to that comic, it says that what defines a good zombie story, more than anything, is the way human protagonists react to their situation-- when everything we have ever known, and ever wanted, becomes useless, how do we keep going?<br/><br/>That is what makes this movie spectacular. Indeed, the zombies are not even the scariest villains-- the things that man does to man (and a little girl) in this movie are much more horrifying. At the same time, characters must sacrifice themselves to save the innocent, they must steal in order to survive, and at every step, they must question their morals, their priorities, and discover what makes them human. This film is a tremendous achievement, intelligent and gripping, that can be enjoyed by fans of genre and mainstream movies alike."

","I have to say I liked this film a lot. It was different than some other horror movies I've seen. Sure, it borrowed from some of George Romero's films, but it still was original in it's own way. I liked the fact that it was filmed digitally. It really gave the movie a gritty, real feeling. The performances were great. Especially Cillian Murphy, as Jim. He fit his character very well. This is the first UK Horror/sci-fi film I've seen, and it was refreshing to get away from typical Teen slashers. I cared about the characters here, to me they were very likable, and realistic. I recommend. It's like Dawn of The Dead meets Lord Of The Flies."
"DarrenHorne","4","2","4","7 March 2005"," Could have been so much better.
","Danny Boyle moves into the horror genre with this zombie film with a twist. Combined with the writing talent of Alex (The Beach) Garland, this had the potential to be a fresh and contemporary take on the classic zombie horrors such as those by George Romeros. It fails miserably.<br/><br/>Animal activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Centre and find caged chimps surrounded by a continuous video stream of war, anger and hate. Somehow the scientists have created a virus of pure rage, and these animals are infected with it. The well-meaning activists then free a chimp, which viciously assaults them, spreading the virus. <br/><br/>28 days later a bewildered Jim (Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find the hospital, and the rest of London, silent and empty. He wanders the deserted streets looking for any sign of life. But the people he comes across have been infected and are now rabid, blood thirsty, rage crazed zombies. Two other survivors (Huntley and Harris) come to his rescue and explain what has happened. They later join up with a taxi driver, Frank (Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Burns). Together they set off for Manchester, which is the origin of a military radio broadcast offering sanctuary and a cure. There they meet Major West (Eccleston) who has brutal and pessimistic answers to their predicament.<br/><br/>Images of a deserted London, wiped clean of humanity by a virus, are both terrifying and shocking, especially as the threat of biological terror attacks nag at all of our minds. The hellish visuals of Manchester consumed by fire snuff out any sense of hope and give a sense of post apocalyptic loneliness. The despair, that haunts every scene, increases when the characters reach the army ""safe haven"". The action scenes are few and far between, but they hit hard and fast, shattering the deathly silence with violent, heart-stopping gore fests. In between there is little suspense or tension, and the slow pacing leaves us craving that next attack. None of the characters are likable, due to awful dialogue and poor decision making. This isn't helped by Burns, whose terribly performance destroys any illusion of realism and constantly reminds us that this is just a film. <br/><br/>Its only redeeming feature is its subtext of the fragility of civilised society and how quickly we become savage and cruel when there is no authority to answer to.<br/><br/>An unsettling film that could have been so much more, especially when compared to the superb low budget werewolf film, Dog Soldiers. Top marks for effort though."
"resimaster","2","2","4","28 February 2005"," Complete and utter rip off.
","Not only is this film boring and dull, but it is also no where near as original as everyone thinks.<br/><br/>The whole virus concept has been used millions of times- e.g.Resident Evil (i hate the film but I'm using it here as an example. The games are much better)so why does everyone think that 28 is so great? Also, this is NOT a zombie film. Zombies don't run and we are told that these people are infected with 'rage'. Yeah, we all feel like that sometimes don't we? These are called 'the infected' as if that gives them some sort of excuse... I am a student and i went for an interview at Salisbury College where i was told lots of people helped to make the 'zombies' for 28. See, people don't know what zombies are any more...<br/><br/>The whole storyline is ripped off a book called 'Plague' that i read in year 8 about the black death. It has the deserted London setting, and comes complete with a young girl coming home to find her parents dead in bed together having left her a note. Really Danny Boyle, Trainspotting was great but cant you be that original more often with your films? For my last point, everyone says how great the opening is with Jim coming out of the hospital and seeing deserted London, but I've got news for you. Its already been done! If you have ever seen 'Day of the Triffids' then you will know that the film opens with a meteor shower and then a man wakes up in a hospital with signs of chaos, things knocked over and glass broken, then he walks outside and finds that London is silent and deserted. He even walks past a bus lying on its side. <br/><br/>I think that if Danny Boyle wanted this film to be any sort of a tribute then he should have made it clear in the documentaries."

","I'll start by telling a bit of the story. There is an awful virus spreading fast throughout the world.As soon as you get in touch with this virus, you transform irreversible into an unscrupulous killing machine... You can't quite call the victims of the virus zombies because they were never buried under the ground,but to make it easier for myself, i'll stick to zombies.The weird thing about ""28 Days Later"" is that the zombies don't move like they just drank 3 bottles of gin like in traditional zombie movies.No, these zombies are fast and very mobile too.And that is something that makes them, in a strange way, less threatening than for example the zombies in ""Night of the Living Dead"". Especially in the first half of the movie, director Danny Boyle is still very good at what he does: the beginning feels like an uppercut and the streets of London are very scary, if it wasn't for the unfitting guitar sounds. But as soon as the main characters leave the big city and arrive at a castle full of horny soldiers, the movie bleeds to death.No more scary images,the actors start acting very poor and this second half of the movie ends in an old fashion and routinely slasher party... George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" remains the ultimate zombie movie.Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" is a very mediocre zombie movie because it just can't scare me."

The whole film could be played out as a series of still frames with no sound as each shot is fresh, imaginative and tells us a little bit more about the story, the characters or the situation.<br/><br/>Although it may sound as if the whole film is based on superficial shots that are there to please the eye, it is certainly not the case. It is impossible to point out any aspect of the film that is a let down.<br/><br/>The acting is real quality, Cillian Murphy gives an utterly convincing performance as Jim who is trying to come to terms with the situation he finds himself in, making even the line, ""Hello"", memorable! Naomie Harris puts in a real composed and confident turn. But the man who really stands out in this film for me is Brendan Gleeson, he really is a cracking actor, he plays 'Frank' with so much warmth that you genuinely care for him. The three characters (and the actors) along with Frank's daughter really work well together.<br/><br/>The sound is amazing, the accurate choice of music for each scene can be compared to that of ""The Shining"".

"heroicstranger","Null","2","4","8 December 2004"," Badly thought out ideas ruin this movie
","A number of problems spoiled this movie for me so much so that I really struggle to watch it any more.<br/><br/>The story is very derivative and that in itself isn't a problem but there are a number of ill conceived ideas within the story that really annoy me.<br/><br/>Firstly, any government research laboratory that was engineering a biological weapon such as rage would have far more security than one technician. So, the whole idea of three animal rights activists breaking in and freeing the Chimps was ludicrous. I know that nothing else was shown and it is possible that there was more security but this should have been more than implied  a simple way of getting around this would been to have had an accident happening with one of the scientists  have one of them get bitten which would have made far more sense but would also have been a bit more poetic.<br/><br/>Another major problem with the movie was the speed at which the virus infected its victims  you get bitten and within seconds you are an unreasoning creature who only exists to infect others. So, how would that kind of pattern spread much further than the South of England let alone the rest of Europe and possibly the world? I mean the infected didn't seem to have any real sense of purpose apart from their rage so if an infected person was bitten at an airport then they wouldn't have boarded a plane and even if they had then they would have infected the entire plane  including the pilots eventually and the plane would have crashed. Same with any for of transport  the virus would not have spread too far at all. Of course  this could have been solved in my opinion by establishing that the individuality of people's metabolisms meant that some people were infected in seconds  with some it took hours. This would have meant that the virus could have spread and it would have also created a lot more tension in certain scenes.<br/><br/>There were other things  the male character who initially saved Jim told a story about how he survived a mass attack of the infected in Waterloo station (or whatever station it was) and how he survived by climbing onto a kiosk stand. So, did this mean that once the infected had infected everyone at ground level then they would have seen him seven feet off the ground and decided that he was too high up?<br/><br/>London was deserted, which made for some eerily beautiful and evocative shots  but surely there should have been hundreds of bodies lying about the place? Not everyone would have survived the attacks and there would have been no-one to have disposed of the bodies. <br/><br/>The roads to Manchester were deserted  again, there should have been cars everywhere. In fact at one point a character says that under normal circumstances it would take around six hours to get to Manchester but in this case who knows? Well, judging by the emptiness of the roads then it would have taken about three hours. At no point until they arrived at the roadblock were there any signs that the country had been infected by a super plague. No other roadblocks, no military vehicles burnt out or abandoned  hardly any infected  the list goes on.<br/><br/>This film which has some nice ideas and beautiful shots seems to fumble absolutely everything that it does. Cliché is heaped upon cliché and ultimately doesn't make an awful lot of sense. The finale with Jim becoming Martin Sheens character from 'Apocalypse Now' makes no sense  a bike courier who has, after all, been in a coma for a month suddenly becomes fit and capable enough to take out some trained soldiers? Again, this could have been solved by having the house at the end being occupied by other survivors  maybe with one soldier in charge. The whole, clichéd, idea that the military would have gone insane in a month was tired and slightly insulting.<br/><br/>It's a shame because I love post apocalyptic thrillers but this one was let down by some poorly thought out ideas."

The virus soon gets out and pretty much decimates the entire population of London.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later,"" we're introduced to the formerly comatose Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up in a deserted hospital and proceeds to walk the eerily silent streets of London.

A newspaper caught in the wind informs him that a virus got loose and transformed people into madmen.<br/><br/>He meets Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) and together the three of them stalk the lonely streets of this dark and dangerous metropolis that's teeming with the deadly ""infected."" They meet Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) and together, they all set off into the country in search of a possible cure for the virus and safety, which is at an isolated mansion that has been heavily fortified by a loose platoon of soldiers, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), and soon Jim and party realize that they are up against something much more sinister.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later..."" has been dubbed by some genre purists as a ""zombie flick,"" but director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland have insisted it isn't and I'm inclined to agree with them. Though ""28 Days Later..."" was greatly influenced by the works of American director George A. Romero (who made the daring ""Living Dead"" trilogy and basically defined a new genre of horror film-making), it's not a zombie flick because the so-called ""living dead"" in this movie are still technically alive, just... ""infected.""<br/><br/>That's about all I'm going to say about that, instead I'm going to turn my focus to the craft and ingenuity that went into this film's production. Even if one wants to call it a zombie flick (I'm not going to disagree with anyone that does), the horror and gore take a backseat to a larger social question about human nature: Is it in our blood to kill?<br/><br/>Alex Garland might think so, since the virus has to be in the blood to infect its victim and transform them into what they are in the film. And if someone does get infected, any survivors around have 20 seconds (or is it 30?) to kill them before the infected individual has a chance to wreak havoc.<br/><br/>I missed this movie when it laid siege to the theaters last summer and proceeded to scare the daylights out of its viewers. But in today's times, an observant person might assume that this movie provides a valuable commentary about the dangerous days that we're living in. The American people are scared and ""28 Days Later..."" may have provided the jolts we needed to shake us out of our disillusionment with modern times.<br/><br/>An MTV (MTV?) special I watched a while ago talked about how people want to be scared out of their wits nowadays; just look at the massive success of movies like ""Cabin Fever"" (another movie about a deadly virus on the loose) or Zack Snyder's remake of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which was released earlier this year.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later..."" is an eerie and frightening film that I highly recommend to any horror fan or anyone who wants to escape reality and slip into another darker, deadlier one.<br/><br/>10/10"

"howard_offtherails","10","2","4","10 February 2004"," Proof that British thrillers can really be great
","I can't understand most of the criticisms that have been made against 28 Days Later. This is not supposed to be a chronicle of how the world would deal with infectious disease. It is about how people - different people - would react to such a situation, given incomplete information and the complete breakdown (and disappearance) of society.<br/><br/>The main character - the principle principal as it were - is Jim. 28 Days Later really centres around his movements and thoughts. He moves through the film in search of a father figure, eventually learning to take control of his own survival. If that premise sounds corny and familiar, its execution is anything but.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the characters' situation moves on and things get better for them. From the underground shop where Jim spends his first night, to Frank's fortified tower block and, later, the stately home outside Manchester where the film finishes, we see progressively better conditions.<br/><br/>However, this sanctuary also serves as the greatest threat to the characters' survival. I won't give away any details, but Christopher Ecclestone's performance is utterly believable and the final plot twist provided (at least for me) a genuine surprise. Thus, the story loses neither pace nor focus at any point. All-in-all, it's a great story and a satisfying experience.<br/><br/>28 Days Later may be magnificent, but its presentation on DVD is even better. Many films get a DVD release with a poor selection of making-of documentaries, unfunny footage of the cast messing around, pointless trailers and terrible deleted scenes.<br/><br/>The technology is put to its best use when taken completely seriously. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have put a huge amount of effort into the DVD release - providing an informative and engaging commentary of the film, including an alternative ending that was never even shot. No matter, though - a storyboard has been drawn up and the writer and director read from the script to fill in the rest of the movie. It is an intimate experience - almost as though you are sat in a room with your mates.<br/><br/>The on-disc documentary - ""Pure Rage"" - sensibly avoids being sycophantic drivel. It's a genuinely interesting look at the production process as well as a crash-course in infectious disease - better than a lot of TV documentaries!<br/><br/>Altogether, the film itself is superb, and the DVD is a valuable addition to anyone's collection - if you like to think from time to time, of course."

Story starts out in England where a bunch of activists break into a lab to take pictures of the chimpanzees that are being experimented on and they let one go and it attacks the first person it comes across. Turns out the chimps are infected with a ""Rage"" virus that spreads by bites or contact with blood or saliva. 28 days later a bicycle messenger named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in the hospital all alone and starts walking the streets of London finding no one. He discovers in a church a bunch of zombies that start chasing him and he runs into two other survivors named Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who help him. One night they are attacked again and Mark is cut. Selena quickly kills him and explains to Jim that you have only 10 to 20 seconds to kill someone after they are infected. Later they spot lights in a building and go to check it out and they find a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Through a hand crank radio they listen to a radio signal that says all survivors should come to their compound for safety. The four of them pile into Franks cab and head to where the signal stated to go. Along the way Frank becomes infected and is shot by the military men outside of the compound. Inside they meet Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) who with his band of men have barricaded themselves into an area for survival. Soon they learn that Selena and Hannah are to be used for breeding purposes to continue the race. The film is directed by Danny Boyle who also helmed ""Train-spotting"" and he again shows a good visual flair in his films no matter how low budget. This film is shot with digital cameras and it gives it a realistic documentary feel that reminded me of some of Steven Soderbergh's films like ""Traffic"". The story is very reminiscent of ""Last Man on Earth"" and its remake ""The Omega Man. In fact, in ""The Omega Man"" Charlton Heston teams up with a black female and that is exactly what happens here. The best performance in this film comes from Harris who shows a strong screen presence and it will be interesting to watch her career develop. She steals every scene she is in and she's a definite up and comer. This film doesn't really offer anything that we have not seen before and I kept waiting for something different to occur but it never happens. There are some questions that never get answered like why don't the zombies just feed on one another? And how long does it take before they die of starvation? This film has nothing new to offer but it is competently made with an effective visual style that enhances the many quiet scenes that take place. Along with the performance of Harris I found this an adequate science fiction film that fans of this genre should definitely check out. Nothing thought provoking, but effective in its own way."
"kay321","10","2","4","9 July 2003"," Finally a smart fun horror flick with a totally drool worthy lead.
","This movie ROCKED!!! Not only has Danny Boyle made the first zombie movie with zombies that are actually scary, but he's also managed to make an intelligent film that asks (if not answers) some interesting questions about human nature and what it means to survive. Boyle offers up for our consideration three very different possible forms of survival, i.e. Selena and Mark's, Frank and Hannah's, or the Army boys', each of which seems to work just fine up until it is threatened by the ideas of another. Is survival itself the only  thing that's important? Would one method of survival work better than another?  Is there a morally 'better' way of continuing when the world has gone to hell?  Does  morally exist in the face of extinction and death? Would the rest of the  world quarantine Britain and sacrifice its people to protect itself? Perhaps the  film never truly answers these questions, perhaps it doesn't even try, but the fact  is, it brought them up and I could kiss the writer for doing that. Too often horror films, and films of other genres rely so heavily on the conventions of their types  that they fail to ask the questions which naturally arise from their subjects and I  commend the makers of 28 Days Later for not falling into this idiotic, mind- numbing routine. Also, I think it brilliant that the filmmakers were able to create  such and tense and thrilling atmosphere given the relatively few shots and sequence with the zombies. The music, the cinematography and the editing all come together in this film to deliver classic horror movie chills which had me  glued to my seat my knees pulled into my chest the whole time. And finally the  characters, and they are great characters, were so evidently what the filmmakers chose to focus on and for good reason. Jim and Selena both cores of the film are a fabulous horror film pair, I love strong women in horror films,  and i think that the players did fabulous jobs with making the audience empathize, and genuinely care for them.  I think they are two fabulous young actors and I for one wish them great success."
"jbar19","6","2","4","18 June 2003"," Potentially very good movie sunk by plot holes
","OK, the film makers get great marks for some impressive and powerful footage of an abandoned London. The acting was very strong and the film moves at a crisp pace. Overall, the film accomplishes a lot on an obvious shoe string budget.<br/><br/>But this script could have used a rewrite or two. The story is too contrived. There are too many implausibilities to ignore. If the author could have made the story more believable this could have been a powerful movie. Perhaps, the budget was too tight to resolve the major plot holes.<br/><br/>
The whole virus should have been explained a little more. It just seems to be an excuse to introduce 'classic' zombies into the movie. The scenes with the soldiers are just the writer's attempt to make a 'Lord of the Flies' type of statement and should have been omitted as they distract from the terror of the main characters fleeing from Zombie London.<br/><br/>The idea of a handful of people surviving a virus that wiped out a city is good. The fact that the survivors are hunted by the virus victims is great. But this movie quickly takes a wrong turn and just ends up as another hack and slash revenge flick.<br/><br/>In a nutshell I was disappointed by this movie. It was stylish, clever and well paced and acted, but the story itself is too flawed to be taken seriously. This movie was 3 rewrites away from being great.<br/><br/>It had me, then it lost me."

"comicboy-95358","7","0","0","12 May 2020"," Not very satisfying ending(s) and weird editing
","So I rented this movie on Google Play: Movies and TV and wasn't really expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did, but I spent as long writing this review as I did watching the movie. So I'm going to start off by taking about what I liked and then talk about what I didn't really like.<br/><br/>So the first thing I liked is that it was kind of funny, yet I don't think it was intended to. It seemed like it was supposed to be a serious movie but I was laughing more than I was actually being scared. The moments that made me laugh were the shopping scene, the rat scene, when the military zombie is revealed and the character Private Jones (almost every scene he is in.) Anway I started off with this because comedy is subjective, and it was one of the first things that I could think of to compliment it about.<br/><br/>Speaking of being scared, the truth is that I wasn't, it was startling at times, like when there was screeching and breaking windows (I can't really blame anyone for that because the virus is called ""rage"" after all.) and when the zombie broke through the window and when the little boy zombie ran out and jumped on Jim. There were some disturbing moments but the editing doesn't help convey any of that.<br/><br/>Now as far as the story it goes, its kind of a thing but I couldn't tell you if I had the right idea of what it was exactly or not. But one thing I can say is that it has two examples that I can think of that can explain how to have an emotional death scene and how not to. So we'll start of with the death that I didn't think was very emotional. It was the first kill of the movie, which was Mark, he explains how his family had the idea of escaping by plane but he lost his family in the crowd and had to climb over other people and he saw his infected father. In the next scene he is somehow bitten, and as soon as the other two notice the woman chops his arm off and then pretty much butcher the poor guy offscreen. (Once again the horrible editing gets in the way so I couldn't tell if that's what happens or not.) The last thing I'll say about his death is that it is quick because it only takes 20 seconds for the virus to fully spread throughout the body. The death I though was emotional was Frank because we actually see his daughter and we aren't told how or if his wife died, I just assume she did. His death is sad because you actually see some good moments that I don't want to spoil and whats not shown to you isn't told to you. So the best words to describe this are to ""show not tell"". Anyway Frank dies by getting a drop of blood in his eye and instead of begging to not be killed he just tries to push his daughter back so that she doesn't get infected, and when she is finally a good distance away from him, one of the others in the group kills him.<br/><br/>Now the ending(s) are both pretty bad. The first one show the three main characters running out of a house to try and be rescued by a jet they hear, but it ignores them, as it has before, which is told to us by one of the main characters. This ending also starts of with a transition card with the text ""28 days later..."" which kind of ruined the whole movie for me, because i thought when the guy woke up it was 28 days into the apocalypse but I guess not. The second ending (which is shown after the credits as an alternative ending) is the worse out of the two in my opinion because one of the main characters dies but I don't feel any emotion about there death at all even though they were one of the main three characters, so I'm glad they changed the ending because as much as I don't like the first ending, it is the better out of the two. My final thoughts on the endings are that people need to understand that not every ending is going to be happy, it's okay to have a sad ending to a movie. Sad does not equal bad, but in this case it does.<br/><br/>Overall the movie has many faults, but it has a better story than most of the zombie movies I've watched recently, so I'll give this movie a solid 7/10. Sorry that this review was so long and thanks for reading!"

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","0","16 April 2020"," More interesting than I thought.
","When I decided to watch this film, I thought it would be just another zombie B movie. However, I think I was wrong. The plot is much better and more interesting.<br/><br/>It all starts when a group of animal activists break into a laboratory to free chimpanzees that are used as guinea pigs. It turns out that at least some were infected with a new virus, which spreads through body fluids and was being studied. Sometime after that, Jim wakes up from a 28-day coma caused by a car accident. To his surprise, he did not see a single person and only when reading some abandoned newspapers did he realize that, while he was hospitalized, the entire population was either evacuated or died. There follows a search for someone still alive, and the struggle to survive.<br/><br/>This film is set against the backdrop of a Zombie pandemic, but the focus is not on those infected or the panic surrounding the disease and its fight. When the movie starts it has already happened, the city is deserted and it looks like the entire human race has been killed. It is quite intense to see this on the screen and a very positive point. I made an effort not to get caught up in details, if we start to think hard the plot reveals flaws in logic. Things get worse in the final half, with the soldiers behaving like mercenaries, in addition to maintaining an ""fort"" in an unusual way, without any kind of replenishment of ammunition or food ... it's like I say: if we think of ourselves plot details, it falls apart.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is to focus on the characters and allow us to create an emotional bond with them as we get to know them better. This is not very common in these films. Cillian Murphy did a good job, very psychological. We can see the internal conflicts that his character lives, particularly when he is faced with death (that of people who are dear to him, that of people who have to kill to stay alive). He was the most anonymous of the actors in the film, but the effort paid off: it opened doors for more ambitious works like ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""Cold Mountain"". Naomi Harris is excellent too, has the presence and inner strength that her character needed. Like Noah Huntley, whom she shades almost completely, she already had a steady TV career. Brendan Gleeson is also a veteran and plays an excellent role here. The worst was the soldiers. It is from there that the film begins to gradually lose itself until reaching a rather weak ending, in the style of Rambo, or something like that. Even so, it is a film that is superior to a lot of American trash that circulates around.<br/><br/>Technically, it is a very interesting film. The direction, ensured by Danny Boyle, bets strongly on discrete special effects that accentuate the dramatic tension and suspense without overlapping the work of the actors or the story. I think Boyle realized that this is, in fact, the role of special and sound effects, very much in contrast to what we see in American films, where the use and abuse of effects and CGI sometimes make you forget what goes on in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a good film, albeit with flaws."

Just after a month soldiers already forgot their principles and wanted to rape women? When I'm talking about soldier discipline, I kinda mean both commanders. You can't really not respect them.
Other things in terms of discipline - it kinda makes sense that in hardest situations army would be one of the surviving remains of the society, since they forget about the pleasure and do what needs to be done.<br/><br/>This movie does have some ideas that you are more motivated to live when you have other person. And time flies and everything is better and there's hope... People can be hit very hard when they lose a person like that.
And as a side note, I don't have anyone like that at the moment.<br/><br/>Even though this movie and ""28 weeks later"" are the same series, these two movies are different in a number of ways. First of all, ""28 weeks later"" has more WTF moments, it ruins all your hopes and thus it's less predictable, more gore.

"Cineanalyst","7","0","0","25 March 2020"," Infectious Grit
","Credited with reviving the zombie genre, although it reuses the viral outbreak idea from the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, and some question whether it's a zombie movie at all--I guess because the infected are alive and fast or something, ""28 Days Later"" is more remarkable for its gritty style, as aided by the then-new technology of digital cameras, infecting the genre with a low-resolution, guerrilla filmmaking look akin to the exploitation cinema from which zombies were first reanimated on screen in George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).<br/><br/>Consequently, the opening lab scene looks especially grotesque, including a rage-filled primate forced to watch similarly low-res, violent screen images, Ã  la ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971). The protagonist waking up from a coma to discover a post-apocalyptic landscape would later be ripped-off by ""The Walking Dead"" franchise, although the shots of him wandering through a deserted London remain unmatched. It's also a stark contrast to the frenetic finale--alternate epilogues aside."

","Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) still refuses to call this a horror film and went with eco thriller amongst others. But the rest of us know one when we see one and this film is a big one. Sexy and nude Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) stars as Jim a young man whom awakes out of a coma after a pandemic and discovers that most of the survivors left are infected with a rage virus which drives them crazy and drives them to attack and infect others. The plot is quite similar to so many. Mostly like every zombie movie ever made. Along the way he meets some survivors which include a truly bad ass Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Carribean 2&3) and they try and find help. A radio broadcast leads them to a group of soldiers with questionable intentions. There's nothing really new here plot wise but the execution is creatively stunning. The grainy, sort if found footage style easily immerses you into the events on screen and it's both terrifying and addictive. The movie is also emotionally effective because the characters and their plight are well developed. Despite the director's intentions the horror community has claimed the film as one of our own and it's undoubtedly worth celebrating.<br/><br/>Budget: $5m

Also good because it shows us many locations, all taken from real world, which additionally motivates us to watch. Bit emotional.

","Danny Boyle's flexibility as director is just so consistently surprising. You know what his next film after this was? After this, 'The Beach', 'Trainspotting' and 'Shallow Grave' before it? 'Millions', the Frank Cottrell Boyce penned kids book about a 7 year old finding a million pounds in a duffel bag. I don't always like his films, but I must hand it to the man, there aren't many spaces he can't fill.<br/><br/>The direction here looks a little dated now, it feels very guerilla, very DIY from the offset (it wasn't, it had a healthy budget from Fox on their pseudo indie-label Fox Searchlight Pictures). The rawness works in the film's favour most of the time and is entirely appropriate given the genre.<br/><br/>Perfectly contrasting this, there are moments in this movie that are so well timed and so well framed that they are nothing short of iconic. They gleam like diamonds in all of the gloom, and are so satisfyingly on the nose that they're almost Expressionist. They give the viewer more than a moment's pause and Boyle shows great instincts on when to let run what other people might dismiss as B-roll footage. A girl running down a dark hallway in a ballgown, a body falling down a tenement staircase, a sole plane flying over a forest after all civilization is supposedly dead, and let's not forget what we all came for in 2003, a man in hospital scrubs wandering an empty, abandoned London. The latter was nothing short of movie magic in those days, when fully rendered CGI environments were a thing reserved only for the absolute biggest of Hollywood blockbuster movies.<br/><br/>Writer Alex Garland had at this point half proven himself to be a contender with 'The Beach' novel and screenplay, and he must have been hungry for another win. Where 'The Beach' was grounded in reality, specifically the experience of being young, dumb and full of cumbersome desire to travel and find oneself, descending then into flight of fancy, '28 Days Later...' takes people out of their world and into one Garland built himself, utterly horrific as it is. His dialogue takes a back-step in favour of a more tense and realistic silence (for practical reasons), which leaves him to play with and plot bigger scenarios and ultimately bigger themes. What he delivered was brutal, very concise and utterly convincing.<br/><br/>Performances are just great really, across the board. Brendan Gleeson plays against type very nicely, Naomie Harris plays to type very well, a 26 year old Cillian Murphy acts his freaking socks off, and the film is gracefully cradled towards it's ending with the measured and self-assuredness of the always wonderful Christopher Eccleston, who stands guard like Nero, on the doorstop of his home town as it burns to crisp behind him.<br/><br/>My goodness. It is a good film, and yes! You were right! The First Best Zombie Movie of all time IS George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead'! Thank you and goodnight. '28 Days Later...' is a very close second."

The movie also had a good story. Not just the same basic thing you see in most zombie movies. Solid acting and likeable characters. Very intense throughout. Seen many zombie movies and that was the first time I've said that about one, because zombies aren't scary in my opinion. This movie was though.

The second half unfortunately is just plain daft. The atmosphere was the only thing that kept me watching. The church scene and the cafÃ© sums up how spooky this film got.<br/><br/>The acting was fine. Only negative is the child actor who it seems, was reading her lines by being printed on the wall behind the camera. The pacing was fine and the story of four uninfected humans trying to make it up north to a military camp was engaging. Thinking about, the whole film should of focused itself on there journey up to the camp rather than totally ruining it in the final act. And this leads me to the final act in which can be summed up by one word, terrible. You are forced to spend twenty minutes of your time by watching an infected thing run around a mansion like a fool. I love the fact that these zombies run at there prey head on rather than limping slowly but at times, especially the last twenty minutes, it made the whole film look daft.<br/><br/>Is this film scary? i would say not. Is it fun to watch? At times, yes. Is it a modern day classic? No, for me, easily forgettable and with the last act being either a snooze fest or a barrels of laughs depending on your current mood, i wouldn't force myself to watch it again."

","28 Days Later might not be what you expect. Yeah, it's got a lot of action, but it's not your typical zombie movie. There aren't towns full of them, which is a change, for better or worse. In my opinion, it was an original change, but I wasn't all for it. It barely shows any gore or blood and when it does, it shows it for maybe 5 seconds. This was dissatisfying, but good for people who want to start out with a zombie movie that isn't guts flying all over the screen for 2 hours and still keeps an R rating. My favorite part about the movie was Cillian Murphy starred in it. He's not only a great actor, but one of my favorites. It sucks he's not in too much. He's an underrated actor just like Thomas Jane. What's really crazy about this movie is the zombies are moderately smart. They're full of energy and they usually know what to do. Also the military people turning on the main characters was a good choice, with the whole world ending and all, or whatever you want to think of it as.

"pfgpowell-1","6","0","0","18 July 2009"," Rather good for the kind of film it is
","Taken on its own terms, 28 Days Later isn't half bad. As a zombie movie it gets far better than half marks compared with some of the formulaic pap that is out there. In many ways the filming is rather rough around the edges, but given that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by some sort of virus, that isn't half bad. There are plot holes galore and some very inconsistent behaviour by the main characters, but then I did stress that the film does oblige you to take it on its own terms and as long as you are not looking forward to an intelligent piece, analysing, say, the breakdown of society as seen through the eyes of some would be auteur, your on safe ground. In some ways the film is in two halves, with the second half when three of the characters reach apparent safety, only for the women to find that they are anything but safe, promising something over an above your average zombie movie. However, that promise is not fulfilled which is rather a pity. Director Danny Boyle does well on very limited resources (your average Tinseltown zombie movie will have a budget ten, twenty times what Boyle had) and the opening scenes in an apparently utterly deserted London are impressive given that the locations are real and that Boyle had to clear the streets of London completely for each shot. I have to say the desertion and desolation of New York city in I Am Legend is superficially more impressive given that film's greater resources (both films cover much the same ground, in fact), but the sheer bleakness of an un-digitally created deserted London carries additional weight. I'll stress, taken on its own terms Boyle's effort is rather entertaining, better than many glossier attempts. You have to take the story and characters on trust and suspend your disbelief, but then All's Well That Ends Well demands a similar commitment, so that is no great shakes. Just switch off and enjoy."

I saw it three times and attempted to enjot it each time... but it went wrong somewhere, and I can't exactly figure out where.<br/><br/>Hmm.  First of all, the first quarter of the film was incredible.  Abandoned London (it reminded me of Philadelphia in ""12 Monkeys"" only much more ominous, perhaps because the main character had no clue what was going on. I also appreciated the ""inhumanity"" of the survivors.  They didn't care about feeling or loyalty... they just cared about being alive.  How refreshingly un-American.  I can only imagine how horrible this would've been if Kevin Costner was in this film somehow.<br/><br/>So we follow Jim and friends around for a bit... the UK's gone, he's dealing with it... does something really stupid... more zombies... then they meet the little girl and her dad.  By this point... I knew the film was going somewhere rather cliched.  I went to have a cigarette. <br/><br/>
Much, much later... there's the ""Lord of the Flies"" military outpost, complete with attempted rape of the women, Jim is almost killed... more zombies, thrilling escape... and then one of three possible endings where everyone is assumed to have been rescued by the British military. Yay....<br/><br/>Perhaps I was expecting too much from the guy who directed ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave.""  <br/><br/>I'm perfectly willing to suspend disbelief for a while, but a virus that infects people in 20 seconds?  Isn't that kind of... impossible?  And there were a few plot holes that could've been dealt with through a careful look at the script.  Why does one of the characters say it's spread to Paris and New York, but we get a few indications (i.e. a jet flying overhead in the middle of the film) that the outside world is still functioning fine?  Is that one scientis in the lab the only one working?  Why doesn't anyone else see what's going on?  The supermarket seemed to be lit by the (in other places not working) electric light.  A couple days to get to Manchester? When I went to the UK, it only took a few hours from London by car, and this was with the entire populace alive and well (and on the roads incidentally).<br/><br/>And... what is it with animal rights people being blamed for the destruction of humanity?  I'd like to see a movie where religious right people are responsible for the extinction.    <br/><br/>This film could have been amazing... intstead it was OK... and rather disappointing.

","Well, that's it. After seeing ""Shallow Graves"" and ""Trainspotting"", I had sworn loyalty to director Danny Boyle.

""28 days later"" is a tribute to the classic ""(night, dawn, day)of the dead"" series, plus a bit of ""The Omega Man"". It fails. The characters all behave erratically. I understand that one underlying theme in Danny Boyle's movies is how a group of people start out as having one type of relationship, and then changing *gradually* into another completely different thing. But in this case the changes are sudden, with practically no explanation, unbelievable. Another thing going against it is the weird digital/video resolution chosen for the film, plus the over used shaky scene recourse. ACK! Add to that some large plot-holes.

","My problem with this movie is not the plot or overall storyline, which is excellent. We understand immediately that something has gone very wrong with the city, the country, the world(?)  Obviously, a hyper-deadly virus has wiped out any (verifiable) traces of civilization.<br/><br/>What first disturbed me was the almost casual way in which Jim makes his way out of the hospital and walks around downtown London after he wakes up. I would have thought a hospital would be an excellent place to try to find clothes, food and other necessities. Rather, he just strolls out wearing nothing but his (by now smelly) green hospital outfit and a pair of socks. I would also have liked to see more confusion and despair on his part.<br/><br/>Okay, so after the leading duo make their way to an apartment complex and join an (uninfected) father and his daughter, there is a scene which made me cringe. Making their way to a supposedly better place, the group decides to take the quicker route through a highway tunnel rather than a longer above-ground route. This was a dead giveaway that something bad would happen. I was hoping to be surprised, but it didn't happen.<br/><br/>The longest part of the film takes place in a castle, where the survivors join a small contingent of soldiers. Why they decided to go with the all too foreseeable ""lonely men get horny and need women"" storyline, we will never know. At one point, the major in charge - the only soldier who seems to possess even a grain of intelligence - hints at an effort to understand the nature of the virus by showing Jim an infected soldier kept alive in order to evaluate how long a victim would survive if left without food and water. I thought this was the start of something, but alas, no.<br/><br/>After the soldiers' attempt at gang-rape of the two women have been halted by Jim, who has gone from geek to gung-ho menace in mere minutes, the director seemed to want to end the movie too quickly. The end is both open and closed, and we can only hope the survivors move to a better place than they came from.<br/><br/>The one thing I did enjoy was a brief moment when Jim in laying on the ground and sees the distant vapor trails of a jetliner in the sky. Clearly, there is something better somewhere else, but that is all we find out. He hears from a soldier (now dead) that they may all be victims of a gigantic quarantine operation. I would have enjoyed a further pursuit of this part of the story.<br/><br/>Also, the first scene in the movie contains some very disturbing images, so parent with kids - skip them, they are not essential to the story."

Overall, let's just say, ""Nice try"" and leave it at that.<br/><br/>But, lordy, lordy, this is not a ZOMBIE movie, if by zombie one means a re-animated corpse (whether or not under the will of another person). The ""zombies"" in this film didn't die and come back to life. When killed, (and they can be killed, in very mundane, non-specific ways) they don't reanimate. And if a person dies in an uninfected state, apparently the person stays dead. These creatures are ""enraged"" (but apparently not at EACH OTHER, only at those who have not yet been infected).

","If you like gory, gruesome, mindless slasher flicks, then this movie is not for you.  SPOILER ALERT:  it has been asked why were there dead bodies in the pews of the church.  Well, we know that the main character's parents committed suicide to avoid becomming infected.  Thus, one can assume that many people chose suicide instead of becomming infected, and chose to do so in churches.  Another question was asked, why didn't the infected attack each other.  Simple.  The virus is a primate virus that mutated into a human virus.  Since the infected are very much alive, and are infected with a mutated primate virus, they were most likely able ""sense"" who is infected and who is not. Observations: the infected are not dead, they are not zombies, they are just as alive as you and me.  They are just infected with a virus that causes the person to be in a constant, violent, out-of-control, murderous rage.  While I had a few issues with the movie, I liked it."

","***I will warn that all of my comments in this review will be spoiling to some degree***<br/><br/>This film threw me for a loop, and I am unsure whether this is because there are gaps/loopholes in the plot, or that there truly is a deeper meaning present within the work that I am so desperately trying to ascribe.  I will state my difficulties with the story as I see them:<br/><br/>I found it interesting that there were dozens of dead bodies stacked up in the church that our protagonist enters in the beginning of the film.  Two questions came to mind upon seeing this scene.  First, why are all of the people dead inside the church, while there are no dead bodies in the streets?  Furthermore, why are there so many dead bodies in the first place? I was under the impression that, upon infection, an individual's only desire is to infect others (not to eat them alive, not to kill them, but only to infect them).  It would then follow that no one would directly die from the RAGE outbreak; they would only risk infection.  Why, then, were so many people dead at the onset of the disease?  They would not be dead from getting the infection, as it was made clear that the only way infected humans CAN die is by starvation (which further supports the idea that the infected don't desire to kill others to eat their flesh or anything). **So ultimately, my question is this: who are the dead people in the church, why are they dead in the church (as opposed to the street), and how did these people die?<br/><br/>I was also confused about the living status of the infected.  Most other reviews of this film have indicated that the infected should be viewed as zombies (i.e. unliving).  That would make sense, as any living human could not throw up as much blood as the infected humans do and live for very long. However, if they are unliving, why would they ultimately starve to death? I would certainly hope that the infected are in fact being portrayed as living, because it would certainly seem more plausible to me that a virus such as RAGE could be transmitted from a live, physically healthy monkey to a human who becomes physically and mentally affected by the disease, but is not caused to become undead from it.  In any event, this aspect of the story was unclear to me as well.<br/><br/>I would love to discuss the unclarity of these issues with someone else who is interested.  I feel as though I may be trying too hard to ascribe hidden meaning to a movie that had nothing of the sort, and truly is just a zombie horror film.  The movie itself has been the object of much of my thought since I saw the film a week ago, and so my deep affectation demands attention.  What do you think?  Feel free to contact me."

Yes, the film shares all of the typical ""Resident Evil"" stylings, from a bleak, post-apocalyptic landscape to hordes of mindless humanoids who want nothing more than to destroy all that comes near them.  But there's more to this film than zombies and the obligatory expendable cast-members.<br/><br/>Unlike virtually every horror film of this same genre that I've seen, this one has a conscience.  Sure, the later ""Dead"" movies (""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"") try to do this somewhat, but neither of those films ever struck any kind of emotional chord with me.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the despairing soundtrack, used to excellent effect (no cheesy orchestral ""hits"" to startle you when a monster jumps out, no pounding, frenetic fanfare as the leads are chased by a horde of monsters), or maybe it was the script.  Or perhaps it's the rather original idea that takes a more intriguing look at the darker side of human nature (IE: rage).<br/><br/>Honestly, though, for me, the biggest departure in this film from the typical post-apocalyptic or horror film (or mix of the two as we have here) is the real human impact of such an experience.  The survival instinct, the need for human emotional interaction (IE: love or a familial bond), the sense of despair that the characters feel, as well as the confusion in the face of such a disaster are all present in this film.<br/><br/>!!SPOILER WARNING!!  READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE PLOT POINTS REVEALED!!!!!!<br/><br/>The film's more poignant depictions of this are most notable to me in four particular vignettes, two of which are closely related (so I'll group them together).<br/><br/>1.)  At the start of the film when Mark becomes infected and Selena ruthlessly kills him, and at the end of the film, where Jim kills the would-be rapist soldier, we are shown that our main characters are capable of the same brutality that the infected are.  To me, this illustrates a key point of the film: the infected are not so different from the healthy, in that the uninfected still have the same capacity for rage and violence, at least in order to survive and protect their own.<br/><br/>2.)  As one of the more incompetent soldiers lies dying on the mansion's floor, the otherwise despicable Colonel holds his hand and reassures him. To me, this scene illustrates the flip-side of the above vignettes: even those uninfected who may tend towards brutality are capable of compassion and tenderness.<br/><br/>3.)  And the moment when this movie truly distinguished itself from others of its kind is when Frank becomes infected, and as he feels the symptoms begin to overcome him, turns to his daughter and tells her that he loves her very much.  While in print it may sound hackneyed, when you watch the film, it really strikes you.  Or at least it struck me.<br/><br/>

Even so, there would have remain some of the things that for me spoiled the movie towards the end, and converted it in another cheap slasher. We pass from a good science fiction-suspense movie, to a copy of any film that you can remember in which a killer is bloodily disposing of everybody in sight. But that alternative pre-ending, and the alternative ending, would have saved the day. The first one, because, among other things, the breaking and massive attack of many zombies have a better effect that just one doing all the havoc. And the latter, because it's more according with the general mood of the movie, and would have left us guessing. (Note: I'm satisfied with the alternate ending, but stripped from the second alternate ending -or continuation- that also comes in the DVD, which is also guilty of being Hollywood-esque). My guess is that the filmmakers were afraid of leaving the movie with no happy ending, and that was their biggest mistake. It's a shame, because it's all there, in the DVD.

Thats not horror, where the point is to scare people, thats a psychological thriller. And look at the people who love it. Are they the usual ""horror movie buffs""? NO, its critics and chick flick lovers.<br/><br/>The marketing world is calling 28 Days Later a horror movie and a zombie movie, because they think that will help sales, and because they don't know any better. They probably only see 5 horror movies a year. Once word gets out from people who actually love zombie movies as to what this movie is like, its popularity will decline fast.<br/><br/>DirkMaster"

","The movie opens quite elegantly. It's derivative, certainly, cannibalizing 'The Stand,' 'Dawn of the Dead,' and 'The Thing' (among others), but it takes itself quite seriously, and that's something. There are some genuinely disturbing moments early on--the walk through the eerily silent metropolis, Jim's first encounter with a jerking, hissing zombie, Selena's startling response to the attack on Mark. The plot is frequently implausible (taking Valium to help them SLEEP?), and the approach is occasionally tone-deaf, too (the jolly grocery-shopping scene is one embarrassing example), but overall it makes a more than respectable start.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it collapses about halfway through, bogging down in a boring and rather ugly new storyline that leads to a needlessly vicious climax. And, really, even at its best '28 Days Later . . .' never realizes its philosophical potential--the closest it gets is a throwaway conversation where Selena talks about the implications of the end of civilization. Jim basically shrugs it off, as do the filmmakers. Horror movies don't often achieve much depth, of course, but this one doesn't even have the sinister wit of Danny Boyle's previous effort'Shallow Grave,' and I think this might finally prove the theory that this director is only as good as his screenwriter. While I can't deny that here he shows just how gorgeous digital video really can be, unfortunately his self-conscious composition too often gets in the way of the story, especially early on (when there still is a story to get in the way of).<br/><br/>Performances are basically likable (especially Cillian Murphy in the lead), except for 'Shallow Grave' veteran Christopher Eccleston, who's wasted in his one-note role. Overall, it's probably worth a watch for fans of the genre, but you won't want to see it again. 6 out of 10."

","Unfortunately that two thirds in the first two thirds of the movie.  The film, which follows a band of people who have survived an outbreak which renders its victims into deranged killers, starts off superbly.  It also helps that the film was filmed with homemade cameras on a low budget.  That helped make the film much rawer and intense than if it used a more polished film.  The sense of isolation is also portrayed well, such as when the survivors are driving around through the empty streets of London, which is covered in trash and ruin.  Unfortunately, during the film's final act, the story falls apart and becomes excessively confusing and leaves us with no one to root for.  The twist towards the end also doesn't seem to have the reaction the filmmakers were expecting from us.  A shame that a bad ending happened to an otherwise good movie."

Ironically, one of the sleugh of rotten lottery-funded brit flicks, it finally did some business in the US (about $45m) just as the lottery commission pulled the plug on the companies which had produced a string of flops.<br/><br/>So it's not Strictly Sinatra, but what ARE its redeeming qualities? What makes this film like tootache is its pretensions to big budget apocalyptic-ness when it was painfully, obviously shot on tuppence 'happeny, especially near the end when the cast run around a country house they have hired for the weekend with some extras dressed in army surplus.<br/><br/>All credit to the showreel editor who took the best 90 seconds of the film - the deserted london and motorway bits - and cut all of it it into the trailer. That packed them in in the states.<br/><br/>However, the plot is utterly pedestrian and the flow of the film appalling. Certain scenes make no sense other than to create suspense - wandering into a deserted, blacked-out cafe without protection, for example. How Alex could have emerged unscathed, why the radio didn't pick up signals from the uninfected continent. The film fails to add up - but then it never tries.<br/><br/>The political/ecological overtones are laughable - the science of a 10 second demonic virus is utterly absurd, and never could have caused a pandemic. The end third of the film, which is meant to be some sort of satire on how we are all animals an inch before the surface is pathetic and predictable, especially its distasteful overtones of anti-white racism: but then that subject is the signature titillation of the liberal classes.<br/><br/>The concept can be done so much more suggestively and effectively with an equally low budget - Romero's Dead trilogy is so much powerful and captures the sense of decay from the perspective of a single room, a shopping mall and a military installation far more convincing than the barbed-wire Chatsworth created by Boyle.<br/><br/>Obviously Boyle and Garland were fans themselves as they crib ideas from these films mercilessly.<br/><br/>The jury is out on the use of DV. It has a stylistic novelty for use in the cinema, but often the visuals are hard to make out rather than evocative.<br/><br/>

Soon after Jim is informed of the fate of the entire British Isles, the film begins its observation and commentary on human nature. Serena, the female lead, delivers the chillings line, ""Staying alive is as good as it gets"", and that point is addressed for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>Lots of movies end with a feeble attempt to convey to the viewer that the characters of the film really got to know themselves and the people around them by undergoing the events that make up the movie. I think in the case of 28 Days Later, this effect is achieved with tremendous success. In the context of not only coping with being amongst the few humans left, as far as they know, on Earth, further issues such as if and how to rejuvenate the human population and what aspects of human life are necessary to make it worth living, are also raised.<br/><br/>If you want a typical suspense/horror movie then go see The Ring but if you also want a frightening two hour crash course in philosophy, sociology, and behavioral studies, 28 Days Later is well positioned to provide an intellectual and emotional kick start to a movie-going mind that has been number by the pointless drivel that is blanketing today's cinema screens."

","I'm not a big fan of horror movies; because, there are usually wide gaps in logic or questionable character motivations or actions that ruin things. However, I did not see that happening in this movie. The characters are very realistic people, who have been reduced to survivalist mode as a result of a virus unleashed in the London area. The three classic conflicts are all present and accounted for here: man vs. man, man vs. nature, and man vs. himself. People that are writing reviews of this movie, complaining that it's not realistic, know little about human nature. All we have to do is remember mobs of people in concerts and soccer matches around the world to see how we behave over nothing. Now imagine a world where your very survival depends upon almost how vicious you can be in an instant simply to defend yourself and stay alive. There are several scenes that stand out: the flat tire scene and the infection of one of the principals among them. The introduction of the pseudo-army characters into the story is far more realistic than what most people will realize. Survivors are not all ""everyman"" people like ourselves. There are always people that are trying to play ""king of the hill"" in society; the thirst for control and power over others is a very human trait, although one of our basest. It would manifest itself, I think, even under the circumstances proposed in this movie, although it is admittedly a horrible thought. The film itself has a documentary feel to it, backed by eerie music in the background. Although this is a lower budget effort to begin with, the director wisely avoided any big name actors; this is exactly the type of movie that could be ruined by star performances. I see there are numerous complaints about the different endings. I did not see the ""original"" ending either. The theater did not show it after the credits, like so many others seemed to have done. However, knowing what the other ending is doesn't change my enjoyment of what has gone on before. I do agree that the original ending is probably more consistent in tone with the movie than the ending I saw. *** of 4 stars."

A survivor (Jim) wakes up on a hospital's operating table and finds London (England) deserted 28 Days Later...<br/><br/>
This movie has an alternate ending but it wasn't very well advertized. Most people in the cinema left when the credits appeared because they did not know about it. I read it on a newspaper review and decided to wait until after the end credits to see if there was really an alternate ending.<br/><br/>
The ""official release"" ending wasn't very good. It was a pathetic saccharin Hollywood-style ending. For other films, happy endings are fine but it did not suit the nature of this particular film which had a dark and bleak theme. Apparently the alternate ending was its original ending and it was circa 4 minutes long but initial studio tests did not sit well with the average audiences. Unfortunately, Danny Boyle was forced to shoot a new ending! <br/><br/>The alternate ending: After the credits, the words - ""But what if..."" appeared.<br/><br/>When Jim was shot, the three drove out of the compound. The next scene was in a hospital where Selena and Hannah were frantically trying to save Jim from his wound. Jim died on the operating table. This ending was poignant as he woke up on an operating table at the beginning of the film and now he died on an operating table at the end of the film. He had gone a full circle and went back to where he began. Hannah and Selena leaves the hospital with a satisfactory ""what now"" question left unanswered by the story.<br/><br/>
I thought the movie rated 4/10 with the ""sweet"" ending. Maybe 6/10 with the original ending. The movie was shot on video and eventually transfered to 35mm cinema film neg and pos stock.

The sub-sub genre which I refer to, I call: Post Apocalyptic, Last Normals Alive in an Urban Environment Ravaged by Psychotic Blood-Sucking Freaks!' Phew!!<br/><br/>Although there is nothing really new in 28DL, I was entertained and generally satisfied mainly because I find the Post Apocalyptic, Last Normals Alive etc sub-sub genre really fascinating and frightening. I think the world of 28DL, The Omega Man and Night of the Comet (1984) represent the most terrifying circumstances a protagonist could find themselves in.<br/><br/>28DL is tightly and expertly edited, however I did find the story a little too manufactured in places. Without putting any Spoilers into this review, there are scenes in the film where characters unnecessarily walk into dangerous situations. In other words there's forced interactions between the protagonist Normals and the Infecteds. Forced interactions between characters means lazy writing.<br/><br/>I'm a bit unconvinced about some of the characters and their motivations. For example, human beings by their very nature are heavily addicted to structured society. In 28DL however there are some uninfected Normals whose basic drive is for short term pleasure and cruelty rather than doing constructive stuff. I know this is a debatable point, but I believe that given a circumstance which is highly stressful, Normals' are going to be motivated to stick together, co-operate and get things done.<br/><br/>I think Alex Garland should have spent more effort shading some characters and this would have made 28DL more effective. There are characters in the film who are a little too 'one track minded' to be convincing. I also think there should have been a bit more time spent on explaining the Infecteds and their disease. I'm still confused as to whether they become entirely cannibalistic, or whether they just bite victims and spread infection.<br/><br/>But overall, a good sub-sub genre effort. 7/10"

The few times it ever offers a ""made you jump, ha ha ha"" moment they are cheap and involve characters doing something stupid. <br/><br/>For the first 45 minutes of 28 DAYS LATER (following a forced, confused PETA raid sequence that doesn't work) it seems that Danny Boyle might have found a new genre to breath life into. SHALLOW GRAVE was the first top-notch thriller since DEAD CALM and TRAINSPOTTING was a return to enlightening while entertaining lower end economic social commentary pretty much abandoned in the mid 70's. So the promising start of 28 DAYS raises one's hopes, after the wise cracking and near parody of the ELMSTREET and SCREAM franchises, Doyle might have produced the first great horror film in a long time (since perhaps HALLOWEEN). Alas, Danny shoots his creative wad in those 45 minutes and the rest of the film becomes a tragic miscalculation attempting to meld a horror film with a ON THE BEACH/DAY AFTER lone human survivors infighting story.<br/><br/>One of the things the film first has going for it before Doyle looses his nerve and goes Hollywood is the unknown but very good actors he cast in the lead roles. One of the advantages of small films is the fact that their unknown casts help pull audiences into their worlds without the distraction of ""Hey, its the guy from Dawson's Creek!"" But then Doyle first uses Brendan Gleeson, then Christopher Eccleston to remind the viewer ""its just a movie with that guy from GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS."" Which is pretty ironic, because Eccleston was unknown when he did SHALLOW GRAVE.<br/><br/>For those who don't see that many films, this is certainly one to skip unless you want to feel disappointed and used by the publicity machine.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the filmmakers had something better in mind.  This a superb film.  It is both visually and auditorily stimulating.  The dialogue is well written and well delivered, which makes it easy to empathized with the characters.  The story is excellent, which is rare in a horror film. The camera perspective alternates between first and third person throughout the film to heighten tension, which is far more interesting than the standard practice of just turning up the eerie music for a cheap scare.  The music in this film is not used to manipulate the audience.  It is beautiful and haunting, and it gives fullness to the scenes where it is present. Plus, the ending was hopeful rather than hokey.  All of these elements came together perfectly on this film, and it gives the film a more human quality. It isn't overblown at all.

","This is certainly worth seeing despite some flaws. But it is not a zombie film. The ""zombie"" characteristics come about because of a fatal infection, they are not the undead. The sequences in a deserted London are superb. The use of silence is extremely effective. I note in the credits a thanks to the traffic marshalls of London for making it come about. I thought Cillian Murphy was ok as the hero but far better was Naomi Harris as the female survivor. She really made something of her character and I hope we see her again. Christopher Eccleston is always good but there really wasn't enough depth in the characterisations of the soldiers. It's a cliche that when civilisation ends, the brutish are in charge. They probably would be, at least in the beginning; civilised behaviour is a bit of an oxymoron when there is no civilisation. But overall it is good film and well worth the money.

","Prior to its belated opening in this country, I remember seeing the trailer for this flick many months ago - in late 2002 - and thinking just how damned average it looked. The trailer seemed to make the film look very poor indeed, and revealed nothing of the inherent nastiness and desolation this film so brilliantly portrayed. With the benefit of hindsight, I must say that that disappointment was not such a bad thing  my lowly expectations were completely blown away after seeing this film. I'm pleased that I wasn't turned off completely, because I would have denied myself a treat.<br/><br/>Reviewers here have oft criticised the films' supposed lack originality. The opening moments of a naked Jim waking up to an empty world, and eventually finding two survivors, is clearly reminiscent of the brilliant New Zealand film 'The Quiet Earth' (1985). And running zombies were depicted in Bava's 'Demoni' (1985). Sure, it borrows elements of this film and that. But how many films can one see these days that doesn't borrow a bit of this and a bit of that? What makes this an absolute stand out is its capacity to reel out the tension and never let up. I found the tension relentless, to the point of almost finding it difficult to watch. The infected zombies actually frightened me, by the twisted and speedy way they moved and the ghastly noises they made. Also, its portrayal of despair and hopelessness was quite rare, and extremely effective. It worked well, and the cinema audience I was a part of looked rather shell-shocked at the end of the film. Amusing!<br/><br/>The addition of humour in these types of films can sometimes seem corny. But the couple of humorous moments provide the audience with some nervous reprieve from the horror, rather than an unnecessary distraction. A couple of plot flaws are forgivable  e.g. why was the deserted supermarket lit up like a Christmas tree if the power was supposedly cut? But these are inconsequential in the bigger picture. The addition of the journey to the Fort Knox like army barracks and the barbaric soldiers seemed logical in terms of plot. In my opinion, it provided an interesting and perfectly reasonable comparison to the barbarism and desperation of the 'infected' outside the compound. So what if it stank of ideas already shown in Romero's 'Day of the Dead' (1985)  it simply worked.<br/><br/>Hats off to the British for producing a fantastic addition to the zombie genre. This is most unlike the terrible mess the Australian film 'Undead' (2003) was. Incidentally, both films opened here on the same day! I'm at risk of sounding most un-patriotic here, but that film isn't a shade on this. I'm excited at the increasing quality of British horror. None of this flashy Hollywood-like horror nonsense here, and thank goodness for that.<br/><br/>Given this films' inherent nastiness, it's interesting to note that the Australian censors only saw fit to assign this film an MA15+ rating, rather than an R18+. I thought it was definitely pushing the envelope...wouldn't let my kids watch it."
"bajbij","Null","0","0","7 September 2003"," NOT the best zombie movie ever (SPOILERS)
","One thing needs to be clarified here:<br/><br/>This was NOT the first film to feature fast, running zombies who act savage and quick (Demons, Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead, Braindead, etc.) <br/><br/>That is the general consensus with alot of reviewers here. The novelty of running zombies happened almost 20 years ago. The look of the zombies themselves are impressive, but there isn't enough screen time devoted to them to appreciate the look (the best view of them comes in the second act when one of the captured zombies held by the military struggles to free itself.)<br/><br/>Speaking of the military scenes, this is where the film fails. Instead of an interesting study of the already established characters, one of them is killed off and the rest are captured by an extremist military branch who see the female character as a chance to breed, and the film essentailly becomes a battle for breeding rights, and the lead male for no reason explained turns into Rambo and offs much of the military personnel by himself. An interesting idea to add to the film would have been the regression mentally of the lead character which forces him to turn savage in order to rescue his friends. It would have added made a supposedly ""intelligent"" film actually look intelligent.<br/><br/>The much heralded ""deserted London"" scenes deserve all the praise it gets, and Danny Boyle does indeed deserve credit for the way he achieved it. However, if this scene was done with CGI (like the insepid RESIDENT EVIL,) I doubt anyone would care about this scene, which I guess goes to show how jaded have become with CGI that if an effect is acheived without CGI it almost makes the film seem superior. <br/><br/>In summary, 28 DAYS LATER would have been a great film and SHOULD have been a great film if some more character development was added to an already dull group of characters who could have been memorable."

One man, seemingly alone in a world where all life has vanished.  The fact that these guys could accomplish these shots is amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is superb.  The plot is a little funky, and spirals downward near the end of the flick, but is solid enough to hold your attention.

"keith96778","5","0","0","23 August 2003"," 28 days later ... you forget this movie.(SPOILERS)
","This is a very ordinary film with no original contribution to the genre. The camera work is interesting at times, but the concept and script are straight out of the vault (of hackneyed and overworked ideas).  It has no real identity of its own to speak of and, thus, is hardly worth speaking about.<br/><br/>The movie lacks the hard edge that might have given it some distinction. It has some grit, but it is inconsistent.   Scenes are painstakingly manipulated to set up suspense that never materializes, such as when the females are forced to dress up so they can be more fun(?), attractive(?) or what(?) to rape by the horny little soldiers.<br/><br/>Long before fashion becomes an issue, the film betrays itself with contrivances and inconsistencies in the world it seeks to create.  When poor addle-brained Jim stumbles about a deserted London, for example, there is nary a clue as to the ""rage"" that decimated the population.  Meanwhile, Selena and her original companion are scrounging out an existence in a city with grocery stores filled with food. Shortly after, Selena, who would leave anybody who falls behind, skips off to visit Jim's mum and dad for no apparent good reason.  Nearing the end, Jim is handcuffed then mysteriously not handcuffed so  he can rescue the ladies.  The director didn't even bother with an implausible account of that fete.  At least he could have inserted a bubble over Jim's head thinking ""What good luck I am Houdini's great-grandson.""  It wouldn't have detracted from the film in the least.   The list goes on and on.  Even classic horror has a plot hole here and there, but never so many, so deep.<br/><br/>It really wouldn't have been hard to tighten up the logic of the film to give the treatment some integrity.  Filmakers seem to not bother with details these days. But why bother when consumers don't demand it?<br/><br/>If one suspends disbelief and good taste, this film can be tolerated. Otherwise, if you're lucky, 28 days later .... you forget this movie.<br/><br/>

","Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Danny Boyle. After waiting so long to see House of 1000 Corpses - and hoping it would be the return to the 70's and 80's heyday of the horror movie - and then being so disappointed when it turned out to be an MTV style piece of excrement, I thought it was over for the TRUE horror film. <br/><br/>Although it isn't your traditional ""living dead"" zombie flik, it has all the right elements - small group of survivors fending off large number of ""infected"" - and it's atmospheric, stylish and scary (House of 1000 Corpses was none of the above). <br/><br/>The film had homages to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead... but at the same time it was totally original. One of my favorite things about the Night, Dawn, Day and other zombie movies of the like is the slow moving zombies stumbling and creeping toward their prey... usually only very threatening in numbers. In this film the zombies don't stumble or creep toward their prey... THEY HAUL ASS. This isn't the first film where zombies have running ability, mind you (think The Return of the Living Dead films, Nightmare City, Zombi 3, Zombie 4... well, it's better not to think of those last two), but the way these zombies attack is so brutal. THEY BEAT THE HELL OUT OF YOU!!!<br/><br/>There are too many great things to say about the film to list and too many great scenes.... the opening scene especially!<br/><br/>In the great zombie movie category this is my top ten list:<br/><br/> 1)Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/> 2)The Return of the Living Dead<br/><br/> 3)Day of the Dead<br/><br/> 4)Zombie<br/><br/> 5)Dead Alive<br/><br/> 6)Return of the Living Dead 3<br/><br/> 7)28 Days Later<br/><br/> 8)Night of the Living Dead (1968)<br/><br/> 9)Night of the Living Dead (1990)<br/><br/>10)Return of the Living Dead Part 2 (yes...

There is only a bit of character development.  The film is shot very much too dark and most of the infected are barely visible.  The plot summary does not mention that the plague is only on the main British Isle and not worldwide.  An gruesome touch would have been for the flyovers to sterilize the whole island.

"TheNorthernMonkee","8","0","0","22 August 2003"," Got some nice points, but us Brits can't do everything.
","MAJOR SPOILERS.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" is one of those strange British films, which once again relies on minimal special effects, and comes out with flying colours. This film, without putting it mildly, is mostly stunning. All of the characters are well explained and well performed & the plot itself is excellent. In fact, the only flaw with this film is it's ending which is (to say the least) a bit pathetic, but this seems to be an on running problem with all films nowadays which seem incapable of actually properly ending the masterpieces they are up until whatever point. Anyway, irrelevant of this one technical flaw, for the first 9/10ths of this film, it is expertly written & performed.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" begins at an Animal Testing facility where a couple of Animal Rights Protesters attempt to release some infected animals into nature. They unfortunately succeed and thus doom the entire of Britain to become full of ""infected"", people who are blood hungry and madder than Britain's Foreign Policies. This film then skips to 28 days later where a man (Jim) awakens in a hospital after being put into a coma two or three days previously to the original outbreak. The film then progresses as Jim searches for survivors and answers & then attempts to escape this country which is now under quarantine.<br/><br/>Jim and his friends gain and loose members until an explosive climax. Now if you haven't seen this film, I recommend stopping reading now as going to briefly mention later parts of the film & discuss things which could ruin this wonderful experience.<br/><br/>Everyone who doesn't want to read ahead gone? Good.<br/><br/>Eventually Jim and his few remaining friends encounter the remnants of an Army compound & eventually these Army men abuse their abilities in an attempt to rape particular women & Jim is forced to fight back. This fight back is powerful (helped by a stunning soundtrack) and when Jim eventually is faced to face with his remaining friend Selena, it is the obvious culmination of the idea that despite the ""rage"" being an investment of physical violence, simultaneously it is possible for us to be just as crazy and animalistic when we are angry. Perhaps this is one notion the film intentionally tries to show us. This film shows us just how aggressive and exploitative we can be when a social morality ceases to exist and we are quite literally living like animals.<br/><br/>I could go off on one now about the whole notion of the flaws with Animal Activision, but I'm going to pass on this opportunity and summarise.<br/><br/>In general, for the vast majority of this film, the plot, acting, and minimal special effects work wonderfully together (Jim walking through abandoned London is particularly effective. Always wanted to see a Big Red Bus on it's side), but ultimately the ending is a disappointing dip down. Either way, it is unfair to condemn the majority of this film for it's ending. Watch this film, love it, but turn it off before the final five minutes."

","Danny Boyle's post-modern update of George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead' is more chilling than scary, but it's still a pretty effective apocalyptic nightmare--even though it never quite becomes the nightmare you want it to be. The film is filled with disturbing images of a devastated Britain that stay with you long after it's over. (A long shot of the town of Manchester seen going up in flames is particularly haunting.) Boyle has shot the film in digital video (the camerawork is by Anthony Dod Mantle) and it's a good choice, bringing a grainy immediacy to the narrative and allowing Boyle to indulge in some flashy but useful shock editing whenever zombies infected by a `rage' virus are onscreen. But the director and his screenwriter, Alex Garland, aren't content to let the concept of a country (and, presumably, a world) destroyed by infection be what the film is ultimately about and the second half changes direction, introducing a plot of lesser value about a crazed army major (well-played by Christopher Eccleston) whose goals for the future of mankind are intended to be as outrageous as the more gruesome elements of the story but are not, unfortunately, nearly as interesting. Still, much like `Trainspotting', Boyle brings his indefatigable energy to the proceedings and the intensity never flags even when the ideas get shuffled around. The young, eager-to-please cast includes Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns and they're up to a difficult task."

But it doesn't have buckets of gore and tons of mindless violence - which is the reason I wanted to see it in the first place.<br/><br/>Apart from being erroneously acclaimed as a Zombie film, it's more your kind of ""survival in the face of apocalyptic adversity"" type of affair - with the ""infected"" being humans imbued with terrible uncontrollable rage replacing yer actual ""walking dead.""<br/><br/>There are a few moments of gore and violence - and by and large they are done with style. There are also a few moments of excellent suspense, delivering genuinely hair-raising thrills.<br/><br/>Basically, I mean to say that it is a cut above the typical horror fare that is served to the brain dead masses, and it delivers a fairly satisfying couple of hours entertainment.<br/><br/>It has emotional impact too - again something that your average horror movie lacks - and screen time is spent developing ideas  rather than wringing scene upon scene out of a single concept.<br/><br/>28 Days later - with it's digital video look, is very reminiscent of British TV's scifi of the 70's and early 80's - THE SURVIVORS - QUATERMASS - DAY OFTHE TRIFFIDS (not the dire movie) - possessing a  sinister sense of low-budget menace, clipped diction and impending doom.<br/><br/>But it strikes me that 28 days is a bit of a quick turnaround to lose the entire UK - and not have anyone with a radio to pick up foreign broadcasts or satellite TV.....<br/><br/>Ah well - a thought provoking, genuinely horrible at times, movie,  but not in the same league as Romero's mighty Zombie trilogy.<br/><br/>Initial thoughts 6/10<br/><br/><ul><li>ahhh what the hell, ambitious UK films deserve a lot more support than big budget Hollywood garbage that's floating around at the moment -</li></ul><br/><br/>

","During the first half hour of ""28 Days Later"" I was ecstatic. This, I thought, was precisely the way the ""Resident Evil"" movie SHOULD have been done. So engrossed was I in it's faux-low-budget style, I didn't even mind that it was just about literally another filmed version of Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" (previously adapted as ""The Omega Man"") crossed with Craig Harrison's ""The Quiet Earth"" (later adapted by Geoff Murphy under the same title). But then I started to get restless, noticing more and more James Horneresqe direct rips from ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" and even the substandard ""Day of the Dead"". Yes, I slowly realized that this movie didn't contain a single, original thought. Add to this the incredibly senseless idiocy of the film's hero Jim, who repeatedly gets himself in inanely deadly situations only to escape through sheer dumb luck, and you get a stupendously infuriating movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the film's visual style. Though Boyle does allow the digital fluff to somewhat defile his otherwise impressively potent post-apocalyptic setting, some of the early zombie scenes were indeed undeniably effective. Unfortunately, though, he nauseatingly overuses that Saving Private Ryan shutter-strobe effect to cover the disappointing lack of actual gore scenes. He prevents us from getting a good look at anything, not unlike Paul Anderson did in his disastrous ""Resident Evil"".<br/><br/>In it's second half, the film suddenly turns into Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"", with Jim in the Dustin Hoffman role, defending his girlfriend Selena from sex-starved British soldiers, who surprisingly turn out the be the real villains of the film (incidentally, this also closely resembles Romero's underrated ""The Crazies""). Now, despite the fact that Jim was earlier established as a complete and utter imbecile, he is somehow able to perfectly predict and control the behavior of the surviving zombies, which he uses as preposterous weapons against the soldiers. I kid you not! In the film's third half, we're actually supposed to be rooting for the zombies as they violently slaughter soldier after soldier, including uninvolved innocents who just happened to be serving with the three rapists. The ending is so eerily similar to ""Straw Dogs"" that I couldn't help being revolted (not by the violence, but by the plagarism and its implications, considering Peckinpah's original intentions). Plus, the British soldiers are complete idiots, actually deciding to leave the safe perimeter of their base and enter the woods JUST TO KILL JIM! Couldn't they have just shot him in a remote part of the base and added his body to the already existing pile of zombies? But that wouldn't have given him the chance to escape, would it?<br/><br/>Blech."

I want to know why many who didn't like this movie liked ones such as ""Re-Animator""?  I rented that movie and found it to be a parody of itself.  28 Days has a much more serious tone.  Other parts of this movie I found quite frightening are when the lead actor is being debriefed about his predicament and how early on, the rage attacks were taking place and it was later then that people knew it wasn't just random violence.  The mental image of people trying to flee by plane and not being able to do so because everyone had the same idea. That could have been incorporated using flashback scenes.  The best part of this movie is the type of virus it is:  RAGE!  What could be more frightening than ourselves going mad?  Answer is:  Look at Charlie Manson.  I don't believe in ghosts, vampires, supernatural ghouls, or alien monsters. Viruses and human monsters are real.  As long as we remain human and not cyborg, we will always have to worry about the former."

","All in all the movie is pretty good, and I enjoyed the graininess of the images, and the bleakness that it implied (most UK movies from the 1970's and 1980's seem to have this quality, and I think the director may have been paying a subtle homage to this quality).<br/><br/>The movie was lacking, however, in that there was insufficient explanation on who created the virus, why it was so lethal, why the victims became vomit-zombies, what happened in mainland Europe and the rest of the world, why some were infected and others were not, maybe a few flashbacks to the riots, and perhaps having some kind of confrontation with the originator of the virus (they had to survive, they always do).<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe I just need to have things explained to me, but I would have liked more of a story-driven movie (see above) than a theme-driven movie (bleak, desolate survival).<br/><br/>But it was entertaining.

","There's little doubt that Danny Boyle and Alex Garland are talented in directing and writing respectively.The first half hour goes in superbly well. From there on it all gets a bit gory and nasty. Nothing wrong with that per se but you might expect some thrills too.However these are in short supply.Cillian Murphy is also not strong enough an actor for the lead though he is not bad. Brendan Gleeson is miscast in a supporting role and the excellent Christopher Eccleston is wasted playing a daft soldier.Naomie Harris is very appealing in the role of Selena and I am sure we will hear much more of her in the future. As usual in Boyle's films, the use of music is great and the soundtrack album should be well worth having.The scenes of Jim walking through a deserted London are memorable and the DVD extras explain how they managed to pull it off. Overall, 28 Days.... would have been better if a bigger budget had been in place.However,there is much merit in the movie and it probably will become a great cult favourite of the future."
"SuperDaveMader","8","0","0","2 August 2003"," A intriguing and brilliant film
","This turned out to be the best film about zombies taking over since Dawn of the Dead. Though I expected it to be a cheesy flick filled with cheap pops and marginally scary events iced with an obvious romance, however it spoke a much deeper meaning to myself, filled with lessons about humanity and the basic instinct. The film's directing was simply brilliantly done, with a soundtrack complimenting the films mood perfectly. I found the characters to be compelling in their own desperate motif. The virus infecting everyone said a lot about the mob mentality and the clearly spoken arguments of how man has always killed man and that the events in the movie have nothing different then was already present in the world. I felt that if the film had continued without them reaching the source of radio broadcast, the film could have gone in a much better direction. A story of them trying to reach the broadcast like some kind of road to salvation could have been a slightly more suspenseful story. The alternate ending was actually disapointing and I was glad that they used the other ending with a more 'happier' ending. I felt that this was not one of those films where the protagonist should die. I'm not sure if birds have a symbolism, but I must have counted like 100 of them in various shots.<br/><br/>I thought that this was going to be Britain's answer to Resident Evil, but this was actually much better. 8/10.<br/><br/>p.s. This film lost one point because you can actually see a guy walking up the street when Jim is traveling through the 'deserted' London.

","I went to this movie with the expectation of being scared. Everything I had heard of this movie, from the storyline to the filming style, described some of my worst nightmares. For the most part, it did scare me, but more by the psychological aspect. The premise, the never-quite-seeing-them style, and the general unease throughout were all realistic enough. I would have liked more tangible tension; we seemed to be kept at arms length (though actually it was probably the constant close-ups and pseudo-artistic angles that shut the viewer out).<br/><br/>I liked this movie. I am still thinking about it, and some of the issues it brings to the forefront.<br/><br/>All of that said, this is *not* a film for the ""Jason/Freddie"" set. As I was leaving the theater I heard one viewer complain that he had heard this was supposed to be the scariest movie ever, and he was very disappointed. This is a psychological horror, not a serial thriller.<br/><br/>Oh, and for those who try to claim ""28 Days Later"" is liberal (or more threateningly, ""leftist propaganda""), consider that it was speaking out against the eco-terrorists, not the scientists."

","I liked this movie the first time I saw it, when it was Night of the Comet back when I was a kid in 1984. http://us.imdb.com/Title?0087799<br/><br/>Seriously, these two movies have so much in common that it can not possibly be a coincidence. The writer of this film clearly ""Borrowed"" the plot from that other 1980's bubble-gum movie and just put a slightly more serious tone to it.<br/><br/>Also, apparently, British men will result to raping children if they are forced to go a month without sex.<br/><br/>
I personally hate Hollywood drivel. I hate Freddy vs Jasaon type flicks. I hate the blood and gore movies the studios try to pass off as entertainment these days, but my hatred for those movies does not make this one any better. A mediocre film is a mediocre film no matter how hard you try to analyse it and build it up. Plan and simple this is not ""an amazing look at the human condition"" as some here would sugest. The bottom line is no one in this movie reacts naturally.<br/><br/>Night of the Comet might be a silly 1980's film, but it still managed to tell this story better and more entertaining then 28 days later. If you're going to rip another movie off, at least make a half hearted attempt to do it better."

","wow, this movie was awesome! by far my favorite horror movie. it starts off very good. this is like the first zombie movie i've seen where there is actually a reasonable explanation for why a virus was spread (as far as reason and zombies are concerned). it was pretty intelligent. but what instantly drew me in was when our hero Jim wakes up in a hospital, completely deserted (aside from a full frontal shot which i could have done without). he gets out of the hospital and looks at the city, also completely deserted, except there are dead bodies everywhere. Jim walks around for about five minutes looking for anyone while a creepy piano jingle is played.<br/><br/>but it keeps getting better from there. this movie has a thousand thrills, not really scary, but very suspenseful. one of the best things about this movie is the beautiful landscape. that's what i loved was the shots when there would be momentary peace, and our heroes would stop and look at the scenery and just enjoy the last few nice things on earth for a moment (probably the two best of these was the family of uninfected horses roaming a field, and the city of Cambridge burning, because there were no fire squads to put it out). Jim is a very likable character, as well as Selena, his beautiful survival partner, and Hannah, the young teen who's father was killed.<br/><br/>this is by far my favorite horror movie. the guy's who wrote and directed are VERY talented and could easily do more serious movies, but i'm glad they did an excellent horror film. one of my favorite parts was when one of the guards says ""f*ckies!"". i love that word (this movie takes place in england, so i figure it's an english word). well, this movie is really gory, but if you do not like blood than it is ok, because the movie is good enough to where even the gore can be overlooked (i enjoyed the gore actually, it wasn't over done, it was just right). 10/10"

","Horror and sci-fi films so often seem pre-programmed:  you have the heroine, whose friends slowly but surely die off one by one as a result of some mysterious killer or entity.  She has to discover who or what it is, and after she does, she manages to destroy it.  Is anyone else sick of this formula?<br/><br/>Thank God for ""28 Days Later...,"" a fantastic film that not only delivers a scare or two, but is thoughtful, well-acted, perfectly writtern, and unpredictabl, breaking the standard formula without losing its impact.<br/><br/>(Spoilers here) The film begins with a dramatic bang as several animal rights activists attempt to release caged chimpanzees.  What they are told by a panacked biologist is that the animals are infected with a very contagious virus called rage.  One bite from an animal and you will become infected in 10-20 seconds, metamorphisizeing into a blood-hungry zombie. Needless to say, the activists do not listen and set the animals and the virus loose.  After this stage-setting scene, we are taken 28 days later into the future.  London is a wasteland to which a young man, Jim, awakes. He was in a coma during the devistation and merely witnesses the bleak aftermath.  Fortunately, he meets several other survivors, and after many trials and tribulations, including run-ins with ""the infected,"" Jim and company make it to a militarized zone.  But the film doesn't end there. In the end, un-infected, fellow humans are nearly as dangerous to Jim and his friends' well-being.  This is the twist I like, since it seems most realistic given the circumstances.  But I'll let you savor these secrets when you see the film.<br/><br/>Still, you can't fully appreciate the film from a brief synopsis, because the plot isolated seems rather trite.  But the way the writer and director treat the material makes ""28 Days Later..."" a bit of an anomaly.  First, the dialogue is very lean, illiminating the useless lines that you would typically expect in a film of this subject matter.  Next, the cinematography is outstanding.  Rather than completely grossing us out with painful zoom-ins and still shots, the director chooses a rapid fire means of photographing the infected.  Instead of seeing their every detail, we see their fast, jolting movements, which are excentuated by flashes of light. It's that old Hitchcock philosophy of less is more, and it works well for O'Boyle.  Finally, there are clear themes in this film which set it apart from it's lesser peers.  Themes of survival, companionship, loyalty, and hope, that manifest themselves well in the film.<br/><br/>In the end, you come away from ""28 Days Later..."" with a clear sense of the film's purpose and meaning and the realization that you've just been through a wild ride.  It is a unique film experience that many will appreciate--not just horror buffs and O'Boyle fans.<br/><br/>Rating:  8 out of 10"

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ""28 Days Later""<br/><br/>By James Johnston<br/><br/>At it's heart, this is a basic ""The apocolypse is here"" kind of movie (A la ""The Omega Man""). Here's the basic premise <SPOILERS>:<br/><br/>==============================================================> A group of Animal Rights activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Institute to free some monkeys being experemented on. Despite being warned by a terrified scientists, they unlock the doors, freeing the infected apes....<br/><br/>28 days later (wink) Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital, after a long coma. He finds the hospital empty - no patients, no doctors, no one. After wandering around London, he is beset by murderous people that have been infected by the RAGE virus. Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark, two survivors of the plauge. From there, they search for any other sign of life....<br/><br/>==============================================================> The basic idea behind the movie is great. There have not been many movies recently using the ""World is Over"" premise, and it's good to see one.<br/><br/>
There are also some nice deviants from traditional Apocolyptic Films: Instead of slow, mutated humans turned zombies, there are fast, insane, murderous humans who have been infected by RAGE. And when bitten, the victims are 'turned' in only 10-20 seconds.<br/><br/>Another cool deviation is the lack of a 'total' apocolypse - England is completely infected, but North America and Europe remain uninfected (though there are hints that the virus may be spreading to those locations).<br/><br/>
But the movie is far from perfect. There are some pretty huge plot holes in quite a few locations. And a few incidents don't make sense. For example <SPOILERS> when they find the military base and the 2 women are expected to sleep with the troops to 're-populate' the Earth. When they refuse, the soldiers try to rape them. This makes little sense - the soldiers KNOW that the other countries are still uninfected, but think that the world is over and they will die.<br/><br/>Also, I find it hard to believe a group of animal activists could get through security into the Cambridge Institute - in an area so dangerous, there would have to be tons of guards and such.<br/><br/>Those are 2 small examples that I can think of off the top of my head. There are many others.<br/><br/>Another problem is the lack of 'monsters'. In a city of over a million, there must be hundreds of thousands of mutants. But you only ever see about 7-10 in a group. And you don't get many close-up shots of them, but I suppose that's to add to the scare factor.<br/><br/>Also, appearantly the movie was filmed with Digital Film or something, instead of the standard film. Why, I don't know. I have no idea why they did this, the film appeared slightly 'fuzzy' in a few places, mostly in far-off shots.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like about the movie was the lack of a back-story behind the 'apocoplyse'. We don't see the riots, the carnage, the military blockades, etc.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ending was TERRIBLE. I saw it with 2 endings - which I will call the ""Good"" (all 3 signal a plane, the original ending) and the ""Bad"" ending (Jim dies from a gunshot would - Selena and Hannah continue to try and find an excape). I'll go from the ""Good"" ending, since the ""Bad"" one was pretty much just an attempt to get more people into the theaters. In the last scene, you see a military jet fly over the house, while the 3 survivors have made a giant sign out of sheets that says ""HELLO"". The jet sees them and radios back. This leaves the ending open enough to make the movie feel incomplete, while not open enough to warrant a sequel (at least not a good one). So you leave the theater feeling a little shafted.<br/><br/>Well, enough with the bad. Let's start with the good.<br/><br/>The acting is great - esp. because while these actors/actresses aren't really 'unknown', they arn't big-budget stars. Murphy does an especially great job as the confused and scared Jim.<br/><br/>The Cinemotagraphy, despite the above film problem, is excellent. The shots of Trefalgar (sp?) square deserted, Big Ben not working, empty streets etc are fantastic. I have no idea how they managed to get those shots, but they are great.<br/><br/>Although I didn't take much notice of it, the Score was great when I did. Nice moody music.<br/><br/>And finnaly, the movie is indeed Scary. I saw it with my little sister and her friend, and they jumped 4 feet in the air when the infected jumped out. And you are on-the-edge of your seat through a good portion of it.<br/><br/>This movie is a good watch, but It could have been better - throwing out the survivors fighting survivors part would have raised it from an 8 to a 9, as that part was totally pointless IMO.<br/><br/>But non-the-less, a good movie that I reccomend whole-heartedly.<br/><br/>James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston"

","spoilers<br/><br/>While superficially, 28 Days Later appears to belong to the sub-genre of zombie thriller, it is in fact closer to post-disaster SFI/fantasy flicks such as Mad Max or Terminator. The source of destruction here however is not nuclear annihilation but an infection that turns people into zombie-like biters. These `infected' however do not play as large a part in this movie as some would have you believe. They serve rather as a general threat or `evil' that is always lurking in the background but not quite the subject matter. <br/><br/>The movie is presented in three distinct `movements' if I can use an orchestral analogy. The first is the setting up of the story. It moves slowly, always with an ominous undertone, and leaves the audience wondering where it is going. Most impressive is the use of `Abide With Me', a solitary, barely audible voice meandering through a world sprawling with hideous aftermaths of the virus.<br/><br/>The middle `movement', in the form of a highway movie (which puts it in distinguished companies such as Straight Story, Kikujiro No Natsu and About Schmidt), is the most enjoyable part to watch. The characters are beginning to fall into place: Jim and Selena (hero and heroine), Frank and Hanna (father and daughter). The four of them have made a decision to seek the source of an army broadcast that might lead them to safety. `Ava Maria' is invoked in this part to signify hope and optimism. Interwoven with abrupt outbursts of threat are interludes of tranquility and humor. The natural father-and-daughter affection radiates warmth. The characters of the hero and heroin begin to acquire new dimensions. Selena, initially cold and rational, ready to kill at will for survival, starts to display a softer side. Jim, on the other hand, an almost completely helpless weakling initially, starts to acquire traits of natural violence which can almost be described as bloodthirsty. The tone changes abruptly again in the final movement, when the apparently safety haven provided by a group of 9 soldiers fortified in a big mansion turns nasty. The `human' nature of the soldiers turns out to be no better, or even worse, than the inhuman `infected'. Violence erupts between the soldiers and their `guests', together with cat-and-mouse situations, always against the backdrop of the `infected' ready to break in and wreck havoc. I wouldn't reveal the endings, and no typo here, because there are two, at least in the version shown here in Toronto. Forewarned, we stay till the lengthy ending credit is completely over, to see the alternative ending which is introduced casually with the words `and what if' appearing on bottom right of the screen.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is not for everyone. However, those with an appreciation for the imaginative and a taste for the bizarre would probably enjoy it."

","First of all I want to state that I don't know why in the hell people people have their panties in a bunch over Danny Boyle in the first place. 'Shallow Grave' is alright, but 'Trainspotting' was eagerly promoted to godly status by the freshly pierced-obligatory tattoo-desperate to be cool-wannabe masses who just missed the Pulp Fiction train. They wanted to feel like they were there for the something cool so they tried to make 'Trainspotting' their 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Resevoir Dogs', just becuase it was quirky, dealed with Heroin (Pulp Fiction) use, had a good soundtrack, starred Ewan, and Johnny Lee Miller from the decidedly chic 'Hackers', and was adopted from the very slick scribbles of Irving Welsh. All those elements alone do not a great movie make. American audiences may not know this but 'Resevoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' are like the Bible for British Film guys like 'Guy' Ritchie and Danny Boyle (still to this day) who are trying really hard to be that innovative and hip. Well good for them for trying, but if you REALLY watch Trainspotting for the movie itself, it's not THAT great -it kinda sucks, and has the same ending as Shallow Grave. And Have you ever seen 'The Beach'? -OR even worse 'A LIFE LESS ORDINARY'??? -God Forbid!  Danny Boyle is NOT that great....Let's not give him too much credit just for Trainspotting, and become blind to the fact that his talent for filmmaking is actually mediocre. And to prove it I give you: '28 Days Later'...... (SPOILERS)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Great Idea for a Movie........... In the hands of a better filmmaker. Ok, first of all lets take a step back: Danny Boy you have the oppurtunity to make a cool assed movie! You have the money! The fame! The reputation? there are some good ideas in there, but you want the movie to entertain... to WORK! I don't know who this Alex Garland screenwriter is, but he needs some help. I suggest a think tank. - Virus that takes over London and more?: Cool Idea...... - Virus effects you in 10 seconds: Lame (unplausible, theorectically will never spread to rural areas or overseas, and could be quickly quarantined)...... - Everyone is gone streets are empty: Cool Idea, effective..... - Infected ""Ragers"" work together, symbiyotic groups: Unbelieveable, Rage is Rage, the idea that the ""Ragers"" are similar to Zombies and ""smell"" each other, or work together is ridiculous, this didn't ruin the movie but it makes it more lame, you could've thought of something better with a little more effort....... - The whole entire miltary thing: Lame!  Also this makes the film lag. Don't you WATCH MOVIES 'Ol Danny BOY?  The entire 3rd act was completely overbearing. And it is a copy of George Romero's 'Day of The Dead' -the lamest of the 'Dead' Zombie movies, where some survivors of a world overran by zombies hook up with some military guys in an underground bunker. DIDN'T you ever see THAT?  you want to stay away from those lagging assed themes. The Militry guys act the same way in both movies they flex their muscles and bully everyone around, and experiment with the zombies/ infected.  Oh Dear...... - The Video/ Digital Video/ Blair Witch asthetic: I thought it worked and was cool. In some movies it sucks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>..... To put it simply, if you would have just played the movie in your mind before you filmed it, or asked some of your filmaking buddies how the idea sounded, I think you would have been more sure of yourself, and came up with a way KICK ASSED movie. But for some reason you fell short. Too bad. maybe that is why the British DVD has so many alternate endings. You didn't know what story you wanted to tell, perhaps, 'ol chap?....     I don't know.. It could have been cool, maybe you should have let Clive Barker write it, and Rob Zombie direct it....... I will say one thing for the movie in favor of it: it was scary! YEAH! I won't let my 10 year old watch it until he's like 14 or 15 at least! Unless he wants to have some Freaky-assed nightmares...... But other than that it was lame...Nice Try... Oh Well..."

","This movie was an amalgam of ""Day of the Triffids"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" without any of the elegance of the first or the cinematic shock value of the second.  There's a lot of discussion in America right now about films that portray the military in a bad light.  I say, bring 'em on!  But this film asks us to believe that a bunch of British soldiers would become so horny and desperate in 28 (plus) days that they'd kidnap and attempt to force themselves upon two females, one of whom is a practiced killer, the other a child who has just lost her father.  And where does Jim get his Rambo injections?  I was so completely turned off by this diversion from the more interesting issues raised by the story itself (such as the day-by-day particulars of survival and the relationships between the principals) that I lost interest in these very unpleasant people.

","In 28 Days Later. . . Danny Boyle and Alex Garland `team up' again, as it were, as they did in effect when Boyle made a movie out of Garland's popular book, The Beach.  This new lower budget grainy digital video effort seems to have fared a very great deal better with the critics than the high budget Leo Di Caprio version of The Beach.  Is it better?  I don't really think so. I had fun watching it, but considering the way it collapses into incoherence two thirds of the way through I find its almost universal acclaim  and the sheer amount of critical interest lavished on it in the press -- somewhat had to fathom. Boyle hasn't yet gotten back to the knack he had in Trainspotting and Shallow Grave for making young grunge hip and suspenseful and edgy.  His doomsday trip can't match what is in many ways its model, George Romero's ghoul flicks, especially the imperishable low-budget original, Night of the Living Dead.  He took the chance of working in a low budget and without stars, but ultimately he doesn't take the chance of being really gross and transgressive.<br/><br/>I think people were so very hard on The Beach because pretty-puss Leo was in it and it was so glossy and beautiful and a bit pretentious in its promises of excitement and mind games.  It looked like Boyle had turned slick.  Had he?  Garland wrote his book with the skin of his teeth and just got lucky. And actually the movie recaptured most of the more vivid moments of the book really well and the locations were as exotic and beautiful as you could have possibly wanted, Di Caprio and the others did an excellent job, but people would have none of it.  <br/><br/>28 Days Later is as lucky as The Beach was unlucky.  Coming in the midst of a host of overblown and costly American summer blockbusters, it somehow graces  the Cineplex and provides unexpected delight because of its modest means and the offbeat punch it manages to pack.  But let's not forget that the same Garland/Boyle team is at work on it, only this time there is no book to be loyal to.  That's where the trouble comes in. The movie starts off with a series of dazzling traumatic set pieces, as any apocalyptic flick has to and would.  There's the animal rights activists' misguided invasion of a lab where they release a bunch of primates infected with the disease of rage.  They go out and bite humans and before you know it London is empty. (Somehow end-of-the-world movies usually restrict their devastation to the place where they were made.) This is one of these clever devices low budget sci-fi filmmakers resort to:  all they had to do was shoot so early in the morning that nobody was out.  There's the freshness of the newborn in the awakening of naked Jim (Cillian Murphy) in a hospital to walk out to a city more populated with half consumed soft drink cans than with people.  The first half hour is hard to forget because it has that freshness of seeing a world through startled young eyes in an atmosphere of total adrenaline rush; the people who appear to Jim and help him are vivid because they seem the only people in the world.<br/><br/>There are a lot of movies as good as this one that nobody remembers and few have seen.  28 Days has gained admiration with a general audience little acquainted with the pulp sci-fi genre just as Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon did three years ago with people who didn't know that lots of Chinese language martial arts flicks were just as good.<br/><br/>I would feel like a bad sport saying this, because 28 Days Later is good fun and toward the end has some beautiful grainy expressionistic images, except that it stops making sense once the hero gets to the military camp where he's been promised they will be saved and instead all sorts of confused nastiness is happening.  We don't get a lot of views of the `Infected,' and when they do appear it's quick like the battles in Gladiator so we can't really see what's happening.  This is one way of bypassing budget restrictions but not, perhaps, the most satisfying one.  If  you think back to Night of the Living Dead it was way, way scarier.  And right up to the last terrible irony, it all made grim good sense."

","I went into the theater knowing nothing more than ""it's a zombie movie"".<br/><br/>Having no expectations usually makes a film more enjoyable, it allows you to be pleasantly surprised. Perhaps this is no exception. Regardless, I found this film to be very well done. A scrappy, smart, small studio (read non Hollywood) release that does not overextend itself and achieves a very intense and lasting effect.<br/><br/>The lighting and set work was stunning. The pace and suspense was very effective. My favorite thing about the film however was the realism. I don't fault a film on the details of it's portrayal of zombies. That's not the point of the film here. While some action was implausible (i.e. changing a tire in the tunnel!), I found the conviction of detail, theme, and story very realistic. The many details of post-apocalyptic Britain were intriguing, creative, and chilling. These details also made the film more believable and compelling (`the end of the world is f'ing nigh', Jim's parents' death, his headwound, irradiated apples, etc.)<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film's plot winds in smart, unpredictable, and thoughtful ways. The story does not explore the horrors of zombies, a killer virus, or the apocolypse so much as it explores the unknown and the evils inherent in man - a very real, primal, and criminal horror that already exists and is not dependent on zombies or the end of the world, just a minor breakdown in society. It is a chilling Hobbesian exploration of the social contract.<br/><br/>The propensity toward animal/mechanistic one-on-one killing (or other sexual and violent crimes) demonstrated by both protaganists (Jim's transformation at the film's end, Selena's instant dispatching of Mark) and antagonists (the soldiers) in the film is chilling. Shifting the conflict from man against monster to man against man was a beautiful development. This twist is refreshingly unpredictable and smart. It would have been effaced or inadequately explored if this film came out of Hollywood. There would have been a lot more shooting and machismo. Jim would have been played without subtlety by some hot property like Collin Ferrell.<br/><br/>Instead, the protaganists NEVER picked up guns - except to use the bayonnet. The action of this film kept the frame of resolution tight and uncomfortably man-to-man. Certainly the duality of the protagonists was explored, but the killing remained personal and uncomfortable (yet animalistic) for them. It remained responsibile, conscious, self-defense - a necessity awakened by the circumstances. This contrasts the detached mechanical use of bullets and violence employed for personal gains in power or sex (i.e. the soldiers). In a clever inversion, the one soldier who considers using the bayonnet find himself in an argument with his partner, allowing Jim to escape. It is this reluctance to take moral and social responsibility that separates the antagonists from the protagonists, the animals from the humans, the soldiers from the non-militants, and (almost) the women from the men.<br/><br/>I was happy with the acting and found the characters moderately well developed.<br/><br/>Though the film loosely borrows some concepts, themes, and action from other post-apocaloyptic sources (Romero's original Night of the Living Dead, King's novel The Stand), I do not fault this as a weakness. Overall I found no particular weaknesses in the acting, direction, cinematography, etc. In that respect I disagree with many of the reviews here."

","As you can probably gather from the title above I didn't pretty much care for this film.  I will admit it was scary at times but that is not enough to get over the fact that this film is a remake of Night of the Living Dead with bits of Dawn of the Dead(the sequel to the Night) added in too.  In other words, with the exception of the characters and locations, everything about this film has been done before and on FILM if I may add.  28 Days Later wins the award for being the first feature film I've ever seen in a theater that was shot on a Canon XL-1.  Not at a film festival or at a special screening but at just a regular average movie theater.  Oops, I forgot Blair Witch, that is the only other one shot on such a low grade video that I have seen.  The results were, for lack of a better term, bad. The depreciation in resolution was very apparent and so was the limitation of colors.  I don't really understand why the film was shot that way. One would just assume that is was done for budgeting constraints but Danny Boyle is an established filmmaker who did such hits as Trainspotting and the Beach.  Isn't he able to purchase film stock for his films by now.  The film also had a couple of holes in it's story that made it even worse.  First, why did the zombies or the ""infected"" go running after and attacking the humans.  In Night of the Living Dead it was because they fed on the living or the just killed and in Return of the Living Dead they ate the brains to ease the pain of being dead but in this film it is never established. It's just assumed that because they did it in those other films why not in this one too.  Second, is it possible for a bacteria or virus, which ever it was, to turn people into monsters in 20 or 30 seconds when no other infection on earth works that fast or nearly that fast.  I know the film is fiction but that pushing the walls of suspension of disbelief a little too far. There was one other guy who wrote a review on the film here that stated that he liked the portrayal of how humans act under such an apocalyptic crisis. The part with the soldiers in the mansion.  That pessimistic look at humanity was already covered in the film Dawn of the Dead.  I guess this film was ultimately shot on video because no one really wanted to fund an underwritten remake of Night of the Living Dead."

That part of the story is told very very well.  Rage is a contagious disease that to cure we must first understand.  The second scene of the movie was marvelous.  The use of that Godspeed You Black Emperor! song was well thought up and used.  It built up the tension fantastically and climaxed well.  It's a beautiful song and a beautiful scene.  The scene at the end of the movie where the woman doesn't know whether or not our hero has the virus is fantastic.  Our hero had to fill himself with rage to destroy not the infected but his non-infected enemies.

","28 Days Later is not your average horror film. Borrowing from movies such as ""Omega Man"", 28 Days Later effectively combines horror, some action, and suspense.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up in a London hospital to find that the city is deserted. Teaming up with Selena (Naomie Harris), Jim learns that an extremely contagious virus has turned most of the people into mindless machines of uncontrolled rage. Later, Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and Hannah (Megan Burns) join the group. The group heads to Manchester to investigate a radio broadcast from Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston).<br/><br/>Avoiding typical Hollywood formulaic scare tactics, Director Danny Boyle maintains a balance, striving to weave some character development and suspense into the mix. Jim is first bewildered and passive, but as his situation continues to change, he eventually responds by taking action. Selena, coldly focused on survival, later blossoms as she regains touch with her humanity.<br/><br/>One step that you have to take to enjoy the film is to accept that a virus can infect and transform a person in a mere 30 seconds. Also, Jim ends up a little too blood-thirsty during his 'save Selena' crusade. Reducing Jim's savageness during these scenes would have made for a more believable fit to his character. Several others of note include: a taxi that drives over a pile of cars; Jim doesn't use any of the readily available cars for the first third of the movie; Frank lifts the side of the taxi to change a tire; and we get to see Jim naked several times (while Murphy has a nice body to show, it doesn't add much to the plot).<br/><br/>The acting is fairly flat. Cillian Murphy never hits any big highs or lows with his personal trauma (like dealing with his parent's death). Naomie Harris ends up being a little more personable on screen, taking some of the spotlight away from Murphy.<br/><br/>Technically, the effects were low budget. During some of the 'vacant London' scenes, I thought I noticed reflections of traffic in windows. Some of the grainy film effects were weak, and some camera work was a bit too shaky. But despite minor glitches, the film works fairly well.<br/><br/>At times dismal and depressing, and not treading any new ground, 28 Days Later manages to bring together decent plot, actors, cinematography, and directing. I would watch this movie again."

It's near impossible to find a recent movie (barring comedies) that has had an impact on this viewer, the way 28 DAYS LATER did.<br/><br/>Now, many people have been heard to say ""this movie looks like crap, it's shot on Digital Video.""  To them, I say, ""SNOB!""  How dare you rank on a movie because of the medium it was shot on.  Last time I checked, many films pre-CITIZEN KANE were pretty grainy and often left with sound that was riddled with crackles, hiss, and pops.

The post-apocalyptic ""zombie"" (mind you, no where in the movie was the term zombie used, they were simply infected.) thrillers I have seen to date have all been ridiculous, poorly shot (on film mind you), terribly written pieces of garbage.  28 DAYS LATER surpasses the generic and trite territory of a horror film - in fact, it is not a horror film, it is a fine piece of thriller cinema.<br/><br/>Boyle does an impeccable job moving from one plot point to another, keeping the entire thing plausible, if not possible, and in fact - suspending disbelief for an entire audience - using a budget that could barely support a middle class family.  If every film made spent as much time in its conceptualization and plot development, and less time on making sure they have the camera on the right F-stop and running at the right ASA speed, the film world would be a hell of a lot better.<br/><br/>In conclusion - The down to earth intellectualism of 28 days later is left me with a grin - and the fact that a brilliant movie can be brought to life without squandering all of Zaire's Gross National Product, makes me feel a little better about the future of movies."

","28 Days Later was certainly an intense experience.<br/><br/>One could say the premise is not really an original one.  One could even say that the film is not particularly ground breaking in the way, for instance, Pulp Fiction was.  But the film gripped me from start to delicious finish.<br/><br/>Taut and disturbing, the film is unflinching in its buildup of suspense and in its commentary on human nature.  Stray camera shots and seemingly meaningful details are sparingly littered throughout the film to keep the suspense taut and brittle as an unplucked guitar string.  Swift and clever editing veers the film away from its campier B-movie counterparts and allies itself with the audiences' imagination, making the film even more effective in what we think we see.  (SPOILER: At the denuoement of the film, there is a 5 second shot of what looks like the word HELL at the top of the screen - which ultimately turns out to be HELP).<br/><br/>Ultimately, what lifts this film out of the pack of gratuitous horror flicks and their unrelenting sequels we have come to expect in the past two decades is that the film not only works as a genuinely scary and suspenseful film, it also preys on the subconscious with that nagging ""what if..."".  What makes this film brilliant is that it goes that one step further and, within the digesis of the film, examines this subconscious at work in classic meta-filmic irony.  The audience watches this film, fixated - not unlike the laboratory babboons at the start of the film.<br/><br/>The film is not pat in its handling of human rage and violence as social commentary.  There are no good guys and bad guys.  Our leads are equally capable of horrendous deeds in the name of self preservation as are the military personnel. The activists in the beginning of the film trigger an epidemic with their absolutist self-righteous ignorance.  When all bets are off and government is defunct, decency becomes a rare commodity to be bartered and negotiated.  There are no easy answers here, and one calls to mind (in addition to the obvious Romero classic Night of the Living Dead) William Golding's Lord of the Flies, in which none of the characters emerge unscathed by the events that unfold.  It is never clear in the film what the infected people want of the uninfected few, but that question is irrelevant. By tracking the devolvement of what the characters believe to be safety in numbers - to every man for himself, the film hints at an answer.  As Satre once said ""Only violence can put an end to man's brutality"".<br/><br/>In much the same way that Cronenberg, Craven and Romero's horror films of the 70s were an answer to the Vietnam era, it seems that 28 Days Later offers a voice to an era plagued by new diseases and doctrines of pre-emption, an era of unilateral war, uncertainty and paranoia, of mistrust and isolation.<br/><br/>Perhaps this review has been too academic, but rest assured, the film is quite a ride on the wild side, and the discussions it has generated bears testament to its power."

Whether this is an actual viral situation or simply the results of constant exposure to violent images is left (quite correctly) to our imaginations, when the animals are released by a group of animal rights activists, they attack their ""rescuers"", releasing the horror on England.  28 Days after this event, a young bike messenger, Jim (brilliantly played by Cillian Murphy) awakens from an accident induced coma to find that nothing is close to the way he left it.  London, and all of England is empty.  Save for the infected and a few animals...nothing lives.  He eventually stumbles on a group of survivors (Naomie Harris and Noah Huntley) and after them a father and his daughter (the incomperable Brendan Gleeson and a wonderful Megan Burns).

"ilovedolby","8","0","0","20 July 2003"," `28 Days Later' gains its strength from its remarkable human approach in the wake of such horrific events.
","Let's face some facts about the today's horror genre-it sucks! With moronic plot sequences accompanied by the worst bred actors, the level of expectation with such films is low. However, Danny Boyle (`Trainspotting') has brought moviegoers something new, yet almost traditional in the sense of horror films; a zombie thriller called `28 Days Later.' By using good actors, an amateur format for the cinematography and a decent story, Boyle gives us something that is not only horrific, but also terrifying in the very notions of its story. `28 Days Later' tells the story of a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a hospital one morning, only to find that the world he knows has turned upside down. What's more, there appears to be no one around. Jim soon realizes that the human race has been taken over by a plague that turns people into zombies. He then finds some survivors; one named Selena (Naomie Harris) who tells of the events that have transpired. In particular, how the virus is spread, through blood and other human secretions. As they search the city, they find an apartment building with holiday lights in the windows. They enter the building and find a few more survivors, a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). While there, they hear a recording on a hand radio that tells any survivors to come to Manchester for help and 'the answer to infection.' But when they arrive in Manchester, they find more than they can handle. It's easy to admire Boyle for his great direction on this picture. The amateur film format is really the best trick up this director's sleeve. Because the print of film has a videotape appearance, it makes the movie appear raw and rough to watch. The camera, during suspense shots, is always shaking which gives the audience an almost dizzying feel to watching the movie. With the dizzying feel of the film, it also makes the story seem more real. That's where the real horror sets in-how incredibly real the film appears. Regardless of the notions of zombies, the idea of a plague, which in this case was manmade, administered to monkeys that got out of hand and harmed their trainers turning them into zombies appears in a realistic way. The very opening of the film centers around a break-in to an animal facility that houses these mad-apes and a botched attempt to destroy them. After that, for a few minutes we see news footage of rioting and complete social unrest in the wake of the plague as it hits the whole of England; something that could certainly happen when a society is faced with an unstoppable force. The acting in the film was very good. Murphy and Harris are great in their roles as survivors looking for an answer to the infection. But real credit has to be given to Gleeson for his role as Frank, a father trying to save his young daughter from the dangers that exist in their world now. We feel his pain as he tries to make his daughter feel like things are going to be all right. He does this by stringing up Christmas lights in their apartment window and binge shopping in a grocery store. In the end, `28 Days Later' gains its strength from its remarkable human approach in the wake of such horrific events, however, absurd as they may be. It's a great change in pace for lovers of horror films, not consumed by the commercialism that ruins most entertainment these days. ***"

","I agree with John Taylor. My reaction was highly mixed.<br/><br/>The good: This story walks the path of British catastrophe fiction which may go back to the late 1890s: THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. I also recall AFTER LONDON. There are elements of John Wyndham here -- the hospital scene is straight out of TRIFIDS (the book, not the awful film). This also reminds one of NO BLADE OF GRASS (the fine book and the somewhat lesser film). Do not forget Jack London's sturm und drang THE SCARLET PLAGUE. There is a cautionary element about biological experiments, and especially how well-meaning protesters can get in over their heads and put everyone else in it. We see the disintegration, then the perversion of state authority.<br/><br/>The bad: They wanted to make a scary monster movie, fine. ALIEN(S) is such, but here we are definitely long on spook/gore and short on realism -- although, yes, it can be a white knuckle operation. 28 DAYS tries too hard. There are two sequences which are superfluous, all for the chills. The chained experimental subject -- rather too heavy on cultural symbolism -- is totally unnecessary. Then the disease: The etiology indicates a massive assault on the central nervous system with serious secondary gastro-intestinal effects. 1) The onset of symptoms is rapid beyond belief even for story purposes. 2) One should also expect motor dysfunction after personality disintegration, increasing steadily with the victim helpless. 3) The upper G.I. damage in many subjects would lead to dehydration (at least) and possible internal haemorrhage, which is what it looks like.<br/><br/>Also: I note how two potentially inconvenient characters . . . go away. I further note how the film correctly gives credit to the racially mixed society of modern Britian, but grow weary of yet another kick-butt improbable heroine in deference to contemporary feminism. Finally, the communications options -- necessary for plot and denouement -- are twenty years out of date.<br/><br/>And OH! 28 DAYS was made with some kind of digital system, fine, but the movie house put it on a large screen which degraded the image and frankly hurt the eyes. This is not the fault of the film makers. Its title remains a mystery. The lunar synodic period is twenty-nine days, if one is alluding to the appropriate legend."

I recently saw Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later here in the U.S., and I think that it is superb.  I am not particularly a horror fan, but in a case such as this I would say that categorizing the film by putting it into a specific genre would be like saying 'the middle east has a lot of Muslims.'  This movie has a lot of zombies (not to compare them to Muslims), yes, but it also has a lot more than that.<br/><br/>The horror of this movie isn't always the kind where you jump in your seat and then breathe a sigh of relief as you and your girlfriend exchange smiles.  It's got some of that, but moreover it's a deep-seated sort of tension, mixed with apocalyptic awe, mixed with a sort of helpless curiosity.  Also, there are many interwoven and complex themes running through the course of the film (I could expect no less of Danny Boyle), and not all of them are neatly resolved in the ending.  For example, during much of the second half one actually enjoys seeing some of the few surviving humans being ravaged by the zombies.  Or: everything is potentially contaminated, and while they are still in what's left of society, all they can eat and drink is junk food and soda, which I thought was interesting.<br/><br/>Technically, I have to mention that the Digital Video suited this film perfectly (to parrot other reviewers); it gave it a very realistic element that went along with everything else I think Boyle is trying to do here. The main characters are complex, interesting, and likeable; and there is a certain amount of romance/sexual tension, appropriate to the context of the film (very instinctual and not overdramatized).  The ending is actually not one: Much is left unanswered, but more in a compelling rather than disappointing way.  Also, there is some symbolism going on here that leaves one wondering (the color red, the significance of 28 days).<br/><br/>Here is part of a review by someone who didn't like the film:<br/><br/>
they don't explain a lot of the plot and they spend too much time with what I like to call ""empty film time"". ""Empty film time"" is when they spend time showing a character doing something somewhat pointless or overly ordinary. Such as walking around, eating, up-close views of facial expressions, etc.<br/><br/>If you disagree with this guy, Go see the film!  Otherwise, wait till Star Wars 3 comes out."
"zachsaltz","Null","0","0","18 July 2003"," 3 Reasons Why ""28 Days Later..."" Works
","Three reasons why ""28 Days Later..."" is an extremely effective horror film:<br/><br/>1.  The grainy, pseudo-amateurish style in which the film is shot.  It looks like a documentary (and brings back memories of ""The Blair Witch Project"") and the<br/><br/>scenes with Jim walking in a barren London are extraordinay because they feel eerily real (and we don't expect a film that looks this low-budget to feature this kind of amazing sequence).  The style is also good in scenes where there is little or no light (i.e. the opening sequence, when Jim, Mark, and Selena spend the<br/><br/>night at Jim's parents' house). <br/><br/>2.  Boyle deliberately makes his 'zombies' difficult to focus on.  Like Shyamalan's ""Signs"", the creatures here are ominous and always slightly out of focus so we never quite know what we are truly looking at.  The zombies are fast-moving,<br/><br/>just like the way Boyle films his action sequences; in the opening sequence and when Selena is forced to kill Mark, the camera moves so rapidly, it's hard for us to see what's going on.  I assume that Boyle wants us to feel the terror that Jim is feeling, not knowing what is going on, everything happening so fast.<br/><br/>3.  The movie is very well-written and acted.  I know many have shunned the<br/><br/>final act, but I think it's the film's highpoint, in reference to the script.  Like most great horror films, ""28 Days Later..."" questions the morals and ethics of mankind, and we see the problem facing the army base.  How is mankind supposed to<br/><br/>continue living?

"oskar-7","Null","0","0","15 July 2003"," A Good Surprise
","***If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't read anything about it. It'll be a more pure viewing experience.**** I would hazard a guess that nearly ever viewer of this film came into it thinking it would be a horror film.  I was looking forward to a horror film, because, I was kind of tired, and I was only going to hang out with a girl. However, as the title of this review might reveal, I was pleasantly surprised by what I ended up seeing.  I guess one of the points is that a good movie will always wake you up.<br/><br/>Almost immediately I was struck by how unorthodox the film was; an important point because if it were a horror film, even one like ""The Ring"", a large degree of the film would be typical, in terms of camera movement and photography, staging, and the like.  But when we opened ""28 Days Later"", we see a fully naked Jim--something a typical horror movie would never do, because it would alienate a large portion of the audience.  Then, there was the lack of score, which lead to very empty scenes (for a horror movie). In short, it became very obvious that this was no slasher flick.<br/><br/>Okay, enough exposition.  This film was magnificent.  It blew me away. It is probably the best film I have seen all year.  I admired its look, low-res, independent, amateuristic at some points, sometimes gritty.  The movement on the picture in many sequences is just excellent.  The entire sequence of Jim walking through an empty London is now a staple in my cinematic treasure box, if such a thing exists.  With echoes of Kubrick, and the New Wave movement (heavy on the latter).<br/><br/>I like the idea of portraying rage as a virus...its a fairly easy connection to make, if you think about it.  That's probably the best part of the movie, that idea.  Because in the beginning, we are told that the uninfected are good, and the infected are bad, are dangerous, but as we go on, Danny Boyle slowly begins to illustrate the similarity between infected and uninfected--Selena killing Mark without thinking, the insanity of the soldiers.  But the finest point of the film is made in the climax, when Jim unleashes the infected soldier on the compound, and before.  When faced with almost certain death, Jim's form of survival becomes rage.  When he runs through the house, showing no compassion for even the cowering black soldier; when he saves the two women, he is almost undistinguishable, aesthetically, from the infected.  Boyle makes the point ultimate, that humanity is rage, is angry as the infected, and that humanity is almost a virus. Indeed, this point is brought up in the dinner scene, after the omelet, by the New Age Sergeant, but it escapes any but scant notice.  (Similar to Coppola divulging the moral of Apocalypse Now Redux in the dinner conversation at the French Plantation.) Thinking about it as I write, Boyle also references the first part of Kubrick's ""2001"".  There is some connection between the apes discovering violence as a way of evolution, and the apes carrying the virus which decimates England."

","First and above all else this movie or at least the print of this movie that i saw was out of focus which automatically places it beneath Kangaroo Jack which at least cared enough to be in focus. The highest an out of focus movie can rate for me is a seven and this one is not good enough for that by far. I'm a big Romero Dead fan and seeing artsy fartsy crap like this reminds me why i appeciate the Dead trilogy so much. By the way, I complained about the focus to the theater manager who spoke to the projectionist who related back to me through the manager that there was nothing he could do about the focus because it was a low grade film. Five is a pretty low grade which is what I give 28 Days later. Of course, if you get drunk before the movie or are watching the movie underwater then focus won't mean as much and maybe this movie is actually a seven if you're in Scuba gear and maybe even an eight if you're stoned in scuba gear"
"ke82","Null","0","0","14 July 2003"," not your average scary movie
","Countless scary movies, even teen slasher flicks, make use of the classic Gothic conceits. Remote locations, empty houses, dark and stormy nights. But 28 Days Later distinguishes itself as an urban dweller's horror film. The story begins when Jim awakens from a coma in a silent, empty hospital. Outside is a silent, empty London. He's completely alone in a place built by and for millions, now all gone. He wanders in the unreal city, past monuments and everyday places. It's natural for him to look for someone else, so he shouts hello over and over, and eventually turns into a church, hoping to at least find a priest. Soon enough, he discovers that he is, most unfortunately, not really alone.<br/><br/>From then, the movie uses the half-conscious language of an urbanite's paranoid nightmare. Shadows growing on a wall. Footsteps running up behind you. Getting a flat tire in a bad place. Knocking on the wrong door for help. The fumbling and the adrenalin. Get the car going. Get up the stairs. Get the door bolted. Just in time. Now that's terror.<br/><br/>This is the best part of 28 Days Later. The center of the movie, when Selena (another survivor) and Jim meet up with a father and daughter, is a chance to understand who these people might been before the plague. It may not be standard horror movie fare, but it was funny and affecting. The last part of the movie began to drift, however, oddly enough just as it drags out all the Gothic images, down to the remote mansion and an on-cue thunderstorm. The conflict becomes more one-dimensional and predictable, rather than being any sort of insightful commentary on human behavior. The infected are replaced with the vile, and the new threat hanging over the protagonists feels gratuitous.  And with interest waning, I had too much time to start thinking over plot holes.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was worth seeing. The London scenes are amazing. The interlude in the green countryside was striking. The infected scared the hell out of me, while the protagonists easily drew me in. The actors playing Jim and Selena were terrific. And I'd watch Brendan Gleeson read aloud from a telephone book. I just found the last part of the film disappointing, despite getting to see Christopher Eccleston doing a bit of a Mad Hatter thing during the dinner scene."
"rroberts1320","5","0","0","14 July 2003"," Not worth a trip to the theater, but worth renting.
","28 Days is different than any movie I've seen recently. I like the plot, however I feel as if they tried to fit too much story into one movie. There were a few different parts of the plot being developed when I felt like they should have tried to focus more on certain areas. It is obviously a low budget film, but that doesn't really hurt the movie's rating as far as I am concerned. What does hurt it is how they don't explain a lot of the plot and they spend too much time with what I like to call ""empty film time"". ""Empty film time"" is when they spend time showing a character doing something somewhat pointless or overly ordinary. Such as walking around, eating, up-close views of facial expressions, etc. While I realize that a low-budget film needs a lot of things to feel the voids, I believe they could have used this time for more in depth dialogue. I want to know how and why the monkeys became infected and a more in-depth description of what happen in the world. Overall, I would give this movie a 5."
"seattleferry","Null","0","0","15 July 2003"," Finally, a horror movie that doesn't insult our intelligence.
","I imagine the publicity machine that went to work on 28 Days Later will, with hindsight, regret having made reference to Zombies in the promotional campaign. In doing so, it created a reason for people to criticize the movie or at least spend as much time talking about what it isn't rather than what it is. Which is a shame as this is a though-provoking. intelligent, and well crafted movie that grabs the attention in a pretty scary--it's a movie I know but this could happen--opening sequence and never lets go. The screen writers must take credit for not allowing the apocalyptic undercurrent that moves the story along to deteriorate into a classic horror-flick treatment where the dumbest characters do the dumbest things. On the contrary, they seem to have adopted a rather simplistic and refreshing approach: what's the obvious thing to do in this situation?<br/><br/> In this context beating a friend to death in a heartbeat, because if you don't he'll likely tear you to shreds, does seem the most obvious and natural thing in the world to do, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Technically, sure, the movie has a few holes. But when art imitates life why on earth would we expect perfection? It more than compensates, though, in the afterthought-what you're left with when the movie has run its course. And in this case, the very real and disturbing message that remains is that whatever notion of evil we concoct for our amusement and entertainment, nothing will ever compare to man's inhumanity to man. And this, I'm afraid to say, is the real horror of 28 Days Later. Go see it. And bring a friend. I guarantee you'll want someone to talk to on your way home."

"ethan-34","5","0","0","14 July 2003"," This movie isn't what you may be expecting
","The description for this movie says that it is about survivors of an epidemic banding together. That, combined with a bad assumption that UK flicks are more intelligent than US films, led me to think that this movie would be interesting.<br/><br/>No. It is a zombie horror flick where you are constantly bracing for what is going to jump in from around the corner and try to kill you. The epidemic which is the premise of the movie is a contrivance: the infected person will bite you or projectile-vomit blood onto you, and then you are infected with 100% reliability within 10 to 20 seconds. Those who are infected live for the sole purpose of infecting those who are not yet infected. They don't use weapons or tools, or even speak. They're zombies, remember?<br/><br/>But their eyes are red and they run around waving their arms, drenched in blood, and issuing blood curdling screams that could not possibly come from a human voice. Yup, zombies.<br/><br/>There is an attempt to make for cleverness by having the main character experience rage (""rage"" is the name of the epidemic) in a parallel to the rage of the infected zombies, but the whole premise of the disease and the army barracks is so contrived that it was hard to appreciate the effort. In the end, this was nearly two hours of intense fear while my brain is going ""this is dumb"". At least the normal horror movies have a sense of humor about themselves...<br/><br/>If you want an end-of-the-world movie with zombies that has some scares, but isn't quite as intense as 28 Days Later (and it was very intense), and has a sense of humor about itself, rent Night of the Comet. It's a B-grade scifi/horror flick, but it knows that it is B-grade and revels in it. When Night of the Comet ends you've had a good time. When 28 Days Later ended, it took me 30 minutes to recover and I'd wished I hadn't seen it in the first place."

","The lack of money that went into this film only helped to make it that much better.  Without digital effects or elaborate action sequences 28 days later relies on more traditional camera tricks to raise its level of intensity.  I especially liked the way the director used industrial rock as opposed to the more melancholy notes of other horror films.  While some have compared this movie to another favorite of mine, Resident Evil, the two are not comparable.  Resident was a true popcorn zombie film while this is more like a lesser Night of the Living Dead with a conscience. Unlike most horror movies (and movies in general) 28 Days Later has a simple and clear moral which is what makes it the best horror movie I have seen this year.  A rating of 7.5 to 8.0 is more than fair but for fans of horror this is a must see and instant classic."
"callaway76","8","0","0","13 July 2003"," Pay no Attention to the Trailer
","Preview Pre-Review<br/><br/>The first trailer I saw for this movie was the teaser, very short. It basically shows you a man waking up in a hospital to a world stripped of people, void of music or narration. Immediately the mind scatters. You become intrigues, speculative and enticed to see this Sci-Fi, Philosophical, Brit-Flick.<br/><br/>Subsequent trailers followed frequently during my favorite television program (ironically the movie makes a joke about the Simpsons) revealing further plot to this movie and unfortunately portraying it as a Zombie genre Horror flick. I knew from the teaser that the movie was good and had to mute out the previews to keep my head from thinking this movie to be another 'Evil Dead'.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in a local theater packed with many high school students. Many people left after 20 minutes, pairs would leave every 7 minutes there after. The trailer spoiled it for them, similar to how it spoiled me.<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>I loved this movie! First off the camera work (what appears to be digital camcorders), though it takes getting used to, was an awesome canvas. Second the acting, well done. Similar to Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead'. It displayed true human angst for salvation after man's society has been replaced by eminent threat. The directing was superb. I have always loved 'Trainspotting', 'Life Less Ordinary' was decent and I was advised to steer clear of 'The Beach'. It was hard to associate the directing in '28DL' with any of these movies. It was definitely Danny Boyle turning over a new leaf.<br/><br/>
Overall this movie pleasantly fused elements of Goosebump inducing story telling, Jump-out-of-your-seat Thrills, and the overly-forgotten advantages of low budget film making (the most expensive special effect was probably the red contact lenses). Together you get a thinking man's Thriller. It is not a zombie flick since technically there are no Zombies only sick, very sick, people. It reads like a novel but it grabs you like a animalistic killer. Well shot and well developed it is a completely original take on an age old idea.<br/><br/>Even though it has a preview for ""Jason vs. Freddy"" it is not a slasher movie nor your run-of-the mill Horror movie. I'd say worth seeing."
"raypatnaude","8","0","0","13 July 2003"," An intelligent, well-crafted horror film...
","The trailer from 28 Days Later makes the film look like a remake of The Omega Man, which starred Charlton Heston as the last man on earth, save for a handful of Survivors and many many nocturnal zombies. It looked like a shameless remake, in fact, seemingly counting on enough time having passed that no one would notice the similarities- the apocalyptic plague, the number and race and gender of the survivors, the nature and appearance of the Zombies. As a fan of the zombie genre, and of the post-apocalyptic genre, I noticed, and was very disappointed that the guy who brought me Trainspotting had sunk this low as to do a remake of the Omega Man without even billing it as such. At least Ridley Scott upcoming remake is using the original novel's title, ""I am legend"". But I was wrong. It's not Omega Man Redux, it has it's own original story which is among the best in its genres. It references the Living Dead films, especially the best of that series, Dawn of the Dead, and the darkest of the series, Day of the Dead. In the postapocalyptic genre, it references the best of the 1980's :the the underrated 1985 film Night of the Comet, and the art-house version of the same year, The Quiet Earth. It also references the post-nuclear-war films of that decade: despite the title, not so much The Day After, more like the far more human version:Testamtent, and the far more depressing British version:Threads. Thus it draws form the best of each genre, mixing them together to somehow form a tru;ly scary, unsettling, creepy, bleak, yet fun film. And moreover it does this while remaining only very slightly postmodern- cynical, but never tongue-in cheek liek the characters in Kevin Williamson films who have to beat us over the head with how aware they are of the conventions of their genre. The best line of the film, the last woman on earth to the last man: ""So what do you want, then Jim? For us to find a cure and save the world? Or just fall in love and f***?"" The heroes are likeable, and you root for them and feel for themm when they die or turn into zombies. The villains are fleshed out- but just enough to be a little sympathtic and realistic. That goes for the humans villains, who ultimately are just trying to survive- and the zombies, all of whom can be seen to have varying degrees of resistance to their carnivorous nature, based on the strength of their character. Visually, the film tries to scare you in the usual horror film ""it was just a cat"" ways, but it also tries a few smore subtle tricks with the film stock to overcome the film's fantastic subject matter and draw the audience into beleiving this is real. While much of the film is shot on what appears to be 8 or 16mm, which makes it look like more of a documentary, it avoids the Blair Witch-style hand held shots, favoring an unusually static camera with unusal, unsettling, almost random composition in the frame, giving the feel of the action having been caught on hundreds of Englands security cameras, and edited together from that. I cannot recommend this film highly enough to fans of the zombie, post-apocalyptic, or last-man-on-earth sub-genres- it rivals the best, and I recommend it strongly to all others who happen to enjoy an intelligent, well-crafted horror film."

I knew going in that it was going to be no such thing. I stated in an earlier post that it is NOT a zombie movie. And I might add that I WASN'T disappointed that it was not a zombie movie. I found the premise of a virus that reduces people to pure rage far more disturbing than any run of the mill zombie. Also, please stop assuming that we didn't like it because we went in with our brains turned off, ready to be spoon-fed typical horror movie cliches and crap. Finally, stop assuming that we didn't like it because it was shot on digital video and had a ""gritty, grainy"" look to it rather than the standard Hollywood gloss. I have no problem with that type of ""raw"" looking photography.<br/><br/>
I didn't like this movie because I just didn't like it. I don't think it made the most of its premise; it was poorly paced (which is not to say that I wanted it to be paced like a ""Terminator"" flick); there were HUGE plot holes, some of which I mention in my earlier post; the characters did things that made no sense (and didn't do things that would have made perfect sense); and the movies central theme about man's capacity for violence and cruelty is not especially earth-shattering. Hasn't anyone ever read or seen ""Lord of the Flies""? Finally, beneath the ""grit and grain"" of the digital video photography there IS a typical Hollywood flick lurking--just a slower paced on. Near the end when Jim finds Selena after his wet, shirtless Rambo-like adventure around the estate they end up embracing and kissing, finally acknowledging their attraction--how cute and romantic and Hollywood. I love the fact that he lunges at her without first reassuring her that he was not infected--this, despite the fact that she is holding a machete and he has previously seen her in action with it.<br/><br/>If you liked this movie that's fine. I would never begrudge anyone something that provided them with enjoyment and food for thought. But we folks who DIDN'T like it weren't necessarily sitting in the theater in a brain-dead stupor waiting for a British version of a Jerry Bruckheimer or Wes Craven movie--which seems to be the prevailing assumption. You are wrong. An actively engaged brain can decide that it likes something or that it doesn't. I, along with others, did not like this movie. That doesn't make me (or them) dolts."

A monkey-borne plague has spread across England and many people in the country have fled while others have died...or have they?

It's got the same premise as resident evil but i found that movie to be more entertaining.  There were no twists and no surprises unless you call the silly subplot with the major a surprise.  It wasn't even a comtemplative apocalyptic film as i did not feel anything for any of the characters or get any sense of what it would be like to be in that situation.

","Although I would agree that Danny Boyle is a good director, I think this movie is complete garbage. The cinematography is stunning, yet the story leaves much to be desired. *SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>The movie begins with a very brief scene consisting of animal rights activists attempting to free monkeys from some sort of scientific research center. When discovered by a scientist, he warns them not to free the monkeys because they are ""infected with rage"". Of course our friendly activists don't listen and all Hell breaks loose (which we don't get to see). 28 days later, our hero (Jim) wakes up in a hospital without knowledge of how he got there. He leaves to find the streets of London completely void of any signs of life. When he enters a church, he finds a floor full of infected people who chase him through the streets. Two other survivors (Selena and Mark), who have found out how to kill the infected, rescue him. They explain to Jim that everyone is pretty much dead and that anyone who becomes infected needs to be killed immediately. After a few misadventures (including Mark's death), they discover a signal in light coming from the home of a man and his daughter. The end of the movie consists of the four survivors taking refuge with soldiers who have sent out a radio signal to any who are listening that they have the answer to infection. When the soldiers decide (between scenes of fighting off the infected with flood lights, land mines, and volleys of machine-gun fire) that they are going to kill Jim and rape his two female companions (one of them a young teenager), Jim outsmarts the entire army unit and uses the infected as a weapon against them. To me, it goes without saying that the writer clearly ran out of good ideas a few minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>Moviegoers can certainly sympathize with the characters on screen, however undeveloped they may be. The problem with the movie is the ""infected"" people. These horribly disfigured characters, rather than adding shock and suspense, add an enormous sense of clichÃ© to the film that allows it to be compared to such cheesy zombie flicks as ""Resident Evil"". In fact, the suspense is almost completely erased because the attacks of the infected are usually preceded by fast-paced views of their charges at victims from their own perspective. In short, you are visually warned of what's coming before it even happens (as if anyone needs any sort of clue as to where this movie is going). I applaud the shooting of this film very highly. The camera-work (particularly the shots of an abandoned London) is astonishing. That, unfortunately, is as good as this movie gets."

","I agree with people who say this film is not really a Zombie movie. I definetley has more in common with films like The Omega Man than any of the Romero Zombie films. I think though, that a lot of people have been put off by the fact that it is a very non-Hollywood looking film. It was in parts gritty and grim, and in other parts beautifully shot, just like life, just unlike a lot of Hollywood films. We are not spoonfed information, instead we are asked to use our imaginations as to how the virus works, and how things have happened. All the best scary movies ask you to use your imagination. We only get glimpses of the 'scary enemies' as was the case in Jaws and Alien which achieved good tension, and unlike Alien Resurrection which did not. The heavy editing was only really used when involving the infected, which I though enhanced the sense of fury they had, and the editing in the 3rd and final part of the movie perfectly displayed a sense of panic and confusion.<br/><br/>This film has it's flaws and is not entirely original, however it is an effective high-tension thriller/horror and Jims walk around a deserted London is one of the best 5 minutes of cinema in a long time."

","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie and good thing, too. Anyone expecting your run-of-the-mill horror flick will be disappointed because 28 Days Later is certainly not your average horror movie.<br/><br/>First off, the camera angles, shots and film quality is unlike your typical film. Although the choice of shots and angles were distracting at times, the overall effect works. The premise of the film is that a virus has swept through England, killing most people or turning them into flesh-eating zombies referred to as ""the infected"". The opening shots of a vacant and silent London are disquieting and sets the tone for a creepy, sparse, and disturbing film.<br/><br/>The violence is retained into short flashes for the most part and gore is present but not the purpose of the film. Rather, it is very character driven. Unlike most horror movies, you get to know these characters and actually care whether they live or die.<br/><br/>Don't expect all your questions to be answered in this film. There are a number of things left unexplained but I found the film wholly satisfying nonetheless. It was scary without being redundant and it had a creepiness factor that is too often missing in films of this genre."
"toshikk","Null","0","0","8 July 2003"," ""Zombie flick""? Are you kidding me?... (possible spoilers)
","If ignorance is bliss, than the IMDB comment board must be the paradise. And today I found another proof for it: the fact that half of all the people that commented on the ""28 days later"" here were actually discussing things like (sweet jesus!) differences between ""real zombies"" and the infected guys in the movie, for god's sake!<br/><br/>People! What the heck is wrong with you? Wake up! What is it with Americans always trying to put everything in some kind of a supid framework and then bashing everything that doesn't fit? Aren't we supposed to be unbiased and unprejudiced? You've been told that this is a zombie flick. It is not. Big deal! This is not what the movie is about... And this is not what you should be thinking after watching it...<br/><br/>Now the movie itself. Simply put, excellent. Just what I've expected. Sca ry enough to make me jump a couple of times (and it takes a lot to scare a person like me), and smart enough to make me think about some things I don't normally think about after watching a sci-fi movie. First, the whole ""kill an infected in a heartbeat"" thing. You don't normally see that in movies like this one. Usually the character manages to say a long sad tirade, shed a tear, and apologize a thousand times before killing the good-guy-gone-bad person. Here, it's a bit more brutal and realistic. You get bitten - you're going away. Then, the deserted London sequence. Brilliant. The similar sequences in Vanilla Sky and Devil's Advocate are nothing comparing to this one. This is probably the scariest part of the movie. Hollywood horror flicks directors should learn from Danny Boyle. Silence and absence of monsters (filmed properly, of course) work much, much better than ""creepy"" music and presence of one. Also, one of the best scenes in the movie is the ""dialogue"" between Jim and a ""disloyal"" soldier while they're waiting to be executed. The camerawork is excellent (just as it is throughout the movie... i'm not describing it here, so just go see it), and there is some kind of a message (something you rarely see in modern movies). The saddest part is, a lot of what the soldier characters in the movie say is ultimately true. There is nothing abnormal about people killing people just for the sake of killing, for it is happenning all the time. In this case, they just speeded up the whole dying process a bit...<br/><br/>Also, the last 20-30 minutes of the movie is not Hollywood at all (although the actual endling is a bit cheesy): what you see is not Save-Two-Girls-You-Barely-Know-Hero-Wannabe Jim. It's more like I-Wanna-Save-My-Own-Butt Jim. Just think about it: the soldier who is to be executed with him tells him England's quarantinned and the rest of the world is doing just fine. Then, after he escapes, he sees the airliner in the sky. And THEN he goes back and tries to rescue the other people... You figure it out.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this movie is definitely worth seeing. In my personal opinion, it could've been a bit deeper (I'm a big fan of philosophical movies, and I have a certain prejudice towards thrillers). 9.5/10 . See this instead of T3 (which was a piece of junk)."

He meets up with a (very) few survivors and they make their way to what seems to be a small military stronghold where a cure is promised. <br/><br/>
The music is just awesome.  Very well used and completely adds to the pace of the film.  Well, the second half of the film anyway.  The first half is slow and there is a big difference between slow and boring which a lot of people don't seem to understand.  I had these idiots in the theater talking on their cell phones twenty minutes into the movie, but that's neither here nor there.  The point is, this movie seemed to take every good thing about the Living Dead movies and put them all into one very creepy film (thanks to the mini-digital video used for filming).

","This zombie film is a fun little thriller, and is one of the first zombie films in a long time not to play things for laughs. While hilarious films such as RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and BRAIN DEAD aka DEAD ALIVE certainly have their place, the trend of going for dark humor with the unstated belief that the genre was otherwise played out is aptly refuted by this no-nonsense film.<br/><br/>While tipping its hat to classic horror/post-Apocalyptic films such as DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS and THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL (not to mention the Romero trilogy), the film is also a distinguished benchmark in horror cinema as the first important post-9/11 fright fest. The film is amazingly prescient in that, although it was actually filmed during the summer prior to 9/11, it so accurately encompasses so many of the fears that traumatic event let loose.<br/><br/>It is impossible to look at the masses of photos of missing loved ones on the walls in abandoned London in this film and not be reminded of the same in the days following the World Trade Center disaster. The viral plague that is let loose on England in this film is horrifying in many other ways.<br/><br/>
Not only is the thought of any nation as an island susceptible to a virus capable of turning humans into mad, flesh-consuming beasts horrifying in and of itself, this film works on other levels. In that the world we currently live in is one of spooky nightly news telecasts of SARS and monkey pox and seemingly new endless contagions, it is impressive how far out ahead of the curve the production of this film was.<br/><br/>Also, the reconstruction of the zombie mythology whereby rather than being slow, lumbering living dead, these zombies actually move about like sprinters, sometimes merely being seen as a blur, is a radical departure from what we are used to and all the more horrifying for it.<br/><br/>
Finally, it is also incredibly heartening that Danny Boyle has recaptured his roots as viewed in SHALLOW GRAVE and hopefully forsaken crass blockbuster projects such as THE BEACH."
"david77","7","0","0","7 July 2003"," A fearful vision follows a weak premise
","With the weak premise of a virus that produces murderous rage in seconds behind, the movie ""28 Days Later"" proceeds to sufficiently apall and frighten its viewers. The premise-monkeys with a rage-producing virus in their blood, are turned loose by some misdirected animal lovers who are immediately attacked and bitten by the monkeys. Those who survive become within seconds ""the infecteds"" who will search for someone to kill-or failing to kill-will create another infected human.<br/><br/>We meet our hero, Cillian Murphy, as he awakens from an accident that had kept him-a bicycle courier-in a coma for 28 days. He finds himself in an apparently deserted London. The views of him alone in the city's vastness-surrounded by upended vehicles, garbage, and complete disorganization-are eerily threatening and photographed quite well.<br/><br/>
He soon finds plenty of dead people in a church and after saying ""Hello"" hesitantly is assaulted by a murderous priest, and some others. He is rescued by two uninfected humans who blow up the pursuers. The female rescuer, Naomi Harris, explains the situation to Murphy while not releasing her hold on a machete. This comes in handy shortly thereafter, when she must kill her partner after he is bitten by an infected human.<br/><br/>
Apparently the virus has spread all over Britain. There is no TV or radio, nor any government. Survival is paramount, and director Danny Boyle keeps the action moving briskly.<br/><br/>Shot in digital video, the film looks like nothing you've seen before-a greater sense of the immediate, perhaps. Murphy soon becomes a survivor like Harris, and with some others, they make their way to a possible military facility they've learned about on a recorded radio broadcast. It soon becomes a question of whether they have made a sensible move.<br/><br/>
While we know that viruses take time to make people sick, the times we live in now and the threat of bioterror make this film all the more watchable and interesting."

","This film is advertised as belonging to the horror genre. Very simply, it doesn't. The concept was exciting... a virus and murderous behavior. Indeed, the created atmosphere was splendid. The aura fits the story just well. The acting is pardonable. The sound effects... oh yes the sound... horrible. Not that it was favorable for the plot but that it was so unnatural and ""forced"". Boy, I've just discovered only now that the sound effects could also be dragging! The sudden booms designed to give accent to the suspense only served as my alarm clock in waking me up as I was almost sleeping and slipping away from the theatre. Yet there was still some interest left for me after the 2nd time I woke up from the sudden amplification of sound. And this was perhaps at the middle to the end of the film, not bad huh?<br/><br/>In summary, while I liked the concept, I didn't like this movie. It was weird. The movements of the ""monsters"" looked as if they were just played fast forward.

","Regardless of whether or not you consider this a zombie film or not, it should be said that this film is not mainly about the horror of zombies in London, but more about human reaction to widespread chaos.<br/><br/>In the argument on whether or not these people are zombies. There are multiple forms of zombies not only in folk lore and movie lore, but essentially the core definition of a zombie is a person who is under complete control, and will do a task mindlessly and non-stop under any means necessary. This definition covers the traditional movie favorite, a corpse come back to life to devour flesh, and the type of zombie in this film, people infected with a virus causing uncontrollable violent rage, and a lust for killing.<br/><br/>In a neat plot device, if someone in the movie is scratched, bitten, or exposed to the blood of the zombie, then he/she will become infected in ten to twenty seconds. It makes the need to ""kill or be killed"" all that more important. It also eliminates the tired scenario of people being able to hide their infection until the last minute. <br/><br/>As for the zombies themselves they run fast as the wind looking for people to kill, they are quick brutal and violent. In the film when a zombie attacks a human the camera pans around wildly, never really giving a true clear view of the event until the attack is over. Some may complain about this, but I felt it added a level of brutality to the zombies. Besides, it's a lot scarier to HEAR a zombie kill someone, rather than see it, because it lets our imagination make it as gruesome as we want to be.<br/><br/>The film has many creepy elements, especially the sequence at the beginning when the main character is walking through the abandoned street of London, where nothing is left but himself and chaotic remains of a tragedy that has already past, and he is completely clueless of. This accentuated by the camera, I don't know much about film cameras, but this is of lesser quality, giving the shots a grainy, rough look to them. This gives the eerie ""documentary"" like effect to it, and it gives a sense of devastation, like this was the only camera they could find in the rubble of a destroyed civilization.<br/><br/>Of course eventually he meets other people, who with them goes in search of more people, and that is where the real meat of the film is. It's main focus is on the interaction, thoughts and relationships of these survivors, and to what level they will go to ensure their survival, which is at times more disturbing than any zombie they could come across.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is an engrossing horror/sci-fi drama that focuses on humanity in a post-apocalyptic nightmare, and decides to make it interesting by throwing some zombies into the mix.

","As a fan of the horror genre I walked into the movie believing it would be the typical 'horror flick' that abounds these days: very little plot, extensive gore and not much character development.  Boy was I wrong. Almost every aspect of the movie was amazing.  The visuals were definatly on the high side.  Danny Boyle achieved a quiet subtley that grabbed a hold of you and didn't really let go.  The plot was definatly something new and fresh. The acting was good, for the most part.  A few characters(when I say 'a few' I mean one) had a kind of mechanical acting.  As the movie progressed though, the character seemed to loosen up and start to act. When I speak of acting I also have to mention the character development that took place throught the film. The evolution of the characters was simplisic, in a good way, and very smooth.  The transition from one exteme of living to another seemed to have happened so fast the characters were forced into a new life. As for the horror aspect; it was nice.  The surprise effect many movies go for, and miss horribly, was right on target in this movie.  I highly recomend this movie.  (This is my first time to ever give a movie comment/critisism, so I hope I did it right.)"
"kyrat","6","0","0","8 July 2003"," good, but derivative (mild spoiler - discussion of the plot's roots in BBC tv series)
","I got the feeling that Danny Boyle watched the following British post-apocalyptic style series and then tried to make them more scary by adding in a more gory/graphic threat.<br/><br/>In 1975 the BBC made an excellent series called ""Survivors"" which is very similar to the film except that the virus killed everyone instead of turning them into zombie-like creatures.  It was a little more psychological than horror, but similar themes exploring survival and what it all means to maintain one's humanity and how to rebuild emerged each episode.  In fact, one episode featured a military style dictatorship set up that expected to use female survivors as breeding stock.  If you liked the exploration of Survival and the fight to maintain humanity (both physically and mentally) behind 28 Days Later, you should check out this series (some PBS stations play it occasionally).<br/><br/>In 1981 there was also ""Day of the Triffids"" (from the 1962 film) which also featured a deserted London and the banding together of survivors to keep safe from the attacking plants.  It's not as good, but still interesting."

","I watch a lot of movies, so I feel I can freely comment on this flick. For starters, I also have a college education and have written several stories and a couple of screenplays myself.  Am I still going to be labeled by the lap sludge from the web?  Most likely.  It seems the web is a great place to freely abuse someone without any risk involved, like getting your face smashed in with a ball bat, or having the oppressor gouge his thumbs into your eye sockets and push until you are dead, like Jim does in 28 Days Later...<br/><br/>Forget what you think this movie is.  It is NOT a Zombie flick, it is definatley not a chick flick, and it's not for the weak minded, or, weak stomached at times.  Danny Boyle likes his dead babies still and a few scenes look exotically realistic, like the bodies in the bed (to not spoil anyone's fun).  I was stunned and shocked by this movie and it's creepy lonliness and eerieness.  It's not a ""jump at you"" screamer, but it is a haunter, and after twenty-four hours from when the credits rolled, I'm still thinking of it.<br/><br/>It was brilliantly filmed.  I liked the grainy fast movers for the Rage victims and the openess of the land and city around the lonely protagonist. The dialogue was non-existent, leaving the scenery and actors to move the story at is slow pace.  I like things like that.  There is this thing that most screenwriters, or even screenwriter wanna be's should avoid.  It's a thing called exposition.  That is, explaining the story.  It's dull, unexciting, amateurish, and boring!  This movie had very little and you felt what the main character was feeling and you thought.  You actually sat there, forgot about the popcorn for a moment, and thought.  ""My God!""  I doubt Resident Evil, which cured my insomina, or the Hulk made you think. And I doubt Dawn, Day, Night, whatever of the Living Dead made you feel for the main characters or think about their predicament.<br/><br/>I still feel it.  And I was HAPPY at the end!  I actually FELT for the characters and I felt anger towards others.  I could care less about the people affected by Rage, except, how cool they looked.<br/><br/>5 of 5 for me.<br/><br/>(All views expressed in this post are MY opinions, and I speak them freely)."

The cinematography is outstanding and the washed out, grainy, 8mm-style of filming is perfect for a zombie movie. In fact it reminds me of some of the classics. This film takes a dangerous tack by mixing genres (apocalypse/road trip/zombie) but it all seems to work here. The film is as scary as anything since The Blair Witch Project and will become a cult classic in no time flat. I won't spoil it but the last part of the film asks a few questions about human rage and where it comes from by showing that anyone can succumb to it if pushed far enough. 28 Days Later is a great film for zombie movie fans and it even pays homage to the great George Romero a few times but this is no copycat film. It is original and fresh and I liked it very much."

","** This commentary is full of SPOILERS **<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" was unbelievably great movie for the first hour or so. The only weak hole I personally saw, was the lack of explanation to why ""Jim & Selena"", instead of having only baseball bats and half-machetes, could not simply walk into the first police station and arm themselves to their ""teeth""?  Having said that, the scary premise, the tactics, the acting, the plot, the end-of-the-world feeling was pretty frightening and thrilling in that first  3 1/4 of the movie. BUT, then the filmmakers yielded away from those great ""winning"" ways which were evident in the first hour or so,  just to engage us with this dumb sub-plot of ""Jim the hero"" trying to rescue the two women he barely knows, from their uncomfortable, but surely logical  ""breeding machines"" - destiny.<br/><br/>Now, why in the hell would ""Jim"" ever do that? I mean, how logical is that in the face of sheer terror, man-versus-man type of mentality, and against the overwhelming odds - ""Jim"" is turning against the soldiers who happened to be the only source of protection these three have, just to engage in ""Ramboisation"" and save the women from their own protectors - even more especially when is known to us that ""Selena"" would have no sentiments of killing ""Jim"" if the need arised.<br/><br/>And also, why did soldiers have that ""infected"" alive in their garden to begin with? One would think that they would do anything to destroy the infected a.s.a.p., and not risk their own well being by having an ""infected"" full of powerful rage chained in their midst? (by the way, how did they succeeded in chaining the ""infected""??) And finally, THE ENDING. For chris' sake, that was lame. Why do they always have to have stupid, ""happy"" ending is unbeknown to me? It's a FICTION movie for god's sake, so make it end in the most powerful way you can. I mean you're making a horror drama full of doomed feeling, and than you end it with ""happy, happy"". It's like p***ing all over your work thus far. I mean, at least make a compromise if you have to - maybe by hinting that everyone in England will die, but then show a commercial plane flying sky high overhead. That type of ending could have been the most powerful, gloomy, but ultimately optimistic as it would signal that the life goes on in the rest of the world.<br/><br/>If this move had an ending that was similar to disturbing beginning, it could have been the most profound horror movie of all times. This way, and due only to ""Ramboisation"" of  the main character, as well as to ""Hollywood ending"" in non- Hollywood movie, it still remains superb - but not THE ULTIMATE - it could have been!<br/><br/>So close.<br/><br/>Pity the fools."

Under the rage they most likely felt little to no pain, like they were on drugs, or extremely adrenaline rushes. They were very much alive, and when they are killed they stay dead, you didn't see any of them crawling around with half of its torso gone, now did you?

"diviner","Null","0","0","8 July 2003"," Trainspotting is just a one-hit wonder
","I went into the theatre, convinced that ""28 Days"" would offered something different and provocative.  Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>First, the camera work was, like, done my someone who just came out of film school, trying to cram as many tricks and angles as possible.  Once in a blue moon, they seemed somewhat intriguing, but most of the time, it just looked plain awkward if not annoying.<br/><br/>The acting, I think they did the best they could.  The interaction between all the characters consist of strategically placed one-liners.  The producers might as well make them all non-speaking parts so that they can save a bundle.<br/><br/>Like the Impostor (2001), the 28 Days Later could have been easily boiled down to the first and last 20 minutes.  Unlike the Impostor, however, the omitable portion doesn't advance plot or character development.  One just sees people going from one (easily preventable) situation to another.<br/><br/>There are just so many things I either don't get, or they just simply don't make any sense at all.  For instance, without giving away too much movie, how does one survive a gun-shot wound in the stomach with little medical attention?  And what is with all those in-your-face product placements. ""All I have is Pep$!, and Sunny-D.  What do you prefer"".  C'mon, this is just rediculous.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  Danny Boyle must be very bitter, and desparate for a comeback. It's good that he has still some friends in the right places.  Otherwise, I have no idea how this even gets on screen and receive good reviews.  He has to realise that Trainspotting was just an one-hit wonder and move on."

","As a fan of Romero's dead films, I always look for new incarnations of the zombie horror genre.  Here, in ""28 Days Later,"" is a really fresh look at it.<br/><br/>More than a movie about zombies, this movie is a post-apocalyptic vision. The characters are compelling.  The script is harrowing.  The special effects are chilling.  The cinematography is disorienting.<br/><br/>But the zombies themselves are quite horrifying in themselves.  Not the usual stumblebum walking corpses.  In fact, they seem to possess rather agile movement and almost super speed.<br/><br/>Also an updated concept is the idea that these so-called zombies are not really walking dead, but enraged, cannibilistic, living people, who are ""infected"" with a virus, aptly named ""rage.""  In these days of chemical and bio-weapon fear, this seems all-too-plausible.<br/><br/>For those seeking a secret message, an allegory perhaps...  I imagine there are metaphors tucked away in this film.  I will leave that for others to comment upon.

","No, that's really a story my friends told me. And then my friend brought me out to see this movie over seeing T3. Was I glad I did so? You bet I was.<br/><br/>28 Days Later has nothing to do with Resident Evil. In fact, the comparisons are obvious but 28 Days Later was made for a better reason, 28 Days Later is like a collection of all of the Zombie films you've ever seen made in a fresh and interesting way.<br/><br/>Unlike Resident Evil, the powering force of Danny Boyle who brought us Trainspotting is behind this one. Oddly enough, people compare this film to Resident Evil endlessly but the film starts out where 12 Monkeys would leave it off. I find it funny that no one has made that comparison.<br/><br/>
So, essentially what 28 Days Later is, is what Resident Evil 2 will be, but in London. People who dislike this movie will really SHlT a brick when RE2 comes out and it's.... uht oh... semi-based off a video game where the city is dead! OH NO! But these are just people who tend to complain, don't let them throw you off.<br/><br/>Making a horror movie is very hard but this movie pushes all the right buttons and even the buttons Resident Evil didn't get to push. You see Resident Evil was made to appease to video game fans as well as fans of horror films. This movie was made to appease fans of cinema as well as the horror sub genre of Zombie Film (even though it's also a Sci-Fi sub genre, but we won't get into that.)<br/><br/>The camera in this film captures moments in time and makes the sure moments of horror beautiful. Everything I wanted to happen... happened. The music fits perfectly with the film, the film converys lights in a beautiful way and all the while the city being empty seems horrifying even if we're not british. It all fits together at the right moment.<br/><br/>Of course all the while you have to keep in mind our civilization is not too far away from 28 Days Later. I mean, how impossible is it for one of the American Testing labs in Boston on the MIT campus to accidentally release an animal onto Boston and cause a widespread disease that would have to be quarantined from the rest of the America, and the world? Surely not far off. Anything's possible.<br/><br/>This movie truly blew me away. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a while and it was worth every second of my wait and more. I feel in a way it was a foreign film because Danny Boyle shot it in British fashion which made every second of it even more beautiful.<br/><br/>I truly believe anyone who disliked this movie is a person who feels the need to be negative as a critic or simply does not have interest in cinema as an art. 28 Days later is truly a beautiful movie, it is Art-Cinema in an apocalyptic way. Resident Evil is a great American action film and 28 Days Later is an amazing and beautiful art-cinema film from Danny Boyle, our favorite British director. Both are in the same genre, and both are very good films for their genre.<br/><br/>I like how they connect and I think Danny did it purposely. To dislike this film is to have no taste in cinema. I'm sure the same people who hate 28 Days Later also hate Run Lola Run and would somehow find a way to hate Battle Royale and every other amazing foreign film. See this film, don't listen to your stoner friends who disliked it. But even that may be a misstatement, because I'm not even sure how a stoner could dislike this movie. It is truthfully beyond me how anyone can dislike this amazing piece of cinema."

As I watched the movie I felt disappointed at times and satisfied at others.<br/><br/>Perhaps I shouldn't really call this a zombie movie.  The creatures are humans, very much alive, but infected by a virus.  There is none of the relentless, pressing sense of doom that Romero's shuffling, never-tiring zombies gave us.  But, there are frenetic bursts of adrenaline.  These creatures move *fast* when they attack.<br/><br/>The camera work with the creatures was good.  Most sightings are in the periphery.  Blurred shadows and fast-motion effect captures.  Since the attacks tended to punctuate long periods of quiet movie, they were pretty jarring.<br/><br/>The movie was uneven at the end.  I didn't like the military group turning out to be so evil.  Not that military groups can't be evil, but I felt that the movie needed to focus on *one* enemy.  Switching gears like that near the end diffused the focus.<br/><br/>I did, however, like the revelation (?) about exactly how widespread the contagion was.

As for being scary, this movie maybe had two scary moments, and any other instances just startle the audience because of loud noises and spurts of blood.

","""28 Days Later. . ."" is a gritty, contemporary re-interpretation of the nexus of the genres of intellectual-post-apocalypse humans-messing-with-nature sci fi (like ""Omega Man"" and ""On the Beach"") and bloody zombie horror (including pod people), as well as virus threats (like ""Andromeda Strain"") that are no longer idle speculation.<br/><br/>""Vanilla Sky"" tried to capture a similar mise en scene with the opening dream scene in a deserted Times Square, but that was about the star from those opening shots.  Director Danny Boyle uses skinny accidental hero Cillian Murphy amidst scans of the freakishly deserted London (there's a thanks in the credits to all the officers who held back the city traffic), while John Murphy's music plays up the fear, confusion, and the unknown.<br/><br/>
Alex Garland's script is particularly insightful about human reactions, feelings, and relationships amidst disaster, especially how tropic we are towards hope and connection, such that the grim line ""Women are about the future"" put a chill down my spine. The actions and appearances of the trustworthy and the untrustworthy can seem identical visually without context, making judgments instantaneously necessary and risky (for us and the characters)--is that a passionate kiss or an attacking bite?<br/><br/>
We really care about the individuals unpredictably meeting their fates, as we're given just enough background to make them believable and real, as it comes full circle on the issue of being humane.  Though there's no big-name stars, I recognized the excellent actors from Brit TV mini-series (and did have a little problem with the accents and slang now and then).<br/><br/>
The ending, that feels like its in color in contrast to rest that seems to be more in shades of black-and-white and bloody red, does seem a bit tacked on, though a key clue is introduced just before the climax.<br/><br/>
The digital video was occasionally blurry in the print I saw; I don't know if that was intentional or if the DVD will look better, but it's a very visually communicative film."

As a fan of good horror, I suppose I should be glad someone actually tried to achieve a truly disturbing atmosphere outside of the typical 'make-them-jump' fest that permeates most of the poor efforts that make it into theaters. This was an ambitious attempt, but in the end it felt like the sometimes capable Danny Boyle and his crew put too much into the look and too little into the story.<br/><br/>There are a lot of aspects of this movie worthy of credit. The digital stuff really set off the opening shots in the empty London streets as well as the distant fires of Manchester. The rapid-fire, jerky movements of the infected - at least in the few instances they stuck to this sort of movement (in most of the encounters, the infected just broke into normal runs) - did seem to give the plot some seperation from the Romero zombie films it borrowed liberally from. However, at times...this approach became almost indulgent, going through multi-cut off angle scenes where it really enhanced nothing. (An awkward over the shoulder in an early dialogue scene comes to mind) The intent seemed to want to disorient, but more truly just distracted. My biggest problem was with the plot. The early half of the movie focused on the brutality of this new world, and the unmerciful role basic survival had placed on the group...however, when encountering the soldiers, this was scrapped for the standard chivalrous moral crusade which ended in chaos and could have very well taken the very lives our 'hero' was striving to save. The ending was also extremely disappointing...taking the easy way out of what might have actually been an interesting bit of the story, as the group was now once again free of protection and surrounded by terrain that a character had referred to earlier in the film as ""teeming with infected"".<br/><br/>
One of the attractive points of the most classic horror is its greater distance from the formulas of popular cinema. This movie tries very hard to create the impression that this is true in its case as well, however it's all look and little substance. In the end, the entire effort is only slightly less than typical."

","There are no perfect movies, even classics have their errors, and there will always be some who love and others who hate, with the majority in between. This movie focuses more on the human aspect, rather than political or scientific aspects would could have taken precedence easily.<br/><br/>
True the filming was at times grainy, in my opinion it added much to the overall quality of the film. It showed not a clear scene but caused you to generally focus on the center of the screen. You never were sure what would happen next, okay well sometimes you wouldn't of course like any movie it does follow some basic structure standards.<br/><br/>The flashes, that people complained added an MTV like quality created an ominous feeling, and though there was little gore cause the major suspense of the movie. You didn't know exactly was going on with the ""infected"" but your imagination created it.<br/><br/>There are many unanswered questions, such as why was there such little security to begin with in this medical facility, or why were there no survivors from Manchester or surrounding areas, what exactly did the disease do the body, How was Jim able to change so much on a physical plane, and was the spitting blood aspect a dissolving of the body or a weapon?<br/><br/>
People mentioned that the infected didn't eat one another, I think that is explained in that species tend not to eat their own unless damaged, we only saw healthy infected, or undamaged ones. Since it does delve in psychological, societal, and global issues, I think we are prone to analyze it more. We are scared of global contagions, of possible infections, of what they can and will do to us. I think this does address some of those concerns, though the time was condensed. Many of the psychological traumas would usually take more time to occur, but on further reflection, after the effects of the contagion, there was enough stress to create such an environment. Again far from perfect, but you enjoy the movie for what it makes you think about, for when it makes you jump, to the issues  that are shown, and emotions involved(particularly the letter from Jim's parents)."

"mw_director","6","0","0","8 July 2003"," Pretty good, but not great, horror opus
","My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Though it's a return to form for Danny Boyle after such post-Trainspotting disasters as A Life Less Ordinary and The Beach, 28 Days Later could have risen to a higher potential. The opening scenes of a deserted London are tremendously effective, but some other scenes lose their full horror value because Boyle rushes through them, such as a scene involving a hurried tire-change before the onrushing hordes of the ""infected"" arrive. It flies by so fast we never get that ""Oh Dear God hurry up!"" sense of panic a horror film ought to build in the viewer.<br/><br/>Basically, what you have here is the same premise as The Omega Man or, amusingly, Demons. People are infected with ""rage,"" which causes them to become mindless murdering beasts with fierce red eyes. It's stylishly shot, but the script unfortunately glosses over characterization: we barely know our hero, Jim, or his traveling companions Selena and Hannah. So our ability to fully feel what they have lost is muted.<br/><br/>The gore quotient is pretty good, though again the most violent scenes are shot in super-shaky-cam mode which makes things a bit too frantic to be effective. Boyle also knows when to use silence to generate suspense.<br/><br/>But near the end (I'll refrain from spoilers), the script becomes a bit too reminiscent of--of all things--Day of the Dead (the weakest of Romero's trilogy), when our heroes hole up with some military types who are a bit too macho for comfort.<br/><br/>Also, in an odd technical choice, most of the movie appears to have been shot on digital video--but not 24P High-Def, merely plain ol' DV or DigiBeta, then transferred to 35MM. The image is cruddy looking on the big screen (though it might look fine on DVD), and whether this is an artistic choice or a budgetary one is unclear. Oddly, the very last scene is crystal clear and seems to have been shot on 35. Go figure.<br/><br/>In all, it has its good points, but isn't the horror masterwork advance hype would have you believe. For really excellent British horror, check out Dog Soldiers instead."
"hoversj","8","0","0","7 July 2003"," So many opinions? Must be something here!
","It's very interesting to see the huge range of comments people have written for this - hating it for not being ""scary"" enough, loving it for being thought-provoking, etc. I can't help but wonder what the ""not scary enough"" people were expecting? I have to speculate that they are all male, since events in the latter part of the film are certainly scary enough (in a ""real-life"" way, rather than a ""eaten by zombies"" way) to creep any female. <br/><br/>The premise has already been described to death, but I have to wonder - in the reviews I read (not all 400+), no one has mentioned ""The Day of the Triffids"" as a possible source of inspiration for this film (not the movie, the book). After all, it's both British and post-apocalyptic, and addresses (in more detail - after all, it's a book) many of the same social questions that this movie touches on. <br/><br/>OK, so there are directly-correlating scenes between this and Dawn of the Dead (shopping), Day of the Dead (intra-group strife, and captured zombies), and a variety of other movies. It's still really well done and has the oddly-scary ""grainy-o-vision"" appearance of movies like ""Make them Die Slowly/Cannibal Ferox"" which was made in the 70s and looked like a honest-to-goodness snuff film. (I actually went to the theatre staff and asked if there was a problem with the focus...)<br/><br/>Don't watch this looking for a slick zombie-fest like Resident Evil. I loved RE, but it was action-based, and this movie isn't - it's very much rooted in character, drama, and despair.<br/><br/>What's not scary about being one of the last people left alive in a world inhabited by infected creatures who only come out at night and want to kill anything that moves?"

","Spoilers. I must give the British credit, for they know how to stretch a budget to its limits. My wife noticed the mansion they used was from the movie 'a bridge too far'.  Anyway she hated this film, found it boring and would give it a 3.  Myself, I found this movie entertaining.  Forget about the science fiction premise, this movie is about the human condition and the effects of stress on it.  My father says do gooders usually have the best intentions, but think with emotion instead of logic.  This is the premise of what causes the end of civilized England, the story at the end gives clues that the island nation contained the virus, and stopped it.  I love the thinking in this film especially the cute comment about eradiated food.  Working at the post office I see daily how stress, desperation, and stupidity play on the human condition.  The part where the survivors find the soldiers (not special forces but normal people) and what stress would do is accurate.  Bad situations test peoples' character and brings the worst out.  I believe the major had good intentions to begin with, trying to bring women in for his men, but creates a solution more terrible than the problem.  Not enough women and TOO MANY MEN.  I believe if the hero was not there to fight with them, then the soldiers would of started fighting with each other.  Bars try to keep the ratio even, the Antarctic station banned women for fear of love triangles, and when it was lifted they had a murder love triangle afterwards.  This film exploits this premise believably.  People fighting over the leftovers.  In the end, the film shows the virus only takes out our darker emotions of the infected when situations bring us into a rage.  I give it 7 out of 10."

The film reinvents the whole genre of Zombie Horror flicks with it's new approach and inventive plot and outstanding artful directing by Danny Boyle.   By looking at trailers it looks like your typical slasher movie, but the whole idea of an epidemic that kills almost everybody in 28 days makes for a great film. It incorporates the scary aspects but also makes you think and wonder and watch more and more.

"se7en45","10","0","0","5 July 2003"," A stunning achievement that bites both heart & mind...
","28 DAYS LATER utilizes a brilliant story of apocalyptic proportions but reduces the premise down to a few incidents. By staging such a concept, Danny Boyle and his excellent crew, have created a superior thriller that juxtaposes genres as diverse as Science Fiction, Romance, Comedy, Tragedy, Horror, Action, etc. All these diverse ingredients are thrown into this melting pot and the end product will leave the connoisseur satisfied and sated on a visual feast for the eyes, an audio delight for the ears and a disturbing residue for the imagination.<br/><br/>
The plot may have been seen in films such as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE OMEGA MAN, DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH etc, but Alex Garland, who I derided for his work on THE BEACH, has crafted a stark work which is blinding in it's clarity. Thankfully, after the Hollywood disaster that produced THE BEACH, this team of British artists have stayed true to their vision and integrity in bringing their daring project to the screen without the silly interference from executives.<br/><br/>
Also, it's lovely to see great actors at work, these people carry no baggage from previous roles, their performances are filled with a raw intensity and leave a mark of indelible realism in each scene. All of the bad habits of typical Hollywood acting have been stripped away, there's no surplus fat on display here, no melodramatic outbursts, no cheesy one-liners (the bane of all the recent teenage slasher films), there's even a complete absence of an over-ripe budget to inflate egos and bring out the worst aspects of Stars becoming more important than the material.<br/><br/>
This lovely little gem is an example of great film-making. All areas of production have been carefully analyzed and full justice has been done to the subject matter. From the opening, inside a dark laboratory, to the ending in an open field, everything comes together to create a picture with the perfect balance.<br/><br/>
This film is extremely shocking and powerful, there's no glory in the violence, no release at all. Just sudden, and dirty, these brutal deaths appal and unnerve the viewer. Characters are lovingly, and realistically drawn and then suddenly dispatched in such sadistic pain that it will haunt the most hardened and jaded horror fan. The atmosphere reeks of unseen menace and danger, wide open spaces with sunlight suddenly become creepy and desolate. We see more horror in a silent, mysterious, eerie street than the whole of POLTERGEIST (filled with noise and special effects). I literally leapt out of my seat when the silent sound-stage explodes with the bleeping sound of a car alarm!<br/><br/>
The choice of using Digital Video was inspired because it allowed the film-makers to shoot the film like a pseudo-documentary, fast moving and energetic. Just watch as Hollywood floods the market with cheap imitations in the near future. The fluid camera movements, rapid editing, parched colour scheme all heighten the levels of atmosphere. You just know a film has the hallmarks of a classic when you begin to sense fear in an open, and brightly lit, space. Danger clouds every scene. There's a hazy graininess which evaporates all warm colours, this leaves behind a sense of loneliness and alienation in the mind.<br/><br/>
The film is packed to the hilt with visual metaphors which enrich our understanding of what is being revealed, step by step, layer by layer. The opening scene of a chimpanzee tied down and drugged is contrasted with the naked human, in the following scene, who's also laid out in a hospital bed and is slowly coming out of his zombified state. Like a newborn babe, fresh from the womb, he stumbles around in confusion until he finds his mother's milk, which in this case, has been ripped out of the stomach of a soft drinks machine. He guzzles down the fizzy, sugary drink with relish, his body arching backwards as his throat greedily slurps up the liquid. And, just like a child, he burps loudly and with pleasure. Now that he has tasted the forbidden fruit, Knowledge slowly starts to ignite his fuzzy memory. Outside, after he has absorbed the shock of a desolate wasteland devoid of any humans, he finds money on the pavement, he starts to grabs as much as he can until it dawns on him that there's more important things to do. Interestingly, it's at the house of God, a church, where like a resurrected Christ figure (just check out his visual appearance, beaming innocence like a child, the beard on his face, etc), his first experience with a zombie is a priest. Ironic and powerful. His rejection from the house of sanctuary is unsettling for the viewer, it seems to be saying that if there's no safety in the house of God, then where can one find peace?<br/><br/>
We later discover that all established areas of life have been disrupted and left destroyed by the mechanisms that Humans have put in place. The Army, representing the State, is nothing more than another tribal group with their own hidden agendas. They are as much prisoners in their fortified mansions as are the raging zombies in the vast open places. No one is safe, not even the rats in the sewers, the cycle of life has been ruined and the spiral downwards into degeneracy has begun.<br/><br/>
The film rips away conventions, thus, the zombies are not represented as slow and ponderous, instead, their rage and speed are very potent. They really do have bite! However, these creatures are not demonised, their actions and condition reveal that they could possibly deserve our pity. Compare their brutality with what the humans get up to. The assault on the two defenceless girls by the soldiers is horrific and very unsettling. It was great to see that the strongest character in the film was a woman and Black, what a break with convention that is! And our hero is an Irishman whilst the twisted Army commander is played by an Englishman. A punch in the face of stereotypes!<br/><br/>
Some people have spoken about how they dislike the climax of this film. I just have to say that after the traumatic ordeal that the characters have waded through, and also the depths of darkness and evil that they had to overcome, I think it fitting that there was a glimmer of optimism and hope. And even with that final image, what concrete proof is there that all will be well? The message displayed on the green field reads ""HELLO"", yes Hell is Low, right beneath them, like a grave beneath the grass they're standing on. The jet flying overhead, once again represents the forces of the State. And what happened the last time our protagonists got tangled with the Army? They became guinea pigs to kick start the human race. So, even with that ending, I'm not too certain that everything's all hunky-dory for them. Just take note, there's no shot of the inside of the jet to reassure the audience that the pilot will radio in help for the survivors. There's no close-up of a human face in the plane's interior, just a nameless speck that booms across the valley like a spy. Very unsettling indeed.<br/><br/>
The music was simply awesome in what it managed to do. Just listen to the soundtrack as the horses speed away across the fields, or the song that was played over the end credits. Haunting, emotive, sad, melancholic and perfect as the bookend.<br/><br/>
This film is undauntedly a classic. A complete masterpiece in all departments. From the scorching acting, the harrowing script with realistically drawn characters, the disturbing atmosphere, the effective soundtrack, the hawk like direction, the brilliant production design, all these factors were beautifully merged in a symphony of psychological terror.<br/><br/>
It's a pity that some misguided people are comparing this film to THE EXORCIST or other films in the ZOMBIE genre. That's sad because I personally feel that, despite the nods to other films, 28 DAYS LATER is a work of fresh originality that does not care for comparisons. It stands proud and high on its own merits.<br/><br/>
A magnificent achievement, both for the heart and the mind, a tragic piece that will remain with you long after the film has finished. Quite simply, one of the best films that I've seen this year."

But we quickly learn that the animals are infected with a rage virus (how they could even say that line without laughing is beyond me) that makes them stark raving mad.  We then cut to 28 Days Later (oh, I get it now) where we see a bicycle messenger named Jim waking up from a 4 week coma.  Why he was butt naked I have no idea.  Perhaps his doctor was Larry Drake.  He then realizes he is the only man left in London, and he walks around shouting ""Hellooooo"" for quite some time.  I must admit I enjoyed these early scenes, they were mysteriously creepy.  That is, until Jim stumbles upon a church full of zombies, who must have been searching for salvation.  He is then rescued by some rough and tough zombie killers who update him on the last 4 weeks.<br/><br/>Then after about 45 minutes, I realized something horrible.  The monkeys were not coming back.  I waited and waited, but yep-- they were gone for good.  I hadn't been this disappointed since that movie 12 Monkeys deceived the world by not having ONE monkey!<br/><br/>The other problem I had with 28 Days Later was the fact that you can't see anything.  The movie looks like it was shot on a freakin' View Master, therefore even the daytime shots look dark.  Zombies come and go, but the action is so dark and frantic, you can't see anything!  Another thing that defies logic: There is a charcter named Selina who is tough as nails in the beginning of the movie, but in one day softens up so much, she lets any military man have his way with her.  She doesn't even TRY to fight anymore! Michelle Rodriguez would never have stood for that.  Jim then snaps ""Lord of the Flies style"" and becomes a one man killing machine.  Not only does he kill zombies, but he kills highly skilled and trained military personnel including a Major.  At least I think he was a Major.  Oh, who cares, he was weak anyway.  The movie also tempts us with nudity, but it never arrives. Oh wait, I take that back.  We do get to see a nude zombie for all the necropheliacs in the audience.  Oh yeah...one last thing that makes this movie so bad.  It sucks!  They should change the title to $18 Dollars Later. That's right.

Anyone who dismisses the movie because it isn't a zombie film (which it isn't, technically) or because it's too slow clearly doesn't enjoy being thrilled.<br/><br/>Unlike so many modern Hollywood (read: Dimension Films) scary movies, 28 Days Later does not use a thrashing metal soundtrack, lots of gore, or any over-the-top monsters to scare you. The beauty of this movie (like any classic) is that it allows you to scare yourself. The director seems to understands that it's the sense of fear and hopelessness and uncertainty that creates tension, and this tension allows viewers to become more engaged with the film.<br/><br/>The use of sound in the movie is incredible, and the timing is wonderful.

In the four weeks that Jim has been sleeping, the disease has ended civilization.  Jim wanders through empty London, echoing the famous `Hello?!' scene in Day of the Dead.  _28 Days Later_ is post-apocalyptic, post-AIDS, and post-Romero.<br/><br/>The script is economical, intelligent; the acting is solid.  The characters aren't the hollow wannabe action heroes of _Resident Evil_; heroine Selena (Naomie Harris) is  simultaneously a tough-as-nails survivor and a real woman, haunted by real grief.  Jim is no less convincing.  The characters are all solid creations, affected in different ways by loss and trauma.<br/><br/>
Boyle is able to convey desperation in the details: when Jim and Selena find refuge in the barricaded apartment of father and daughter Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and Hannah (Megan Burns), we glimpse an aquarium where goldfish swim in a scanty few inches of water.  The situation is there, literally and figuratively.  Our four survivors are literally running out of water, but the sight of the fish swimming clumsily right under a receding waterline suggests more than a water shortage.  Later, when our heroes meet up with a group of soldiers who've made a fortress against the infected, the group tries to celebrate with a feast.  The mood turns sour when the commanding officer (Christopher Eccleston)spits out the first bite of an omelet - the eggs have gone bad.  The characters' reactions reveal the soldiers' group dynamic, and the hollowness of celebration when all you have to celebrate is not being dead.  The omelet is also the first tangible hint that not all is well with the boys in uniform.<br/><br/>Intentionally or not, this zombie picture shows its post-AIDS origins. The zombies are `infected,' and the condition is always dealt with in terms of disease.  Fights with the monsters are followed by desperate body checks: `Were you bitten?' The piled dead seen throughout the film look more like the victims of plague than of massacres.<br/><br/>The movie is refreshingly free of obvious CGI effects.  The monsters look real, because they are, created by actors and good makeup.  _28 Days Later_ has its share of horror clichés (most particularly, heroes seem eager to take unnecessary risks, but would it really be fun to see them take the safer route out of the city?), but it manages to avoid pitfalls.  This movie fan is particularly sick of that ultimate third-act cop-out: `If you need to up the tension for the finale, just make the monster bigger.'  _Aliens_ worked, but that's because a showdown between two hell-raising matriarchs has resonance.  _Resident Evil_, a recent zombie flick for kids, subjected audiences to a bogus third-act CGI monster that had little to do with zombies and even less to do with good storytelling.  The third act of _28 Days Later_ works, in part because by this point we care about the characters, and in part because (as with the best horror movies) the real horror is powered by human players, not supernatural ones.<br/><br/>
Danny Boyle may claim to dislike horror movies, but _28 Days Later_ borrows extensively - and effectively - from the hallowed canon of zombie cinema. The subgenre has always been a delightful mix of brilliance and kitsch, but Boyle tries (sometimes too hard) to avoid the latter.  If bearing good cinematic progeny is the only real path to canonical status, George Romero's stature should be enhanced by _28 Days Later_.  Jim wanderings through the empty city evoke _Day of the Dead_.  A gleeful supermarket visit parallels the mall-plundering in _Dawn of the Dead_.  The structure is fundamentally similar to _Dawn of the Dead_: the middle part of the movie is relatively peaceful, with four characters creating their own makeshift family amidst the ruins of the world.  As in _Dawn of the Dead_, that peace is disrupted, but not by monsters.<br/><br/>Zombies are the empty vessels of horror.  They don't have pre-set personalities and built-in themes, like sultry, oversexed vampires or snarling, beast-within-man werewolves.  They depend on their filmmakers for purpose, and they can express an incredibly wide variety of themes.  Maybe that's why zombies have had greatest success outside the Hollywood mainstream: Romero didn't answer to Hollywood execs, and Sam Raimi made the first two _Evil Dead_ movies for cheap long before _Spider-Man_.  Even within the same trilogy, Romero uses zombies in different ways, focusing on different themes in each film.  Compared to these films, or to _28 Days Later_, a standard-issue Hollywood horror hackfest can look pretty soulless. Hopefully, the next Hollywood stab at the subgenre will look more like _28 Days Later_ than _Resident Evil_.<br/><br/>_28 Days Later_ isn't perfect.  A few of the best scare scenes are set up in contrived ways.  Jim's endgame strategy seems poorly considered.  Boyle avoids the kitsch of the subgenre, but contrivance is arguably a worse sin. His style is often too MTV for my taste; some fights with the infected subscribe to the `shock and confuse' school of editing.  Boyle's greatest weakness is that he tends to machine-gun themes at you.  His theme explicating is often labeled as pretentious; I'd guess that it's not pretentiousness that motivates these didactic bits, but worry that the audience won't know how to feel about the film without them.  He should trust his audience more.<br/><br/>The flaws of _28 Days Later_ are clear, but they don't negate the accomplishment.  Atmosphere, character, and storytelling get the attention they deserve.  The end results make for great horror, and will stay in this viewer's dreams for a while yet."

","I think the key to this movie is to avoid the relentless publicity, previews and all the interviews. It's more effective if you sort of just ride with it from moment to moment. The DV camera work is initially offputting and sometimes a little forced but if saving $$ (sorry, don't have a sign for pounds) by shooting on DV allowed those awesome initial shots of empty London it was money well saved.<br/><br/> The setting of England helped the horror because not everybody's got a gat under the bed, so if it's you and your baseball bat (instead of you and your NRA-issued submachine gun) against five screaming freaks that raises the stakes for you somewhat. Lack of CGI infestation means that the visuals are more personal than they would be with Digital Domain's painted-in armies of the dead. I think horror, especially this kind, is better that way. Some half-turns and questionable moves from the characters, esp. Jim (let me see, I'll throw down this Bullpup battle rifle for a more effective weapon...a bat! Yes! -That- will be a good upgrade!).<br/><br/> I don't think I can put this in the upper pantheon of ""they're coming for you"" flicks but it's serviceable entertainment. Owes a lot more to ""The Omega Man"" and ""The Stand"" than the Romero trilogy but suffers from a forced upbeat ending. Boyle certainly hasn't been a storytelling optimist in past movies, so I gotta think this is a personal declaration on his part or pressure from the suits to make a ""movie about people"" (I guess that's as opposed to a movie about plate tectonics or oranges, which we all know are very popular.)<br/><br/>Not horrible, not upper-echelon.

","I heard a lot about this film, and the previews looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try over T3 and the other summer films.  Overall, it reminded me a lot of ""From Dusk to Dawn"":  a combination of genres in a so-called horror film.  BUT...<br/><br/>I respect Danny Boyle for some of the risks he takes in cinema (at least, when it's not a commercial film he's doing).  First, the use of digital video gives the film a feel of authenticity, a la ""Blair Witch Project"". Second, the one thing I really loved in this film was the opening sequence with the main character walking through an empty London.  How they did it is beyond me; heck, I really don't want to know-that's real movie magic. Third, rock music seems to be the atmosphere-setter in Boyle's films, and once again, he utilizes songs well to set an atmosphere.  Finally, combining a survival film with a road trip film and a zombie flick is tough, but Boyle does manage to narrate the film well.  Furthermore, he directs a cast of no-names with good command; their interactions are believeable (for the most part).<br/><br/>Yes, the zombie theory is more believeable in this film (when compared to others).  There were a few times when it felt like the acting was ""pushed"". For me, though, what could have made the movie better was a few cuts during the road trip segment and during the 3rd act of the movie.  Otherwise, a definite recommendation, especiallly over films in the summer of 2003 like ""Legally Blonde 2"", ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""Charlie's Angels 2""."

","28 Days Later is not just a horror movie, it's a movie you actually need to think through. The comments about this movie being a terrible waste of time and that it doesn't live up to Trainspotting, are by people who missed the first 10 minutes of the movie or didn't understand what happened. Trainspotting (I agree) is an amazing movie which is ALSO a movie that you think through. <br/><br/>I believe it's now apparent from other peoples comments that monkey's are released by animal activists containing a virus, which spreads throughout the country side. The collage in the beginning directly relates to the LA riots in a attempt to control the human emotion of RAGE. The scientist (David Schneider) even explains that to develop a cure (to rage), the monkey's must be infected (similar to the idea in Mission Impossible 2). This crucial idea that being infected by RAGE instigates the violent side of humans. It is the rage in human nature to attack, destroy, mutilate all other people who are not infected by the disease. Maybe people are familiar with the slogan, ""You're either with us or against us"" which becomes the mentality for the ""zombies"". The infected lose their sense of right and wrong and feed off their hate and bloodlust. The idea that the movie portrays ""zombies"" is just an identifying factor that allows the viewer to determine who is and isn't infected. People everyday are infected by rage and their lives are run by anger. This is why the scientists in the beginning are trying to develop a cure for OUR disease. The monkey's are not being tested for body products, but for an actual GOOD cause.<br/><br/>This movie is not your typical horror movie with body counts and bad movie lines. The script written by Alex Garland can stand alone with its insightful thoughts and realistic story line, but it's the true vision of Danny Boyle that makes this movie a classic like Trainspotting with the cinematography. 28 Days Later will be a film that will live on and become a cult classic because no matter what, rage will always be in our lives and there's a zombie in all of us."

"Robert R Jackson","10","0","0","5 July 2003"," Requiem for Mini-DV
","This may be the pinnacle of Mini-DV. In the past few years a number of directors have tried their hands at making feature films using Mini-DV and each has had a different vision of how the medium is best used. Mostly, though, they've all tried to exploit it as a nimble and cost-effective alternative to film. With this movie the medium is used for its unique visual appeal and the cinematographer and editor have worked together to exploit those qualities in a way I haven't seen anyone else work. Years from now I feel like this will come to be regarded as the high-water mark for Mini-DV. Now that High Definition consumer camcorders are starting to become available for about the same price as Mini-DV I think the days of the Mini-DV feature are numbered, but leave it to Danny Boyle to show everyone else how it could be done.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle brings us an $8 million zombie movie where every penny is up on the screen. The acting is all top-notch. The locations are all well-considered. In the middle of another summer full of swollen special-effecs films, Danny Boyle brings us the antithesis of hollow summer fare. Here's a film where the story and the performances are more important than the special effects budget or starpower and the end result is a movie that outclasses efforts with 20 times its budget.<br/><br/>
Finally, there's the place in history this project earns as a zombie movie. Ever since George Romero wanted to make I Am Legend, couldn't acquire the rights and changed the vampires to zombies, we've had sort of an international zombie underground. Eventually, even a remake of I Am Legend decided to follow Romero's lead and The Omega Man featured its own variant of zombies. This project falls into the techno- zombie category of films like The Omega Man and Warning Sign and it proves to be the best contribution to the genre in decades. Boyle has given the world its first great zombie movie of the new millennium. Thanks Danny."
"mrchaos33","Null","0","0","5 July 2003"," Believable characters in an unbelievable scenario
","28 Days Later begins with a great horror movie premise. A group of British activists free infected animals from their cages, unleashing a deadly `rage' virus on the human population. Twenty-eight days after the virus took hold of the city, a bicycle courier named Jim awakens from a coma, unaware of the devastation. In one of the year's best cinematic sequences, horror or otherwise, Jim leaves the hospital to find a deserted London. Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) infuses the shots of the empty streets with a sense of dread. As Jim wanders through the vacant Piccadilly Circus the feeling of foreboding grows as he realizes that something catastrophic has happened here. And that's just the first ten minutes. (The scenes of London's deserted streets were shot just after dawn on weekdays. Because of the traffic, they could only shoot for a couple of minutes each day. Crewmembers frequently had to stop and ask clubbers not to walk into shots.)<br/><br/>Boyle deftly juggles two distinct ideas in 28 Days Later.  It is a full blown Halloween flick, complete with drooling angry zombies, (although hard-core gore fans will be disappointed, most of the horror here is psychological) but at its core it is also a compelling study of human nature and the will to survive. Each character is fully rounded, and none are superfluous in this tough drama. <br/><br/>Selena (Naomie Harris), for example, isn't a damsel in distress, nor is she simply a hard-nosed zombie killer. She is a layered character, a normal person who is placed in an unimaginable circumstance and is dealing with it on an instinctual level. She isn't a killer, but she'll kill to survive. `Staying alive is as good as it gets,' she says grimly.<br/><br/>Boyle (and screenwriter Alex Garland) give a wide berth to the stereotypical character traits found in horror movies  the screaming girlfriend, the witless teen, the gung-ho monster slayer  and instead concentrate on developing believable characters and situations in an unbelievable scenario. <br/><br/>In addition to believable characters 28 Days Later also re-invents the cinematic zombie. Gone are the lumbering, `We're coming to get you,' living dead from years past. Boyle's ghouls move with frightening speed, hissing at the scent of human flesh, and attacking at random. These are the zombies that nightmares are made of. <br/><br/>Shooting on digital video this time out, Boyle has left behind the visual showiness of Trainspotting and the austere picture-postcard look of The Beach, trading those in for a grainy, almost documentary feel. The jagged feel of the video gives the movie a sense of urgency and energy which seems appropriate for the subject matter. Unlike Soderbergh's Full Frontal this material actually benefits from the use of video.<br/><br/>28 Days Later runs out of steam as the third act winds down, but up until its closing minutes it is as good as speculative fiction gets."

Sandra Bullock is replaced with a British unknown, Cillian Murphy, and instead of alcoholism, the protagonist must deal with zombies created by dark biology without the benefit of a 12-step program. Director Danny Boyle, the same who did Trainspotting, possessed the wheat germ of a wonderful storyline but could never brew it into anything potent. Much like alcoholics, the protagonist and his friends depend upon others to get them out of their problem rather than relying on themselves.  The deus ex machina ending is not a happy ending, it is only the beginning of more problems.  They trusted the military once, much to their misfortune, why should they trust them again?  Instead of being governmentholics, they need to be developing their own government."

","Not since the classic Night of the Living Dead have we seen a good, creepy zombie movie. And it looks like it will be awhile more. Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later is barely scary, but if you take it for what it really is, a creative drama, it's pretty good. However, instead of the position of Venus, animal rights activists release contaminated apes to the world, which are infected with rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma and finds London completely deserted. He sees some attacking zombies, but Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris) ward them off. Soon he goes along with them to try to find other survivors, but to also try and find a cure.<br/><br/>Although there have been attempts, the last good horror film was Identity. 28 Days Later tries to be a horror film by putting in a few quick and semi-suspenseful scenes. All before the final, concluding sequence (which is the film's greatest sequence), are quick, five-second shots of zombies trying to attack people. Boyle has the camera moving so quickly during those sequences it's impossible to tell what's happening. Of course, we could see all of the blood, because there's plenty of it, but at times it looked real, but many times it was false.<br/><br/>28 Days Later, which I originally thought was a sequel to the Sandra Bullock romantic comedy 28 Days, really makes itself a good movie by putting in a scenario we've all thought about but never really see in movies. The end of the world is always an interesting subject: when will it happen, how will it occur, etc. This explores one way: an infectious virus. It probably would have played better if we didn't know how London was empty, but the way writer Alex Garland made it work, also.<br/><br/>In between those scarce horror sequences, some good drama plays out. We learn more about the virus, but I thought that the relationship between Jim and Selena was very well done. Movies like this have a limited amount of characters, making us like the ones that are there. I wouldn't call it a character-driven piece, nor a character study, but it certainly has interesting characters.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a typical zombie-horror movie, look somewhere else. If you want a drama with intense scenes (and an AWESOME score), check out 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violence and gore, language, and nudity."

","As a big fan of zombie movies, I knew I had to go see this film in theaters. Sure, the infected are not zombies in the dead sense, but they are close enough.  Like most good zombie movies, the film relied on the characters' response to the zombies for a look at how people react than just making it a shoot-em-up movie.  We do care for the good characters and since they are always in harms way, it is tense to see them in danger.  One good guy dies early on in the film, so we know that there is not a guarantee that the people in the movie will live.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a bang, then suddenly goes limp for about 10 minutes.  As the zombies pour in, the film finally advances in entertainment.  Danny Boyle's direction is very claustrophobic in this film. We cannot tell in a lot of shots of the zombies exactly how far away they are from the protagonists.  There is a scene in a tunnel where four people have to change a tire as we see the shadows and silhouettes of zombies closing in.  Then the film goes limp again with too much dream sequencing. Then it builds to a climax with some troops, the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>While the film can terrify, there are some flaws that keep it from being a great work.<br/><br/>First and foremost, DIGITAL VIDEO.  Why did Boyle decide to shoot the picture in this format?  This film looks horrible projected.  Anything in the background, even when it is the focus, is blurred.  The film would have been much better off shot on High Definition,  which can easily achieve the same color saturation as DV, is still easier to setup than a film camera, costs a little more but gives a clear, naturally 16x9 picture.<br/><br/>The music, while I like the fact that it slowly builds, is annoying.  The creators let it build up too high so that it is deafening and you just want the damn music to end.  And then there are scenes without music (or where it builds too slowly) and it really needs it to keep it from being too slow.<br/><br/>The MTV-style video editing during action scenes is atrocious.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending, but the film did seem to drone on at times where I thought ""THIS was the ending"" (or we were near it)... and then the movie kept going.  This is especially true about 3 minutes away from the REAL ending when a still frame is used and it goes to black at just the right moment that we think ""this is the end.""<br/><br/>The film could have been great.

The nineties had Candyman, Scream, Ravenous, and In the Mouth of Madness, and that was it. There were some good comedies with horror trappings (Tremors, Frighteners. Demon Knight), but those four films were it.  In the last three years, though, we've had Devil's Backbone, Frailty, Session 9, the Others, the Ring, and Audition.  Good stuff.  There has been dreck, including two of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, House of 1,000 Corpses and Feardotcom, but we are really in a renaissance of horror films right now.  28 Days Later continues this good run with an intense, Romero inspired movie with scares, action, and good performances."

","28 Days Later saw me leaving the theatre shaking and thinking ""simply, wow."" Filming it in digital video gave it a real raw ambience, rather than the sort of fake, aesthetic look of traditional celluloid.  Quite frankly, this movie just chilled the bejesus out of me.<br/><br/>The storyline goes way beyond a simple rage-against-the-zombie movie... I could feel myself in the Jim's shoes waking up to a devastated London where danger lurks everywhere.  Selena's cold-hearted approach to survival really struck me as uber-realistic; the movie really brings out the different facets of humanity that are bound to surface should something this intense ever happen to the world. <br/><br/>It's not a horror flick designed to touch your basic human reactions, but rather to prod your intellect and your own sense of order; one could easily question the soldiers in the movie, and yet agree with them at the same time.  If I ever wanted to feel the lawlessness, that fear of noone in position of authority to bail me out of a crisis, this movie was more than happy to give me a taste.<br/><br/>Definately a grade-A thriller.  The British have got turning their country into a wasteland on film down pat.  See it for a really different shock experience."

","I left the theater shaking after taking this one in.  It's not for everyone. I would not call it scary, but intense.  There are some of the most horrific and brutal murders I've ever seen on celluloid in this flick.  Not to mention some white knuckle situations.

","*Some Spoilers* After seeing this movie, I felt betrayed by all the advertisements -""Scary as Hell"" being the first one that came to mind. It's not scary, it is a wee bit suspenseful and there are a few ""boo"" scares here and there. The actors are all somewhat bland and one-dimensional, and the transitions each one makes (tough to emotional, or weak to strong) were poorly handled and unlikely. Frank the father was the best character by far, followed by Major West. Selena wasn't bad either. Anyway, this movie is essentially a rip off of every other zombie movie I have ever seen. In particular ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"". The whole evil hidden military agenda was straight from Day, as well as the idea of taking a zombie prisoner. The opening empty streets with newspapers giving Jim his clues was also directly lifted. The refueling station scene was very reminiscent of Dawn, I must say, especially with the child attacking the lead character in the office ... hmm. This movie is also  addled by too much artsy cinematography of scenic hillsides and horses, etc. A lot of the films action is based on stupid mistakes as well. Soldiers forgetting how to fight, people not taking guns, people hiding and waiting to get killed, people walking into dark rooms by themselves... silly clichÃ© stuff. However, despite the plethora downfalls I was still somewhat amused. It should have been better, and it was frustrating to watch, but it was a decent movie. It was better than ""The Italian Job"" anyway, the movie I had seen a  few weeks prior. 2.5/5 stars."
"tdbell","Null","0","0","1 July 2003"," Amazing, moving, beautiful, and not a horror-movie
","There are some anencephalites elsewhere on this page who have claimed this movie was awful; clearly they just didn't get it.  I bid you to take their reviews as something born of disillusionment rather than as the fruit of reliable criticism.  Some have asserted that 28 Days Later was neither scary, nor thoroughly entertaining; they have claimed that the `infected' are akin to zombies and that one need not bother here if he/she has seen Night of the Living Dead; so too they have criticized the name `rage' (that of the movie's relevant virus) as being inane, plain, trite, etc.  These critics missed the point entirely.  But I don't pin the blame on them.<br/><br/>This movie was billed as a horror, sci-fi; it is neither! - this is a critical point.  This is a low budget, artsy film, shot entirely in digital. Its purpose is not to scare the viewer, but to make him/her think, to realize - and this process is something generally undesirable to the average horror-movie seeking patron, at least when they are at the movies (i.e., one goes for the brainless excitement, a horror movie is a ride akin to space-mountain, etc.)  This movie should in no way be considered, and certainly should not be criticized, from this horror-movie point of view. But, as it was a product of Fox, and we all know their predilections for visual entertainment, it was listed as such. So to say something positive: this movie is in fact amazing.  Anyone who has read Camus' novels, or even has an interest in quasi-existentialist themes would enjoy this movie thoroughly.  It is not honestly existentialist, but it raises existentialist questions.  Its purpose is to show that humans, specifically humankind's proclivity for rage (hence the virus name, which is perfect here), for violence, and endless killing (as the film's army commander points out), is ruining us; it will eventually succeed in wiping us out entirely.  Our species is but a spec in universal time, a spec which will eventually be washed away by the ceaseless locomotion of the invisible clock (another point mentioned in the movie). Thus, we are unspeakably fragile, in every sense.  I have not seen a film EVER which so perfectly captures this point - and I have seen a lot of films. I know this is a lot of sentimental crap; I know normal people don't read Camus and similarly don't pay attention, and thus don't respond well to, existential crises; rather they pay attention to electric bills and read Clive Cussler books and Conde Nast Magazines.  So, in essence, this movie is not for everyone.  This film is, in fact, a film, it is not a movie - and it is certainly, as I said, not a horror-movie - just as literature is not the same as a run of the mill novel.  As a New York Times literary critic has said: novels can be understood with common knowledge, but literature requires an alternate form of acquiring and processing information, which is taught within the pages of the work.  So too is this film; and it teach much, and does it well.  This is why I have labeled many of my fellow reviewers as anencephalites: because they really do lack a necessary part of the brain - at least for the comprehension of this film!<br/><br/>It is, in sum, a delight for anyone who is, like me (who majored in Philosophy, History and English in college) impractically minded, and who is, as such, interested in the subterranean but doubtless inherent problems of mankind.  If Danny Boyle is reading:  I understood you, and thank you; this film is wonderful.  It entirely makes up for The Beach. *****"

Nope, someone obviously got a new editing machine for Christmas and they weren't going to put it down. And why do people think it's clever to film everything in the rain and the dark?

In the first 5 minutes I figured what was happening and have seen those 'wandering the streets' scenes before in On The Beach. Then it did borrow heavily from Omega Man whereas I thought it'd be more Night of the Living Dead. There were many disturbing scenes.

","It truly bothers me that many viewers of this film do not find its contents frightening.  Or that they find elements of the plot and structure in similar styled movies which preceded it.<br/><br/>An honest interpretation of this film destroys both of these false conceptions.  It wasn't formed seemlessly in a vacuum.  _28 Days Later..._ does indeed pay homage to the heroes of its genres whether they be the apocalyptic or more straight forward horror. This is not to say that it doesn't spin these themes around on their heads and give them us something provocatively new.<br/><br/>Quite simply, _28 Days Later..._ takes one of the most numbingly frightening aspects of our contemporary culture, that of blind, irrational, and implacable hatred and lets it destroy the world or most of it.  Sure its an infection but lets be quick to the point here, there's a reason its called rage.  No longer are the 'zombies' the dead ghouls rising to plague the living.  No, these 'zombies' are very much alive, exaggeratedly so, ruthlessly fast and completely indiscriminate in their destruction.  The only thing they can actively discern apparently is who doesn't share their boundless blood-lust.  And all they want to do is pass it on.<br/><br/>Ironically the dead are the only ones at peace and the living no longer need their help finding ways to die.<br/><br/>This film does have its flaws (I did give it a 7 after all) but not detriments such as shameless unoriginality or lack of terror.  At times it can be a bit heavy-handed, delivering its morals with a listless dull thump, exactly the kind of strikes I remember _Night of the Living Dead_ zombies making, which makes them all the more unacceptable now that Boyle has decided to usurp such creatures.  The latter third of the film, the Manchester-third (without giving anything substantial away) is far from subtle and can be a bit tedious.  Thankfully the breath-taking opening and terrific middle portions will be remembered for what they are and payed homage to in the future in their own right."

","Danny Boyle's tautly imagined `28 Days Later' is an ambitious zombie film more plausible than supernatural, more hysterical than scary, and more raw than gory.  Although the film is being marketed as a horror film, it bares truer resemblance to thrillers like `Outbreak,' based on the terrifying non-fiction, `Crisis in the Hotzone.'  Unlike George Romero's genre-defining visions of `Night, Dawn and Day of the (Living) Dead' trilogy, D. Boyle's zombies are not dead but rather terminally enraged.  Clearly the makers were inspired more by `Crisis in the Hotzone,' especially the way Ebola virus spread, and applied it in a zombie film. (In the final stages of Ebola infection, contaminated blood pours out from every orifices of victims' bodies while causing them to thrash violently and infect others through eyes, mouth, open wound and some even through air.)<br/><br/>Wonderfully transparent Cillian Murphy plays Jim, a bicycle messenger who fell into coma just before the outbreak, wakes up to find all of London empty and left to discover the terrible fate of humanity.  Embracing the limited budget and digital video, D. Boyle champions inspired collaboration from his talented cast and cameraman, Anthony Dod Mantle.  Christopher Eccleston's insane Major Henry West and Brendan Gleeson's tenderly father Frank are excellent, and DV photography helps shape the film's creepy mood as well as freer application of digital visual effects.  John Murphy's aggressive score highlights film's implicit violence and psychological turmoil occurring throughout the film.  While `28 Days Later' is not as scary as G. Romero's Dead Trilogy, D. Boyle succeeds in breathing fresh life to the living-dead genre.  This one rates 8/10."

","Usually I like to creatively criticize films, but I couldn't find anything wrong with it....<br/><br/>28 seconds later...<br/><br/>This movie was nothing more than a rip off of every walking dead movie. The only difference is the fact that you know what caused the people to become zombies. Oh wait a minute! That was a difference as well-the zombies weren't actually dead at first simply people who have contracted a virus call ""rage"", But the concept is the same. --The only survivors of the town have all come together to fend off the creatures until they begin to turn on each other thus leading to their downfall. Then the final survivors still have to maintain their sanity until help arrives.<br/><br/>One good thing I can point out is--the zombies were better than the traditional slow walking creatures. (except-return of the living dead) And these zombies were actually faster than those. That made it a bit more challenging were as there actually was chance to be rundown and killed by one of the zombies than to be killed by slow moving stiffs because of stupidity.<br/><br/>Anyway go check it out---mainly because of Naomi Harris who brings a bit of a Linda Hamilton feel to it....(Just a little bit)"

","(while I admire the effort and usually love this sort of movie, I have to rate this one as a total failure)<br/><br/>Until the arrival of some military squaddies at the end, there's little to no mention of firearms in this film.  If zombies had taken over, I think finding a gun would be on the top of my to-do list.  At the very least, if I'd woken up one morning to find a city abandoned, I'd still get a gun at the very least for hunting purposes (horse meat, anyone?).<br/><br/>
The most troubling aspect of this movie is its total lack of originality. The basic premise is stolen from THE CRAZIES and DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, with a virus wiping everything out and making people go mad.  Then it shoots into DAWN OF THE DEAD territory with characters raiding a store in a very inferior fashion (again neglecting real weapons), and then DAY OF THE DEAD when we run into some hapless underdeveloped military goons not unlike the convicts in ALIEN 3.  There's also a 12 MONKEYS/STREETFIGHTER/CLOCKWORK ORANGE reference at the beginning, involving apes being conditioned by watching violent images, then getting let loose by animal rights activists.<br/><br/>The plot and premise is full of holes: why do rage victims not attack each other?  How do they violate the laws of physics to get so much blood and energy?  How would a virus that takes effect so quickly spread across a body of water?  (I could just imagine an airline pilot still piloting his route, totally oblivious to the fact that all his passengers are hyperactive blood-barfing zombies - or someone calmly boarding a plane right in the 15-20 seconds after getting bitten.)<br/><br/>Most memorably bad is the awful look to the cinematography.  I've shot with a Canon XL-1 with little to no understanding of how to properly white-balance it or do good lighting, and the picture I got didn't look nearly this bad, with pixelly video artifacts, jagged lines, etc.  The cheapness really showed through during the brighter scenes.  With a $15 million dollar budget, the filmmakers may as well have used 16mm or 35mm, because even though they blocked traffic and shot DV on the fly, there's still a few shots where you can clearly see cars in the distance.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie sounds a lot better than it is.  None of the violence is clearly visible due to a rapid ADD-like style of cutting during the action scenes."

The human reactions were believable. I loved how that John kid ran away. Classic. I believe a military unit could fall apart as fast as it did in the movie, considering that the men probably were between the ages of 18-23...what else would they have done? What I don't understand is why everyone is referring to this as a zombie movie. It isn't. The infected, as they were called in the movie, weren't zombies...they weren't even dead, which, I believe, is a requirement. They had a little more character than zombies. I know zombies can't move as fast as the infected did, who reminded me a lot of the ""Wheelers"" in the Return to Oz movie. There were also moments of humor that I enjoyed. It's good to be able to laugh in a suspense/somewhat horror film.

""The Pianist!"")? Well, here's your answer, and as you might expect, it ain't for everyone. Still, it's pretty f***ing brilliant no matter which way you cut it. The nifty little thing about Boyle, is that he really didn't make a zombie film. He's made a casualties of war survival film. Sure there's plenty of zombie gore to please the hardcore genre fans, and it comes early and in the bucket-loads. Also, to the film's advantage, all the gore is the old fashioned kind, i.e. there ain't no CGI here, folks (something that really hampered a film like ""Resident Evil"").<br/><br/>But real film fans will enjoy the emotional complexity, surprisingly engaging character development (which is way deeper than any horror film has the right to be) and the shocking ""survival at any costs"" theme that undercuts the entire film. You'll be hard pressed to find a horror movie with more endearing or ""real"" characters. Another refreshing aspect is that all of the humor (something every good horror movie needs in moderate doses) arises from realistic interactions amongst the characters. Nothing here is an ""in joke"" or overtly self-aware (like ""Scream"" and all its knockoffs). The film takes itself pretty seriously, and has some serious things to say about human nature and survival. When it gets down to it, how far would you go to survive? To protect your loved ones? To find hope? You had no right to expect a horror flick to be this deep or emotionally devastating....until now. Will horror films ever be the same? It's hard to tell so soon, and especially since the apocalyptic zombie stuff is so derivative (that will make it easy for detractors to dismiss the film). And while the herky-jerky digital camera work is used effectively here, it's another trend that most find annoying in films, and that could hurt how folks regard this movie in the future. I think it's got the long clean lines of a classic...but only time will tell...and as long as the zombies don't get us first."

This movie is raw and difficult to watch, so fake sci-fi/horror enthusiasts and the faint-of-heart need not waste their time.  The violence is brutal and constant.<br/><br/>Bicycle Courier Jim awakens after an accident-induced coma to find himself alone in the city of London.

Jim, along with other survivors, must decide what is worth living for, and what is worth dying for, in the world post-apocalypse.<br/><br/>This story of the apocalypse, like so many others, is really about what happens AFTER the apocalypse.  What kind of people are the survivors?  How do the survivors cope?  How do they interact?  What kind of society are they going to form in the aftermath?  Questions of morality and existence are raised which the viewer must answer.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to enthusiasts of such films as The Road Warrior, The Quiet Earth, The Postman.  28 Days Later is difficult to watch, at times, but poignant and inspiring and very, very relevant."

The posters, commercials, and trailers for ""28 Days"" make it seem one step ahead of pure genre-schlok like ""Wrong Turn"".<br/><br/>""28 Days"" isn't a zombie movie--rather, it seems to take genre as a subject, as its moods, themes, and ideas constantly shift, without making the film seem pretentious or clumsy.  These shifts don't draw attention away from the screen--they draw you into it.  Even during really good movies, my mind will inevitably shift back to things in my mind extraneous to the film--that didn't happen once watching ""28 Days"".<br/><br/>This is perhaps the film's greatest feat.  Danny Boyle has revalidated himself as a top-tier, visionary filmmaker with this movie, nearly obliterating the puke-a-thon of ""The Beach"".<br/><br/>One thing specifically (*MINOR SPOILER*):<br/><br/>A lot of people on imdb are bitching about how derivative this film is. Indeed, the squence in the supermarket is almost a direct reference to George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"".  But ""28 Days"" treats the zombie/rampant consumerism metaphor quite subtly: notice the christmas lights blinking in Hannah and her father's apartment building.  They are the visual cue that Selena and Jim notice (they are drawn to them).  And inside the apartment, ""Frosty the Snowman"" is playing on the stereo (powered by batteries, I'm sure).  Later in the film, at the military compound, one of the soldiers says that the eggs made him ""Feel like it was Christmas"".<br/><br/>Don't go see ""28 Days Later"" because you want to see a scary movie--see it because you want to see a good film--er--digital video feature length narrative."

Danny Boyle's take on horror consists of obviously digital video sources,and some weird compositions meant to keep the veiwer off guard and disoriented.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Overall, the film was pretty good but there were some cultural influences that made if hard for me to identify with the characters and some of the plot line.  Others will sum up the plot of the movie so I won't bother with a synopsis of the film.<br/><br/>**possible spoilers**<br/><br/>I don't know what it is with the prevalence of male nudity in British movies and television, but it did start me to thinking about the differences between American culture and the rest of the world, specifically Europe. So what does this have to do with the film?  Well first off, if I were stranded in a city, surrounded by infected humans that want to kill me, I would not choose a bat or machete to defend myself with.  I would find a firearm and make sure I had an ample supply of ammo for it.  Why let the infected get within arms reach of you to kill them, when you can kill them from afar? Granted, this is England and people can't own firearms for the most part, so I could understand it if they were limited to Paleolithic era weapons. But then during the later part of the film, the main character, in a house filled with the infected, basically throws away a rifle he found and decides he would be better off bare handed.  Why?  While I am on the subject of firearms, it was also noted that the military guys in the film handled their weapons like, well, actors.  Pretty much had to suspend all disbelief when `trained' soldiers started shooting from the hip.<br/><br/>Like most other movies I have seen, naturally the military guys are mean-spirited and messed up.  Why make them out to be boogiemen, why not make them human like the main characters of the film?  Why do films always have to portray military characters so one-dimensionally?  Would real soldiers be so hard up after only one month without sex, that they would resort themselves to raping the first females they came in contact with? For a film that is supposed to explore the human condition, it completely failed on this aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, why did the main character go berserk at the end of the film and kill off the non-infected?  Ok, I can understand him not being so fond of the idea of the soldiers raping his friends, but he seemed to go a bit overboard in trying to save them.  After letting one of the infected loose, that obviously cause enough of a diversion that he could get his friends out without too much resistance.  Why did he feel the need go out of his way to brutally kill any un-infected soldier he came in contact with?  Did he really need to gouge out the eyes of one of the bad guys to save his girl? Once again, I found the film lacking in portraying real human emotions.<br/><br/>Overall, I did find the film interesting, and aside from its problems, was well worth the time to watch."

","This movie is lousy.  I read in the paper that it is supposed to be one of the scariest movies.. I honestly never once got the slightest bit scared. The roaring/screeching/screaming of the zombies is more annoying than scary. Let's see.. The film quality was crap, I could have produced better quality with a $100 camera.. In scenes where the city is supposedly empty, there is one shot where a car is driving in the background, and another shot where there is a man walking down the street, but our main character somehow misses both of them.  Aside from the movie being pure garbage, the last 5 minutes really got to me.  The last 5 minutes are of much higher video quality, and given how it ends prior to the 'last 5 minutes' it seems Hollywood wasn't satisfied with letting the movie end there (""choose your own ending"") and added a much happier ending.  But really I don't care and these people could have all died and I wouldn't have cared either.  The only way this movie could have been redeemed is if the girls were bred.

","Several comments posted here indicate that this is a ""boring"" film. Many accuse it of ""sucking"". I couldn't disagree more. This ain't a Hollywood monster movie. So if you are the type that has been de-sensitized away from classic thrillers via Freddy, Jason, and Mike Myers...you won't find much to like about 28 Days Later. It borrows just a bit from George Romero's early zombie films, but don't be fooled---this is NOT a zombie flic. Just as much as viewers want to conjure the ""Living Dead"" series, they should be equally conscious of  Lord of the Flies and (Stephen King's) The Stand. 28 Days Later focuses more on human psychology than decapitations. Again, if you want mindless gore...well, this won't satisfy.<br/><br/>Maybe this might be a reliable litmus to tell if you'd like 28 Days Later: If you were creeped-out by Session 9, you should give this movie a chance. I suggest this because TDL puts you in a bizarre setting and lets your imagination unravel your nerves. It's not the sole responsibility of ""zombies"" to scare viewers; it's the loneliness...the bleakness...and the survival-mode itself that frightens.<br/><br/>A word about the direction (beware possible SPOILERS): The ""infected"" humans (aka ""zombies"" for a common, albeit off-target, reference) attack with full ""Rage"" (the actual disease they suffer), and the camera work is hard to follow. To my thinking, the scenes work better with this jittery approach. Why should we see clearly what damage a Rage-infected human can inflict? Don't we already know? Aren't their red eyes, boiling blood, and guttural growlings enough to clue us in to their danger? Should the Rage-afflicted be slowed down so audiences can see a Matrix-style wire act? And I'd argue that the origin of the Rage virus is no more or less incredible than Romero's ""Hell is full, so the dead will walk the earth"" scenario...<br/><br/>Let me paint one scene for you (definite SPOILER ahead), and you judge if it sounds like it's worth seeing:<br/><br/>The father character attempts to drive away a crow that's feasting on the flesh of an infected corpse. (Both are overhead, BTW) A drop of blood happens to land smack on his eyeball! It has been established that Rage will course thru the bloodstream in 20-30 seconds, and effects will be immediately visible. (It's a terrific vehicle for the actors! )The father character paws at his eye, knowing full well that he's screwed. He stumbles over to his daughter and takes his last few sane seconds to remind her he loves her. Then, nearly in the same breath, he's transformed into a snarling beast that can't resist the blood-borne urge to rend her to pieces! He was a very likable character to that point, and on a dime he turns and suddenly must be subdued (killed) by the others. Any hesitation would be tragic. It's a powerful scene.<br/><br/>THAT's why this film works. Low-budget horror movie directors should take note."

"jack1013","Null","0","0","29 June 2003"," Absolutely Brilliant
","I have to say, I am shocked and amazed at the comments I've been seeing regarding this movie.  I would have to say, as a rabid fan of zombie movies and of Danny Boyle, that 28 Days Later is probably the most incredible piece of film making I've seen in a long time.  Everything about this movie is incredible - from the plot, to the acting, to the characters, to the stunning cinematography.  The film makers choice of filming in digital is phenomenal, making the film both uber-real and fantastic at the same time. The shots of a deserted London are breathtaking, as is the image of Manchester in flames.  The stark silence of the majority of the film adds an air of surrealism and desperation, bringing us into the story as if we were the ones wandering lost through the deserted streets.  The silence, however, only makes the frightening appearance of the ""infected"" that much more dramatic. As for those who include ""rip off"" in their repertoire of insults, I say shame on you.  Danny Boyle respectfully tips his hat to the master of the genre (George Romero) on many occasions, but his nods to the original zombie masterpieces (Dawn/Day of the Dead et al) are done tastefully and expertly, with a touch and flair of his own creative inspiration that successfully bring those unforgettable moments into a frightening, up-to-date new setting. If you went into this movie expecting to see ""Return of the Living Dead""-type shtick, I can understand your disappointment.  This movie is to ""Return of the Living Dead"" as ""Schindlers List"" is to ""Springtime for Hitler"".  This is not some 80's gore-fest targeted towards adolescent boys looking for blood and boobs.  This movie takes itself very seriously, successfully combining the suspense and fear of superb horror with the character development and storyline of the best kind of drama.<br/><br/>Reading the flood of negative comments left here makes me embarrassed to be part of an American audience.  Are we that incapable of accepting subtlety and suggestion?  Do filmmakers need to include EXTREME violence and bloodshed in every scene in order to keep our attention?  If Boyle had thrown in more nudity, would ""28 Days..."" have passed muster?  Maybe the appearance of Vin Diesel in a fast car would have suited your tastes.<br/><br/>Watch it again, folks.  Turn off Carson Daly, skip the next installment of ""American Idol"", and learn to appreciate brilliance when you see it."

Yes to some of your remarks there are good and there are bad. Some are copy cats to an extent, and some sequels should have never been made. I don't think there is a horror movie I haven't seen. This one ranks up there with stupid, boring, one you wish would end. If I had paid to see this I would have demanded my money back.  As far as RESIDENT EVIL is concerned. My family has all the versions of the games ""we have many systems"" and the series is a favorite. I even enjoy watching them play it. I thought the movie was ok. was it a rip off of older zombie movies? that is questionable. any zombie movie that deals with viruses will be. BUT HELLO YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IF YOU HAVE SEEN THOSE TYPE MOVIES BEFORE. YOU ARE NOW GOING BECAUSE OF THE PLOT. They could have spent a bit more money on the movie, and had a lot more interaction with the zombies instead of jumping from the primate lab to the naked guy in the hospital. show what happened between that time. That is why I liked Resident Evil.To From those who are not familiar with the game I have heard good things. those familiar split on liking it disliking it. like I said I thought it was ok, but nothing can touch Dawn of the dead. stupid yes ! But still a classic. 28 days in my opinion is a waste of film ,and was not a rip of RE. but a rip off of in general. Even my kids were bored with it and they are horror movies buffs also.

"BadNewsCrewse","3","0","0","28 June 2003"," This is NOT a zombie flick! (maybe minor spoilers)
","I want to clear the air first off by saying that this is NOT a zombie flick. Zombies, as a general rule since Romero's ""NOTLD"", have acted in certain ways. They have ONE main goal which is to feed. They aren't in a murderous state of rage out to kill... they just want to eat. They also were people who died in whatever way they died and shortly thereafter became the undead. They also move very slowly and are clumsy to an extent. The general moan and groan is their basic vocabulary. In this movie which has been stated as a zombie flick, the so called zombies are nothing of the sort. They want to do nothing but KILL. They aren't interested in a meal. They are not people who have recently died, but they are people who within 10-20 seconds get infected with the virus through a scratch, a bite, or somehow getting the infected blood into their system which in turn puts them into a state of murderous rage. They can run and jump very proficiently. They also scream as well as moan. I can't understand where people say this is a zombie movie. If you are reading this and haven't seen it yet, do not expect it to be one. I was told that it was and read that it was and was gravely misled. It has some cool moments in the film, but I was not impressed. I also didn't like that every time an ""infected"" would be shown, the screen would move so much that you couldn't really even tell what was happening. Actually that happened when any action was taking place. I would recommend to you that if you want to see a zombie movie, go rent ""Dawn of the Dead"" or if you want to see a movie with an outbreak in it, rent ""Outbreak""."

You just sit there going, ""what is it?"". This movie had the potential to be great. The fast moving ""infected"" are really scary, but you see them so seldom in the film. It needed tons of them. The only reason I was freaked out was because the main characters don't have any guns and don't seem interested in getting any. I would think, since you're trapped in a city infested with rabid zombies, that you might possibly want a better weapon than a baseball bat and large knife?? And you might not want to be walking around out in the open. Like why not stick a sign on your butt ""dinner here!"". This movie seemed to want to be a horror film, but it just didn't quite make it. And the main characters just weren't that sympathetic. Like I had a hard time caring about them at all. Toward the end of the film, things get a bit violent and freaky but not enough really. Or it's just too little too late. Then the ending itself was really lame. About the only thing I thought was really good was that they did a great job of making England look deserted. It's hard for me to recommend this film. The only really scary thing was the no gun thing. And walking around out in the open with no real weapon. I wouldn't give this film a really low rating, but I wouldn't give it a high one either. Somewhere in between.  It's a shame, really.  The potential was there.  The beginning idea was great.  Animal activists try to rescue some chimps and end up getting bitten and infected with a rabid zombie virus that takes over most of the world.  And we're given the story of a small handful of survivors.  But it just wasn't what it should have been.  Too little zombie stuff.  And somehow, alot of the film was boring."

All of the suspenseful scenes are underscored with this faint violin music that sounds sort of like buzzing flies and it kept me on edge for awhile. The movie does have its bad points, some of the acting by the principals coming to mind. Some parts were a bit too slow for me also and I found myself kind of anxious for the goods to pop up again. I also thought the last 1/3 of the movie kind of fell apart. Bad stuff aside, I thought the entire idea of the people being infected by rage, instead of simply being the walking dead was a nice touch, providing for zombies that have a lot of energy to spare. There's even a nifty Stephen King tribute here (readers of the Stand will know which scene I mean) that sets up one of the movie's more terrifying moments! I like the characters, especially that machete wielding chick. One of the characters gets killed off early on after leading you to believe that he's gonna stick around for awhile. I love that stuff!

","Despite being very intense, ""28 Days Later"" is a zombie movie you can take your (less sensitive) friends to. It's an odd film, in that it isn't terribly odd at all. It is photographed on video and shot and edited in a contemporary, slick manner that creates the illusion of immediacy. Still, in it's own way, it is nearly as chaste as a Hammer film. Not too surprising given England's ""Video Nasties"" laws, which could be partly the motivation for changing the zombie rule book -- a zombie picture for a country that doesn't look kindly on zombie pictures. In fact, as has been mentioned elsewhere, ""28 Days Later"" has less in common with the undead and more with the novel (not the film) ""Day of the Triffids.""<br/><br/>Having circumvented Britain's tender sensibilities, and having added some new editing and filming tricks, Danny Boyle does an excellent job of recapitulating the best of George Romero, including his earliest horror effort, ""The Crazies."" I'm not saying this as a criticism, though it does remove some of the film's potential novelty. It is unlikely that the plot will surprise you or leave you, like Romero's films did, with that desire to have your soul cleansed with bleach.

","I truly didn't like this movie. Like many, I have grown used to seeing movies that have the financial ressources required to attain their objective but this movie clearly didn't.<br/><br/>Because of lack of money, the movie has to leave huge plot holes open (spoilers): it is about impossible for a whole country to be wiped out so easily and quickly. The ease with which the soldiers dispatch the infected would translate into a huge part of the population surviving an infection. The whole process and speed of the infection does not make sense. Also, very little is said of the source of the infection, besides making the very politically correct assumption that the virus was created by some faceless crazed scientists. Also, a medical question, how long can a comatose person survive with no medical support - including no drip or feeding?<br/><br/>The movie also suffers from its ""post-grunge"" casting and direction. It has a fascination with unwashed faces and sloppy appearance. For example, I cannot believe that a military unit's discipline would break down as fast as this. Soldiers wouldn't stop shaving or would not start wearing funny hats in only 2 weeks... The production design is very similar to the first Mad Max movie, without the excuse of a long duration of social breakdown. The use of video for filming does not improve the movie... personally, I just think it looks cheap.<br/><br/>Also, if the filmmaker expects us not to see the trick of filming London scenes at 5 am - it is absolutely obvious by the lenght of the shadows on the ground. At one point, I felt that the beginning of the movie was a succession of 20 early morning scenes... It looked plain silly.<br/><br/>
I admit I have seen only one of George Romero's zombie flicks but the parallel is very easy to see. However, I would rate this movie as a more psychological version of ""Assault on precinct 13"" or a less moronic ""Ghosts of Mars"".<br/><br/>As for the supposedly scary aspect of this movie, i'm convinced my cinema has received some kind of edited version... I didn,t see anything scary at all - some people even laughed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd say the director should stick to making movies like Trainspotting and leave the horror flicks to people who can raise better production budgets."

This fatal flaw kinda ruined the whole movie. Also, who is our main character? Where did he come from? Did the hospital not cure him of infection, or why else would he be hooked up to IV and bleeding? And probably the most frusturating of all is where the title comes from, why does he pass out for 28 days at a time? And why did they find it nessisarry to continually show him naked?

It was more like 8 or 9 short stories built on top of each other, with no major goal behind them all. Basically the movie was a camelback of minor conflics and minor resolutions with no overseeing goal at hand. Even if the movie said ""lets get out of here [England]"" would have been better than no real plot besides staying alive for a few more hours.<br/><br/>Once the end finally comes around, it ""leaves you hanging,"" or as I like to call it, ending without explaining ANYTHING from the movie, no resolution for our characters, the virus, the plane, or the entire island of England.

","There was so much hype about how scary this film was that I had reservations about seeing it, being the fraidy cat that I am.  However, my much younger sister begged me to take her, and I ended up thanking her for it afterward.<br/><br/>I should have known that I would like 28 Days Later from the start.  It was directed by Danny Boyle, who has provided us with the great Trainspotting and Shallow Grave among other films.  All of his films have a great frenetic style to them, and 28 Days follows in that tradition.  Shot with digital film, this medium provided a grittiness and realism that could have been too slick if it had been filmed on traditional celluloid.  This is pure speculation, but regardless, the digital format added an almost documentarian feel to the film.  <br/><br/>In addition to the fact that the main character, Jim has been hospitalized for a month after an accident and wakes up to find London virtually deserted, he has some zombies that have been infected with a virus called RAGE to contend with.  These are not your late sixties Romero zombies that walked around slowly and moaned for brains - these are new and improved zombies who move at mind numbing speed, vomit blood constantly, and aren't necessarily concerned with turning you into one of them - they don't mind killing you, quickly and painfully.  <br/><br/>But don't go into this movie expecting a simple slasher/horror flick. Unlike many horror films of the last forty years, 28 Days doesn't rely on a thin (if at all existent) storyline, teen hotties, and corny humor to supplement its non-action oriented sequences.  This is a film that explores family, utopia and most notably, survival among other themes.  Having said that, it is not the least bit preachy or pretentious, and certainly does not take itself too seriously.  What 28 Days does provide is two hours of disturbing yet compelling imagery, an intelligent voice that will have you deconstructing the plot for hours, even days after you see it, and of course, fantastic zombies. <br/><br/>If you don't want to see a horror/suspense film that transcends the plot devices of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street films, don't bother with this one.  But if you are looking for something with a little more mettle, definitely check this one out - even my sister, a die hard slasher flick fan loved it. <br/><br/>--Shelly"

","In 1962 Ray Milland directed himself in a taut little B-movie thriller called ""Panic in Year Zero"" which in it's own unpretentious way examined the theme of ""We're on our own so now what the hell do we do"" more compellingly than other flicks with much bigger budgets.  A key moment was when the Milland character heard someone say that there was no more law so they could do what they wanted; he sharply responded ""The law will come back.  We just have to survive until it does.""  I don't know if Danny Boyle has seen this movie but I see a lot of it in ""28 Days Later,"" especially the underlying faith of the characters that (A) there will always be some form of government and (B) this is a good thing.  I also see this very much as a movie by and about British people, so it's interesting to read how many viewers on this site discern in it lessons for America.<br/><br/>I've only seen two of Mr. Boyle's previous films, ""Trainspotting"" and ""A Life Less Ordinary,"" and parts of a third, ""The Beach,"" on TV.  He's always got his tongue at least somewhat in his cheek, and he doesn't mind mixing the funny with the horrible, letting audience members react as they will. John Cleese once remarked to Dick Cavett that Americans would benefit if they could learn the European knack of holding conflicting views simultaneously.  Mr. Boyle also seems to be teaching this lesson.  At times he seems to be daring us to break out of our standard cinematic emotional responses.  But when he wants to, he can capture a moment of genuine pathos and present it as deftly as anyone working today.  An example in ""28 Days Later"" is when the hero looks at the photo left behind by his dead parents and reads what's written on the back of it.<br/><br/>Mr. Boyle seems keen on asking WHY humans do what they do.  He would seem to agree with Thomas Carlyle's observation about the average man that ""Mere use-and-wont leads him everywhere by the nose, and prejudice, which he pretends to despise, is his absolute lawgiver.""  In each movie he'll put his characters in some bizarre milieu, whether it's sub-Third-World conditions of Scottish heroin addiction in ""Trainspotting,"" or people hounded by murderous angels in ""A Life Less Ordinary,"" or an island run by a fascistic drug cult in ""The Beach,"" or a depopulated England beset with diseased maniacs in ""28 Days Later.""  Each of these is basically a backdrop against which Mr. Boyle examines human habits and tendencies.  ""28"" zeroes in on the English specifically with their ""insular"" mentality.  Maybe Mr. Boyle was inspired by the ""mad cow disease"" scare over there, and he seems to be poking fun at the country's obsession with keeping rabies at bay.  The mysterious disease in the movie resembles rabies in some respects.  We hear characters speculating what's happening in the rest of the world---""Everywhere else people are still watching television.  What should they do with a sick little island?  Quarantine it, that's what.""  Living on a tiny island that once dominated much of the world, the English have always had a kind of love/hate relationship with that world.  Most recently it's heard in debate about the ""Euro"" currency.  Mr. Boyle also spoofs the English preoccupation with social delicacies, as when the army officer tells his guests/captives ""Look, I promised them women, you see.""  Then he shows us the two female characters dressed to the nines sitting on a couch in front of a portrait of the grand dame of the house in days of yore, also dressed to the nines.<br/><br/>Anyone who started reading this wondering what I think of the movie's visceral aspects has probably left already, so now I'll address the visceral aspects: a lot of it's well done, although some scenes feel rushed.  The spookiest scene is probably the one in the tunnel with the flat tire and the rats and the approaching shadows on the wall, even though the screenwriter had to bend over backwards to put the characters there.  Much of the action is dark and/or chaotically edited, hard to tell who's doing what to whom, but that seems to be the style nowadays so I'll just have to live with it. (We've all had scary dreams, right?  Think of one you've had, say with someone or something coming after you: did it have eye-blink editing? Wasn't it just an unbroken, inescapable view of the menace?  That's what made it scary, right?  Why can't movies do that?)  By the way everyone refers to the sick people as ""zombies,"" but as I recall, they weren't the re-animated dead, they were just very sick live people.  A disease communicated mostly by blood or saliva ought to have been relatively easy to contain, I would have thought, as opposed to one that's airborne or carried by bugs of some kind.  My mom, who saw it with  me, pointed out that it would have been scarier if the disease hadn't manifested itself immediately after infection but rather taken a while, so someone could seem healthy then eventually deteriorate.  Since the countryside seemed relatively free of the sick, what was so urgent about getting to Manchester?  That recorded broadcast seemed a pretty obvious setup, along with various plot contrivances pointed out by others.  Still, I'm cutting it a lot of slack just 'cause I couldn't predict every plot point an hour ahead of time, and based on Mr. Boyle's track record in that regard I'll happily pay to see his next offering in the cinema so long as it doesn't have Leo Di Caprio in it.<br/><br/>At the outset, with the Animal Liberation Front types raiding the research lab, I was hoping that whole disgusting can of worms would get examined in a relatively major movie, but unfortunately it was just a set-up sequence; the chimps are never seen again.  I guess it's just a given today that animal abuse is okay if we're allegedly trying to cure something; never mind that the chief goal of this industry, like any industry, is self-perpetuation. It's too bad Mr. Boyle didn't use the original ending mentioned in IMDB, with the human discussing procreation with the chicken, to tie in with the animal theme.  Guess he too has to worry about audience unhappiness with unhappy endings. To borrow a line from Pink Floyd's ""The Final Cut"":  Mr. Boyle, ""Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow....""         <br/><br/>

Despite a hopeful beginning, the answer is NO.  Aside from the extremely annoying music-video edits during the action scenes (which signify that this is, in fact, a zombie movie for the NEW MILLENNIUM), there isn't much in 28DL that hasn't been borrowed from another source.  The trans-generational, ethnic mix of heroes (including, yes, a black female survivalist) echoes ""Night of the Living Dead""--only here, the characters are weakly-drawn caricatures.  The 'zombie disease' theme was mined in ""The Omega Man.""  And the critique of the military as a harsh, dictatorial outfit was handled better in ""Day of the Dead"" and ""The Crazies.""

","Danny Boyle tips his cap to George Romero's ""Dead Trilogy"" and Boris Sagal's ""The Omega Man"" a highly underrated sci-fi film starring Charleton Heston. ""28 Days Later"" is a crisp horror movie. It has the positives of being a gritty, realistic low-budget film without the drawbacks of bad acting, cheap thrills or pretentious ham-handed preaching. <br/><br/>There are a few particularly horrifying (startling) moments in the movie including the scene in the church, the ""candle"" scene, the stairwell scene. On another level of fear: Excellent tension is sustained, both in leaving the city (an eerie tunnel sequence pays homage to Stephen King's ""The Stand"") as well as the strange quirks of the rag-tag military group. The final level of fear is the societal implications. Are we truly a society of consumer-crazed aggression? Is everybody else a danger to us? It certainly puts the condition of our species under the microscope. There is a scene in the film (in the store) straight out of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the captive ""infected"" is reminiscent of Bub in ""Day of the Dead"". It is worth seeing in a darkened theater to heighten the impact."

That doesn't mean it's bad, but like the Dead trilogy, it falls flat in the third act.<br/><br/>It has several scenes that echo Night's ""zombie siege"" mentality.<br/><br/>It uses Day and Dawn's post-apocalyptic feel (though, to be fair, lots of stuff is post-apocalyptic).<br/><br/>The most blatant similarity, however, is the entire theme of Day's whole military-self-implosion thing. The soldiers were just like the soldiers under Captain Rhodes...perhaps _too_ obviously so. Like Day, it had an overly happy ending (a killer for any zombie apocalypse flick).

How is it that a story takes place in an over populated city doesn;t have thousands of empty cars filling/blocking the streets. In as much chaos that must have ensuedin that 28 days I doubt the cars just disappeared. It certainly would have made the story move a lot slower trying to get out of the city though... In fact I would imagine it would isolate the characters to the confines of the city for that reason.<br/><br/> I always liked these movies because it gets me to thinking; If something like this happened where I live what would I do to survive? What kind of supplies would I always have with me when moving around a city full of zombies. Guns. Ammo. flashlights, batteries would certainly be top on the list.

","A simple story with simple, background images, yet this film is stunningly effective  successfully offering the feeling that rage' sets off the time bomb in summoning Armageddon!  <br/><br/>Of course, this movie would have made better sense for the audience to see more heaps of dead bodies strewn on the streets of London, or more blood-thirsting, zombie-like monsters roaming around this city, killing one another. But is the writer, Alex Garland, or Director Danny Boyle, hinting to viewers that birds of the same feather always flock together? Yet, the solitary London street scenes succeed in invoking the apocalyptic' feeling. The hello cries of Jim echoes the same. And the military base' in Manchester does summon up the sort of chaos that could easily mark the end of the world.  One nice aspect to this film: it offers the viewers to see a microcosm of a nation where fear and death siren from corner to corner  all as a result of some ignorant souls opening the Pandora's Box!   <br/><br/>
The film focuses nicely on the theme of survival. It moves at an interesting pace to keep the audience wondering who'd be the next victim. Could a handful of travelers from London find salvation with the help of the military in Manchester?  Death lurks - and the theme of 'death' stays with the viewers all through this film. What is interesting is the way the survivors' are portrayed... none of relative importance. Basically ordinary folks like you and me  trying to keep alive and out of danger when fear strikes! The audience will be perpetually put on edge as they watch the characters move helter-skelter during the cat-and-mouse chases. Yep, be also prepared for the shadows lurking dangerously around the bend.<br/><br/>
The film seems to show that the actors don't have to try to sweep the viewers off their feet with their outstanding performances. There isn't any poetic or flowery dialogue. Characters who have to run amok in films don't have to try to impress anyone with their Shakespearean tongues.  Ordinary folks, who are being attacked in a war zone' doing what they can to stay alive  running!  There's every expectation that there's not a single minute to waste. The cast ensemble works well for this movie and does make the plot work. They bring credibility to their eventful escapade moments.  One can't help being swept in to every chaotic scene, feeling as helpless as Jim and his companions  and thinking what people facing death would do.<br/><br/>
What do I think of the ending of this film? It does leave room for thought. I do prefer happy endings to all movies and am inclined to see `Hello' as a symbolic hint. <br/><br/>B+"

","I waited in anticipation for this movie after seeing the brilliant, comic style posters and a few publicity shots of a deserted London.<br/><br/>My expectations were high, and for once my expectations were met.well almost<br/><br/>The opening scene of a baron & silent London is one of the most disturbing pieces of film I have watched. Anyone who has visited these landmarks will understand how these shots leave the viewer experiencing the fear and confusion the characters are going through. And I know the idea has been used before but, the plot of a virus wiping out humanity couldn't have come at a more poignant time with talk of chemical weapons & virus attacks making the headlines. The story starts to evolve into a wonderful Sci-Fi thriller until they get to the Army Blockade and this is the point were the film Losses itself, luckily only for a short time. The arrival of the Army seems to herald the arrival of a whole new film. Now I love the way it progresses from an apocalyptic Sci-Fi flic to Action horror, yet I can see why many people find the jump in plot a bit hard to swallow. The energy & pace of the 2nd half  is completely different to the 1st  and this sudden change although crucial to the story is hard for the viewer to comprehend. A lot of reviewers have also commented on how shooting with digital video gives a cheap feel to the picture but look carefully at how beautiful the giant drops of rain look when the main character starts his fight back, Im sure you'll agree it only enhances the feel of a dark, desolate world.<br/><br/>The change in tempo is the only set back of the film, but I really can't see how else the story could have been moved on. The acting is excellent, the soundtrack is great and I still havent got over the shot of the upturned bus out of my head. 9/10<br/><br/>Also get this on DVD as the deleted scenes are excellent."

","28 Days Later was one of those films you don't hear much about in the media - maybe the subject, combined with the rating, makes the media pay less attention to it than the usual blockbuster suspects. Or maybe they were quick to dismiss it as ""just another zombie flick"". This is a misunderstanding, fueled in part by prejudice.<br/><br/>I had the chance of watching the film without knowing anything about it, so my approach was as neutral as I can get. While I agree that the scenario is not perfect and that there are parts of the movie that needed some more work, 28 Days Later still remains as one of the year's best movies as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Now I've read some pretty rushed remarks on the film which positively scream ""prejudice"" and ""I haven't really seen the movie"". One magazine complained that ""undead zombies simply don't run"". The fact that we're talking about ALIVE infected people here was obviously lost on the writer. Also a previous comment mentioned that there are no victims or cars on the streets. The fact that there was an exodus, which means people took their cars and drove away (apart from those who got jammed in some places like the tunnel), combined with the fact that the infected's victims become infected themselves explains it adequately I think. As for the soldiers' morale, that's the writer's opinion on the subject and it can't be so easily dismissed, since this is a situation in which no one can rationally foretell what they would do.<br/><br/>In my opinion, 28 Days Later is quite a fresh and realistic approach to a genre that's otherwise as stale as an undead zombie (which doesn't run). There are far worse movies out there (not the least of which was The Matrix Reloaded). In short, I recommend it to mature viewers looking for something better than the usual by-the-book films."
"jdesando","Null","0","0","19 June 2003"," The best horror/zombie film since George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead, and maybe better.
","`28 Days Later,' by British director Danny Boyle (`Trainspotting'), is the best horror/zombie film since George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead, and maybe better.  The eerie set design is appropriate without being overdone (Rod Serling would have approved its restraint), the characters are real without being overwrought (especially the women, who are usually sacrificed to too much emoting), and the subtexts about contemporary crises are clear without distracting from the science fiction genre itself.<br/><br/>Experimental monkeys have transmitted a `rage virus' in England so that the population is largely decimated and the island quarantined by the rest of the world. Left in a Blade Runner/Mad Max post-apocalyptic country are a few unaffected survivors and some very badly infected `raging' zombies, reflecting Shakespeare's comment that the `strain of man's bred out into baboon and monkey.' <br/><br/>Jim (Cillian Murphy) and Selena (Naomie Harris) are 2 survivors who hook up with a family to find an army outpost near Manchester (Remember a similar setup in Romero's `Dead') for protection. <br/><br/>Not only does the film intelligently confront the old `man's -inhumanity-to-man' and `survival-of the fittest' themes, but it also glosses the meaning of life and the need for community. That Jim and Selena are different races adds to the universal quality of the film.<br/><br/>Does it include the formulaic elements of the horror genre? Yes, but with restraint: it has low-key lighting, quick cuts, and stupid moves without drawing attention to them.  The cuts give you the sense of danger and horror without forcing you to dwell on hokey or horrible effects. John Murphy's score intelligently and creatively supports and contrasts meaning and mood.<br/><br/>The spreading contagion, quickly transmitted by blood or saliva, is much like AIDS in Africa (the prominent zombie of the film is black), and the military response reminds of the worst conditions of the war in Iraq or anytime where anarchy is allowed to grow. When Jim asks, `What's the government doing about it?' the reply is `There is no government.'  Jim sums up the naïve populace response when he says, `What do you mean? There's always a government!'<br/><br/>No film this year has so entertained my grandson, Cody, and me with such humanism and suspense as `28 Days Later.' Don't wait that long to be scared and satisfied."

","Without mentioning previous ""horror"" flicks (The Omega Man, et al.), 28 Days Later is, simply put, entertaining and thought-provoking.  Perhaps people shouldn't see the movie expecting to be utterly frightened or put on the edge of their seats-- they should see the movie expecting to learn a little something about human nature and what, in essence, would really happen if we were put in certain situations.<br/><br/>Going from being alone and wandering (and for whatever reason picking up soda), Jim ends up at a church, finding that even the most holy of places has been ransacked with death.  That's where the ideas of looking to spiritual faith end and looking to human nature itself begins.  What brought me into the film wasn't the ""scary"" moments with the zombies themselves, but the insight into human instincts not only to be the hunters we have become, but also to stick together because being alone is the worst feeling imaginable.  This movie is NOT a classic horror flick (Dead Alive), but is an intellectual theatrical whose script, scenes, and actors work well to craft what is human-- survival, but not by any means necessary."

","From the director of Trainspotting and the Beach, 28 days later is a surprising horror/thriller that reminds me of the George A.Romero zombie-trilogy in more than one way. An animalrightsgroup release test-monkeys from a laboratory where the scientists have turned the monkeys into a horrible spreader of a deadly, aggressive virus named Rage. Once released the disease wipes out most of human kind in a matter of weeks. A bicycle courier who wakes up in the hospital after being unconscious for 28 days after an accident wakes up from coma and finds himself in London all by himself, having to wake up to the reality that he now must face a brutal world where most humans are dead or have become infected with Rage and he will have to fight to survive, or run for his life together with the few other survivors he meets on his way. Directed with a lot of energy and excellent acting as well as outstanding photography and great musical sequences makes one forgive the slightly disappointing developing storyline. Influences from Steven King's the Stand and the George Romero zombie movies are put to good use as the movie is at times disturbingly frightening.

We see the central character Jim (played by young Irish actor Cillian Murphy) wandering through a deserted London and looking suitably bemused by the whole experience. Accepting that there has been an apocalyptic devastation of the population, it all rolls along reasonably plausibly for the first hour or so. Jim, alone at first, teams up with some other survivors and together they fend off the rage-fuelled, zombie-like ""infected"". The acting is fine and the script is okay, and the film looks great and it has some fairly tense moments.<br/><br/>***Spoilers now***<br/><br/>But things start to go wrong when they reach the army outpost. In my opinion, the films goes totally off the rails. No satisfactory reason is offered as to why the soldiers are so malevolent, and I find their behaviour highly unbelievable. I would say the same about Jim's revenge scenario. That this mild-mannered, unarmed youth suddenly turns into a calculating, and extremely effective, killing machine smacks of the absurd. The film ends rather too quickly as well, as if the writers simply couldn't be bothered anymore.<br/><br/>Despite all that, the first two-thirds of the film is good entertainment and I would recommend it if you like the premise of people trying to come to terms with the whole post-apocalyptic thing. For this I rated it 6 out of 10, but beware because it does degenerate badly towards the end."
"scrm","Null","0","0","3 June 2003"," An excellent and thought-provoking sci-fi horror movie
","28 Days Later is an adaptation of Alex Garland's sci-fi/horror novel (yes, this is the same team that brought you The Beach). This has to be one of the most riveting and thought-provoking movies I've seen all year.<br/><br/>It is the story of Jim (played by little-known actor Cillian Murphy), who wakes from a coma in hospital to find a Britain in ruins, destroyed by a virulent plague called 'Rage' that broke out just 28 days earlier. The virus has wiped out almost all of Britain's population, while the zombie-like 'infected' stalk the streets in search of new victims to claim to the disease.<br/><br/>The entire film is shot in nicely gritty camcorder-style, which makes it look somewhat like a documentary and is very effective. The zombies are excellently captured in fast-frame motion. There are several REAL frights, but what I enjoyed most was how unexpected the whole movie was - where other movies might give you post-apocalyptic punkish idealism, 28 Days Later tells a story of survival of the spirit; where others may give you frenzied love scenes to rake in adolescent viewers, the rising sexual tension between Jim and fellow survivor Selena (Naomie Harris) in the face of all this madness provides a very human backdrop to the film.<br/><br/>The acting is spot-on throughout the movie, with a great turn by Christopher Eccleston (I won't spoil it by telling you who he plays).<br/><br/>Some images in the movie are intensely disturbing: the empty streets of London and surroundings (remember the empty New York scene in The Devil's Advocate?), an infected priest attacking Jim on a church altar, and Jim's disposing of an infected child with a baseball bat. The really hardcore material though, comes during the final third of the movie, when you realize that salvation is not at all what it seems.<br/><br/>28 Days Later succeeds where The Matrix Reloaded - bloated with style and lacking substance - failed. Even if you're not into sci-fi, I urge you to watch this."

","My favorite genre when it comes to movies definitely must be Post-apocalyptic ones or even similar ones. Dawn of the dead, The Quiet Earth, The Omega Man all great movies about people all alone on earth. 28 has a splendid first 3/4 but then it gets a bit out of hand unfortunately. The opening scenes when Jim walks through a deserted London is brilliant, it right away bring your thoughts to Vanilla Sky when Tom Cruise did the same in New York. The movie gives me a familiar and great feeling that I haven't felt for a long long time. You get chills down your spine if you imagine yourself in the same position as they are.

","At last, I have just seen this movie, I had been looking forward to it's release on DVD as I missed it when it was out in the cinema. Verdict, to quote Mr Costner, yeah neat.<br/><br/>It was certainly not the horror shocker of the year as was often billed, sadly as with most modern horror movies that give themselves this accolade, ie The Ring, Jeepers Creepers, Ghost Ship, they all fail magnificently to live up to the billing. Shame as it is still possible to make a true horror shocker, take a look at Dog Soldiers or Last Broadcast for example.<br/><br/>It would have been good to see a bit of the death and destruction actually happening after the first infections, unfortuneately the movie took the Reign of Fire route and concentrated on the post-apocolyptic aftermath and the plucky survivors. I'm sure the Director would come out with some intellectual arty reason for this, but I would put it either down to a lack of imagination or lack of budget, probably the latter owing to much of the money having to pay for the much hyped empty London scenes<br/><br/>Talking of which these scenes were quite impressive, however everything looked too clean and pristene considering the mayhem that would have happened, all we see is one upturned bus, some paper flying about and a 9/11 style lost person wall at Picadilly Circus. Hell I've seen more carnage staggering out of West End nightclubs at 6 in the morning. Still it gave the director oodles of opportunity for Product Placement.<br/><br/>On the whole I thought was an entertaining though flawed piece of work with a sometimes clumsy glossing over of detail, for example if blood was the means of passing on the infection, then surely hacking your buddy to death with a hatchett at close quarters would not be the most sensible of ideas.<br/><br/>It would have made an unmissable 4 part drama series on the BBC along the lines of the Last Train, but suffered somewhat due to the limited time-constraints of a stand alone movie."

","After an animal liberation-front releases a bunch of chimpanzees that are infected with a very contagious disease which spreads through blood and saliva, the population of England is in great danger. Everybody who's infected becomes an violent and angry 'monster' that coughs up infected blood (and move pretty fast too!) Infections occure in about 20 seconds. So it spreads pretty quick. 28 days later. A bike courier wakes up from a coma to find himself in an empty hospital. He has no idea what happened and wanders the streets of a deserted London.<br/><br/>He catches up with a few survivors and they have to find a safe place to live 'till the end of days because the 'infected' are roaming the streets wiping out the human race where-ever they go.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable movie. The images are descent. (love the deserted London shots, Worth the rental alone) But nothing i haven't seen before. What surprises me is that a lot of people think the story is original which is not. Ofcourse this movie borrows heavily from genre-classics such as Dawn of the dead but more accurate Day of the dead and also The Crazies. All movies by George A. Romero. So really nothing spectaculair or surprising new stuff here.<br/><br/>The idea of a man waking up to find himself in a deserted place or at least safe from the creatures that now inhabit the world is taken from Day of the Triffids. So what you have is a movie that is constructed with al this cool ideas taken from other movies and stories. Of course you can screw it up but luckily Boyle doesn't. It's all in good fun. But not groundbreaking. Gotta admire the DV-camerawork. And the idea of filming on DV. I love movies like this. Just as long nobody keeps yelling that 'it's so original' or 'the best movie of the year'. It's not. At least that's my opinion. But a good time-waster? Yes indeed."

","Well where do i start. A week ago i saw the 28 days teaser for the first time on the internet and found it very interesting. But since the movie hasn´t hit the big screen in germany yet, i decided to buy the uk dvd. ( the dvd is pretty good and offers a lot of specials like commentary from the director, deleted scenes, alternate ending, music video...)<br/><br/>So what do i think of this movie? This is a very good movie. The atmosphere throughout the whole movie is quite eerie and the soundtrack is simply amazing. Even if you don´t like horror movies and won´t watch 28 days, you should listen to one or two tracks of the soundtrack. The movie starts of in the deserted city of london and the first 15 minutes are Danny Boyle at his best. Man you gotta love the beginning. This is filmmaking on a very high level. Then the ""zombies"" are thrown into the story and you get some nice attack scenes with some minor gore. The zombies are done pretty well and boy, they run so fast that even Lintford Christie would go green with envy. After that we follow a small group of survivors to manchester where they are looking for a group of soldiers who claim that they have found a cure for the devastating virus...<br/><br/>
Now i´d like to correct some things which have been said about this film:<br/><br/>1. It is NOT!!! a Resident Evil rip off. Although the story might sound a bit similar, 28 days is far superior to the lame resident evil. 2. It has some gore, but it is definitely not as gruesome as many people out there want to make you believe. If you are looking for a bloodbath movie like ""Battle Royale"" stay away from this. 3. The Acting is not a let down. Ok maybe nobody will get away with an oscar here, but they surly act well enough to make the movie work. 4. The second part of the movie is a bit weaker than the first one. But since the first part is close to perfection this comes as no surprise.<br/><br/>go and watch this movie or buy the DVD. you won´t regret it.<br/><br/>8.5 / 10"

","The idea of this movie is an ancient one. All people have been reduced to walking dead out to get the few survivors (i.e. non infected). Although that's always a good thing for a horror movie, every chance is missed in this script. I do not mind the story being implausible, but then give me some good horror (and don't pretend reality). The only good thing is the cinematography. I suspect that this was why the film was made. An emptied London looks very good. You could classify it as a comedy when the surviving British soldiers make it their top priority to get women after most of their countrymen are slayed. Unfortunately it is not a good drama (weak story), not a good horror (one eye poking after at least one hour), not a good sci-fi (impossible and illogical story). It creeps up to three out of ten points for the technical quality of the film making, but in my view it was a waste of time and money. For a British movie this is worse since there is no too much money outside LA."

","At this writing, the film has not yet opened in the US, but I had an opportunity to see a press screening.  This is a very good zombie movie, in the spirit of the wonderful British horror films of the '60s (""Village of the Damned,"" ""The Day of the Triffids,"" etc.), with a touch of ""The Omega Man.""  Very scary--honestly and with a minimum of claptrap.  It's more than that, though.  It's also about how people feel and behave under such awful circumstances, and the durability and persistence of love.  I think ""28 Days Later"" deserves lots of consideration and praise."

","It has been said that people can walk a thin line between sanity and madness. What is one to do then when there is nothing to check the madness and it is unleashed in its purest most animalistic form without a hint of sanity or compassion? <P> This is the problem facing Jim (Cillian Murphy), who awakens in a hospital to find himself alone and the city of London deserted. Jim has been in a coma for the past few weeks and comes to learn that a virus has decimated the country turning people into rage obsessed killing machines who's blood and saliva infects people 10-20 seconds after contact turning them into the same. <P> The virus was the result of a lab experiment that was unleashed by some well-meaning but stubborn activists who ignored the lab staff's warnings that the animals they were trying to free are highly contagious and very dangerous. <P> Eventually Jim finds some survivors named Selena (Naomie Harris), Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns), and they team up for survival from the hordes of rage-infected hordes that often hide by day and seek out victims by night. With basic need such as food, water, electricity, and security in short supply, the group heads off in Frank's taxi towards the direction of Manchester based upon a repeating radio broadcast that offers sanctuary for anyone who can hear it and encourages them to travel to the location.<P> Up to this point, `28 Days Later' is a very intriguing and gripping film, what follows next is a bizarre yet frantic chain of events that takes the film into new directions, and leaves portions of the film open to interpretation by the audience. <P> The survivors eventually meet up with a small unit of military men who while promising protection from the hordes, soon find themselves facing new dangers and dealing with unforeseen enemies who are every bit as deadly.<P> While I will try to avoid exposing any more of the plot then I have, I found the film to be a very ambitious and unsettling work by Director Danny Boyle, who made a name for himself with such classics as `Trainspotting' and `Shallow Grave'. `28 Days Later' is at times a very violent film that shows the inner save that many believe lurks inside all of us. It seems that Boyle is drawn to stories that show the darker side of the soul and that how ordinary benevolent people can be driven to extreme actions when pushed. I found the climax of the film to be very gripping in how it showed the duality between rage that is unchecked and that, which is contained by the rules of society and restraint. But when society breaks down, the urge to survive and procreate can drive a person to their basic animal instincts. It is an interesting duality for this gripping and disturbing film. Boyle is to be commended for taking what easily could have been a typical zombie movie and producing a film that not only scares the audience, it makes them think.<P><br/><br/>3.5 stars out of 5 <P> Gareth Von Kallenbach <P> gareth@nwlink.com www.sknr.net <P> International Association of Film Critics"
"Big S-2","8","0","0","2 June 2003"," Memorable, edge-of-the-seat stuff
","I bought this movie a couple of weeks ago on DVD. Last night I sat down to watch it and it blew me away. One of the best sci-fi / horror movies I've ever seen, and when set alongside more than a few so-called Hollywood blockbusters, provides ample proof that `bigger' isn't necessarily `better'. A lot of other pundits on this page have pointed out the obvious parallels with other post-apocalyptic and `zombie' movies, but so far no-one has mentioned the superb and unfortunately rarely-shown, never-released-on-video 1970 film `No Blade Of Grass' which also depicts a `post-apocalyptic' Britain. Anyone who's seen that movie will know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>One thing that I liked about `28 Days Later' were the haunting scenes of a dead London. I love `dead city' scenes in my post-apocalypse movies, it is after all what it's all about! Here, this was apparently achieved by a clever mixture of computer effects wizardry and the good old-fashioned method of literally shutting down sections of the city (and also of the M1 motorway) for short spells at `quiet' periods very early in the morning to allow the requisite footage to be filmed. And the results are stunning. The scene of central character Jim standing on the bridge next to the Houses of Parliament in a completely deserted London is (for me anyway) up there on a par with Chuck Heston coming across the ruins of the Statue of Liberty at the end of the original `Planet Of The Apes' movie. The whole movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to end. The characters are strong, the story moves along at a decent pace and the acting by all those involved is superb. The `Infected' were seriously scary too, although I would have liked to have seen more of them in close-up, rather than so much fast-cut camerawork which unfortunately seems to be all the rage among movie-makers these days and can in some cases be quite headache-inducing. The only (minor) beef that I have with the story is that it was never explained why (apparently) millions died from the virus, yet (apparently) millions of others simply became red-eyed crazies out for blood.<br/><br/>The ending was also nicely up-beat, in contrast to the rest of the film (see the deleted scenes on the DVD extras for the much more down-beat alternative ending!). The vintage Hawker Hunter jet (with indiscernable markings) flying across the Lake District at the end was perhaps the one thing that really did betray the project's modest budget  obviously a state-of-the art RAF Tornado, a USAF F-16 or something similar would have been too expensive, as a result of which the makers had to resort to hiring a museum-piece 1950s fighter jet which resides (in real life) at Blackpool Airport! But that's a very minor quibble about an absolutely superb piece of BRITISH film-making that deserves to go down in history as a classic of its genre. Nine out of Ten!"
"Logos_Removed","Null","0","0","1 June 2003"," Not bad...
","***Possible Spoilers***<br/><br/>The beginning of the film reminded me of both John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids, and the classic Twilight Zone episode 'Where is everybody?'. All the way through this movie was reminding me of other movies, including the recent Dog Soldiers.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty old hat, but the presentation made it entertaining enough. The acting was adequate, as was the cinematography. The leitmotif of the movie seemed to be the word, 'Hello' which began the main part of the feature, surfaced throughout, and ended it nicely.<br/><br/>I suppose the movie plays on peoples fears of a biological or chemical attack from Islamic extremists. The most horrific aspect of the movie was the attitude of the soldiers in the last part. They wanted to keep the female protagonists purely to rape them, which was far more horrifying than the zombies on speed.<br/><br/>All in all, you could do worse than this movie. There are better zombie flicks out there though. Romero's Living Dead trilogy (yeah, and on that note where is part IV of that George, Twilight Of The Dead?), any Fulcio zombie flick, and Bava's Demons and Demons II.<br/><br/>I give this movie 6 out of 10."

","This gore fest has its roots firmly in many zombie flicks. I have to say its about 80% a great film but fall apart with shoddy over-emphasis in the script being played out at the deserted manor house. That scene should have been cut down and another one added after. I had had enough of the manor house after about 15 mins, why not have more of City scenes outside London or indeed England.The emptiness was quite haunting, I can see it now Deserted Ports, empty football stadiums, train stations, with trains waiting(hey they could Joy-ride all sorts of transport, Jumbo jets!!) And why didn't they got to the nearest army camp and get themselves armed properly, RPG's, Guns and explosives. Oh yes I can see  a cycle of Beautiful arty shots of the deserted public places  and the countryside blending into brutal barberry of the unfortunate zombies. Sorry gone off on one there.<br/><br/>Anyway the real film, certainly was better than most you will see these days (or in 28 days time) and it really did have my heart pounding (not sure if it was the film or the cocktail of 3 lts of Coke, large Chocolate bar and Popcorn) but either way go and watch it if you like the idea of an empty London (No slow moving packs of Tourists, no guide busses, no Taxi's unwilling to take you South off the river)full over flesh eating Zombies.<br/><br/>Only have one question.Why is the main character naked at the beginning in Hospital? Is it some criticism of the NHS not having enough blankets? British Directors often think this is some sort of Arty thought provoking comment. If you find women attractive the last thing you want to be confronted by at the beginning of film your looking forward to watching is that. It was very unnecessary and would have be bemoaned to the ends of the earth had it been a woman.<br/><br/>Close your eyes for the first 30 seconds and you might want to do so later on in the movie as well.

I won't mention all the good or bad things in the film as I believe they have been covered already but what disturbed me, was the scene with the soldier chained to the radiator talking to Jim about the UK under quarantine ..... then when Jim looks up at the sky and see the high altitude aircraft,  is there life outside the British Isles ?????  Has the UK been 'quarantined', is this the REAL sub-plot of the film ? Would the United Nations(?) seal off a country without aid and let its population die if this scenario really happened ?<br/><br/>

","...of COURSE this film is a complete rip off of Resident Evil! Obviously Resident Evil is such a great film that the maker of Trainspotting has to plagiarise from it! hahahahahaha (spot the sarcasm)<br/><br/>Silliness aside, I think that any film that involves a small group of people being attacked by greater numbers of different people/undead/infected while the protagonists hide in a series of places or one specific place has any number of parallels with any number of previous films. The only difference is that somehow the horror audience is more prone to scream about it. If you're so hung up on this film being a rip off of Resident Evil or Dawn Of the Dead or The Omega Man then why don't you mention Assault On Precinct 13 too? Group of people, attacked by seemingly unstoppable enemies who'll stop at nothing to kill them? Come on, Assault on Precinct 13 was a remake of Rio Bravo crossed with Night Of The Living Dead, but let's not cry about it. Put your hankies away.<br/><br/>Moving onto a constructive criticism. POSSIBLE SPOILERS This film is designed to scare people. As someone who teaches Horror as part of a Media Studies course, I think that I'll use this film next year along with Nosferatu, Dracula (Universal), Dracula (Hammer), Psycho, Blacula, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Dawn Of The Dead, The Shining, Re-Animator, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Se7en and Scream.<br/><br/>I sense hands raising to faces, bacon sandwiches being dropped, and sharp intakes of breath. You demand an explanation, I'm sure, so let me elaborate. All of the films that I teach are relevant within the horror genre. They all represent certain times and places and attitudes. You can NEVER have a film that doesn't reflect times and places and attitudes. As the man once said, the past is a perfect looking glass to the present. Look at Nosferatu, Universal Dracula, Hammer Dracula, Blacula and Bram Stoker's Dracula. All inspired by the same text, but all very, VERY different. Society and technology make change inevitable. By this rationale, I'll use 28 Days Later as an example of a time and place. If I was to take a poll of the public in the UK about what scares them the most, I reckon that (although this is a wild guess), the following topics would be included.<br/><br/>* Catching a deadly disease (AIDS, possibly SARS, maybe CJD); an outbreak of a disease that there is no known cure for * Complete anarchy in place of society * Military taking over * Invasion of the home by 'undesirables' * Physical attack / rape / invasion of self * Destruction of the _chosen_ family unit * Complete loss of government OR power structure<br/><br/>With this in mind, look at the themes and plot twists in 28 Days Later. See how carefully they are tailored to a specifically contemporary audience (i.e. someone watching it today). So what if there are a couple of plat holes? Any one of the films that I already teach have plot holes. After watching the above films with a different group of 18 year olds (who are often initially under duress about wathing them) for three years on the trot, sometimes with two groups in a year, you realise that there aren't many films without plot holes. Look at the pros rather than the cons: what was achieved despite lack of budget. The effectiveness of the 'infected'. The 'nods' (not plagiarised, merely referenced) to previous films, showing a respect for the films that inspired it rather than a complete rip-off mentality (I refer specifically to the refuelling scene that strongly echoes Dawn Of The Dead, even down to the killing of a child). But the overall effectiveness of the film can't be denied - even the detractors from the film in this review section admit that there are moments of great power. Just try to look at it objectively. And if all else fails, remember that it's only a film. Don't take it to heart....it was all acted and directed and written....and actors, writers and directors are only human."

However 28 Days later really surprised me, from the grim opening shots of London as a wasteland it grabs you by the jugular. <br/><br/>Alot of things have been ""borrowed"" from other sci/fi horror movies most notably George Romero zombie films but 28 days still feels fresh.

","Truly gruesome and a must for anyone that likes seeing a rag-tag band of survivors fend off crazed, murderous, and highly infectious maniacs while exploring the true meaning of humanity!

I found this film to be haunting and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Although this movie appears to borrow heavily from Romero's pictures, I would say that this movie is distinctly different enough to stand on its own.  Boyle's movie seems to spend most of its time exploring the philosophical issues surrounding how Man lived and how they live in the face of this epidemic.  It appears what makes monsters so frightening are the traits that we see displayed almost daily from people all over the world. If anything, both ""28 Days Later"" and Romero's zombie movies are the direct product of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"".  It would have been interesting to see Boyle take on `I Am Legend' (A disease turns everyone into vampires save one man.  The sole survivor spends his time hunting vampires and looking for a cure, but from the perspective of the vampires he is the monster - the movie `Omega Man' was a very poor adaptation). Regardless of 28 Days Later's origin, it will keep you disturb and entertained!"

","An apocalyptic vision of human society destroyed by a pandemic virus. Man-made or natural we all fear the possibility of such a biological time bomb. In times of survival I'd hope people would put their discriminations aside and function cooperatively. However human nature dictates that egos will inevitably clash. The challenge of communal living or the acceptance of leadership is more frightening than the raging zombies in this movie. It seems that human beings are experts at unwittingly trapping themselves.<br/><br/>Maybe the story did steal from a million other films  which film doesn't? I don't care, even if 'Omega man' did get their first. This is better than the bitterly disappointing reign of fire'. The film wins out because it blends genres, has a good story and a great cast and director. Some of the imagery is spellbinding. I didn't get bored or tired with the action or inaction. It may have its faults but overall it's definitely worth a watch."

"parker_digital","Null","0","0","20 May 2003"," A post-apocalyptic horror movie for the 21st century
","On paper this movie seemed like a brilliant idea - one of the most talented British directors of recent years making a post-apocalyptic horror movie for the 21st century. But even though this stands out from the crowd of mostly dumb, formulaic horror flicks that we've endured in recent years, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed by it.<br/><br/>Technically, this isn't the zombie movie many have labelled it as, since the movie's `infected' aren't actually dead - they're just seriously angry, to the point where they want to eat people. And while the script borrows heavily from classics such as `Night Of The Living Dead' and `Day Of The Triffids', here the monsters don't just stumble along in the hope of falling upon juicy humans, they can run really fast. Some critics have deemed this silly - but as I've already pointed out, the `infected' aren't actually dead, so why shouldn't they be able to run?  In most movies of this kind, where the 'zombies' are actually dead, there is never any satisfactory explanation for why dead people should suddenly start walking around hankering after human brains. In this respect, `28 Days Later' provides one of the more credible and well thought out storylines of the genre.<br/><br/>All the best horror movies are made on low budgets, and `28 Days Later' continues this tradition (although I'm sure Danny Boyle and co. would've appreciated a few more millions for the production). It's shot entirely on digital video, which as well as giving the whole movie a suitably gritty look, adds a kind of raw edge to the action sequences, because of the way digital media responds to quick movements.<br/><br/>The main problem though, is that there isn't much here that hasn't already been done. Many scenes can easily be traced back to other movies; the scene early on where Jim wakes up in a deserted hospital is straight out of `Day Of The Triffids' for example, and the last third of the film is set in a big house under siege from the `infected' - very similar to the plot of `Night Of The Living Dead'.<br/><br/>This isn't as seminal as say, `Trainspotting', or even as sharply directed as `Shallow Grave', but for fans of the genre, it's definitely worth a look."

","28 days later is an updated version of classic zombie films of many moons ago and it is worth popping your brain into neutral to enjoy this humdinger of a movie. Danny Boyle (trainspotting, shallow grave) returns to form with a streamline bullet of a film with a tale of fear and hope in an eerily empty London. I found the film had an energy not often seen in this genre, at times it was touching and beautiful whilst at other times Boyle goes to town with the spilling of claret throughout the cast. This is a film that would not disgrace your collection as it is quite unlike anything else released in years.

The story follows Jim trying to get-to-grips with this new reality, making the 'Real World' of 'The Matrix' seem petty in comparison. Jim (with the aid of a Pepsi endorsement)learns more about the genetically-engineered virus simply called 'Rage' and how it can be transferred via bodily fluid (blood, saliva etc.) converting the unfortunate party into a 'super-zombie' capable of much more than merely groaning and biting (which they still do - only faster.)With the help of 'Selena' (who 'Jim' falls in love with) he avoids contracting 'Rage' and fights to stay alive by raiding shops for food and joining a military camp - defending themselves from 'the infected.'<br/><br/>For the budget allotted - this film was brilliant with a variety of surprises, laughs and moments of silent tension.<br/><br/>Life ain't a beach when you are being persued by running, climbing and jumping zombies.

(keep an ear for the sound, the soundtrack is brilliant and appropriate and the sound effects, well, creepy to say the least..)<br/><br/>Technically, the movie was brilliantly constructed, the fast shutter speed gave the movie a new dimension where every detail, every move had a new meaning, we could see the rain drops falling, or the blood drops rising from the slashed bodies in beautiful texture and perfection.

","Big budget horror films do have the great asset of allowing you to watch A-list film stars being gutted like fish, preferably after whimpering in a very embarrassing fashion. Apart from that, they are generally rubbish and usually the biggest star survives which always leaves a bad taste in the mouth. 28 Days Later has neither stars nor a budget, so that makes for a promising start.<br/><br/>
After a short prologue showing a terrible virus being released we go forward 28 days to find London virtually deserted, with no congestion charge in sight, bar roaming bunches of psychotic zombies who are affected by particularly bad red eye. The only hope a small group of survivors have is a recorded message from Manchester promising salvation. So they take their chances and head north.<br/><br/>
Thanks to some canny traffic marshalling and a shooting schedule that would make reality TV producers weep, the film opens with some startling scenes of a lone survivor wandering around empty London streets. The same trick was used in New York in Vanilla Sky but the graininess of the footage combined with the non-American surroundings make the sequence seem more powerful and unsettling.<br/><br/>
Whilst the visuals do look murky and chunky at times the decision to use digital video leads to a greater sense of immediacy in the film, without ever sinking to reality TV clichés. The characters still walk into dark enclosed spaces (why do they never learn?), but we are not over burdened with fatuous sub plots or laboured back stories. The deftness of the writing makes it seem a tragedy that Alex Garland can no longer drag him away from his X-box long enough to write a shopping list let alone a new novel. He could at least have got a PS2 with the amount he has earnt.<br/><br/>
The film could be tagged as a consolidation for Danny Boyle, whose reputation has stalled since Trainspotting. however as good as this well executed genre fare is, it never tracends it's origins and smacks of great talent merely passing the time."

","This film is one of my faves. It is very fast, slick and clever. Boyle said he wanted to get a ""ken loach"" factor, meaning he wanted great human characters as well as gung-ho action scenes. I think he did this AND still managed to leave us with hundreds of un-answered questions. Just how much of the world has been affected? what will the authorities do when the survivors are picked up? why did the 'infected' co-operate in packs but not attack each other? why did the 'infected' become nocturnal? Why in a city that has been panic-evacuated is the only traffic blockage in a tunnel? If you can suspend yourself long enough to get past these questions and relax into the film you will have a very entertaining time. Hi points include the shopping montage and the first empty walk through london. I also loved the little touches, like the lime pit full of half decomposed bodies, the 9/11 reference in the notice boards covered in 'have you seen....' letters and the fact that the signal to the jet at the end said ""Hello"", rather than the obvious and cliched ""Help"" (they didn't need any)<br/><br/>

Danny Boyle previously hit the vein (pardon the pun) with the fabulous ""Trainspotting"" but now he has finally produced something that a horror fan as hardcore as myself can appreciate.<br/><br/>The setting is London, devastated by a rage-inducing virus unleashed by unwitting but well-meaning animal activists (like the recent mink release that devestated our wildlife).  The virus spreads fast and no-one is immune - simply because no-one is immune to natural rage.  The infected turn on the uninfected - ignoring their counterparts as did the zombies in the Dead Trilogy by Romero.  Our two heroes (there were three but one was swiftly put out of his misery after a blistering attack by the infected) join up with a pleasant chap and his daughter and head north to a supposed safe outpost manned by troops.  On the way they risk life and limb but encounter some peace in the countryside.<br/><br/>Once at the outpost all hell breaks loose and the action is fast-paced and satisfyingly graphic.  There are few quiet moments in this film but those that are present are moving and beutiful (Jim's grief at his dead parents and the horses at the countryside ruin) and the whole film is one of the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Those that are vacuous enough only to like big production values and big names should steer clear.

Into this changed world, we follow Cillian Murphy's Jim as he wakes up in hospital, unaware, adjusts and tries to survive with a handful of people that have found a way to fight back.<br/><br/>This film pulls no punches and makes no excuses - if you dont buy into the concept, its not going to make it easy for you. If you do, it will rock your world. The early vision of a deserted london is epic and eerie thanks to the rough footage which gives the feel of waking from a drunken sleep mixed with cctv footage. Straight away, we know this is going to be a bloody ride, from the screeching and butchering of the chimps, into Jim's self-defense in a zombie-filled church by beating a former priest round the head, then into the attacking zombies getting napalmed with molotovs by his rescuers. And it barely lets up, getting more messed up and more violent...<br/><br/>But there is time to look at what it would be like to live in a world where everyone you've ever known or loved is dead, not knowing how far it spread and whether there is any point in going on. There are occasional touching moments, particularly in the main duo's relationship with a man and his daughter who are holed up in a high-rise building. The focus of the film is their journey together to find other survivors, and is humorous and wonderfully acted, particularly by Murphy and the ever-reliable Brendan Gleeson.<br/><br/>But whenever the film threatens to slow-down, brighten up or ponder, it bursts into violent, shocking action. There are twists and uncomfortable concepts every few minutes and the final act builds to a loud, bloody crescendo which is very unsettling. The only real gripe is with the film's bookends - the aforementioned prologue and a coda which, while necessary, borders on phoney.<br/><br/>All in all, its a real ride and while it does kick up some interesting ideas, its main goal is to entertain, shock and unsettle and it does all three in equal measure. On this evidence, Danny Boyle is finally living up to the promise he showed in Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. For my money, this is his best yet."

","I will briefly sum up my thoughts on '28 Days Later'. This is a movie which I suspect might not be a favourite with the Americans. For a start there are no American characters.What? Yes, so it must be rubbish, right? It's not a new idea there was a similar movie starring Charlton Heston 'The Omega Man' from 1971 which concerned a virus. A truly British sci-fi/horror, it is unusual to see places I've been to and recognize on the big screen. London was deserted, fascinating to see. The lead character was Irish and the fact that Manchester was burnt to a crisp, an example of what happens when nobody is around to take action, especially in light of the recent fire fighter strikes sent a shiver down my spine. While the plot may well have been predictable enough, the action and characters sustained more than enough interest to keep me glued. This is certainly worth watching."

","Not a big zombie movie fan but saw this to see what it looked like. Tho' the last time I saw a film to see what the technology looked like on the screen - Rohmer's the Lady and the Duke - I was disappointed. This was pretty good and looked great. The London scenes were impressive/amazing. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a film in two parts (potential spoilers) with the second half being in a manor house taken over by a group of soldiers. with lots of running around reminiscent of Blade Runner. sure, they had to get out of London, but it became predictable after that. and they could have gotten out of London quicker and had a bit more character development once they'd gotten to the Manor house (the character development was poor overall. the only really strong character, the female protag, had all her credibility thrown away at the end when she kisses the blood soaked male protag). Alex Garland (the writer), Danny Boyle (the director) and Andrew MacDonald (the producer) spoke after the screening. Mr.Garland stated that he enjoyed smoking then seeing films like the day of the triffids and the living dead when he was young. and thus was writing a film for himself when he was 18. not sure I would have wanted to see 28 days later after smoking... He also noted that he thought the film was better for the plot holes/lack of polish in the writing. I don't agree with this. there were two expositional scenes planted late in the film which stood out like a sore thumb. they seemed to be, just when you're wondering about a major plot hole, a scene was added to explain it away. the exposition should have been dealt with earlier/quicker, in my opinion. He also noted that a scene with people trying to escape by plane at an overcrowded airport was cut for cost reasons. sounded like a good scene. Overall, it worked. Story reminded me a little of Jeff Noon's ""Vurt""."

","The one thing about this entire movie which makes you sit up in your chair or even slump down in avoidance is the overwhelming feeling of emptiness and initial feeling of lonliness. As Jim walks around central London completely alone the audience begins to feel an air of unease. The scariest thing is that in the back of your mind you beleive that some day this could happen.<br/><br/>
The movie has taken fair amounts of criticism and prise for the way Danny Boyle decided to shoot the movie Digitally. To me this was a masterstroke, it creates a feeling of unease in the sense its all a little uncomfortable and goes well with the flow of the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that I feel let the movie down was he soldiers toward the end of the film. They were TOO squaddie like in the sense they were overbearingly boyish. I have friends in the army i know what theyre like and even they arent that obnoxious.<br/><br/>The cast do well with a good script and a brilliant concept, one that I think is amongst the best ideas to come out of the movie world for a long time. Its an old adage, ""Virus wipes out the population"" but the way it was done this time in ""28 Days Later"" had a different feel to the virus movie genre.<br/><br/>I think this movie is the best British film since ""Trainspotting"", another Boyle masterpeice. I highly recommend it to anybody and if you are one of those people like me who were interested but didnt go and see it immediately, I strongly suggest you do.<br/><br/>Rating 9/10"

","I can't find the words to write a compelling review so I'm just going to list my favourite parts. Please don't read on if you haven't already seen the film. Avoid all spoilers and go and watch it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Firstly, the opening scenes in London were fantastic. It must have been a mammoth task to portray a huge city like that as deserted but they pulled it off. I couldn't understand the double decker though. How would you tip one of those? :-)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The part when Jim enters the church sent chills down my spine. On the one hand I knew something would happen if he said anything but the look on the faces of the two infected springing up when he said `Hello' was inhuman and savage. It was an excellent way to introduce these monsters. Having an infected priest was also an inspired move.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The threesome's visit to Jim's parents house was beautiful. The note he found on the back of the photo especially.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Selina's brutal and heartless slaying of Mark was a brilliant twist. His response when she pounced made you feel sorry for him (a `wait' and then screams of pain) although it was obvious he had been infected.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The introduction of Frank and Hannah got my heart pumping. The last thing you would want to see when you are being chased up some stairs is a frightening looking figure at the top but his direction to them made me smile.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As soon as I saw them enter the tunnel I knew something was going to happen. The movement of the shadows down the tunnel was brilliant. As was the idea to have the rats included.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jim's disgust at the carnage in the cafÃ© and his actions on the perpetrator were well portrayed. I was unhappy that the scriptwriter decided to have him go in there but I suppose when you seemingly have nothing to live for you make stupid decisions. This scene added to the tension factor of the whole movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Someone else has already mentioned it but their stay overnight at those ruins was unbearably tense. I felt uncomfortable watching it and was relieved when they finally left. The dream Jim had was a nice touch at that point.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I may be biased but I really like the part where they reach the barricade. Although this is supposed to be near Manchester, I immediately recognised it as Junction 32 of the M6 near Preston.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Although the whole Army part of the movie was a little out of sorts with the rest of it there were some good bits. When Major West tells Jim `I promised them women' and where Selina tells Hannah `I'm making you not care'.  Seeing that Corporal meet a nasty end was satisfying too.</li></ul><br/><br/>There were just a few things which weren't quite right:<br/><br/><ul><li>The lab assistant was unbelievable simply due the fact that I recognised him as Tony Hayes from I'm Alan Partridge. I couldn't really stop thinking about that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A few flashbacks of the television reports from Selina would've been nice. It was done in the Omega Man and worked very well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They had a helicopter at the barricade. Someone could've flown to Ireland or the Isle of Man to escape the horror. Well, maybe not, I suppose no-one knew if the infection had spread or not.</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all this was a fantastic film and the kind of nightmare vision I have been waiting for. After Dawn of the Dead, The Stand and others such as Mad Max, this is an excellent and truly terrifying film. As soon as I can I will pre-order this on DVD, turn off the lights and enjoy the tension!"
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","0","0","1 December 2002"," just a stupid zombie flick....
","This movie is quite popular in Britain, mainly on behalf of its director. Take out the fame factor or the Brit factor and all you're left with is yet another stupid zombie movie. <br/><br/>Let's look at the ingredients: * totally whacked out explanation? Check. A disease that turns people from human to monster in 10 seconds is just as ridiculous as any other explanation ever given <br/><br/>* gory violence? Check and double check and triple check. Blood vomitting, machete-chopping, eyepopping violence galore. <br/><br/>* a few (ill-defined) characters fighting against an army of monsters? Sure.<br/><br/>
* high body count? Check <br/><br/>
* predictable? Check <br/><br/>* you can see who will survive a mile off? Check. <br/><br/>
So, how does it compare with Night of the Living Dead, Resident Evil, From Dusk Till Dawn and other such stuff? It comes out halfway between NoftLD and Dusk till Dawn. The zombies have speed, and that's their main difference from other zombies (turning them, effectively, into something halfway between zombies and vampires).<br/><br/>There are a few things that irk me, though. For example, the visual style may appeal to some, but to me it just completely ruined the movie. Ultra fast cuts, grainy, colour-deflated pictures, and a disappointing ""made for TV"" feel do not make a good visual experience, in my opinion. If this is digital video, and judging the technology by ""Hotel"" and ""Centre of the World"" for comparison, then it's clear that it is just a fad of the moment with no future. Perhaps digital cinematography is capable of brilliance (Attack of the Clones), but currently, it simply seems to be a sorry excuse for using cheap cameras to get a result of slightly-better-than-TV picture quality, but with little appeal to the eye on a cinema screen. Give me back traditional cinema cameras any day...<br/><br/>Then there's the music, which in at least two scenes starts out quietly only to drone on until it is unbearably noisy, and totally, totally out of place. (Well, in the climactic slaughtering it's less out of place than in the first few scenes).<br/><br/>And on the predictability issue, I challenge anyone to claim they could not see the hidden motives of the soldiers from the first moment they appeared... It was quite obvious indeed.<br/><br/>All in all, something for zombie movie fans, but just cinematic junk for most others. Might be bearable on a small screen.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Its been a while since we had a decent horror film, horror has been bogged down with the SCREAM self referential ""knowing of itself"" that has diluted the genre for the past few years. So it is refreshing to see a horror film like 28 DAYS LATER which takes its subject seriously, and intelligently. While some reviews in this user section have led to believe that the film is another dumb horror film, that is completely wrong. What the film is, is an intelligent horror film that reminds you of the George Romero living dead trilogy that fuses horror with social comment. The social comment in this film is that the virus that wipes out most of the united kingdom, called rage, is inherent in all of us, much emphasised in the films final scenes, which i dont want to give away. The emphasis on throwing its central character into a situation that he has no idea of what is happening, refers to Romeros living dead films where the characters are thrown into a situation that they cant understand yet they have one basic desire , the desire to survive. The opening scenes, played to the soundtrack of canadian band godspeed you! black emperor, of a deserted empty London are amazing and hanunting. Do see this film as it is one of the best of the year, and along with Dog soldiers, is one of the best british horror films of the year, and of all time."

","I was told I'd hate this film, because everyone who had already seen it had been so built up by the hype all they could do was pick at it. True, 28 Days Later is not up to Boyle's style of Trainspotting- but as post apocolyptic films go I would say this is the best I've seen, far better than the american drivel forced upon us in the past few years. The use of music, the styles of the shots and the overall theme of despair was so unique- this is clearly a film to question our morals and people go to cinemas to be entertained don't they? What is 28 Days Later if it's not entertainment? Danny Boyle was trying to show us what a surreal situation these characters are in- everything that you question about this film he's done for a reason. The empty streets were to show Jim's feelings of isolation, the naked Jim adds a sense of mystery (true in reality he's be lying in his excrement- but who wants to see that? Not me)making the audience question what might happen in this film, and the soldiers wanting to rape a 14 year old girl shows an example of how society has been turned upside down. There were only two things i didn't like about this film- the dinner scene with the soldiers all laughing and joking and the ending (but then how do you end a film like this?) I think Danny Boyle did a good job. So there."
"thellers","Null","0","0","26 November 2002"," Better-than-average horror film with a little brains and plenty of brutal gore.
","**Warning - possible spoilers (minor)**<br/><br/>There are some reviews around that would have you believe this is a piece of brainless, low-budget, uninspired tosh. I can tell you now this film is none of those things. This is a movie that really deserves 2 hours or so of your attention; it really is worth watching.<br/><br/>There are several flaws in this film, but nothing as bad as any you would find in your average Hollywood no-brainer.<br/><br/>The acting is OK - Eccleston, Murphy and Gleeson were good, while Naomie Harris's performance was passable. Megan Burns (Hannah), however, gave one of (if not THE) worst performances I have ever seen. Her 'acting' was absolutely awful - the kind of wooden word-delivery that footballers, pop stars or other non-acting celebs sometimes give when called upon to deliver lines in cameo roles.<br/><br/>The premise of the film was good, if not entirely original; the opening few minutes of a deserted London were cinematic bliss, although I feel it was the subject, rather than any brilliance in cinematography that did the trick here.<br/><br/>The 'holes' in the plot are much debated, and while the story does tend to raise a lot of question along the way, I didn't find anything that couldn't be ratified with a little imagination, common sense and a smidgeon of the old suspension-of-disbelief. The only issue I really had trouble coming to terms with was the abundance of abandoned traffic in the Blackwall tunnel, while there was a total absence of traffic anywhere else in the movie.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is far inferior to the excellent opening, but is still entertaining enough. Naomie Harris's Selena character takes a disappointing turn from a machete-wielding ass-kicking independent woman to a slushy love-interest for the main character... It seems logical that the character had been normal before the ""28 days"" events and this was the ""normal"" Selena showing through, but the sheer brutality of the character in the opening 30 minutes (particularly the cold-blooded machete killing of her possibly-infected compatriot--some of the best movie violence I have ever seen) makes the character a little hard to deal with.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a fresh and interesting addition to the horror genre - a genre which isn't best known for its intellect. Don't let the fact that this is a British movie, or that it is a Danny Boyle film, make you expect too much of a high-brow thinker of a film--you'll be disappointed. 28 Days Later is a better-than-average horror film with a little brains and plenty of brutal gore.<br/><br/>Go see it and make up your own mind."

","I wanted to like this film a lot, being a bit of a fan of the post-apocalypse genre.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it doesn't start well at all. There is no adequate explanation of the reason for the creation of the virus at the lab. The lab appears civilian rather than military, which given the nature of the virus is highly unlikely.<br/><br/>The virus given it's effects, method of transmission, apparent 100% infection rate after transmission and near instantaneous incubation time would have level 3 (possibly 4) biohazard containment at the lab. What we see in the film (a metal swipe card door which didn't look airtight and readily openable cages for infected animals) doesn't come close.<br/><br/>Security at the lab (even assuming it is civilian) is unrealisticly lax. The lab technician even calls security to alert them giving a partial location to no apparent effect.<br/><br/>How at least one of the infected or the infected chimp actually gets out of the lab to infect the rest of the UK also isn't dealt with. Given their reduced intelligence, lack of transport, obvious infected appearance and alerted lab security, for one or the chimp to get out seems unlikely (though given the lax security maybe not).<br/><br/>We never learn how the rest of the UK actually gets infected so rapidly to the point that civilisation collapses within 28 days. Given the limited number of infected, their reduced intelligence, lack of transport, the method of transmission and the obvious appearance of the infected it is very difficult to imagine how the infection could spread quickly (particularly initially when there are few infected) and out of localised areas as the infected are apparently reliant on walking. Any uninfected person on seeing an infected person is going to try to escape from or kill an infected and inform the authorities who are very likely to quarantine the entire area. We can only assume the initial response of authority was as lax and ineffective as the lab security.<br/><br/>Assuming you can suspend disbelief regarding the above what follows is a film of two halves. The first is good and the deserted London is well done, in particular the street scenes. The lack of bodies seems odd, presumably the limited filming time windows on the streets didn't allow time for them to be placed.<br/><br/>I thought the scene at the Jim's parents house on finding his parents was particularly moving.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film nosedives in the second half when the characters try to leave London. The decision to use the tunnel and continue to use it on finding it blocked is ridiculous. As is Jim's decision to investigate a deserted transport cafe. The characters seem to want to expose themselves to other unnecessary risks too.<br/><br/>The motorways seem peculiarly free of abandoned vehicles and the motorway in front of the blockade is unaccountably so.<br/><br/>The decision to dispose of Frank by getting him infected in a particularly unlikely manner seemed uninspired, since I felt he was one of the better characters.<br/><br/>The soldiers were with the exception of the Major and Sergeant horribly stereotyped caricatures. The idea that military discipline could slip so much so rapidly extremely implausible, again like so much of this film. Some of the soldiers dialogue was very unconvincing and unrealistic. I think the less said about this part of the film the better.<br/><br/>The ending gives the impresssion of being tacked on. As I believe it was following test audience reaction to the original ending.<br/><br/>Overall a film of interesting ideas that could have been made a lot more plausible in various ways and could have been a lot better."

","*Warning: Contains Spoilers.<br/><br/>Just seeing the Infected in the church sit up with a guttural exclamation of surprise to Jim's ""Hello?"" was the first intestinal wrench of what could have been a classic but was very much like the film it ripped off/ paid tribute to, Day of the Dead in that it was flawed and full of cavernous plot-related screw ups.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the Animal Liberation Front misguidedly releasing a rage-infected monkey that attacks and passes the disease to one of their own sets a watermark that sadly ebbs and rises as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Up until Selena and Mark come upon us the film is great and catches your breath from the opening scene, thru the car alarm to the petrol station explosion. Mark's ""joke"" then sees the movie lapse into soap opera-esque exposition and lame acting briefly shaken into life by Selena's brutal, cold-blooded murder of a possibly infected Mark.<br/><br/>While this was a true choker of a twist the fact that Selena is later seen burning through a supermarket on a trolley like a 10 year old doesn't tally.<br/><br/>Plot holes are myriad: where are the all the dead bodies; if England is under quarantine where did everyone go in one month; why don't the infected attack each other, why is it safe to move around by day etc, etc.<br/><br/>Most annoying of all is Selena's transmogrification from misanthropic self-preservationist to tactile vulnerable damsel in the space of 3 days without apparent reason.<br/><br/>Flashes of genius are there to be witnessed. The much ballyhooed desolated London is cinematically orgasmic, rats fleeing in terror from the Infected is bottled adrenaline, the soldier cowering in a cupboard from his Infected comrades grabs you by the testes and Jim gouging the eyes out of a really horrible squaddie that you just PRAYED was going to get what he deserved hits where it should but unfortunately there is equally as much bad as good.<br/><br/>The script really should have been polished up before being handed over. The plot holes are so numerous you could call it a cheese and the acting of Megan Burns is right out of a school nativity play.<br/><br/>The final sequence is so like Romero's Day of the Dead it should have been mentioned as ""Based on..."" in the credits. This isn't a bad thing though as the final scene in the mansion is the best the film has to offer. The site of an infected soldier staring in puzzlement at his own reflection is truly horrible and Christopher Eccleston's mournful ""You killed my boys"" is ironically touching.<br/><br/>Trainspotting has yet to be equalled I'm afraid."

Walk into darkened areas alone shouting `hello', go for walks in the country, take valium to sleep all night, leave their weaponry to run around naked smelling of fresh blood. The characters contradict themselves on many occasions, and the hero just bumbles around pathetically. I shook my head in disbelief more times than I did for teen slasher flicks. There are some nice effects however, and the make up and filming are well done, even if the quality of the digital filming leaves a lot to be desired sometimes.

The ""verite"" camera work is shaky and imprecise meaning that half the time it is impossible to tell what is going on (not helped by very poor lighting). The acting too is pretty uninspired, especially the teenage girl who is quite terrible.

But it was nowhere near as ""bad"" on that front.

","Contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Just a quick question. At the end of the movie they spell out 'hello' on the ground and see the aircraft. I think this implies that the virus hasn't in fact spread around the globe. But the weird thing about all this is that why is the aircraft in Finnish army colors and when we hear the pilot talking, he speaks Finnish and at the end says: ""send a helicopter"". There were no subtitles in English for this part (at least in the cinema where I went to see it).<br/><br/>Finland isn't even a member state of NATO, so why would they send an aircraft to England. That would be the first time ever. Does this mean that the virus has actually spread worldwide, but Finland was spared?

","A capable addition to the ""post-apocalyptic"" genre, 28 Days Later is an disturbing and frightening film, despite a number of plot holes.<br/><br/>The early scenes of a deserted and abandoned London are masterfully done and add to the sense of unease.  Regardless of the unwarranted critiscm of ""product-placement"" it is vital to maintain our believe in the realism of what we are seeing.  The lack of a known cast (with the exception of Christopher Eccleston) adds to the impact of ""normality gone wrong.""<br/><br/>Building up the disturbing sensation for me were the scenes in the north of England, where motorway signs were clearly recognisable as those near Preston, even though the actual location was elsewhere and didn't match the plot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film is somewhat let down by a poor script and some duff acting.  Megan Burns' portrayal of Hannah is as wooden as they come.<br/><br/>Overall, the film will leave you thinking and a little sleepless!!<br/><br/>7/10"

"Jamesgraphics","Null","0","0","13 November 2002"," One major problem...
","There is one major problem with this movie. It's not the list of glitches that seem to be preoccupy the thoughts of most people on the message board.<br/><br/>
Yes, the plot has more holes than a Swedish porn movie, but this is a genre film and it's the excitement that matters, not the scientific plausibility.<br/><br/>
Very minor **SPOILERS** ahead:<br/><br/>The film's major flaw is in it's basic plot. Most films of this nature (i.e. apocalyptic horror movies) tend to have a somewhat episodic plot structure. However, in '28 Days Later...', the sudden change in the story arc when the characters reach Manchester infects the story quicker than the drop of blood that lands in Fank's eye.<br/><br/>The main problem that this change in scenario causes is that it completely shifts the overall values and themes of the film, giving it the feel of two halves welded together, like a dodgy used car. <br/><br/>Both halves of this film are interesting (though the first one is by far the best) but they aren't happy bed fellows. It's a shame, because there's some surprisingly sensitive moments, and some stunning imagery. They just don't belong in the same film. <br/><br/>All in all this is still a film that's well worth watching, particularly for horror fans. What's frustrating is that it could have been a whole lot better. 6.5/10"

","Ratings: * (Terrible) * * (Below Average))* * * (Not Bad) * * * * (Good) * * * * * (Brilliant)<br/><br/>WARNING * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * I have just returned from seeing the latest offering from British director Danny Boyle. The man who brought us the stylish scots drug movie Trainspotting has now brought his style of direction to the Horror/Sci-fi genre. 28 Days later is by all accounts a reworking of the cult sixties movie 'The Omega man'. That said it is quite different although there are a few simalaraties. A haunting and poetic movie performed by a largely unknown cast(With a few exceptions. eg. Christopher Eccleston). The movie tells the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy). A young man who awakes from a coma in a hospital stark naked. Emerging from the hospital he finds the whole of London to be very much deserted. The scene where our hero wanders aimlessly through the barren streets is captured beautifully by Boyle and is a testement to the speed and professionalism it took to shoot. Apparently the scene had to be shot under a minute. As the movie moves along Jim falls in with a young black woman (The love interest in 'The Omega Man' was black) named Selena (Naomi Harris). She tells Jim of the virus that has descimated the world leaving few survivors. Those that have been infected have either died or become Zombies (In 'The Omega Man' they were Mutants). They are referred to throughout the movie as 'The Infected'. As the story continues our characters meet a selection of different people. Notably the London Taxi driver Frank (brendon Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). What takes place later on in the movie will shock some. Hannahs age is not quite known so there is a hint of under age sex. A taboo subject these days. There are scenes of men being savaged by 'The Infected'. A Boy, one of the 'The Infected' is beaten to death by Jim. This however is unseen. Plus there is the haunting image of the city of Manchester on fire. Our heroes can only watch seated in their vehicle. stunned by the sight that they see before them. Boyle keeps the pace going smoothly. Allowing the tension build. Allowing for the bleak atmosphere to set in. This is a movie that is  Psychological at the best of times as well. But don't let the idea of the film being bleak put you off. The ending is not itself dark. It's quite upbeat without giving too much away. As for the performances themselves. Thet are truly outstanding. I have never heard of the likes of Cillian Murphy and Naomi Harris before but having watched them hope to do so again in the naer future. 28 Days later is not without it's faults however. Some may find the movie a bit slow for their tastes. Maybe the movie doesn't draw on 'The Infected' enough and there is on clear resolution to what is happening at the conclusion of the movie.It won't be to everybody's taste. But that said this is still an entertaining thoughtful popcorn movie. A good way to spend the night out. Rating: * * * * (Good)"

","It was a pretty good film. Whilst not specifically about Zombies it was definitely a movie in the zombie genre.<br/><br/>The first half was interesting and entertaining, the film asked some serious questions but provided few answers. The sargeant said that the zombies wouldn't get across the seas and oceans, but can we really believe not one of them made it across the Channel or through the Chunnel? The behavior of the soldiers I would think would be better IRL but that is perhaps me wanting the best from a British squaddie.<br/><br/>The sound was not very good, often music or ambient noise overpowered the dialogue. They also used the same camera effect as in the opening battle scene of Saving Private Ryan. I don't know what it is but it makes it look very jerky like they are shooting at 20frames per second, and was particularly bad during a the rain scene at the blockade.<br/><br/>However, for a 21st century look at the zombie movie, it is okay, set upon a typically dark and bleak British backdrop which I like anyway, perhaps the fact it was set in Britain saved it for me."

","Too often we see horror movies that rely on special effects, big stars, predictable teens, cheesy music and unoriginal storylines.  28 Days later does not suffer from this affliction.  Instead it takes the audience through a whirlwind of suspence, blood, paranoia and pure unadulterated horror.  We start with a virus called RAGE that has been engineered and deliberately administered to chimps.  Unfortunately, animal rights activists release one of the chimps.  Cut to 28 Days Later...<br/><br/>We are taken through the story through the eyes of Jim, a courier rider who was in a coma when something happened.  He awakes to find London deserted (an eerie homage to John Wyndham) and wondering what has happened.  After being attacked, he is rescued by Mark and Selena who tell him the truth. England has been overrun by ""the infected"".  From there it turns into a battle of survival, taking Jim and his new found friends (including Frank and Hannah, a father and daughter) up to Manchester where they believe salvation lies in the form of a military unit led by Major Henry West (play superbly by Christopher Eccleston).  However, all is not as it seems.<br/><br/>What makes 28 Days Later so phenominal is the fact that it plays on our fears and uses minimal special effects, instead going for a George Romero style of real actors in minimal make up.  Deserted London is spooky in it's sparcity and the actors more than meet the challenge, especially Brendon Gleeson in his best role since Hamish in Braveheart.  He is your everyman and someone that we all know.<br/><br/>11 out of 10 for the first real original horror movie since the original 1968 Return of the Living Dead."
"barfly99","Null","0","0","10 November 2002"," Exciting but derivative and unpleasant post-apocalyptic thriller
","28 DAYS LATER does not, as some seem to believe, herald some kind of rebirth for British cinema. This is in fact the latest entry in a very old and well-trodden genre, and the fact that it is set and made in Britain rather than the US for once doesn't mean its complete lack of originality should be conveniently overlooked. Having said that, it is slickly and stylishly done, and contains enough thrills and spills to keep you reasonably entertained throughout.<br/><br/>It doesn't start well. If there really are high-tech laboratories housing diseases capable of causing the mayhem 'Rage' does, I doubt very much that their security system is so lax that they can be penetrated by a few animal rights activists.<br/><br/>But the scenes of a deserted London are chillingly effective, and when the real action starts, as we first encounter 'the infected', the film's pattern becomes clear. Although we have seen this kind of thing many times before, the one interesting twist Boyle and Garland add to the mix is that unlike Romero's zombies, Star Trek's Borg and so on, the fearless, unrelenting stalkers here don't plod slowly and rather pathetically toward their intended prey, but sprint at top speed. This makes the action sequences considerably more tense and breathless than one might have expected.<br/><br/>Furthermore Boyle's directorial flair is such that even when the story moves out of London the screen is repeatedly filled with dazzling, memorable images. There's some good use - although it might be considered overuse - of music, and most, if not all, of the performances are good, thanks to the casting of solid, reliable types like Christopher Ecclestone and Brendan Gleeson in many of the key roles.<br/><br/>But unfortunately Boyle and Garland don't know where to stop. The unpleasantness and/or stupidity of everyone in the film is as ceaseless as the pursuit of them by the infected. Most of the scrapes Jim and co. get themselves into are entirely of their own doing, and those that aren't turn out to be because the uninfected are basically as nasty as the infected. After a while you begin to think that us Brits are all apparently so moronic or amoral that the rest of the world would probably be better off if we did all get wiped out. The likes of THE OMEGA MAN are generally not exactly a barrel of laughs either, but at least those films made you want humanity to survive.<br/><br/>28 DAYS LATER is worth seeing, just about, and as pure white-knuckle entertainment goes it's probably at least as good as the average star-studded Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>Now if only we could do it with more interesting and original material..."

You the British Public must go and see this Film and then make up your own mind love it or hate it that's your opinion and yours is the only one that counts.

The Grainy vision just adds to the overall feel of the film. Yes there are plot holes but not as many as your average Hollywood block buster. Someone else posted comments about the lack of dead bodies. There are loads, *spoilers* Early on our hero walks into a church, crammed full of bodies, people who obviously holed themselves up in an attempt to escape the rage, only to perish trapped in a building. We can assume that many others who escaped the rage would have met a similar fate (just how long can you survive in a small space with no running water and tons of other people)? Oh and on leaving for Manchester the group is seen gazing out of the taxi cab as it climbs onto the Motorway, we can see from the reflection in the cab window that they are witnessing a site similar to that of a World War 2 holocaust. *end spoilers*<br/><br/>The acting is spot on they are not Oscar winning performances, that much is certain but like everything else in the Movie, its real and gritty just like you'd expect. These people aren't super heroes they are ordinary Joe's thrown into an extraordinary situation, I wouldn't have expected anything else.<br/><br/>One final thing, the post apocalyptic atmosphere the film creates, the feeling of dread and the seemingly hopelessness of the situation is worth the entry price alone.<br/><br/>Truly a milestone for British Cinema, Hollywood wish they could make films like this.they can't.<br/><br/>In other words, this film is the Mac, daddy."

He walks through an eerily silent London (reminded me of walking home at 6am after a hard night clubbing).<br/><br/>These scenes are quite breathtaking, especially the iconic fallen bus, and the ""wall of notes"" around Eros. I did find it slightly difficult to suspend my belief that NO corpses were around at this point...<br/><br/>So our hero meets a surviving couple, Selena and Mark. This interlude serves to bring Jim up to speed with the story. Selena then dumps her boyfriend, and teams up with Jim.<br/><br/>They happen upon Frank, an indominatble London cabbie, and his daughter Hannah. I liked the initial tension between these two pairs of characters when they first met. I thought that Frank seemed SO nice to these strangers that he HAD to be hiding some sinister dark secret, but I'm glad that he turned out to be genuine enough.<br/><br/>The Quartet go in search of salvation, following a broadcast from a military outpost near Manchester. Tragically Frank becomes 'Rage' fodder moments before making contact with the soldiers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the soldiers there turn out to be almost as dangerous as the 'zombies' they left behind - and the real reason for the broadcast was a trap to lure unsuspecting totty to apease the uncontrollable squaddies.<br/><br/>In the end Jim has to kill all the squaddies to rescue two remaining girls, and they all flee to Cumbria and presumably live happily ever after.<br/><br/>If one were to be incredibly picky, then there are some massive technical plot holes. The nature of 'Rage' being a case in point... if all the 'zombies' really vomited that much blood all the time, they would all be incapacitated by shock and the film would be called '28 hours'... also the Rhabdovirus (which causes rabies) takes about 6 weeks to grow from a bite along your neurons into your brain and start causing an encephalitis - took about 10 seconds with 'Rage'.<br/><br/>I loved this film. On the up side it has atmosphere, spectacular visuals and runs at a tremendous pace. More to the point - it is terrifyingly scary.

","Maybe spoilers.<br/><br/>For just over the first half of this film, it was on course to be one of the best I've ever seen. The script & idea were awesome and it was one where your mind could wander off and you could place your self in the lead role which is the sign of any good film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the the plot moved onto the army scenes, the film degenerated into a bit of a farce. In all the post apocalyptic films & TV shows I've seen, it seems there's an unwritten rule that nobody can get on with each other after wards & consequently you end up with more deaths than the cause of the apocalypse. Quite why every member of the army had to be killed off I'm not sure.<br/><br/>The acting wont win any awards but I don't let the acting quality affect my view of a film like other seems to. With so much crap soap operas on tele in England, you get immune to acting like that so it's not a problem. The acting here was competent, nothing more, but not enough to ruin a film.<br/><br/>The film could've carried on an extra 10 minutes to let you know who was flying the plane, where they come from where they were going etc etc.<br/><br/>The idea of post apocalyptic films is the most exciting there is as there is no right or wrong to it, but as of yet I've still yet to see one where the characters resemble how you or I would behave in that situation, and this, to a degree was similar. Nobody seemed to ask the questions any rational people would. For the lead girl character, who had much of the film, you knew very little about her.<br/><br/>In short, it starts brilliantly, tails off badly in the second half, picks itself up again at the end but not enough to make it a classic.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, I've seen about 10 films at the cinema in the last 2 months & this was comfortably the best. That's more through the others all being crap (Signs, Greek Wedding, Guru, Changing Lanes, Austin Powers etc). It's better than all of them & well worth a watch.<br/><br/>7/10"

","While this is not a perfect film, I came away from the cinema feeling I had seen something new, worthwhile, thrilling and innovative.<br/><br/>New in the sense it was not a traditional or modern zombie film, in fact it seems to borrow more from the Crazies and the Omega Man rather than Romero's classics (although there are some obvious homage to them as well)<br/><br/>Worthwhile in the sense that the characters were developed more, especially in the first half of the film and the desolation and isolationist feel was well communicated.  Also the film took a brave leap in the second half that some have disliked.  Certainly I felt this was an interesting direction more reminisent of Apocalypse Now than the usual zombie flick and introduced new character elements with new messages.<br/><br/>Innovative, certainly was the digital aspect of the film, the graininess working very well, contributing to the atmosphere and the realism. This was for mind the most impressive achievement.<br/><br/>On the other side the infected are monsterous and the vision bleak. Recommended and throughly enjoyed. 8/10"

The photography was great, I loved the soundtrack, the acting was pretty good (with the exception of ""Hannah"", although she was alright after being slipped a couple of pills), and the humour was just subtle enough to lift the depressing tone of this movie now and again.<br/><br/>Anyway, this isn't just about fighting zombies - we see the protagonists coming to terms with the situation, having a laugh, trying to cope with other survivors, and er, fighting zombies.

"jimsmith-too","9","0","0","8 November 2002"," I went to a press screening and was lucky enough to meet Danny Boyle, Alex Garland and Andrew McDonald
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** They answered alot of questions from the floor, most of which have answered the questions on the message boards about this film.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is good, in a low-budget post-apocalyptic kind of way. It's filmed entirely on a Canon LX (about Â£1500) and has a low budget (reportedly $15 million, although i get the picture alot of that was spent in post production, market research and advertising). It's not a zombie movie as such, although it does have remarkable similarities to that genre.<br/><br/>Basically the plot revolves around Jim, a bike courier who wakes up in a hospital several weeks after being hit by a truck, only to find he is alone. He's in a locked room, naked, and his call for help are ignored. Searching around, he finds the key to the door on the floor, as if someone locked him in and slid the key under to him (weird...) so he lets himself out and tries to find someone, anyone. There's noone around, noone at all. So, he does what anyone who's been out for weeks would do; he gorges himself on chocolate and sugary soft drinks. That over he wanders out into town.<br/><br/>Strangely, London is deserted. London. Yes, London. DESERTED.<br/><br/>
Anyone who lives in london will no how weird that is. Noone ever tries to do a London deserted, it never looks the part. this time it does...<br/><br/>Anyway, Jim eventually stumbles into a church and finds it full of bodies. When he calls out to them, a good dozen or so leap up and charge him. Before you know it, he's on the run, and that's where it all really kicks off.<br/><br/>oh, and i forgot to mention the prelude with the animal rights activists letting the crazed monkeys out...<br/><br/>The rest of the film chronicles a story of survival, how Jim and the few survivors he meets try to make sense of the tragedy while staying alive. This is why i like the movie, the fact that it's more about the characters and how they can cope with their situation, than the situation they are in. This, i think, is why comparisons to literary classics like 'The day of the Triffids' or films like 'Dawn of the Dead' are justified; they really do stand out amongst their contemporaries since they tackle the issue of human survival head on. The Triffids had those walking plants, Dawn had the zombies, but unlike most of their kind, the zombies/plants/whatever were the problem, not the stars of the show. And, like in 28 Days later, the cast don't make stupid mistakes, they try to survive, at all costs. In this movie, look out for how Selena deals with the bite Mark gets in Jim's house. Wow...<br/><br/>Now, i live in Greenwich, a stones throw from where Jim lives in the film, plus my name is Jim too, so when i introduced myself to Boyle & Garland in that way, i got a laugh out of them and hit them with the following questions, which they answered fairly truthfully. so let's round up a few things.<br/><br/>1 Zombies. Zombie plagues always have causes relating directly to the current national phobia. In the 60/70s it was radiation, now it's chemical warfare. Let's face it, these days the concept of zombies just don't cut it with popular culture; we just can't take them seriously. many thanks to Michael Jackson for that, eh? Now, though, the world is worried about chemical warfare; anthrax, smallpox, whatever, that's a real worry. That's exactly why these 'zombies' are chemically infected, disease is a very real worry. Mind you, so is rage. Danny Boyle loved the concept of the psychological virus, everyone who lives in London has experienced rage; tube rage, road rage, bus rage, supermarket trolley rage, everything. Rage is good, and Alex Garland said he wanted to get away from the cheap staggering zombies thing, he wanted turbo charged and highly infectious crazies. I added that is was refreshing that head shots weren't the only killer, that got another laugh...<br/><br/>2 Deserted London. You can't stop the traffic in London, you can simply 'ask' them to wait a minute. By filming at 4am, and by getting pretty ladies to do the traffic stopping, Boyle and McDonald managed intervals of at most 2 minutes, over 4 mornings, to shoot as much footage as possible with eight digital cameras. The rest is in the editing. That's one of the reasons why there are no bodies...<br/><br/>3 Where are all the bodies? Well, mainly because of the reason above. The three of them also remembered Kosovo, where bodies were piled up in churchs, and decided to mimic that, hence the big body pile up church scene.<br/><br/>4 Product placement. Take this example; Jim wanders through the hospital, past a popular UK coffee shop chain, to a foyer where he gets soft drinks and chocolates from a vending machine. Thing is, that stuff is there, in London branding is EVERYWHERE, so why hide it?<br/><br/>* SPOILERS *<br/><br/>5 The end. Upbeat hollywood trash? Well, they did film 2 endings; in the alternate ending Jim doesn't make it off the hospital bed at the end. Would that have been better than the supposedly happy ending? Alex Garland said firstly that nearly everyone is dead so that's hardly happy. Secondly, he pointed out that after getting emotionally attached to characters for the last two hours, the audiences that saw the test screening with the downer ending HATED it. He said that audiences often think they want the downbeat arty ending but actually want the happy one.<br/><br/>You know what, he might be right ;)"

There are moments in the film that leave you breathless and feeling uncomfortable. Its more than a mere zombie flesh eating flick, its (dare i say it it) something special. The weird camera angles should remind you of watching the old Batman baddies in their hideouts but they add to the movie, as does the (so dark you might miss it) black humour. 28 Days Later is a great film and to date i have seen it twice and both times people were jumping and squirming about in there seats, laughing and saying ""ewwwwwwww"" during the ""fingers in the eyes"" scene near the end of the film. Watch it, watch it now.<br/><br/>RottenAddict!"

","28 Days Later uses on of the standard set-ups of fiction, and it is always interesting to see how such a film develops. All post-apocalyptic films have a certain sociological outlook inherent in the set-up, yet I found the particularly bleak message of this film disturbing.<br/><br/>First of all, I found the film itself to be tense, dramatic and interesting. It delights in it's low budget, and the grainy digital photography was surprisingly effective. It was also very much a British film. At times the film was disturbing, but it also had some nice touches of humour.<br/><br/>Remember how Margaret Thatcher is purported to have said, ""There is no such thing as society, only individuals and families?"" Well, I thought that this film - perhaps unknowingly - presented a nihilistic vision very close to Thatcher's comment. In this film, the informal ""family"" that is formed amongst the central characters is happy and contented, yet the possibility of the formation of wider communities seems bleak. Perhaps this is the way it actually would be in Britain under such circumstances - in which case, we are all doomed."

With 10 million people living in London, surely they would have been a few bodies strewn across the place - or maybe the ""infected"" have a consientious desire to clean up after them. Why were the Soldiers so desperate for sex?<br/><br/>Ending was pants. So pants. Why ""HELLO""?????<br/><br/>Coolest bit - Selina chopping up her mate in Jim folks pad at the beginning after he had been bit by one of the infected. A shame she suddenly became such a wimp when being faced by couple of inept squaddies wanting to rape her. I thought at that point she would have really kicked some arse!

","My friend who I went to see the film with described it, initially, as the ""best film I've ever seen"", tempered later by the description, ""One of the best films I've ever seen; certainly the best film of this year.""<br/><br/>I enjoyed it too. :-)<br/><br/>[SOME SPOILERS]<br/><br/>I wouldn't go that far myself! But it is one hell of a movie. Not a gorefest, but a story, with real characters where everything doesn't have to explained to us (the way American movies do). Example? Most movies would go:<br/><br/>Person1: They are infected with rage.<br/><br/>Person2: What do you mean by rage?<br/><br/>Person1: Well, sudden and extreme bouts of uncontrolled anger.<br/><br/>Person2: Oh, I see. So because of this rage infection, they attack people then?<br/><br/>Person1: Yes, that's right.<br/><br/>Person2: I see.<br/><br/>Etc. Sorry, but having seen the likes of Resident Evil, which *is* more high tech, but so awful to be untrue, it was a relief to watch a movie that didn't insult your intelligence, and gave it to you straight, with no hand-holding that is so prevalent in Hollywood movies today.<br/><br/>The sense of loneliness and oppression were wonderfully done. Using DV only added to the 'feel' of the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Other points.<br/><br/>1. I've read criticism on this board that society is unlikely to break down as fast, the soldiers would not be so brutal, would not lose all sense of moral responsibility so quickly. Er, boy are you in for a surprise when the electricity is off for more than a week with no hope of it being turned back on, coz your neighbour will be round with an axe to help himself to your larder, quicker than you can say ""I've got a family to feed."" And have you met your average trooper? He's a gun-toting, beer drinking, testosterone machine. He has needs, the same as every other man. He's got a gun, and knows how to use it. These men had been through hell, having to kill (perhaps hundreds or more) mad Manchurians fleeing from the burning city. The last thing they are going to be is balanced human beings.<br/><br/>2. Killing someone by shoving their eyes through their brain. Ummm. I'm a bike courier and you are a trained soldier, versed in the martial arts. If I try to take you on using Marquis of Queensbury rules, I'm going to die. Not least because you've learned unarmed combat (and perhaps boxing!) and I have not. I'm not rational at this point and have to do anything, everything, to survive.<br/><br/>I'd sure be tempted to take this route against a superior foe.<br/><br/>Criticisms: The young girl's acting was appalling. Sorry. :-(<br/><br/>
I felt the scene (post eyes through head) with Selena and Jim in the bathroom, Selena with machete in hand, was wasted. Selena would have been swinging that blade like her life depended on it. However, I guess that it did reprise her belief in being able to 'tell' when someone was infected though?<br/><br/>Conclusion: All in all, a great movie. Hope you enjoy(ed) it as much as I did.<br/><br/>Robbie"

","It's truly amazing what the right marketing can do for a movie. That together with the involvement of trendy Danny Boyle as Director and Alex Garland (Script) then it's no surprise that this movie topped the UK box office charts. The trouble is it's not very good! The direction has been praised for its realistic and unsettling qualities when all it really seemed to me was an arty-farty way of covering for poor special effects. There were also far too many flaws in the story which made it totally unbelieveable. For me it failed in every way. As a horror it failed because it substituted gore for shocks (i jumped once and that was right at the beginning. As Sci-fi it failed because of the poor effects and by the way it isn't that hard to film a desserted London (See the Boulting Bros movie 7 Days to Noon -they did it far more effectively). Finally it failed because it failed to draw parralells between the rage of the infected and the uninfected. The acting wasn't bad especially Christopher Eccleston as the army commander. The difference between this and another low budget UK movie ""Dog Soldiers"" is that the latter does its job within it's limits. Its's much scarier, the direction is tighter, humour inserted at the right moments and the script is better. Ultimately it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't."

"gregor_mill","8","0","0","6 November 2002"," Original spin on a long overlooked genre.
","A major, and welcome, change in direction for the Boyle/McDonald team, and an original (or as original as horror gets these days) spin on a genre well overdue a resurrection - the zombie movie.  Having read Danny Boyle commenting that it wasn't a zombie, or indeed a horror, genre flick I have to say I disagree - maybe he thought branding it as such might affect his audience or something.  Anyway, 28 Days Later has to be one of the most genuinely grim horror films I've seen for years. While it does wear some of it's influences on its sleeve it is more informed by them than driven to emulate them - think the sense of screaming isolation and the all encompassing feeling of dread pervading Romeros Trilogy of the Dead and couple that with one of the finest horror creations for a long time, the Infected.  I'm not one to be easily disturbed by a film but there are some images and scenes that kept me awake at night after viewing.  The film is carried along by some great performances by the cast, none more so than Naomie Harris who shows a great combination of vulnerability and rock-hard determination.  Cillian Murphy too is great, and you really share in his horror and confusion at the world he has woken to.  The star of the show, however, is the concept itself and the Infected at the centre of it. You're NEVER quite sure just how far the rage has spread and are left to think about it without any real conclusions being made, which just adds to the atmosphere of isolation, terror and desperation throughout the piece. Genuinely unsettling, at times brutally violent but completely compulsive viewing."
"demontiggeruk","9","0","0","5 November 2002"," Enjoy it for what it is!
","Okay, I enjoyed this movie, in spite of the obvious flaws. I know a lot of people have commented that DV is not good enough for cinema, but I thought it gave the film a nicely different look, both ghostly and gritty. It also allowed the shoot to take place in London very early in the morning without massive lighting rigs messing up the shot, or meaning the traffic had to be stopped for too many hours as DV is much more light sensitive (apparently). Oh and of course it's cheap!! The plot although clichéd and cheesy did have enough to say to keep us interested, and was clever enough to use the roller coaster effect (slow, quiet section followed by fast moving jumpy section). However for all of those who are accusing this film of being just like Night Of The Living Dead or Evil Dead or whatever else has been mentioned, try watching the old British SF classic Day of The Triffids. There are parts that made me think that this was almost a remake! It also put me in mind of I Am Legend (the novel on which The Omega Man is based), and the third section, in the mansion just felt like it was ripped out of a very poor Doctor Who ep! Contrary to others I think much of the characterisation is done very well. People do stupid, thoughtless, selfish things in extreme circumstances. People begin to value different things, in the case of Jim a Cheese Burger became more important than his own safety, in the case of the soldiers the procreation urge overcame their sense of decency. I thought that worked. The 'effects' are few and far between, and really probably unnecessary. The infected were just fine (in the best tradition of cheap zombie movies, a few rags, some dirt and a bit of fake blood. Works every time) Some of the acting was fairly bad, but sometimes on a low budget it must be difficult to get good 'child' actors (you know who I am talking about if you've seen the film). At the end of the day if you go to this movie expecting a US style horror / action movie you will be VERY disappointed, but if you go in expecting an intelligent, but ultimately flawed British sci fi, that's pretty much what you will get."

","This movie was remarkably awful, I had high hopes for 28 days later - mostly based around the responses from IMDB - since I don't consider Boyle to have made a single good film. Ok, the opening scenes... well after the Shot of the Pall Mall - didn't anyone notice the black figure walking away up the hill from Jim? I burst out laughing at that point - they spend all that time and money getting a deserted London and there's some guy in the shot! How did they miss that??? Anyway I was prepared to give it a go and was quite enjoying until the daughters speech on the balcony - this was so poor, and I mean very BAD - how can a Director allow such badly delivered (and written) dialogue into his finished film?

"Kolobos85","Null","0","0","5 November 2002"," Brutally killed off any of my previous expectations!
","I was thoroughly impressed after seeing this in the cinema. Danny Boyle has exceeded any possible limitation i could have set on how good a film like ''28 days later'' could be. One of favorite aspects in the film is the constant threat that something ''bad'' is going to happen all the time. As seen in his previous films Danny Boyle can build up tension in a film so well (eg. Robert Carlyle in Trainspotting.) and in 28 days he breaks every possible boundary on tension and had me and most other people in the audience pushing ourselves back into our seats expecting the worst to happen in most of the scenes. There were a few times when the tension was broke with a little humour, and everyone in the crowd laughed quietly together, that was very cool!!<br/><br/>
     The storyline i thought had alot of depth to it, leaving us with the thought it could really happen. The way the Virus is introduced and how the film ends helps makes it even more unique (Thanks to Alex Garland.), and therefore not just another Zombie type film.<br/><br/>
     I was very surprised at how Brutal and graphic the violence and gore was in this. It was purely no holds barred, and happened often in small doses. This was good as it seperated the more emotional scenes of the individual characters coping with the chaos they are in the midst of, and helped keep the film flowing smoothly. Cillian Murphy was brilliant as Jim and was superbly supported by Naomi Harris and Brendan Gleeson as Selena and Frank. <br/><br/>
    Overall i didn't once have a bad thing to say about the film as a whole. I have heard criticisms on the use of digital camera actually making the film look bad itself (Not that it looks bad at all). But this was purposefully chose to create the atmosphere of the film, and works will with the skilled directing. (The Streets of London scenes were awe inspiring.) The soundtrack was perfect varying into different modern styles of music rather than a full on orchestral film score or a full on rap or nu-metal theme. <br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films of the year and would encourage anyone to see it, don't let the ZOMBIE theme deter you!!"
"churchyard","Null","0","0","4 November 2002"," Ignore the morons..this film is excellent!
","I don't have time to go into just how pathetic the criticisms made about this film are, or all the incredible details that make the film actually so damn good.  Suffice to say, the cinematography, editing, acting, effects and sound are unbelievably excellent, especially compared to all the CGI sh*te that's around these days.  Anyone who goes expecting a standard slasher film will be disappointed - it's scary but not leaping out of your seat in terror so.  The gore is understated - it's the effect of the violence on those who perform it that's important.  And so what that the violent, shocking scenes are interspersed with quiet periods - it's to give them and us a break!! Why does no-one realise this?<br/><br/>And no-one who hasn't lived in London could possibly understand what an incredible achievement it is to make the city deserted.  The only criticism I agree with is that yes, the shops would probably have been more looted and there would've been more cars, but who cares in the grand scheme of such an emotionally-tearing film?  *SPOILERS!!* And yes the happy ending was unusual, as I had expected Jim to get killed by mistake, but give the guys a break!!  It;s nice to think human nature could survive intact.  And the soldiers aren't supposed to be insane, just very unpleasant people.<br/><br/>A fantastic film that all intelligent people should see, especially those who enjoyed its predecessors, the equally excellent Dog Soldiers and Reign of Fire - I'd say they comprise a trilogy that I think should be in a boxset!!"
"devon_chris","6","0","0","4 November 2002"," I'd rather think about it than watch it, for once...
","Yeah, you read the summary right. I came out of this film almost laughing at how utterly bad it was. Only when I thought about it later did the odd subtlety of the piece occur to me - the fact that the virus in '28 days later' is called 'the rage', while 'le rage' is the French for 'rabies', which also saw Britain placed under 'quarantine'; the whole moral quandary of how we behave under duress, and indeed the question of man's place in the universe. These weren't bad ideas by any means, and some incredible films have been made on much much worse premises. So there you have it - '28 days later' has a fine director who knows how to capture true, gritty, desolation no less than he did years ago on Trainspotting; it has a decent enough idea of a plot; it has some whimsical black comedy, some poignant touches, and not a bad sense of drama; ultimately, it asks some cutting questions.<br/><br/>So why did I come out of this film thinking it was so, so bad? Well, sad to say, it fails from the word go on some of the most basic counts. The acting is appalling, inexcusable, sub-soap-opera, diabolical, more zombified than the numerous extras, terrible, excruciating... a thesaurus would barely do justice to how absolutely dire the acting performances were. Usually in a dodgy piece of independent cinema, at least we come out thinking 'how's about so-and-so for a fine future talent' - well the same couldn't be said about '28 days'. The soldiers and both female leads are particularly poor. This is sad, since with some decent acting the film could have had some good things come out of it - it would certainly not have been removed to the level of farce it had been after the first twenty minutes by the panto-style fare it offered.<br/><br/>Also alarming were Danny Boyle's shortcomings. Usually such a fine connoiseur of character-building, he happily resorts to feeble stereotypes - the boisterous, two-dimensional squaddies, the sinister tyrannical CO, the hardened feminist heroine. The only attempt at any sort of interesting characterisation lies in the hero's escapades towards the end, and in the tragic father-daughter relationship (though this becomes less impressive once you realise its complete dependence on 'Dusk Til Dawn'). All the characters suffer from severe lapses in rationality, not even explained by the exceptional circumstances they all find themselves in - in fact even less so: it simply doesn't make sense that in that sort of danger, 'Jim' would ever even consider going on his 'cheeseburger quest'.  Besides the poor characters, the dialogue is hardly glowing either - I always say that a reliable sign of a poor film is an excess use of the line 'let's get outta here'; in '28 days later', I counted dozens of utterances. What could have been some genuinely scary bits, too, were so long in coming that we yawned rather than jumped when 'frightened'. To be honest, I've woken up next to scarier things than this movie - despite being billed as a horror film, this doesn't even pretend to be; poor publicity there. Plus, check on the 'goofs' section of this webpage some time soon and doubtless someone who's thought about the film more than me will have given it the dressing-down it deserves in terms of plot holes. Also, the first half-hour left me stunned that we could still be subjected to such blatant product-placement in this enlightened day and age.<br/><br/>Saddest of all, though, is that even the neat ideas the film does have are far from original. The concepts of growing brutality without law and order smack of 'Lord of the Flies'-cum-'Mad Max'; the messages that 1) animal testing labs are evil sadistic torture-pits, 2) man has come to the end of his time, and 3) man is such a horrible violent species by nature.... spare me, all of them, please. Thirty years ago this film would have been epoch-shattering, now it just smells dated, cliched, low-budget and half-hearted. Oh, and just in case you think I hadn't noticed, the whole first half of the film, with all its desolation, potential dread and tension, and all those deserted streets, isn't even original - just ask Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>Basically, see this film if you're eager to see how your lottery money is being totally and utterly wasted, and don't mind a standard of acting performance which my little cousin's nativity play puts to shame. To be fair, I suppose you could see this film if long-exhausted ethical debates interest you, or if you never thought it was possible to stop all the traffic in a part of london for a few hours. DON'T watch it if you want your confidence in independent cinema given a boost - see Donnie Darko if that's what you're in to. Ultimately, though, if you really want to see something bleak, desolate, with a quirky post-apocalyptic edge after a deadly disease... watch Heston's 'Omega Man'. Give '28 days later' a miss - if it was a pet, it would have been put out of its misery a long time ago. Deader than the zombies. Five farts out of ten."

","Remember when a horror movie meant you had to be 18 or over to watch it? Remember what it was like to sit in the dark and be genuinely disturbed about what you were watching? I'm not on about the ghastly images of a 13 times resurrected man wearing a William Shatner mask on the prowl yet again, or the cliché filled one liners from a fire ravaged man with appalling tastes in woolly jumpers.<br/><br/>No, try to think past that. Try to remember the days when a horror didn't mean a killer on the prowl in a school full of perfectly formed teenagers, who all look like clones of ever other perfectly formed teenagers from a score of movies and TV shows. Try to remember when you were fighting with your girlfriend over who was going to hide behind whom. She always won of course and while she hid behind you, you had to lift up your arm to block the image for a second, because you knew something terrible was going to happen and part of you wanted to watch, but the sane part of you, the part that gets scared and truly believes in vampires, ghosts and monsters when you are on your own in bed at 2:30 in the morning and you've just heard a noise downstairs; that part of you couldn't watch. The funny thing is, when you gave up and lowered your arm, the demon would choose that moment to pounce and you'd jump out of your seat, almost knocking your girlfriend unconscious.<br/><br/>Remember movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead, Movies that were entertaining, but with gritty, disturbing realistic concepts? They had, 'What if' scenarios that were fantasy based on reality and were filmed in such a way that you believed it could happen, or at least you could imagine it happening and picture yourself trying to run around a supermarket trying to survive against hordes of zombies; something which I've always wanted to do actually.<br/><br/>Welcome to 28 Days later, a movie that takes horror back to its roots, whilst maintaining a modern edge that doesn't bow down to the Hollywood mainstream.<br/><br/>Jim wakes up in a hospital 28 days after a deadly virus is let loose on the unsuspecting, and I can imagine quite upset, British public. Society, as Jim knows it has collapsed (`It's worse then that Jim, everyone's dead!') but Jim is so shocked, he has to wander around a deserted London and bump into the reason for societies untimely demise before he finally gets it. The reason being infected humans. Now the infected are not like your classic zombie. They don't wander around like drugged up disabled people moaning, 'Brains.' You can't easily doge a hundred of them, nor can you quickly push triangle, circle R2, R2 on your Playstation to skip a level. These are humans whose blood boils with rage, they are totally consumed with a berserker fury, therefore they are just as quick and as strong as normal humans, but maybe a little more as their rage seems to fuel them. Plus they don't give a s*** about their own safety; they will gladly slice their own arm off if it meant they could get to you. Their aim simply seems to be to kill or infect other humans; that's it! So, the movie is basically about Jim and some people he meets up with trying to survive in a world gone mad, while at the same time it sends a message that humans do not need a rage virus to become inhuman.<br/><br/>The Director, Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) successfully draws the audience in to Jim, and humanities plight. The movie is low budget, but Danny uses all the tricks he can to add to the atmosphere, things like striking, powerful images of deserted cities and motorways, believable characters and some of the most realistic looking dead bodies I've ever seen in a movie. Even the use of digital cameras adds to the gritty realism.<br/><br/>Although not a very original concept, 28 Days Later is far better then any recent similar movies like Resident Evil, although it does borrow quite heavily from Dawn of the Dead, which if you think about it isn't really a bad thing!"

I think that this could have just been spoken about rather than having to see it - it didn't really add that much to the film - as it has been used loads of times before.<br/><br/>Perhaps the opening would have been more powerful if it had begun with the guy, Jim, waking up in the hospital - that would have been far creepier!

I know that one of the reasons it was chosen was probably because it is supposed to look more ""real"" but it doesn't seem to give that effect. John Carpenter's films from the seventies, like Assault on Precinct 13 or Escape from New York look a bit ""cheapo"" but not in the same way as this film. It makes the movie look a student's end of year project.<br/><br/>
Soundtrack<br/><br/>I thought that the soundtrack was awful!  The version of ""abide with me"" was so pretentious! And that music in the supermarket! Did the director get one of his mates with a Bontempi Organ to write it! Or was it one of those free music sample CDROMs you get!<br/><br/>Overall Comments<br/><br/>I think that the film was okay. I think it would have been a million times better it was filmed on 35MM, with a completely new soundtrack, better actors (except for the main guy), a better ending, better editing and a new ending.<br/><br/>And WHY OH WHY didn't that woman kill Jim with Machete when she thought he was a zombie? That would have made the film sooo cool!"

","What would you do if you woke up alone?<br/><br/>That one question will haunt you after you see this film. Shot in London, a city with which i am more than familiar, the sheer loneliness of the first few scenes is striking. Seeing Cheapside devoid of life, The London Eye not turning, and the silence, it is errie in a way that defies belief.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle did an amazing job with the subject matter, making it fightningly realistic. The characters were well defined and in the current climate of alleged impending bio-war from Iraq, it is easy to put yourself in the position of any of the people portrayed.<br/><br/>What is most scary is how normal they all are, just doing what needs to be done, to survive and exist, making the most of an overwhelming experiance.<br/><br/>
You are unlikely to run for the kleenex, although the scares, (there are a few), may have you diving for cover, or new undewear but that may just be me, but there is serious emotion in this piece and that makes it watchable. I was sceptical going in (my thoughts were actually this will be s***e but it will pass a few hours) but coming out i was so impressed at how gripped i was all those thoughts evaporated.<br/><br/>Not for the faint hearted, but for those who love cinema at its best, this is a must see."

","This film brings something new to the genre. Difficult to describe, it somehow manages to be more convincing, more real, and produced a more intense physical reaction from me than I have ever experienced in the cinema before.<br/><br/>Perhaps the key is the random ordinariness of the main characters, and the familiar-but-different background - both story and scenery. Whatever the technical reasons, I know I nearly crushed my girlfriend's hand a couple of times, and it was the closest I have ever been to the definitively futile gesture that is yelling advice to the characters on the screen.<br/><br/>It's certainly true that some of the scenes are ""borrowed"" from famous apocalyptic film visions of the past, but it's no worse for that. There has been more effort to make the story hang together than most, and it's only where budget constraints have restricted the maker's freedom that the plot creaks a bit. There are only a couple of Alex Garland's trademark mistakes in the script, which for him is better than average.<br/><br/>Coming so soon after ""Dog Soldiers"", a very different but very entertaining film, I wonder if this could be an indication that the UK industry can challenge Hollywood in mainstream, non-costume drama, cinema. I look forward to seeing how both films do in the US and think that with the right marketing they could be huge.<br/><br/>I would also like to find out whether the version being shown in cinemas now has been changed at all from the original."

","A extreme sense of unease runs throughout 28 days later, particularly in the terrific first act which sees hero Jim (the luckiest man ever to have been involved in a road accident)awake to find London totally deserted. Londoners especially will sense a distinct chill at this disturbing sequence, shot on eery DV which gives the entire movie (bar the epilogue)a rough disarming look, instead the comfortable crisp image of celluloid that we're all used to. I've never been convinced for the need to use DV up to this point, as 35mm film looks so good, but the overall effect works so well here that i've changed my mind. Rarely for this kind of movie, its not all running and gore; there's some particularly touching scenes, including the billboard in Picadilly Circus saying goodbye to lost or missing relatives (shades of ground zero) and Jim's discovery of his dead parents which leaves a distinct lump in the throat. Its in the middle section that the film lags, particularly on the journey to Manchester in which some character moments slow the pace down considerably, and the final third too closely resembles the Beach for my liking (you'll see what I mean) but at least Jim doesn't turn into a bad playstation game so its not all bad.

","A super 21st Century British zombie film and lots of fun. But the bottom line is that it is repackaged Romero Zombie trilogy rolled into one film. The story deals with a coma victim waking (after 28 days) to find London deserted. Everyone seems to have died from a massive plague. Enter some very nasty red-eyed zombies who can attack at great speed. There are survivors, some who are helpful, and some who are more interested in helping themselves. The film deals with a journey to a place safety, which is not all it seems. For anyone who has seen the Romero films (Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead in particular) there is considerable déjà vu - soldiers in a fortress (complete with a chained Zombie), an attack by a child Zombie at a service station, a trip to the supermarket, four friends on the journey (one of them is reckless). The pace is much faster than the Romero films as the Zombies move much more quickly and are much more frightening. The character development suffers, however, as it competes with the action sequences and great scenery. The theme is very much the same, however, human fear and selfishness is the biggest enemy."

Digital works fine for short range shots with focus on inner emotions and scenes that are not too highly reliant on visual authenticity for effect, but for an epic of action shots over broad landscapes the definition is sometimes so poor as to be laughable. 28 Days was made on a tiny  well relatively tiny ($15m) - budget and it shows  no doubt it will continue to uphold Danny Boyle's reputation for making small budget films that rake in millions and, like Trainspotting and Shallow Grave that went before it, the editing in 28 Days Later is sharp and punchy, the infected crazies that keep jumping out like Living Dead Zombies on speed are scary enough, and the Mad Max formula that winds up the near two hours post-apolocalyptic mayhem still works well enough if you throw in a few more crazies and an attempted rape. 28 Days Later delivers value-for-money in the shocks department, but ultimately sees you leaving the cinema feeling empty and cheated."

Not much more time had elapsed before couples were openly chatting and I'm sure if someone had produced a pack of cards we could have had quite a game. Anyone familiar with The Avengers (circa Honor Blackman) and early Dr Who will have seen this film before.  If I'd have turned on the TV at two in the morning and this had been on I would have placed it in the mid-sixties.  Was this intentional or was it simply that poor? Well acted?  Who?  Which character? The plot  did anyone else guess who'd survive? The storyboard for this wouldn't have taken up much room would it.  Monkey infects population, uninfected seek sanctuary, uninfected find sanctuary, sanctuary bad, good prevail. Jim could have so easily been a profound character but he wasn't, Selena was so much better before she became girly and where did Hannah come from?  Was she Frank's adopted daughter? Scary?

People operate from a realistic point of view in this film, if you're angry you exact vengeance. It's human nature. Why do we demand punishment for our criminals? justice? reform? hardly, it's revenge. These are opinions this film is not afraid to make. However, advertising this film as horror will attract a lot of folk who care little about morality and thus will be disappointed that there is a short changing of shock. And let's face it. With this premiss we could have had 90mins of horror tension.<br/><br/>I did feel a little cheated of 'scare', but was pleasantly surprised at the depth in what I was led to believe was the scariest horror movie of the year.<br/><br/>PS Obvious comparisons are made to Vanilla Sky with the bare streets, but it's not about the implied meaning, more amazement that so much of London was shot abandoned, when it hums 24/7 and you can't shut any of it down to shoot.

","Once again the policy of Sneak Previewing anything remotely horror on Halloween gives you the power to ruin the film for everyone else.  I say this, as there may be some Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The premise is all well and good, with the populace infected with a viral form of Road Rage (to quote Danny Boyle), decimating it within a month to a few survivors.  The intro gets to the heart of the matter, as Animal Rights activists unintentionally unleash the virus in a stylish, and well edited, sequence.<br/><br/>However, the film really kicks in as Jim wakes up in a hospital, with the key slid under the locked door.  As he wanders the halls, the place is dead - no people, no sound, even the phones are dead.  Soon he is on the streets of London, desolate with no signs of life - a sequence worth the entrance fee alone, as Westminster Bridge is covered in discarded trinkets, piles of money lie around The Bank of England, with overturned buses lining the roads, and the centre of Piccadilly Circus awash with missing posters. Soon, Jim seeks sanctuary in a church, and the action begins in a typical way - an ""Infected"" Priest approaches him, much in the same way as every single zombie film has an encounter with a lone zombie, and the protagonist has no idea of what is happening, even apologising for striking it down.<br/><br/>Skipping a few plot details, eventually Jim and Selina meet with father and daughter Frank and Hannah, and find out there may well be safety in Manchester with a group of soldiers, and decide to get out of London - in Frank's black cab, including another great sequence occurs in the Dartford Tunnel, but I won't spoil it - even if it is in the trailer.<br/><br/>However, once they reach Manchester (a burnt out ruin), the film starts to unravel, skipping the interesting premise of the first hour and turning into Day of the Dead pretty damn quick - the characters of the soldiers is very similar (if a tad more Cockney), and they have a pet ""Infected"" (like Bub the zombie), among many others, at which point you start to question if the first half was just liberally borrowing from Omega Man/Quiet Earth/Rabid/The Stand.<br/><br/>Also, in the second half, the characterisation goes to Hell.  Many of the soldiers are cut & paste, with the exception of Sgt Farris and Christopher Eccleston's Major West.<br/><br/>As a recommendation, the first hour stands up well, but the last third suffers from a feeling of being tacked on and ripped off.  Personally, I blame writer Alex Garland, who can't write without a gory meltdown to finish, such as the book version of The Beach.<br/><br/>All in all, the film works up to a point (ie, when in London), but as soon as the soldiers are introduced, everything falls away - even the DV camerawork starts to look just ugly, when a few minutes before, in the sequence in the field, it looked beautiful.<br/><br/>Seven out of Ten, with an asterix marked ""Could Do Better."""

Mind you, the machete love letter was more than enough.<br/><br/>I haven't hitherto had much time for Danny Boyle's stuff but he's directed brilliantly here, with some striking poetic images as the wandering team see the world around themselves in an increasingly new light. The film is surprisingly moving and emotional, with an interesting central conceit revolving around the male lead's rite of passage. Only the derivative nature of the proceedings ('Day Of The Dead' is borrowed heavily from) prevents it achieving classic status. The medium used is a help that also becomes too much of a hindrance. What a picture it might of been shot on film. It would probably be easier on the eye on a PC or small TV which rather defeats the purpose of cinema.<br/><br/>The only other niggle is the Eccleston character's inexplicably dodgy aim at a vital moment.

You might recognise a few faces here and there, but on the whole the lack of big-name stars definitely works in the film's favour as there really are no guarantees on who's going to make it through the next violent attack.<br/><br/>There are some shaky moments - the opening sequence at the lab occasionally borders on farce, and the 'deeper' sections of dialogue either come across as corny or are clumsily delivered, such as by the actress who plays the young girl Hannah - but on the whole you'll be shocked, you'll be on edge the entire time, and you'll appreciate every minute of it later. The ending does jar slightly, but it's a small price to pay.<br/><br/>This is the British Blair Witch, demonstrating exactly how budget and production values should come second to talent and cohesive vision, and it's the first genuinely unsettling, unpredictable horror film in years.

The ending does seem a little too happy clappy but I guess that was put in to please the Americans. If you're looking for a grade-A thriller/horror/whatever picture, 28 Days Later is a sure bet."

","The first 30 minutes is excellent. Not completely original to be sure as there is a lot of 'The Omega Man' and 'Day of the Triffids' in the story but nevertheless very atmospheric. The images of a deserted London like those seen in 'Vanilla Sky' are especially effective.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story never seems to get going and the film ends up being just another post-apocalyptic also-ran with a lot of the associated cliches attached. The photography is excellent even though its another film to use the 'Saving Private Ryan' strobe technique.<br/><br/>Overall a little disappointing and not as scary as some of the press might make out. Could have been so much better had a bit more thought gone into the second half."

"tanmar3733","Null","0","0","1 November 2002"," at what point does homage become plagiarism ?
","I went to see 28 Days Later thinking that maybe for once the blurb had it right, the professional reviewers might be on to something. Maybe this would be what they were saying it was... a `truly unique vision'.  It was possible, Danny Boyle without doubt is a talented director who had got a bit lost somewhere on a certain beach, and was back on form.  Well he was, the direction was tight, it looked good,  though sometimes a bit grainy, (deliberately).<br/><br/>The problem was the script, at what point does homage become plagiarism ?. We had this discussion on the way home after the film.  Seems to me the professional reviewers must all be under twenty.<br/><br/>****WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>
The initial scenes though well done were a little TOO `Day Of the Triffids', those who commented that the deserted city scenes where far better than those in Vanilla Sky missed the point of those scenes. A little rich boys nightmare, all that money and no-one to live over.  I personally preferred the city scenes of The Omega Man and On the Beach if you want to talk `eerie', even the ending of Resident Evil, a city ravaged by `zombies' held more visual impact, and that's where the homage comes in.  The newspaper blowing by proclaiming `The Dead Walk' at the end of Resident Evil was homage, 28 days later was something else.<br/><br/>After leaving London in a taxi cab, we'll ignore the fact that a 4 wheel drive would have been preferable and why the hell didn't our fit young initial hero and heroine get the hell out if the city immediately, we'll jump forward to the refuelling sequence.  When that scene started I knew our hero Jim would go into that building and get attacked by a two child `zombies' jumping out of a cupboard,  I was half right, it was only one child.  Practically an exact copy of the scene in Romero's Dawn Of the Dead', and Peter in that film didn't discuss what went on either.<br/><br/>Then on to our soldier band, holding out in the sticks.  Well, they had captured one of their own, who had `turned', and kept him tied up with a chain around his neck inside their compound so they could find out more about the life cycle of these `zombies'.  At least he wasn't named `Bub', and when he escapes he turns one of the soldiers.  Almost exactly as in Romero's Day Of the Dead (except in that film it wasn't one of their own), but I still offer no marks for originality, and the leader of our fearless band of soldiers is eventually `fed' to our rampaging `zombies' inside the compound, also exactly as in Day Of The Dead'.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling cheated, this was a mishmash of Romero's movies liberally spiced with elements from BBC TV's series `Survivors' from back in the 70's.  A good British horror movie ??? Not in this reviewers eyes, frankly `Dog Soldiers' wiped the floor with it, that at least held no pretensions over what it was supposed to be.  This film arrived on a promise it couldn't deliver, and it seems anyone over the age of thirty and familiar with Romero and BBC's Survivors could spot the `homage'.<br/><br/>and as for that tacked on happy ending, well, it felt tacked on. Why feel the need to make a supposed post-apocalyptic nightmare vision and then tack that on the end ?<br/><br/>Why ?????<br/><br/>Oh, thats right, the consumer (and no offense intended, but especially american) demands a happy ending, well thats OK then, artistic vision be damned. It was a cop-out<br/><br/>It was no `truly unique vision' as the blurb says, just a disappointment and Danny Boyle is better than this.<br/><br/>Homage or plagiarism ?, of course its subjective, but if you are going to sell a film as a ""truly unique vison"" it might be advisable not to copy scenes and plot devices from other movies, and if you do, don't pick on the same director for most of them, especially on the one who has defined the ""zombie"" genre.<br/><br/>4/10  (for the teen market its obviously aimed at, unfamiliar with Romero's work)"

","This film promises to scream at you then bite your face off, it doesn't. It sneeks up behind you and then covertly becomes part of you, only when you stop watching it does the quality hit you.  I always hold to the idea that good directing is subliminal, as this is, with flashes of notable brilliance, as this has.<br/><br/>To anyone who has seen it and apreciated it, you'll know what i mean. Cillian Murphy convinces as the idealistic coma-wakeruperer, showing genuine desperation.  Naomi Harris also cuts it as the hardcore post-apocalyptic feminist.  The film shows human sensitivity through Brendan Gleeson's Frank, most touchingly where Jim (Murphy) calls him 'dad' in his sleep, with Santa Clause's unlucky twin giving a knowing smile.  This gives the audience a childs perspective, and adds to the appalling feeling of watching universal dehumanisation (at one layer, the film does question how human humans are...).  Theres so much to talk about:<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS FILM! DOWN WITH HOLLYWOOD TRASH!<br/><br/>(i'm english by the way, but not proud.)"

","Scary movie. This film makes you jump many times but once you have got used to the formula about half way through you probably will start to hope for some meaning or message. If you do you will be disappointed...its just one of those movies that says 'all we have to do is survive' and that means killing a lot of zombies. There's some terrible acting from the young girl and some really offensive cliches that make most army types out to be potential rapists. The ending can be easily guessed and some of the supposedly poignant moments are just rubbish - watching some horses frolicking stands out as particularly pathetic. If you like shock/horror stuff then you will like this but its ultimately pointless throwaway stuff. Some nice effects considering how it was filmed but it does look cheap and rough."

"wizkid1","8","0","0","26 October 2002"," The first great British apocalypse movie
","28 Days Later is the best British horror movie to be released in years, perhaps the best since The Wicker Man.  The scenes of an empty London are truly eerie, and the stark, bleak visuals make it an urban horror to remember.  The infecteds (NOT zombies) are not your typical George Romero monsters, i.e. slow and not much of a threat.  They are quick, savage and angry.  The use of handheld cameras and point of view put you in the centre of the action, adding to the terror.<br/><br/>The film is split in two halves thematically and narratively.  The two lead actors a terrific, but in the first half of the film Brendan Gleeson steals the show as the ideal father figure and in part 2 Christopher Eccleston is equally effective as the ruthless army man. The film has many fantastic shots, (empty London, Manchester ablaze), but there is a ten minute almost silent section of the film in which is pure cinematic poetry.  Cillian Murphy's slient, psychotic rage is captured by Boyle perfectly. When he exacts his revenge on his captors the editing, camerawork and soundtrack make it a scene to remember.<br/><br/>This film may not set the box office alight or live as long as Evil Dead or The Trilogy of the Dead, but it is better than most teen slasher flicks of the 90's and highly entertaining. It has some humorous moments too, and a shot of an entirely naked man for the ladies. Go see it!"
"PoochJD","7","0","0","24 October 2002"," Good, but flawed!
","""28 Days Later"" is an Ebola-virus type thriller, not too dissimilar to the UK TV mini-series ""CHIMERA"". Set in a post-apocalyptic, semi-futuristic time, we follow two survivors as they travel through London, to locate other people who may still be virus-free.<br/><br/>The film is good, but flawed. The first third of the film is exceptional, without a doubt: the sheer terror and brutality of what happens when Man tries playing at God! It's graphic, uncompromising, and not-at-all for the squeamish or sensitive! If you think a horror movie won't make you jump, be prepared! The final third, is also very good. However, the middle third, and the ""ending"" are pretty terrible.<br/><br/>The main problems, are down to the lack of empathy and feelings we have when the hero's meet-up with a gang of army officers, led by Brit-actor Christopher Eccleston. The men are essentially parodies of all the worst aspects of masculinity: the propensity for violence; the need to see women only as sexual objects; the laddishness. Yet, we don't really care if they make it out alive or not. Eccleston's performance is okay, but not his best, which is a real shame. His upper-class accent doesn't fit with the ""Squaddie"" character he portrays. A shame, especially when he is Manchester born and bred, and the Army squad are camped in Manchester.<br/><br/>As for the ""ending"", it really negates the film as a whole, and I suspect that 20th Century Fox may have demanded or forced the creators of this movie to tack it on, despite their protests. Even if that isn't the case, the ending ruins everything you've just watched in the preceeding two hours.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the virus isn't explained enough. We're told it was created, it exists, and has now escaped, but little else. As such, the nature of the way it can/cannot infect others, is left for audiences to accept unquestioningly.<br/><br/>As a horror film, it's good. As a British horror film, it's a real shocker. But as a complete movie, it's let down by the saggy middle part. Some trimming of this section, would have made a really tight, and raw movie. Maybe, reducing the running time to 100 minutes, perhaps. Whilst by no means a long film, as it stands, some of you may well come-out of the auditorium, feeling a little frustrated at how the film pans out. A good attempt, but not the ""finest British horror film ever made""."

","The use of digital video gives this movie a dreamlike, hallucinogenic quality that works exceptionally well, and compensates to some degree for the plot holes and patchy performances.<br/><br/>Writer Alex Garland must have been reading John Wyndham, as several plot elements - the survivor in hospital, the escaping trio (man, woman, child), the dodgy soldiers, the fortified refuge, the rural escape - mirror those in The Day Of the Triffids. Indeed, though the story has been developed into a more visceral, shock-horror flick, it could be argued that it's a better version of that book than the movie made from it in the 1960s (though not of the BBC TV series).<br/><br/>It's well-directed and edited and, by contemporary standards, less blood-drenched - therefore more interesting - than other recent efforts in the zombie/slasher/horror genre.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"SILV3R","9","0","0","8 October 2002"," The UK perspective
","Rating: TBC (lets face it, its an 18 and then some) Stars: Mainly unknowns, and Christopher Eccleston Theme: Horror/Sci-Fi/Drama Language/Nudity/Violence: Very bad language, huge amounts of violence (once sexual) When Hollywood made The Beach they gave it the usual Hollywood spin. 28 Days later is what happens when you actually let Alex Garland write the screenplay. Set in a quasi post-apocalyptic world, a virus has been let loose on an unprepared public by ill-judging but well meaning animal rights activists. It is made perfectly clear in the prologue that this is not a film for the weak of heart, or even the moderate of heart. And even the strongest stomachs can expect to be tested.<br/><br/>The Vanilla Sky sequence around a deserted London is one of the creepiest things you will have ever seen on screen. Not only will it encourage the tension and dread that the film is trying to draw out of its unsuspecting audience but it will force you to try and work out how on earth they managed to shut the entire city down. Until this point the movie has been relatively slow, but this is all about to change as the story really kicks off. It would be unfair to the film to reveal much more of the plot after this point, and even more unfair to the potential audience.<br/><br/>The cast is made up of unknowns and faces that you are sure you have seen before somewhere, but just can't place. Whether this confusion was intentional in the casting or not I'm not sure, but it certainly enhances the overall sense of displacement. Christopher Eccleston's appearance later in the film awards him with the entrance that all actors would like. Unfortunately he spends most of his role looking slightly embarrassed about being in such a trivial movie, only once enjoying himself as he torments a captive. There will not be any best actor Oscars winging their way to the cast of this movie, but they're acting ability isn't really what the movie is about. They are all perfectly acceptable as their characters, with Jimmy being the standout performance. This is a mood movie that is designed to mess with you head but not allow you enough time to work out the answers.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is essentially I high budget, intelligent and deeply scary horror film in the vain of many a 1950s B movie. This is not Eight Legged Freaks (Arach Attack), but comparisons could be made. It is darker, less humorous (although not devoid of humour), and definitely British. The main difference between this and the last decade worth of horror movies is just how possible it really is. This is not a spoilt brat slasher or alien invasion movie, this is a tangible danger that is no leap of imagination to consider real.<br/><br/>Mark: 9/10<br/><br/>Who to go with: Someone big and strong to hide behind."
"fedor8","Null","3","8","16 May 2009"," Trust Danny Boyle to get confused even by something as simple and straight-forward as the zombie sub-genre...
","28DL starts off much like ""The Quiet Earth"" and ""The World The Flesh & The Devil"", soon switching into ""The Dawn of the Dead"" mode, only to totally disappoint by going into retarded ""Day of the Dead"" territory. The bad bad evil evil military (all 8 of them) turn out to be a bigger threat than the zombies themselves - an idiotic premise already served to us 20 years earlier by the perpetually un-intellectual drivel-making liberal nincompoop, George Romero. <br/><br/>I've said this before and I'll say it again (and again): whoever (mis)uses the zombie genre to make ""clever"" political commentary needs to have their head examined. There is a time and place for everything, hence screaming, brainless, undead morons (am referring to the zombies, not Hollywood's horror directors) do not a proper background for social satire make.<br/><br/>The problem with the third part of the movie (the army part) is that zombies are completely pushed aside. Boyle, in his infinite and typical lack of wisdom, switches off the by-then seemingly limitless supply of zombies, turning 28DL into a mere cheap exploitation thriller with effeminate post-apocalyptic Cillian saving damsels in distress from an almost certain destiny of getting raped by a bunch of horny soldiers. I sort of half-assumed they'd rape Cillian first, what with his unusually high estrogen levels. Let's face it, even those two girls look less female than he does. When will this current trend of casting hermaphroditic ""males"" as screen heroes finally end? How many more Di Caprios does the movie world need? Who has stolen all of the testosterone from the modern male? <br/><br/>Thrillers are by far the dumbest genre: far-fetched plots, plenty of illogicality, poor and often contradictory character development, etc... The worst aspect of Boyle's version of ""Day of the Dead"" was Bambi-like Cillian becoming Rambo - killing off the scared, incompetent little soldiers as if they were a bunch of kids and amateurs. Remember: Cillian started off as a skinny nerd, recovering from both the injuries that brought him to the hospital in the first place, and the disorientation caused by the world he found after he woke up. Plus, also remember: these soldiers were not only trained for combat, but they belonged to a small number who actually managed to survive the virus. So obviously musculary-challenged, X-legged Cillian bumps them all off as if they were mere flies in his soup...<br/><br/>Baby-faced Cillian strips off his shirt like a WWF wrestler and proceeds to stalk, kill and destroy enemy targets like a computer-game soldier in heat. That was the point at which I had to start laughing. I always appreciate a good comedy, but something tells me that Boyle's tiny mind had different intentions...<br/><br/>Apparently, it doesn't take (British) soldiers long (several weeks?) to become stark raving sex maniacs, hell-bent on killing off males and screwing females. Boyle's understanding of human psychology is catastrophic - mildly put. But what else can one expect from a director who in all honesty and wide-eyed naive enthusiasm promoted ""Sunshine"" as a serious sci-fi film? Boyle can barely handle i.e. understand zombie psychology, let alone human.<br/><br/>Politically correct - hence stupid - ending with the two females being the sole survivors. Who would have ""thunk"" it?! So predictable...<br/><br/>What's with that post-end-credits final twist? Was Boyle trying to start a new trend? ""Watch the WHOLE movie, if you wanna see the REAL ending"". What a boyle on my movie bum Danny's turned out to be post-""Trainspotting""...<br/><br/>I love the way the girl's father gets killed: that drop of blood falling from a dried up zombie should get an Oscar. An Oscar for Silliest Horror Film Scene Of The Year.<br/><br/>Boyle still seems to be confused about movie genres, particularly horror and comedy."

","Title: 28 days later<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle<br/><br/>Stars: Cilliam Murphy, Noah Huntley, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns<br/><br/>Review: <br/><br/>I finally got to see this film after much anticipation and was very pleased. The waiting was well worth the wait. The film is effectively creepy and scary and demonstrates that not a lot of cgi or a huge budget is needed to effectively scare the pants of an audience.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is familiar since we've seen this sort of apocalyptic theme played out before in many films. This time around my hat goes down to Danny Boyle for creating a truly deserted and isolated place! It literally looks like no ones living in London! No one! Except maybe a few rabid raging zombies here and there. This idea of a desolated earth has been done before many times in films like George Romeros Dead Trilogy, Escape from New York, The Omega Man, Mad Max and The Quiet Earth, so the premise isn't necessarily something new, still it manages to impress. Empty streets, news papers with doomsday headlines of contagion spreading world wide, missing peoples pictures all over the city. All elements that enhance the feeling of desolation.<br/><br/>The main character Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a desolated world. This is one of those films that continuously makes you ask yourself, what would I do if this were happening to me? To me that is really something, because it lets me know that I'm really into this film, and in the theater I was watching it in, the audience had the same reaction. <br/><br/>This film takes a lot of inspiration from previous zombie films, there are moments here and their that will instantly remind you of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. I think its cool that this film takes inspiration in Romeros now classic zombie films. I'm fine with paying homage to other films, just as long as the filmmakers give it their own special touch, and Danny Boyle certainly did that. <br/><br/>One of the most interesting factors from this film is the level of reality displayed. Never for a minute did I feel I was watching some popcorn/summer flick (not that I hate those) but rather, this film had a realistic tone that really augmented the horror scenes. The scenes that would make you jump out of your seat. Be on the look out, there are some genuine scares on this one! After you see how crazy and vicious the infected are you are genuinely concerned that one of those crazy zombies will pop out of nowhere an mess everything up for the survivors. In other words, you never feel safe.<br/><br/>The zombie effects were different, not a lot o latex going on here, but trust me that is not a bad thing. These zombies look scary as hell...its all in those crazy red and yellow eyes. Its more about the ferociousness that they attack. <br/><br/>The performances are great, and intense. I loved the chemistry between Jim and Selena. I cared for Frank and his daughter and wanted everything to work out OK for them! I really cared for these characters and didn't want anything to happen to them and that says something about a performance. I really admire Danny Boyle for making a truly horrifying zombie flick with such a limited budget. Yay for Danny Boyle, now go see 28 days later! <br/><br/>Rating: 5 out of 5"

From the beginning until the end this movie was able to fascinate me, thanks to the excellent music, the interesting way of filming, the nice acting, the very good story,...<br/><br/>The movie starts with some environmental activists who have broken into a test lab where chimps are being used as guinea-pigs for all kinds of scientific experiments.

Jim is a young bicycle courier in London who has been in a coma because of a car accident. When he wakes up from his coma, the hospital where he's being treated is empty, as is the entire city of London. At first he thinks there is no living soul left in the city, until he finds some people in an abandoned church... all infected by the virus (which he doesn't know yet of course). He gets out alive and meets some other non-infected people.

It has nothing to do with that and I'm very glad about that. I find zombie movies rather lame and stupid to be honest, but I definitely can't say the same about this movie. This one is absolutely great and underrated by many... It's full of suspense, it's blood-chilling, it has an apocalyptic feeling and is more than just another slasher/zombie/horror flick... I reward this movie with an 8.5/10, perhaps even a 9/10."

","What a shame that a the first British film for a long time to make substantial use of central London (and which must have been difficult and costly to set up) should fall so far flat after the first few minutes. The film's premise is that a virus with a very (and I mean very) short incubation period has broken out of a research laboratory and has rampaged across the country in just 28 days, killing most of the population and leaving the rest as zombies (sorry, it's not a zombie film, it's a parable about epidemiology) who rage and scream and just want to infect the survivors.<br/><br/>Well, in even trying to describe the premise you can see where it begins to collapse. Why do the (non-)zoms want to infect the healthy, when there's nothing in it for them and they're going to die ? (If they don't die, the country's population would still all be running and jumping around, and there wouldn't have been the Omega Man scenario at the start, would there ?) How long does it take for the Infected (for that's what they are called, friends turning to fiends in seconds) to snuff it ? If the infected only come out to play after nightfall (or so it seems from the opening sequence), why do they later chase about in the daytime ?<br/><br/>I do like zombie films, really I do, and Trainspotting and Shallow Grave. But Danny Boyle's grasp of pacing, dialogue and character development seems to have deserted him this time. We get a series of unconnected lurches from good guy to bad guy, healthy to infected, alive to dead, with nary a consistent theme or underlying thread to hold our attention or suspend disbelief. And in any kind of post-apocalypse scenario, zom-fest (sorry there I go again) or just plain horror film, that is precisely what we need to do. The attempts to portray group bonding among the fugitive survivors are so bad that we just don't care what happens to them. Even Christopher Eccleston is uncertain how to play his role (as well he might be), coming over as neither sane nor demented (he's supposed to have gone mad, what with all the killing) but directionless. And as for the rest of the squaddies in his bunch of military survivors, the least said the better.<br/><br/>There is just one memorable scene, after the man-wakes-up-in-deserted-London opener. A taxi drives along an empty motorway with a burning city (Manchester) in the distance, to Fauré's Requiem. And Cillian Murphy is clearly a lot better than this nonsensical ragbag of a film suggests. <br/><br/>Fast editing, blood vomiting and over-used profanities do not a lasting impression make, and I've forgotten most of it already. If your attention span's more than 28 minutes, you will too."
"TxMike","Null","2","5","7 February 2005"," ""Staying alive is as good as it gets."" (Selena)
","""28 Days Later"" opens with views of rioting and other violence all over the world, then the camera gradually pulls back to show us a Chimp, strapped down, being shown these images at a Primate Research center via multiple monitors. Activists break in to free the Chimps, ignoring a warning that they are infected with a new ""rage"" virus that spreads very quickly and those infected are in a constant ""rage"" and, quite miraculously, only attack those who do NOT have the virus. So, this movie is about what could happen if, through carelessness, humankind unleashed a devastating virus that would threaten to destroy all of civilization. I quite enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect by any stretch, but held my interest to the closing credits, and beyond, with some interesting ""extras"" on the DVD.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. The main story starts ""28 days later"", we see Jim naked in a hospital bed, no one else around. He strips off the tubes, grabs some scrubs, and takes a stroll into London. All the familiar landmarks, not a person or moving vehicle in sight. The only sounds we hear are the fluttering wings of pigeons. Newspaper headlines tell of the virus and the exodus of British from their island. However the news stops after reporting that large cities like New York and Paris are infected, so the virus may have spread all over the world. For anyone not yet infected, ""Staying alive is as good as it gets"", says Selena.<br/><br/>Jim gets away from some ""infected"" he encounters, and ends up with Selena, plus Frank and his 14 year old daughter, Hannah. They have a self-powered radio, randomly scan and hear a broadcast message telling of a safe place and possible cure northeast of Manchester. The next third of the movie is a road trip, as they find a taxi and supplies from a grocery store and head north, on deserted main highways. They approach Manchester and see the whole city in flames and smoke. Frank gets infected when, looking up in a barn, has a drop of fluid from a dead body drop into his eye. Almost immediately in a rage, we hear gunshots, see the soldiers, the three survivors are taken to the compound. <br/><br/>They think they are safe, but Jim learns from the commander of the nine men, ""I promised them women"", there really was no cure, the message was just to try to get women. Jim reacts by trying to run away with Selena and Hannah, but is subdued and taken out by two rogues to be shot. He escapes, looks up to see commercial jet contrails, knows there is hope, eventually gets the best of all of the others, he and the two women escape in the taxi. They end up in a country farmhouse, Selena sews sheets and other fabrics together to make a very large 'H E L L O' which is seen by a jet fighter flying low, and we suspect they will join other survivors and begin to re-populate the world."

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>I was excited going into this movie. Zombies. British. British zombies. End of the world. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a classic example of over hyped mania. This movie does not reinvent horror. Nor is it terrifying. Nor does it fit into any other adjective spit out by some overpaid blurb writer. This is what it is: Post apocalyptic survivors going from one desolate English town to another while they try to connect with each other. Scares are scarce.<br/><br/>""HELLOOOOOOOO?!"" Remember that word. It's the theme of this movie. It's about connecting, dang it! How would you handle the world flipping upside down? What choices would you make to survive? Would you be able to make hard decisions at a moments notice? Like bashing the head in of some drooling, raging maniac? Not a hard choice at all for me. Of course I would. Gladly.<br/><br/>
This is not a horror movie. It's a sci-fi thriller that's low on thrills. There are no zombies either. Like Umberto Lenzi's ""Nightmare City"", they are infected with some sort of virus, (The Rage Virus), and go about randomly attacking people. Unlike ""Nightmare City"", this movie is not fun at all. All the attacks are shot ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" style. Very fast speed. Also, most of the attacks are in the dark so you'll have double trouble actually telling what in the heck is going on. But the big problem is that the ""zombies"" are not attacking nearly enough. That might be because the ""zombies"" are not what this movie is about. It's about connecting, rebuilding, desolation, empty streets, nothingness, no future, dreary English musings on life, etc. When you have a horror movie that is not about the horror, that's the first sign that something is stinky.<br/><br/>When the survivors run into the soldiers near the end, the movie picks up a bit. There is some infected action and suspense. But by the end I had had it with this world and was ready for them all to be infected. It would have made the movie livelier. The hype surrounding this movie definitely plays a part in my disliking this film. I don't know what difference it would have made if I had went in cold. My dad saw it with me and gave it a B. He knew nothing about the flick before sitting down to watch it. If you walk into the movie theater healthy and hype free, you may think ""28 Days Later"" is fair.

Not even blood around in the streets to show signs of attacks or peril. It had no real beginning, and i have seen snails move faster then this movie did. The acting was horrible. Ive seen singers and sports stars act better then these people did. the ending.. what ending. was it just another way to have a sequel? Lord i hope not. 16 bucks later I am sorry to say that I could have brought four Frappachinos with that money. I could say again that this movie sucked but it was being giving it justice if i say it sucked it sucked more the i can imagine a movie sucking.

All it gave me was the 'dabs' as I wiped away the tears after wasting eight quid and the best part of two precious hours on this badly executed, cruddy dialogue-ridden tripe.<br/><br/>A man-made virus infects almost everyone, turning Britain into a nation of bloodthirsty lunatics (nothing new there, then). So when the 'infecteds' are around, which isn't nearly enough, this is almost fun. There's an interminably boring middle section involving a drive from London to Manchester which is about as exciting as the real thing, then we're holed up with a ragtag band of soldiers who turn out to be as mad and bad as the infecteds. The clichés and plot contrivances rain thick and fast (hey, wonder what'll happen to that infected grunt they've got tied up out back?) before the bloody and bloody silly denouement. And somehow the hero, not-so-fresh out of hospital, turns into some sort of Bruce Willis/Jet Li character at the end. Don't get me wrong, I can suspend disbelief with the best of 'em, but come on...

(It sort of reminds me of Dawn of the Dead remake, the most similar one I can think of right now. But Dawn was a classic straight forward horror, it did not leave deep impressions) I was so grossed out by 28 days =.="" but it's been a day that I watched it, I can't exactly translate my thoughts to words as to why that was the case though I suspect I was suffering from an overdose of sheer brutality. By the end my desire to analyze the symbolisms or metaphors whatever that some claimed was abundant became nil. The way the storyline was constructed--disturbing, the way the fight scene was constructed--disturbing. I do not like the ending and cannot sympathize with any of the main characters. Some spoilers: I had left the TV room with 2 scenes firmly attached to my head, one in the beginning when Frank was disposed (When i watched Hotel Rwanda, the main character said something to the effect of ""the machete is no way to die, I'd rather you take the kids and jump off the top of the building"" I concur with that)and the other near the end when some soldier died (or just paralyzed by shock?) because Jim managed to stuck his thumbs into his eye sockets and pressed....and pressed...(can you really die from that? I don't know but anyways...)The infected humans on the other hand are not scary since all they do is pretty much chasing after uninfected people, spitting blood and attacking victims with fists teeth and all but no tools off camera. The atmosphere didn't strike me as tense, it is almost carried out at a leisure pace until the final scene in the military mansion where we see Jim had come back with his own type of rage....<br/><br/>Obviously this movie have done its job projecting its horrible images and mentality into me and perhaps some others. mission accomplished as a horror movie so much so it deserve a 10 but watching it had left me with such mental burden I'd rather give it a 10 in then negative direction and due to the fact that you cannot give negative ratings I gave it a 1. Be forewarned that this movie is twisted in the mental sense. Not a movie for everyone.

"cheungnicholas","1","2","6","29 June 2003"," A Total Mortification of the Movie Industry, Especially of the British
","This movie is a total disappointment. I feel utterly indignant and cheated as a movie-goer and a consumer of the movie ticket. I also find myself a complete idiot to have even considered seeing this movie in the first place. Not only was this movie a humiliation of the viewers' intelligence, but it was also a complete fiasco, either as a scary movie, or a zombie movie. Basically, it's the type of movie that you want it to end, but it just doesn't and keeps going nowhere. This two-hour movie is a total torture for the audience and simply doesn't do justice to the theatres and it explains why the British can't dominate the movie industry as the Americans do.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie never explains clearly why it starts off the way it is (why's the protagonist, Jim, lying alone on a hospital bed naked. And miraculously a vulnerable man like him didn't get infected like the others.) It also never explains clearly how the monkeys got infected with the virus and it becomes just a cursory set-up of the story. As well, the beginning is a complete drag as it's almost a fifteen-minute running around in a city in England that is already evacuated. The beginning and the end just don't make for a good movie and don't integrate with each other, especially when the viewers also have to put up with the mundane and uneventful middle section.<br/><br/>
Secondly, much part of the movie is unnecessary. I'm not going to elaborate it as I don't want to give the plot away. The trip to the army base can't be more boring and unsurprising. Many audiences would just want to make use of this part as a bathroom break, as a lot of people in the theatre actually did. And most of the 'jokes' are so pathetic that the audience would laugh at, but simply because there's nothing else in the movie that the viewers could appreciate and is worth laughing.<br/><br/>Thirdly, if you're looking forward to seeing a scary zombie movie, I'm sorry. The episodic and predictable zombie popping out of nowhere and their annoying squeaky voices can only drive you crazy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie could've redeemed itself when it comes to the part when the survivors meet the soldiers if it dwells on a little bit more explaining the intrinsic evilness of human nature and makes it the movie's theme. But instead, the director didn't use this part wisely and it is shown so ambiguous and hasty that it becomes just some bloody, pointless carnage. You'll wind up cursing the characters for what they've done to each other. Jim comes off as a reckless maniac and a psycho, so as the head of the army. Hence, the movie itself is not thought-provoking at all and just ends up going nowhere and having no theme at all. The movie barely has any plot and character development. It spends too much time showing how deserted the cities in England and how gross the zombies are, but lacks the right development that a movie should have. The interactions between the main characters are very contrived and reveals little of their personalities. Many characters eventually become a bunch of one-dimensional characters. As a result, you don't feel for the characters in the movie and sometimes you'd even hope that they'd die soon so you could go home earlier with your frustration.<br/><br/>This movie simply doesn't make an iota of sense (The story itself is already so stretched and contrived; if most part of England was infected, why isn't there any foreign assistance? Why the other countries just quarantined England? What the hell is the U.N and Uncle Same doing?). The title 28-days have nothing to do with the plot but simply just a haphazard number of days that the story goes along, and it also doesn't fit the tagline: The days are numbered. The scenes are gross and crude but not SCARY. They're only meant to gross the audience out. The British ended up being a despicable copycat of the American Resident Evil by producing a sub-standard version of a zombie movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, why can't the British make something better out of their sophistication?  I thought this is part of their tradition, but maybe I'm mistaken.<br/><br/>Rating: 0/10"

","This has been on my watchlist for ages. I never knew about the movie when it was new but at some point started seeing the title everywhere and started wondering if the popularity means it's some sort of classic. Now I did finally watch it. But it wasn't the classic I was hoping for. Quite the contrary.<br/><br/>The concept is ok. Somewhere between Romero's ""Dead"" movies, Stephen King's ""The Stand"", with resemblance also to the 1985 movie ""The Quiet Earth"" the story is ok (yet reminds of those numerous other movies a bit too much, but that doesn't matter if the movie is enjoyable.)<br/><br/>The real problem is the camerawork. There's ""shaky cam"", a lot of tilted angles for no reason, fast-forward effect, extreme closeups, random framing of the picture... I don't have anything against experimental ideas if they makes the result look good but here it just feels like this was shot by some wannabe-artistic teenager who doesn't know anything about camerawork and just tries to be edgy by holding the camera in all possible weird directions. I guess this kind of style was popular in the early 2000's (in the wake of ""Blair Witch Project""?) Even if the story was good it's hard to enjoy because all the time the visual style feels annoying to look at.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't find the movie really scary. Even though it has horror elements I'd more likely describe the mood as unsettling in a psychological thriller style. The story is a bit better than the visual style but still nothing really special. Quite basic apocalyptic/zombie/survival kind of thing. Characters and acting are ok but nothing really stands out.<br/><br/>Overall: I didn't like it. In the early 2000's there was a phase when I quit watching brand new movies altogether and started to protest by collecting old Dracula's and such. This movie makes me remember exactly why I felt that way."

","Danny Boyle's science fiction/horror film 28 Days Later was a critical and commercial success, which owes much, I suspect, to its post-apocalyptic theme, capturing a mood prevalent after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Many viewers noted the similarity of the kiosk in the film, covered with notices posted by people searching for lost friends and relatives, to the real ones posted in New York City after the fall of the World Trade Center towers -- a prescient touch on the part of the filmmakers, since the scene was shot before the terrorist attack and its aftermath. It has also been an influential film, helping spark an interest in ""zombie""* movies and TV shows. After a prologue that shows how animal-rights activists attacked a research laboratory and unwittingly released a virus that causes uncontrollable rage in its victims and is spread by contact with blood and saliva, the film's protagonist, Jim (Cillian Murphy), wakes up from a coma in a London hospital to discover that he has been abandoned there and that the streets outside are empty. (The premise of someone waking up from a coma to discover a world depopulated by an incurable virus was repeated by the creators of The Walking Dead, first for the graphic novel published in 2003 and later for the TV series that began in 2010.) Jim soon discovers that he is not entirely alone: He is attacked by people infected with the virus and rescued by two who weren't: Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Unfortunately, Mark gets bitten by one of the infected and has to be killed, allowing Selena to explain that the disease takes hold swiftly and is incurable. Naomie and Jim then discover two more survivors, Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns), who have a crank-operated radio that has picked up a signal from survivors north of Manchester calling for others to join them. Frank is infected and killed during their perilous drive northward, and Jim, Selena, and Hannah discover that the survivors are in a well-armed military outpost under the command of Maj. Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). It turns out that West has been sending out the signals especially to attract women to service his sex-starved troops, which means not only that Selena and Hannah are in danger of rape but also that Jim is expendable. Before he helps Selena and Hannah escape, Jim also hears the theory of a soldier opposed to West that the virus has not in fact spread worldwide: that it has been contained in other countries and that the island of Britain is quarantined -- a theory that Jim confirms for himself when he sees the contrails of a jet plane flying high overhead. The released film ends happily -- or at least hopefully -- when Jim, Selena, and Hannah, having escaped, construct a giant ""HELLO"" sign that is spotted by a plane flying reconnaissance over the cottage where they live. It's not the preferred ending of director Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland, who proposed a bleaker resolution of the story that failed with test audiences. Well-directed and -acted, 28 Days Later does what it's designed to do: build suspense and provide interesting characters. It also resonates nicely with our paranoia about pandemic infections in the age of HIV, Ebola, and the annual influenza scare . But it doesn't hold up well under the old test of Questions You're Not Supposed to Ask: like, why has Jim been abandoned, stark naked and comatose, in a hospital? If the hospital was attacked by the infected, why wasn't he attacked? If it was evacuated -- we see a newspaper headline, EVACUATION, at one point - - why was he left behind? How did he survive unattended for 28 days with only an IV drip that would have run out in a few hours? If the rest of the world is safe and only Britain is quarantined, why doesn't Frank's radio pick up international broadcasts? Where are the humanitarian operations like the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders? And so on....<br/><br/>*The infected in 28 Days Later aren't technically zombies. i.e. animated dead people. They're still alive, and they can be killed by ordinary means like shooting or stabbing them.<br/><br/>(charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)"

","a well-acted, well directed, and well written scary movie. Director Danny Boyle keeps the audience off-balance. Nightmarish quick cuts and digital video give the look of the movie a gritty, hallucinatory immediacy. Boyle also makes brilliant use of the empty artifacts, from the deserted London streets to a once-magnificent Gosford Park-style country house, now occupied by military, who eat rotting food around the table once used for glittering parties. Each character gets just one defining quality (idealistic Jim, tough Selena, stout-hearted Frank, ingenue Hannah), but that just adds to the sense of urgency -- we don't have time to get to know them, just as they don't have time to get to know one another....Desolate and empty London streets. An upturned bus. A solitary man's echoing 'Hello?' sends pigeons fleeing. Simple imagery, but stunningly effective.Danny Boyle can't be typed as a director. This guy is all over the board. He has a great feel for horror though, making very sure that he knows what really is scary. There is some blood, no doubt, but this isn't a spoon-fed easy horror, but more of an unseen menace. Even when the ""Infected"" are (quite literally) in your face, the camera is shaky and quick cuts are used to break up what you see and blur comprehension. Boyle also knows when to rely on action and when to slow things down. He never seems to be in a hurry, and allows the audience to get to know the characters on their own. Nothing is ever over-explained here at all, and any small lapses are acceptable due to the focus."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","1","2","11 October 2011"," It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...
","28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.<br/><br/>When animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as ""Rage"", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...<br/><br/>28 days later...<br/><br/>The amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day).<br/><br/>There's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 Weeks Later"". It's not as raw as ""Days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.<br/><br/>A great cast and premise get down and dirty In a sharply executed infected based horror. 8.5/10"

","As funny as it may sound, this movie reminded me the case of another infamous film trying to combine two half-stories to make them match into a solid one and falls short : ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"".<br/><br/>First, Max finds problems in a post-apocalyptic city in the desert, then gets cast away and discovers a children colony living in caves. Then, the film has to move on the best it can and the script wreckage begins. <br/><br/>Same with ""28 days later"" : The first part is a decent usual 'horror/survival/road trip/bound of trust between characters' drama that works pretty well with suspense, fear and tension, plus a touching background of sadness and even despair <br/><br/>Then the second part begins with some military unit that makes us all think about ""Lord of the Flies"" - and the audience might feel a bit cheated on at that point, for that infamous ""Solution for Infection"" message is in fact a let down from the very first minutes the survivors join the group.<br/><br/>And for the third act, the script writer has to prove his brain muscles out to make the two half-stories fit  and fail he does. <br/><br/>In order to make the story move on, illogical twists keep going : the hard-boiled girl who once killed her only friend with a machete blade because he got infected now becomes a poor wining-crying doll; the young lady who needed care and protection simply vanishes from all pieces of dialog and the skinny-and-shy-and-uncompetitive bicycle courier turns out to become a stealth commando expert who can defeat 5 or 6 trained military men loaded with weapons. <br/><br/>Not to mention an eerie upbeat happy ending where many viewers thought there would be a 'Planet of the Apes'-like strong and unforgettable conclusion. <br/><br/>Good directing, good actors, nice cinematography and a touch of sadness... but definitely too many scripts holes.

"joeyseattle30","Null","1","2","10 January 2009"," Fantastic 2/3rds of a film, skip the last 3rd
","I rate this film based on a weighted average of 9 out of 10 for the beginning up until the scene where the father is shot, and 1 out of 10 for the rest.<br/><br/>The 'infected' in this film changed my notion of what a zombie like creature could be. Unlike the stumbling, sleep walking, flesh-feaster's of Romero (although respectable in their own right) Ferocious, sprinting and scrambling, the infected chase their prey like a starving rabid dog chancing upon a chicken coup.<br/><br/>The scenes of desolation and emptiness around some famous landmarks at the beginning I found captivating & moody. I also got a kick out of the main protagonist finding money strewn all about the streets, collecting some in his bag as well as the free shop the group had in the supermarket.<br/><br/>As in many fine horror films, the horror of some scenes come from the mind of the viewer while a character describes an experience rather than us being shown it directly (e.g seven). I thought the scene with one of the male characters describing he and his families attempt to flee the city near the beginning of the outbreak to be hauntingly evocative.<br/><br/>I really liked the idea of instantaneous infection & transformation from Jekyll to Hyde. It avoided the well used plot device in zombie films of having a loved character accidentally bitten & infected, and the moral dilemma about whether to kill them now or wait to see if they turn. In this film the precious few seconds available between infection and morphing, gave rise to some of the most visceral and heart-racing scenes of the film for me.<br/><br/>Up until the father was unfortunate enough to take the wrong kind of eye drop, i found myself utterly engrossed in the story and wondering, really wondering where the solemn adventure would take the group.<br/><br/>Unfortunately from there the movie degenerated into a sick and disturbing action piece. Jim & the girls find the source of the radio broadcast offering an answer to infection, in the form of a bunch of army guys holing out in a well defended country house.<br/><br/>It seems all that is on the minds of these men & the reason for them broadcasting the signal for the uninfected from around the country to rendezvous near the house, keeping in mind their dwindling number of soldiers, their lack of food and the need to constantly monitor the area around the house from the constant threat of the zombies, well the only thing on their minds seems to be to find some women to rape! 28 days later from the collapse of society as they know it, instead of seeking out ways to contact the outside world for rescue, or worrying about starving to death,or being attacked by ravenous sub-humans, they are trying to trick some chicks into coming to their house so that they can have sex. Well, Jim does not want to play along with it like a good sport so the army dudes dump him outside the confines of the house leaving him a prey for the infected. Luckily for Jim and the girls though, before he slipped into his coma, this bicycle courier had watched the movies commando and die hard at least twice, drawing on that knowledge and with the help of an infected he just about single handedly, unarmed, kills all of the trained army men and manages to escape with his friends to a beautiful spot in the country where they apparently live in peace until a plane flies overhead signaling their rescue.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the beginning and middle of the film had me glued to the screen and the only reason I sat though the disturbing last part must have been I was glued to my chair."

","To be very frank, I really don't think this is such a phenomenal movie after all.<br/><br/>The film takes off well, however it loses its direction in the middle, and completely messes up in the end! This is exactly what happens when one has a great plot in hand and does a sloppy execution of it.<br/><br/>However, the actors are definitely the saving grace for the movie. Great performance from him as always. And Boyle definitely knows how to direct.<br/><br/>Agreed that the movie has a chilling storyline, but there are far too many flaws and mistakes around. In fact even a single watch is sufficient to spot some of them! And the worst part of it is after making such a great start to the movie, the director just seems to lose it all thereafter. He fumbles with the ending and what you get is a really irritating termination of what could have been one of the best science-fiction movies ever.<br/><br/>As soon as the gang reach the weird military quarters, the film ends."

","I just saw ""28 Days Later"" for the first time on DVD and I say it's GREAT!!! Danny Boyle has really outdid himself by turning the genre on its head and bringing something new and fresh to audiences and the critics loved it since it's first release back in 2002; especially Ebert&Roeper. True, the plot may be Sci-Fi in nature but on the surface, it's more like a metaphor for all the violence and chaos raging throughout our ""normal"" society and is so plausible that its really horrifying and disturbing. The ""Rage"" virus captures that dark aspect of humanity and the characters personify it beautifully unlike any Zombie/Horror movie I've ever saw. Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye) is simply awesome as is Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, and Christopher Eccleston, all who give terrific performances. I really liked Megan Burns as Frank's daughter who comes across as resourceful but also vulnerable and innocent. There are many scenes that were shocking and heartbreaking that can make you feel sad and bring you to tears; especially the post-apocalyptic, deserted scenes of London, once teeming with life but is now an empty shell of itself. The only problem I have is that the ending was a little too upbeat. Still, 28 Days Later is the best film of the genre that I ever saw. Watch it on a big-screen TV to get the full effect of this groundbreaking movie.<br/><br/>Superbly awesome. Best I've ever seen in years."

The ending is a tiny bit on the sappy side, but i didn't mind that at all, even though some people probably would.

"Robert_duder","7","1","2","15 December 2007"," Cult classic certainly spins a different sort of genre
","28 Days Later is not a zombie film. It's usually mistakenly referred to as that and usually compared with Night of The Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead and the likes and the comparisons are not unfounded but still very misguided. I think director and creator Danny Boyle created something very unique and introspective when it comes to the horror zombie genre. Somewhere amidst the gore and gratuitous bad language is some sort of moral about people and survival and people killing people but it's kind of lost in the fact that ultimately this is a horror, blood splashing gore fest with zombie like creatures that are still not intelligent but fast moving and really angry. The landscape of England is a brutally isolated and disturbing setting for the film and the gray and dreariness of it really puts you in the mood for the story. Enter not only terrifying rage filled human creatures but deranged and sadistic soldiers and a small group of survivors who bond over their situation. The great thing about this film compared to something like Night of The Living Dead and the sequels and remakes and such is that 28 Days Later has far more of an interesting story complete with an actual beginning, climax and end and surprisingly the ending is almost a happy one or has the potential for a happy ending.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy, looking disturbingly sickly and pale, plays Jim, the hero to the story. Murphy is terrific in this role because he's dark and mysterious but quickly adapts to having to survive. I almost didn't recognize Murphy because his performance was so different from his more mainstream films as of late. He didn't look as evil and bad guy as he usually does but instead plays Jim with a certain subtly and importance and his character really changes throughout. Naomie Harris plays Selena, another survivor who ends up teamed up with Jim after saving his life. Harris is the perfect balance to Murphy's Jim. Whereas Jim is quiet, subtle, and dark, Selena is loud and bold, and touch and strong but still needs rescuing and needs to find faith again that all is not lost. Harris and Murphy have good chemistry and do a terrific job. Megan Burns is decent as the youngest group of their survival squad, Hannah. She has a lot of importance to the story and seems to become a hope for survival to Jim as he protects her. Unfortunately her role lacks something and she comes across as a little boring at times. Brendan Gleeson also plays a small yet very important role as Hannah's father Frank. He's a strong, down to earth character that will stop at nothing to protect his daughter.<br/><br/>28 Days Later wasn't perfect. I didn't find it overtly scary as much as it was disturbing in a political and real way. The humans gone mad were far scarier than the ones infected. There were no jumps or chills just a lot of gore and blood and a half decent story as well. It felt like the type of movie that would jump start a series (which they are now into the second film which I can't wait to see.) Still as I stated earlier 28 Days Later is something completely different from an overplayed and dull genre and bravo to them for doing that. A strong cast and a decent story makes for a cult classic to say the least and I do see why people love it. I just thought it was a little dull at times and didn't really move at the pace that I had hoped. After watching the DVD's and the alternate endings I am really glad they ended it the way they did. It would have been very stereotypical for them to kill off everyone or almost everyone in the main cast but instead they actually spun it with a potentially happy ending. Part of the moral of the film is that Jim is determined to prove to Selena that all is not lost and that rings true in the end making everything fit together. Overall a good strong movie that many love. Definitely worth seeing if you're tired of the same old Zombie crap out there. 7/10"

","It's interesting to see how popular a movie can get despite being derivative to the extreme. I guess this simply means that not enough people have yet seen George Romero's zombie trilogy, or classic British apocalypse TV such as Day Of The Triffids or the mid-70s ""The Survivors"". Making a good genre movie doesn't simply mean patching together all the familiar elements of the genre; you have to add a new twist or a new aesthetic to it. I can't say that ""28 Days Later"" does any of this.<br/><br/>The first 1/3rd of the movie is excellent, gaining strength from the predictable yet very spooky images of a London completely empty from people. Cillian Murphy immediately wins the viewers sympathy, and carries the whole movie in a way that the director & writer should be quite grateful for. Unfortunately I think there is a slackening of pace and narrative grip in the middle third, which is the encounter and northbound car journey with another couple of survivors. The two female roles aren't properly developed, and I personally think the actors can't match Murphy & Gleeson... it really does feel like an old TV series here, briefly.<br/><br/>The last third is very uneven; it covers familiar territory while making some interesting points; the direction is alternately confused and inspired, and there is a definite weakening from insufficient exposition of the soldiers as group and individuals. A lot is asked from the viewer here, and it seemed sloppy and B-movie like, compared to the first third.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie tries to combine two powerful (yet familiar) themes into one, and a proper balance is not achieved. A different editing of the storyline would probably have improved things, but ultimately it is a case of a well-known and thus predictable story, whose first hour or so still works well thanks to atmosphere and acting, which cannot maintain its strength until the end. All in all, I was a little disappointed, but still found the movie worth watching."
"Jake_MABS","9","1","2","8 October 2007"," 28 Days Later - A lesson in Horror.
","The brilliantly directed Danny Boyle film '28 Days Later' started as a little known film circulating cinemas across the country. Through word of mouth and the critically acclaimed director Danny Boyle the film started to get the recognition it deserved. The mixture of superb cinematography and unique camera angles give this horror film an 'arty' edge which in my opinion put's this horror film a cut above most others. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's (Author of 'The Beach' and 'The Tesseract') adaptation of the rage filled zombie's is also a welcome relief from our stereotypical brain dead, gormless zombie's that appear in films such as 'Resident Evil' and 'Land of the Dead, with the horror being generated from a mass epidemic spreading across a country and maybe the world. The acting within the film is well thought out (with some exceptions) with clever casting of Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson all with staring roles and all have gone on to other big Hollywood movies, the only down side is the acting of Brendan Gleesons daughter who's acting can only be described as terrible. Overall the breath of fresh air that '28 Days Later' brought to the zombie/horror sub genre was almost a rejuvenation for zombie films. The mix of clever directing and sheer terror seen throughout the film makes it without doubt my favourite horror film, above titles such as ""The Shining', 'Halloween'' and 'The Exorcist'.

","I can't say that this one is exactly... a classic.

It's basically just another zombie film.<br/><br/>However, it has some interesting twists. Instead of seeing the same old, same old, they twist it up a bit. The infected has involuntary muscle spasms, and will be running around like maniacs at the sight of ""prey"". There's no reasoning with these. There is no tying them up and teaching them meaning to life. Not here. And that's a slight beauty of it.<br/><br/>I can most certainly say, though, that it's sequel, ""28 Weeks Later"" is far, far better. There's much more action, much more drama, and a lot more horror.

For me though it took up until the survivors were 'rescued' by the soldiers for the film to come to life, definitely the second portion of the film was far more superior to the first and things got much better from them on.<br/><br/>I like Danny Boyle's work, always have and the look and sound of the film was a major highlight, it gave our cinema sound system an excellent work out but looking at the film as a whole only lets me rate it as a 6...maybe it would have been different if I would have not looked at the ratings first and expected more...but I have the DVD for a week so it will be getting watched again."
"MaxBorg89","9","1","2","22 April 2007"," A compelling, artful, very British take on the zombie genre
","Having made his name with dark, grotesque comedies or dramas like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle didn't seem like an obvious choice for directing a zombie movie. But then again, appearances can be deceiving, and as it turns out, Boyle's gritty, low-budget take on the genre is one of the best horror films to have been produced in the last decade.<br/><br/>In fact, the Z-word (as it's lovingly referred to in the hilarious Shaun of the Dead) is never used in the film, perhaps because the director prefers not to call his work a ""zombie film"". Instead, the undead are called ""infected"", as the whole story begins with a raid in a lab, where a very powerful virus is accidentally released. At this point, the scene fades to black, followed by the caption ""28 days later..."" (hence the title). And that's when the movie really kicks in: an average Brit named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital and goes out in the street to look for help, only to find the whole of London completely abandoned (a truly unsettling sequence), safe for the infected, constantly running (maybe that's where Zack Snyder came up with the idea of fast zombies in the Dawn of the Dead remake) in search of human flesh. Having been saved by the disillusioned (and very tough) Selena (Naomie Harris), Jim decides to join her and her allies in an attempt to find a place where a peaceful life is still an option.<br/><br/>At this point, the second part of the movie begins: Jim, Selena and the others run into a bunch of soldiers (led by Christopher Eccleston), who live completely isolated in a military zone while waiting for the situation to improve. At first, the survivors have nothing against staying there. Soon enough, though, they will realize that maybe it isn't the infected they should fear the most, as a dramatic battle for everyone's life starts to take shape...<br/><br/>One of the main strengths of 28 Days Later... is Boyle's unpretentious, realistic approach: the hand-held cameras add to the eerie mood, particularly in the film's first half, giving us an otherworldly, but at the same time believable portrait of a dystopian, gloomy England. Also important is the attention to character: where most movies focus on the action scenes, the Trainspotting director is more interested in establishing plausible, affecting relationships between the people he's observing, and in that he is helped by a committed cast, especially Murphy and Harris (plus Brendan Gleeson in a brief, but exhilarating appearance). It is in fact largely thanks to the actors that Boyle manages to get away with a fairly conventional third act (heavily inspired by George Romero's Day of the Dead) and villains that would look stereotyped if played by lesser thespians.<br/><br/>Overall it does have a few flaws, but 28 Days Later... is nonetheless a compelling film, and arguably the most interesting British contribution to the horror genre since The Wicker Man."
"Socalicitizen","9","1","2","18 April 2007"," More Action, Less Stupidity!
","I'm the kind of person that likes a fair amount of horror but HATES the fact that in horror movies, besides blood and gore, is a great amount of human stupidity. I don't experience any emotions (other than boredom) when stupid people die on screen; this is why this movie is so great! It shows the growth of Jim (Cillian Murphy) as he progresses from clueless to stupid to weak to strong to deadly. Also, unlike other horror movies, none of the characters are two dimensional cardboard cutouts. When someone dies you lose a character with a back-story that you the viewer has a certain amount of emotional investment in when they die. Another great aspect of this film is that it is very well written. For example, there's a scene where a bunch of army guys are sitting around a table philosophically discussing how they feel about the situation, and from that you can see how the characters react to events differently based on their point of view. Buy it, Rent it, Netflix-it, whatever, but you'll like it. Also I give the bonus features 5 stars."

","""28 Days Later"" isn't your run of the mill movie. It utilizes the free, non-hollywoodized style of the independent European directors, and a really modern, end-of-the-world story that really makes you think, if not keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Don't get me wrong, the entire movie isn't a fright fest, and, all in all, it really isn't that scary, but, in fact, very suspenseful instead. The movie does an excellent job of blending these suspenseful moments with much brighter, happier scenes, as well, creating a truly full experience, not a hollow, cheap-blockbuster bang. Not only is is a great full-experience movie, but this is amplified by the fact that it really does leave you thinking. I can't tell you what leaves you thinking, that would give too much away, but trust me, you'll ponder some of the more existential values and lines of the movie. In all honesty, this movie ranks with my all-time favorites, It's something I recommend to everyone. I give it a 9/10 rating, not a full 5, because it seems a little too gritty in parts, but, trust me, the 9 is well earned. Check it out!"
"static-j","9","1","2","25 January 2007"," Not a typical zombie movie.
","Reviewers in the past have been to fast to discard this film as a zombie fest with the an added twist. I disagree with this theory as the creatures in this film are anything but zombies. A zombie is the walking undead whose soul purpose is to feast on human flesh. The 'rage' infected victims in '28days...' however are quite different. They are not living after death, rather they have been infected rage and become feral. They do not wish to eat people, their' attacks are purely rage driven.<br/><br/>Something that sets '28 days...' apart from the stereotypical zombie film are the themes. Most zombie films spawn from testing gone wrong, or in some cases no explanation at all. '28 days' is the former, yet it leads into more issues than a regular zombie gore fest ever has before. Along with the unoriginal 'testing gone too far theme' comes a variety of other more thought provoking themes: what is the point of our existence? Is there a justification for war? <br/><br/>Of course none of this would matter if the film was poorly made. However this is far from the case. The cinematography is something to be remembered. Every camera angle has been thought out to almost perfection and the empty London scenes are more eerie than any graveyard at night. The camera quality feels dirty too, like a bands first album. This is in no way a hindrance to the film, however, rather it adds entirely to the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The acting here is all top notch with many great British actors involved. The best performance however is from Naomie Harris who you will believe has been killing the infected for 28days, if not longer!<br/><br/>I wrote this review to let any sceptics know this film is worth your attention even if you are not a fan of the zombie or horror genres. It is a high point in modern British cinema and has more messages and ideas than the entire Romero back catalogue."

Somewhere along the line he picks up a random (adult) female and later acquires a young girl. And off they go in search of other survivors. Of course, when they find them, all is not as they hoped.

"skitzoild","9","1","2","24 November 2006"," 28 Days Later - A future horror classic in the style of a docudrama
","Review  '28 days Later' His fear began when he woke up alone. His terror began when he realised he wasn't.<br/><br/>The film starts when a group of animal rights activists who have broken into a research facility let out of a cage a monkey that is infected with a contagious virus despite the begging of the scientist in charge of operations. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage. The virus spreads from one monkey 28 days later, Jim wakes up from a coma in hospital to find London completely deserted. He meets up with some other uninfected people and the film follows them as they fight for survival on their search for a sanctuary. They pick up a broadcast on a radio coming from a military encampment near Manchester so they go north but little do they realise that it is not only a deadly virus that threatens them.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film, when Jim wakes up to find London's streets trashed and completely deserted is extremely powerful. An extremely eerie atmosphere is created through imagery alone as there is little dialogue. It is obvious that complete chaos has taken place in the 28 days between the virus escaping and Jim waking up. The previous scene in which the animal rights activists release the monkey is a very frantic one which makes the eerie quietness of the following scene all the more effective. The exteriors of the streets of London were shot in the early hours of the morning on weekdays. The crew only had a couple of minutes each day, and crew members had to politely ask clubbers not to walk onto the streets. Most of the film was made using digital cameras to give it the real look (the final scenes in the cottage were shot on 35mm film). An added benefit of the digital filming was that the London shots could be set up and executed much quicker than otherwise possible which helped the filmmakers exploit very tight time windows to complete the scenes of an empty London. The music in this scene fits well as does the music for the duration of most of the film. In a lot of horror films I feel that scary music is overly used but it is not here. Another thing that I liked about '28 Days Later' was the fact that the surnames of Jim, Selena, Mark, Frank, and Hannah are never revealed, either during the film or in the credits. Likewise, the names of Jim's parents are never revealed. In a post-apocalypse situation surnames have little use as there are so few survivors your first name is likely to be unique to you.<br/><br/>When the characters reach the military encampment is where Danny Boyle cleverly turns an apocalyptic movie into a study of the human race: can the people who are supposedly meant to protect us be actually worse than the ones who have fallen to a devastating plague? The answer, quite simply, turns out to be yes. That this makes Jim do a much needed transition from dazed youth to fierce survivor drives the point home even more: Rage wiped out most of the population, as a virus, but in given circumstances, is found quite well within us, and Jim becomes so filled with it at one climactic sequence it takes Selena a second before realising that he hasn't yet been infected.<br/><br/>Overall I thought that this film had a tight, gripping storyline despite a few loopholes and the acting was powerful and convincing. This film conveys strong feelings of sadness, isolation, emptiness and helplessness which are all closely associated with rage.<br/><br/>Overall rating = 9/10"
"Chrispatschack","10","1","2","22 November 2006"," A very fascinating horror movie
","I remember when I first saw the movie in the theater, I was with my older sister Megan and her boyfriend. I can't remember being scare at a movie ever in my life. Danny Boyle's take on Zombie-flicks is a very fascinating and visually stunning movie. Honestly, I thought the movie was scarier than THE RING. Sure the plot is no different from your traditional virus Apocalypse flicks, survivors being attacked by mutant incarnations of a devastated aftermath, But there is a strong eeriness to it that makes reality look like a dark scary place.<br/><br/>Honestly the only monsters that scare me more than the Freddys or the Jasons are what we can find in reality."
"The_Sandheaver","9","1","2","20 November 2006"," Boyle proves he can still surprise you
","Danny Boyle has always been known for directing and producing several excellent masterpieces. Look at films such as Shallow Grave (1994) and Trainspotting (1996) for evidence. He proves that he has not lost his touch with this magnificent, harrowing film about a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy, Batman Begins) and his struggle to survive in the streets of London, which have been abandoned due to a plague known as ""Rage"". However, he soon finds out he is not as alone as he thought he was...<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best drama films of the Twenty-first Century, and easily a cult British classic, and will always be remembered for the famous opening shots of the central character, Jim walking through the totally abandoned streets of London. It is just slightly disappointing in that the film seems to be clearly split into two halves. The first half is very intriguing, mysterious, thrilling and pretty scary, as we see how terrible things have become in London. However, the second half seems to completely lose the momentum the first half of the film developed, and it loses its edge, but there is still plenty of drama involved, and there are still some twists to the story left.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" boasts a fantastic soundtrack, a top-notch crew (featuring the excellent Cillian Murphy, and the quirky Christopher Eccleston), and an intriguing plot which isn't completely predictable, and will cause a few shocks and screams as the story of a crippled world slowly unfolds. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a ""zombie"" film, more an exploration of human behaviour in the face of a huge, post-apocalyptic crisis, and the results aren't pretty."
"bruno-d-1","9","1","2","14 November 2006"," Empty city = fear
","28 Days Later is a film about zombies causing havoc in London, which falls into the Gothic Horror genre. The highlight of the film is seeing the deserted capital city. This works so well because it shows well known landmarks in London such as Piccadilly Circus, Westminster and Centre point absolutely empty apart from one lead character. It is strengthened by evidence of mayhem in the wake of a virus ridden city with money on the floor, buses on there sides, crashed cars and ones left open in the middle of the road and canned drinks and litter everywhere. These scenes contrast the safe, every day hustle and bustle of the city centre so well and anchor the viewer into the film in amazement ready for the beginning of the real horror. Another personal favourite scene is on the motorway going north on completely empty roads in a taxi. This again contrasts Britain's packed motorways but allows the camera to go much, much wider and show miles on empty roads and a blazing city on the horizon. This like the first scenes of the empty city draw in the viewer before more shocking scenes of horror."
"emilita","10","1","2","5 November 2006"," fantastic horror yet not gory
","I thought this would be another run of the mill zombie movies, I've seen enough to know that they can get very boring. HOWEVER--This movie was filmed well and kept me clutching my knees until the end. This movie contains no zombies and I'm very glad for that. Expect to think about the origin of the virus, not just accept that blood will be spilled. Also, the version of infection is very well thought out and realistic. It highlights a few pieces of our society which are taken for granted, and asks the audience to really think about the situation. The gore is downplayed in favor of humanity. This movie really sits in your psyche and grabs hold."
"pistera","7","1","2","30 October 2006"," super speed zombies equals super scary
","Despite a very corny premise of how the infection begins, the movie is good at the scare and the gore. While it is not the best horror movie I've ever seen, it is one of the scariest, mainly because the ""zombies"" move faster (much faster) than uninfected humans. These super strong creatures intensify the nightmare factor. The movie also is supported by good acting on the part of Cilian Murphy and cast, as well as limited idle chatter (a problem for many horror movies). Again, the opening scene is quite laughable and there are a few minor plot holes, but after a few minutes, you'll get into it and your skin will start tingling. Good for anyone who enjoys a scary gory horror flick."
"spambouk1000","10","1","2","29 October 2006"," Bloody, Great Film
","While the idea of zombies run amok in London seems like the premise of the film, there is a lot more here. I can't help but wonder if folks who didn't really like this film are actually reacting to their own mistaken expectations.<br/><br/>Actually, the film invites us to think about the horror of violence in human nature: if the ""zombies"" are not terrifying enough simply as zombies (and they are pretty disturbing), the idea that we are already among the enraged zombies is perhaps more disturbing.<br/><br/>The film follows Jim (Cillian Murphy) around London, as he awakes from a coma to find the city deserted. He encounters two other waifs, Selina and Mark, and from them learns that a virus has unleashed the normally suppressed hatred in humanity. The whole city has killed itself. In saving herself from the infected, Selina has become hardened and anti-social, but encountering a father and daughter makes her realize that surviving at all costs may not the best option.<br/><br/>The high point of this film for me is Christopher Eccleston as Major West, who supposedly rescues Jim, Selina, and Hannah but has ulterior motives. His cool, calm exploitation of these people reminds us that while civilization may hide our basic aggression, civilized people may be just as cruel as the bestial infecteds.<br/><br/>The film recalls scenes of horror in Sarajevo, in Poland, in Phenom Phen and in colonial America: a really moving (and terrifying) film that is hard to watch at times and very very hard to forget."

The sections that did have violence/gore was not over stimulated like when the infected did not have to rip peoples bodies apart like in Dawn of the Dead etc. The actors except for Cillian were basically unknown but still didn't do a bad job in their parts. I won't reveal anymore but the Infected aren't their only problem and this extra problem made it more edge of the seat. Overall a good movie and its definitely worth seeing for an entertaining evening.

","28 Days Later is the first horror film in quite some time to successfully combine the hyper-realistic neo-celluloid capabilities of HD with the blood gushing glory of 70's grindhouse cinema. This is largely due to the always excellent and under-appreciated direction of Danny Boyle, and a cast that successfully balances their performances with the post-apocalyptic nightmare setting and monsters of the film.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is very impressive in a lead role that is usually underused in most of the older zombie films in order to put the focus on the carnage. He, along with the supporting cast, add the emotion and character development needed to make the battles for survival that much more important to the audience. And for most part, Boyle delivers the goods on both ends, never letting up on the action in a ravaged English wasteland and delivering the blood in cringe-inducing splendor, all in high resolution.<br/><br/>While the ending feels a bit rushed, I was completely enthralled throughout the entire film, largely because I sincerely cared for the characters and their lives.<br/><br/>Definitely do not miss out on this modern horror masterwork.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

Leave it to the Finnish to have a rescue mission in a quarantined area. I loved the idea of the rest of the world quarantining Britain without the British actually knowing that they are quarantined. Unless... it wasn't only Britain that was affected by the Infection. The horror and the breathers were appropriately distributed throughout the movie. Two of my favorite scenes were when the group was camping out next to the field that the wild horses ran through and the scene where Hannah (Megan Burns) is pumped up with Valium and sits on the couch wearing a puffy and glittery red dress. Why? Because the first scene shows that the world will go on without humans and that it can be beautiful... probably more so without humans. And the second scene is filled with apathy effected by the Valium and is sickly funny when the Infected pops up against the window."

","A slightly campy rendition of the typical zombie film. The thing that sets this cult classic apart from other zombie films is its quick transition between fight/flight horror and every day concerns. Humor works its way into the script at key moments to let the viewer know all is safe for the time being. Just when you think all is safe, a dream or noise will bring back the fear and expectations of horror. While many non-brits will think the movie boring or disjointed, I think this type of film making has a bright future. No longer are film makers forced to keep the suspense or horror up for the entire length of the film, but the transitions back and forth are problematic because of the lag time the view experiences. Is this really a horror moment or something else? It takes some mastery to get that right for the majority of the viewers, and I think this film does an excellent job of that with its portrayal of the fast moving more animal like zombie. Another unique feature is the transition from human to zombie. At ten to thirty seconds, it leaves little time for decision making and adds to the immediacy of the situations."

","When most people think of horror movies they immediately think of pointless nudity, gallons of blood and tons of gore; and while that image may be close to reality, the horror genre offers the chance of delivering something else, something intelligent, something deep. Of course, not every director/writer takes that chance, but when they do, it is big. Director Danny Boyle adds a bit of blood to his effective formula of existentialist character studies in ""28 Days Later..."", a powerful ans smart apocalyptic horror movie in the old style of ""Last Man on Earth"" or Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy.<br/><br/>One morning a young British man named Jim awakes from a coma and finds nobody around. He doesn't know it but 28 days before a lethal virus codenamed ""Rage"" was unleashed by accident leading to thousands of deaths and the evacuation of London and other major cities. Now Jim, along with a handful of other survivors must find a safe place and a way to find other survivors of the epidemic before being killed by the hundreds of still living infected people.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later..."" is a horror film the way the genre used to be, it is not only an entertaining and scary movie, it is a through-provoking one. Written by Alex Garland, the film offers a surprisingly realist and very insightful take on humanity and survival, as well as providing an interesting social commentary on the easy corruption of the authority. Sure, it may not be the most original movie in the world, but the execution of the whole idea is near perfect. Director Danny Boyle builds up his story at the right pace and lets the story unfold smoothly.<br/><br/>The realistic visuals used in the film gives the movie a semi-documentary look that gives the film a frightening realism. As usual, Boyle's focus is in the characters rather than in the plot and this approach is just what makes this horror movie so different than other examples of modern horror. He makes us know, like and eventually care for this characters in a very reminiscent way to what George Romero did in ""Night of the Living Dead"" and its sequels. This is no coincidence as Danny Boyle doesn't hide his influences; the film pays true tribute to well-known classics of the genre without being derivative or pretentious.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is simply superb as the lead character, but credit must also go to Naomi Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns, who play the other survivors Jim finds. Naomie Harris gives a terrific performance as a woman who will do whatever is necessary to survive, and Gleeson and Burns are very effective and their father-daughter relationship is very believable. Murphy has earned praise for his performance but it is safe to say that without this good supporting cast the movie wouldn't be the same.<br/><br/>If a flaw was to be found in ""28 Days Later..."" it would be that probably the film may not everyone's cup of tea. Fans of horror will be really pleased but the casual movie goer may be turned off by the grim depressing tone of the film and its ruthless violence. Other than that the film is near perfect and while not the most original horror film, it is one of the best executed examples of the so-called ""zombie sub-genre"".<br/><br/>With its well-rounded characters, its witty plot and its remarkable visual style, this modern horror film proves that it deserves all the hype surrounding it. While only time will prove if the film becomes a classic or not, it is definitely one of the best horror movies of the decade. 9/10"
"clotho42","Null","1","2","1 May 2006"," Whatever you might read, this is NOT a zombie movie
","Nor is it really a horror movie. A thriller, yes. A bit of gore (though far less than I originally imagined from the subject matter), sure. But it's not a zombie flick, it's not even really about the horror.<br/><br/>It's about humanity, and how fragile the separation is between humans and other animals.<br/><br/>The initial infection with Rage is little more than a plot device. That's not stated in a derogatory way, but it's simply less important in the overall scheme of things. Though I did pick up on some real issues with the disease process as it was presented that scene left me pondering one real question at the end of the movie. Who was really to blame for the infection - the scientists that created Rage in the first place, or the activists who set it free, despite warnings of the imminent chaos that would ensue? <br/><br/>I won't deny there are significant plot holes. Any number of the other reviews will cover these for you, but in my mind, the plot was merely a stage to demonstrate what happens to so-called civilised society when social constraints are removed. Some people feel there's not enough angst over the loss among the characters, but to me it seemed realistic. How can you possibly comprehend, let alone grieve for and come to terms with, the loss of an entire nation, possibly the entire world? Numbness, denial, anger, those emotions all come before acceptance and grief and this can only be magnified in a situation such as this, especially when you are still fighting for your survival every day.<br/><br/>Contrary to what others have said, I didn't find the middle of the film dragging. However, that is probably because I was viewing this as a showpiece of humanity rather than as a gore-fest. It wasn't something that made me jump and scream, but it left me with a profound sense of unease that left me both hating and loving the film at the same time. The initial scenes of a deserted London, and the deserted stretch of motorway that I know so well was more disturbing than any horror effect could have been. The fact that this was so British in it's presentation was a wonderful thing in a market so dominated with US products.<br/><br/>I found that the storyline with the soldiers was perfectly believable and yet again served to demonstrate that the enemy isn't ""zombies"", but humanity - whatever guise it might take. The quarantine would seem to be a valid route to prevent a pandemic spread of the infection - ultimately, humans want to survive, by whatever means is necessary.<br/><br/>Overall, the alternative ending provided on the DVD would have fitted better than the ""offical"" ending, but ultimately the premise is the same. Things happen. People will succumb and die as a result of their own failings, depression, hopelessness, disease, injury, infection in a post apocalyptic world... but if any people survive, then they will regroup and reform society because in the end, humans are social creatures. But what can be more frightening is what kind of humans would remain to repopulate society after the fact? <br/><br/>Thought provoking, chilling and disquieting, I've knocked off a couple of points for the obvious plot holes even though, in my estimation, they don't significantly detract from the overall effect of the movie. If you go expecting gore, horror, shocks and zombies, you're going to be sadly disappointed. If you need a seamless plot rather than a premise and imagery, then you'll probably be annoyed at the plot holes. If you watch it prepared for a quietly disturbing presentation of humanity and society, then you'll probably get a lot more out of the film than you might have expected."

","A highly contagious virus was accidentally released from an animal research laboratory by a bunch of well-meaning but deeply stupid activists.

Pure unadulterated rage courses through their veins and they charge around at unnatural speeds trying to wrap their slavering jaws around anything that moves. Specifically, anything human that has not yet succumbed to the virus. Their eyes go red and they start to snarl incoherently. Death is the only cure. There is a 20-second window of opportunity between exposure to the virus(through blood, saliva or any other bodily fluid you happen to encounter) and the symptoms developing.

","While most survival-horror flicks attempt to establish a small amount of space for the development of characters, human relations, and most importantly human nature, they fall flat on their face. You find yourself caring less and less about the characters themselves, and more and more about when the next most gory death scene will occur.<br/><br/>This is not the case with 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle, the same fellow who brought us the masterpiece Trainspotting, once again hits the nail on the head with this awesome depiction of human nature at its worst. While the ""rage virus"" is just that, a virus, one could say that there is underlying social statements in this film. An example of such is at the beginning, when the chimp is being forced to watch media coverage of riots and violent acts being committed between humans.<br/><br/>But beyond this, when the real action begins- and this happens to be quite early on in the film- it simply does not end. There is not a single twenty-minute gap that I can think of in the film where a zombie is not seen, or where an altercation of some sort does not take place.<br/><br/>The people killing people line, as well, was quite perfectly scripted and well-delivered.<br/><br/>All in all, the film proved to be quite valuable on several levels.

","Jim is the victim of an auto crash who wakes up after twenty-eight days in a deserted London hospital. Unable to find anybody, he wanders the streets, is attacked by some frenzied people and rescued by a woman called Selena. She explains that a virus has wiped out British civilisation. Hearing a radio broadcast, they head north to see if they can find any other survivors, and any hope of a future.<br/><br/>This is a film of two halves; the first is a frightening, authentic-looking and spine-tingling odyssey, as our hero wakes up to an apocalypse and stumbles numbly through the ruined streets of Westminster, trying to grasp the enormity of the situation and find a focus. The second half, set in a stately home taken over by a makeshift platoon of dumbbell army squaddies, unfortunately turns into a formulaic series of standard horror scenes. There's a lot to recommend this though - despite a low budget, the deserted London scenes are eerie and impressive, as Murphy crosses Westminster Bridge and walks up Whitehall to The Mall with nobody around. The performances are good, the atmosphere is grim (except for the surprisingly bland and upbeat ending), the horror is treated seriously and the ""infected"" people are shot with weird spastic camera movements that turn them into human versions of the old Tasmanian Devil cartoons. There were a few too many gaps for me in Alex Garland's script though - I'd have liked to know more about the virus (are the victims dead, do they eat and if so what, are they capable of rational thought), the action is flashy but insubstantial, and Jim's transformation in the last two reels into a manic acrobatic assassin is just plain stupid. This is Day Of The Triffids meets Day Of The Dead, and is reminiscent of many other more enjoyable films (Night Of The Comet, Lifeforce, The Quiet Earth, etc), but is still a decent horror movie with some grown-up scares."

It blatantly steels from THE OMEGA MAN staring Charlton Heston, and then there was THE LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price. Not to mention the George A. Romero zombie films. A good film it is but it's not original. Either way Danny Boyle did do a good job with his epidemic film. The acting was fantastic and they didn't shy off on the blood to much... Thanks Danny Boyle for bringing a horror film to the screen that actually has some balls. Maybe this is a sign of things to come in this decade. After the 90's anything will be an improvement.

This is an excellent British horror movie and i would recommend it if you like zombie movies but there are a lot of better movies out there like brain dead and dawn of the dead. so if you have some spare time and have seen all the other zombie movies out there I think you should pick this one up.

","The problem with this film is that it isn't at all logical. First, if the infected people are all so ill and throwing up blood and not eating, where do they get all their energy to rampage like they do? More important, why are they always attacking those who are not infected, but never attacking each other? These two problems make this movie a totally ridiculous one, and what originally began as a tightly wound cautionary tale of the dangers and the results of scientific genetic manipulation degenerates into a remake of the Night Of The Living Dead. By the end it was just silly. Nevertheless the scenes of London devoid of people were extremely eerie and filled with atmosphere and horror; They were the best thing about the movie."

I liked the fact that they casted less well known actors because it prevented the film from being a campy Hollywood disaster. 28 Days Later is sort of like what you would expect a more sophisticated version of Outbreak to be like.

And two, those soldiers trying to abuse the two girls, when its supposed they are for protect the world.<br/><br/>That's a very scary message. When the world is ending, not even the ones who have to protect it can protect us. This is the right screenplay with the right director and the right performers. Cillian Murphy is amazing as Jim, the hero of the story and the real core of the tragedy. What he see, we see, and what he doesn't see, we don't see.<br/><br/>Those first 10 very long minutes with London deserted, not a human being on the streets, no cars, just silence and devastation, are both freaking and lyrical. It shows you how it's going to be the whole movie, that the power of it's images it will be equal to the power of it's characters and plot.<br/><br/>Is a zombie movie, yeah, but with so hyper-realistic production design that it's closer to the documentary than to the horror movie.

","For me this was one of the most overrated movies I've seen in a while. I'd heard good things about it and gave it a go. I thought the first half was great but once they started the road trip to Manchester it lost all of its momentum. Some of the ""surprises"" in the plot were telegraphed as well - especially Frank's death and the phoniness of the broadcast from Manchester. The part with the soldiers would have made a really good episode of a TV show based on this story and characters. Whenever the ""ordinary guy defeats a whole heap of trained soldiers"" rubbish is rolled out I have to be skeptical. When this movie degenerated to that at the end I lost interest completely. The whole premise of rounding up the women struck me as stupid too and I expect a lot better from a writer as talented as Alex Garland. Overall I was hoping for more answers and resolution and instead got a well made TV show. Well-written and well-acted but still - a TV show."
"williamcurley","10","1","2","22 November 2005"," zombies... as a metaphor?
","On the surface it is an overly violent zombie movie. On a deeper level however, it is a brilliant metaphor with every character representing an emotion. The ideas of emotion in regards to language and identity are portrayed here in the clearest sense I have ever experienced in pop culture media. The message of 28 Days Later is not that zombies are bad, but how we can lose our identities in everyday life.<br/><br/>Jim, who is the personification of hope for the survival of our right to Be, goes on to meet the rest of the very small cast: Mark and Selena, two survivors that are in his same situation. Selena represents doubt and pessimism, and Mark represents a sense of impending mortality. They next meet Frank and Hannah, a father and daughter barricaded in their apartment. Frank represents mature fatherly protection of his daughter's life, and Hannah is a sort of misguided teenage angst. They hear a radio broadcast from the military, that they drive out to investigate. What they find is a handful of soldiers who all represent our most basic human will to survive at all costs, including the need to procreate. The zombies however are the clearest representation of rage, and mob mentality. Both these emotions are about the fear of the loss of our identity. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, the zombies are always called 'the infected' and the infection is only called 'rage'. It is the purest sense of hatred and a desire to destroy anything other than their own kind. The movie begins with a scene of animal rights activists breaking into a lab where a monkey is strapped down, with its eyes forced open, being made to watch images of rioting, racism, hatred, and chaos on monitors that surround him. In freeing the monkeys from the torture of the experiment, the activists unknowingly unleash the infection. The one spoken line by an infected person is when Jim is forced to kill a little boy. He has the child pinned on the ground with his foot, and is standing over him with a baseball bat. Through the guttural wheezing and sputtering, the boy looks up at him and says 'I hate you'. It is as if even if the infected had language and separate identity, they would only use it to hate and destroy. Jim is forced to kill him because the infection had dissolved the boy's essential human nature. As a foil to that, when Frank gets a drop of blood in his eye, just before the infection takes over, he looks at his daughter and says ' Hannah, I love you very much'.<br/><br/>Each character in the movie has a name and personality. They each play their own role, separate from one another. The director, Danny Boyle, makes a truly brilliant distinction between the person, and people. The person is smart, sustainable, kind, and helpful. However, when it gets to be more than one person, especially in a mob environment, those qualities are lost, and traded in for the good of the group, a sense of not being a singular person anymore, and fear. The zombies are not people who happen to not be thinking straight. They are a writhing mass with no language, and no identity."

","I got this movie to watch on Halloween because it was reputedly a very scary movie. I don't think I felt frightened even once in the entire movie. There is no aching suspense, no sudden jumping out.<br/><br/>The lead actor Cillian Murphy is almost impossibly handsome. The camera often takes time out from the mountains of gore to lovingly caress his face and body which sometimes seems so jarringly immaculate it looks as if he just walked off a fashion runway.<br/><br/>There is lots of slime and blood and festering, hours of it. There is also what felt like like 10 hours of footage of people bashing each others' brains out in the dark. I could not tell who was bashing who or why.<br/><br/>I have never watched a movie where I had less sympathy for any of the characters. Even the ""heroes"" were totally selfish opportunists.<br/><br/>The rape scenes were supposed to be terrifying, but I could not help but laugh. Why would anyone give a thought to rape when they knew they were about be pounced on at any second by rabid plague victims? The mayhem wore thin very quickly. The villains were as distinctive as the white plastic-coated soldiers in Star Wars.<br/><br/>By far the most interesting parts of the movie were about the gritty practicalities of living without electricity, running water, grocery stores or other people.<br/><br/>As metaphor, the movie had its moments. It showed how money really is just a token in a social game. Money becomes meaningless in the apocalyptic world. There was one bit of philosophising when a soldier noted that for most of earth's history it had no people, and now with this megaplague, earth was returning to normal. The plague itself is symbolic of the rage that spreads from person to person in modern urban society, erupting in mass violence like the Iraq war.<br/><br/>The special effects went on for what seemed like an eternity too, namely wandering through British cities without seeing a even a single car or pedestrian. I suppose these might be more interesting to people familiar with the landmarks with their normal bustle. The effect was supposed to be eerie, but for me, it came across much like visiting a resort town out of tourist season. It has been done too many times before and director Danny Boyle belaboured it. He went on for what felt like hours of it with nothing happening.<br/><br/>P.S. I was not on drugs. The time dilation effect comes purely through repetition of the exact same thing over and over and over."

Well first of all, to be a zombie you have to be dead. The infected in this film were not dead... they were diseased, they were infected with rage. Zombie, or the actual spelling Zombi, is a word meaning: A supernatural power held in voodoo belief to enter into and reanimate a dead body... or in other words, bringing the dead back to life. In this movie the dead are never brought back to life. The people in this film are still living, they are just infected. This film is very similar to a zombie film, but not quite. I loved this movie!

","The storyline is about the escape of a virus, 'Rage' that causes the infected to become mad with rage and hungry for blood. 28 days after the outbreak in London, the whole of Britain and the world is dead or infected, leaving behind a blood thirsty population and a only a few solitary normal people. <br/><br/>This may sound like a film that you may have already seen, but the touch of art used by Danny Boyle allows the film to stand out, achieving what many others haven't managed to do. '28 Days Later' does not focus on the extensive use of special effects and gory actions scenes between the normal and infected. Instead the focus is on how people react and deal with the situation mentally. The main characters drive the story and sympathy for them is created throughout the film. This is unlike many horror films where the audience is unable to connect with the characters, as they dive straight in to the action and gore. <br/><br/>Throughout the film there is a sense of sadness, emptiness and helplessness. The long shots of a desolate London with a soundtrack devoid of sound will give you the creeps, as this is something that we never wish to witness, yet in the back of our minds we know is not impossible. <br/><br/>There are criticisms, and it can be said that the focus on the goings on at the military base takes up too much of the storyline. It is relevant when thinking about animal instinct, survival of the fittest and human reproduction, however, it is dragged on for much longer than needed. Overall, this British film is a brilliant modern piece of horror and is definitely worth going to see if you want to be thrilled."

When he meets a couple of other survivors their quest for salvage begins.<br/><br/>28 days later is a good movie and nothing less. The story is good and believable. It makes sense and is not too far-fetched. The story is well written. There are nice changes of mood and tempo. The characters are strong and believable as well. What I really like about it was that it focused more on the characters and the story then on the blood and gore. It didn't scare me as a horror movie with monsters jumping at you and a suspense and haunting music, but it's scaring in a deeper way. It shows what humans are possible of. People don't really need to be infected be a virus to do these things. That makes it much more than a horror film.<br/><br/>The actors does a good job. You believe them and they portray the characters well. Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns makes a strong trio in the lead.<br/><br/>The cinematographer does a great job in capturing the different moods and pace of the film. It changes more than once and every time it's good. There are shots that are tense and get you all on your toes and there are shots you just lay back and enjoy cause of their beauty. The cinematography features out of the ordinary shots and is all in all very good.<br/><br/>The score is something rock like with guitar and drums and it's really nice. It's dramatic and action filled. However, there are also sequences with no music. It's just the empty sound of no one else. It accentuates the element of the emptiness.<br/><br/>The makeup and effects are also good. However, might contradicting to the genre this is not a gore filled movie. Never the less, the effects you see are good.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a good entertaining and enjoyable movie with feeling, humanity and not just the superficial ""kill the zombie"" then this should be your movie of choice."

It sells itself as an end of the world, fight for our lives film, and does that successfully for the most part, but when it takes a turn into a more humane state, it fizzles out and loses any interest it once had.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved the field scene, that was tremendous, the cinematography was really great.

IF you would call them zombies, or just people infected with ""RAGE"" The military characters are the worse, with the British soldiers being nothing more than your typical foul-mouthed grunts. The clever use of dialogue in ""Dog Soldiers"" was fast and hip, but still built characters, here it most definitely does not.<br/><br/>What does set this apart from your other zombie type movies is of course is isolated in London feel to it.

Of-course zombies is not real, but this movie project it as "" what will actually happen to the survivors if the city is over run by the living-death."" <br/><br/>It opens with breaking the code of zombie movie by telling the source of the virus, before concentrating on one-man wake up in the hospital 28 days later. The story is great and was told really well. The directing is awesome. And the acting is surprisingly good and though they are unknown actors (to me) I have no problem watching them.<br/><br/>I've seen the alternative ending; it is not better than its actual ending.<br/><br/>Though less action (compare to other zombie movie) and pretty slow pace  this movie did work out pretty well. Not to brag but this is one of the most interesting horror films I've seen in sometime.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Excellent Zombie Film. Buy The DVD.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-) Please Rate My Review After Reading (YES/NO) Thanks!"
"PersianPlaya408","8","1","2","4 September 2005"," A good horror flick, flawed but entertaining
","28 Days later is a damn good horror flick. This is a genre of films I do not like much, especially with vampires and zombies in this case. I did not like From Dusk till dawn, and many other horror/thriller favorites. However Danny Boyles 28 Days Later is great, if it wasn't for an ending which was a bit mediocre, this film would have been perfect. It starts out so well, and has great acting/direction throughout. I thought the script was a bit flawed because the third act didn't always make sense and was a bit bizarre and mediocre. This film was still good though, i liked it, a great use of music in this film, Boyle impressed me. The acting was good as well, especially Cillian Murphy and brendan Gleeson who is always good. 8/10 #232 on my list of all-time favorite films"
"chris-2512","5","1","2","5 August 2005"," Over-hyped.
","Danny Boyle's a great director, but this piece of trash was pointless and its praise is undeserved.<br/><br/>This movie is a straight up remake of Day of the Triffid with plague ridden zombies instead of foliage. Secondly, the zombies act like they're spazzing on meth which sucks because zombies don't spazz! Zombies are supposed to move slower than mummies and that's why they're such a potent symbol for existential dread. (IE Being trapped in the prison of a body that's ineffective and slowly rotting)<br/><br/>Boyle forgets he's making a zombie film a couple of times throughout and seems to have focused his film on the nature of human aggression. This was done way better in his superior Di Caprio vehicle ""The Beach"" As a fan of such films as ""White Zombie"", ""Zombie"" and ""Zombie Holocaust"" (Basically anything with Zombies) I can not bless this production. It says nothing new about the zombie genre and is just ineffective. Some good performances, but what else would you expect from Boyle?"
"papafain","3","1","2","24 July 2005"," Is This the Movie He Wanted to Make
","This film seems to fit the comments made on it only as another ""flesh- eating zombie"" movie, of which there are way more than enough. It is more stylish and less gory than the others but the director's commentary on the DVD I rented, together with the comments of ""scientists"" included therein, suggest a more serious, if not original, intent. The idea that animal rights activists might accidentally or intentionally release a pandemic is not implausible. Such an event could indeed be a disaster. The idea of a pandemic occurring on its own or as a result of a terrorist act is also not implausible. So why not make that movie? Not commercial? Instead this is just another rather dumb movie, rather than the cautionary tale it might have been. All the neat scenes of deserted cities cannot overcome that. Query: if the ""disease"" is so contagious and leaves it victims raging maniacs instead of dead, where did everyone go? If the infected can starve to death, why don't they attack each other? There are a lot of things to admire about the technique of this movie and the actors. If you like this kind of movie, don't watch the director's commentary."
"BHorrorWriter","8","1","2","20 July 2005"," Who said anything about zombies?
","I recently rented this on DVD. I had every intention of seeing it on the big screen, but that never happened. Anyways...<br/><br/>A few years later and I decide to rent it - and I'm glad I did! In some ways this film scared me...not that it is a scary movie...but the reality I myself found from watching the film. After watching this I thought: ""Wow, that is a lot like AIDS!"" What do I mean...I know the filmmakers did not intend this for the film, but it was my own thought....Pure Rage reminded me of AIDS. Why? Well for starters, back in the day a lot of folks thought AIDS came from some guy having sex with a monkey from Africa (or a gorilla, or chimp, I can't remember)...anyways and people are infected if blood from an infected person gets into them. It attacks quickly and with regard. Much like AIDS. No cure is ever mentioned in the film - hinted towards- but no cure...Like AIDS! I know that may seem like a stretch...but think about it. It is a lot creepier to me to think of it in that context. I know that may seem preachy, but not my intentions. Merely stating an observation. The thought of comparing Pure Rage to AIDS made the film a lot scarier to me. We don't know all that we think we do about infectious diseases, which do not have cures.<br/><br/>Off my soap box now...<br/><br/>And who said anything about zombies? I have read a lot of people saying this sucks as a zombie film, or not enough zombies, etc. I did not think of this as a zombie flick. But instead, as a smart, grisly and edgy UK production with a healthy dose of realism.<br/><br/>I was very pleased with this film and look forward to the sequel."
"xohsohappyx","9","1","2","18 July 2005"," A movie with great atmosphere
","I loved this movie for many reasons. One of which, was that it was actually scary, but in different ways than most ""horror"" movies. I don't even really consider it necessarily to be a horror movie. It's very epic and artsy as well as frightening. All of those combined make a great movie for any audience and not just the horror movie buffs. The setting is amazing and strange, because a lot of people would consider england to be a weird place.(not that I do personally) And especially ""weird"" when it's just been evacuated and its completely empty. the dialogue is enjoyable in the movie especially if you like British accents. Overall I would say this movie is worth 8.5 stars/10."
"laikareturns","7","1","2","15 June 2005"," Not as original as I'd thought
","I thought it was an excellent movie, the biggest reason was the originality of the storyline, or so I'd thought. The storyline, while fresh and interesting for a zombie movie, is completely lifted from John Wyndham's classic novel the Day of the Triffids. <br/><br/>Still, it's a fine film and deserves most of the positive accolades it has received. It's easily one of the finest horror movies I've seen in ages. The digital cameras really add to the feel of this movie, very gritty, very real feel to all the shots.<br/><br/>Again my only disappointment with the film was that it wasn't the original idea i'd thought it was, unless it was intended as an homage to Wyndham?"
"MatBrewster","7","1","2","10 May 2005"," Good First Half
","The zombies are fast.<br/><br/>It's true that in Danny Boyle's 2002 film 28 Day's Later the crazed, flesh eating villains aren't technically zombies. In fact, Boyle has gone to great lengths to qualify them as humans infected with a virus known as RAGE. Yet, to this reviewer at least, the differences seem moot. In traditional zombie pictures, and in this film the creatures are mindless, they carry a real zeal for human flesh, they have a predilection for turning everyone else into their like, and they are fairly easy to kill. Whether the creatures are the living dead so to speak, or infected by an incurable virus doesn't make much of a difference. Though the zombies here, seem updated from their filmatic ancestors.<br/><br/>These zombies are fast.<br/><br/>Traditional zombies are a slow moving lot. Having been rotting in their own graves for untold years, their reanimated flesh is a little atrophied, causing them to move at a slow, sluggish pace. This has always been a helpful plot point for the heroes in zombie films, for they are easy to run away from. In fact, the means by which zombies generally kill their victims is through sheer numbers. Boyle has circumvented this convenience by allowing his monsters to run at normal human speeds. It is an excellent update to the genre, giving the ability for more scares.<br/><br/>Man, I dug the first half of this movie. Well, except for the very, very beginning. The opening scene gives us the origin of RAGE, with a bunch of Clockwork Orange inspired monkeys. I've never really dug origin scenes in zombie flicks. I think it's much scarier to just have the zombies running around eating brains, without any reason for their existence. Origins, generally, just seem dumb. And here, with the infected monkeys being freed by some Green Peace types doesn't really inspire any other feelings. Though, I suspect it was another move to plant this film outside the zombie track.<br/><br/>But after the dumb origins scene things get really good. We've got a naked guy named Jim (Cillian Murphy) hooked up to various tubes in a hospital bed. I always like it when there is a bit of male nudity in a flick, since there is always so much of the female variety. Anyways, Jim gets out of bed and wanders the streets of London. There are plenty of shots of Jim (fully clothed now) walking by big famous London monuments without another soul around. It seems London has been vacated. It is creepy and effective.<br/><br/>In a bit, Jim clamors into a church figuring to find some sanctuary, or at least have a few questions answered. What he finds is a bunch of dead folks piled up. In a good holy crap moment, Jim says, ""Hello"" to find a couple of the dead guys not so dead and jumping up. From there until the second half of the film, it is a constant run from the zombies.<br/><br/>The zombies really work in this film. They are fast, furious, and vicious. Jim eventually teams up with some other survivors and they set about trying to figure out what to do. Boyle really does a great job of adding tension to the film and keeping the scares up.<br/><br/>Then the film changes.<br/><br/>The group is rescued by a gang of all male military types, living in a compound. Turns out the military types are a bunch of psychos and the film turns from being a zombie flick into being a stranded-in-a-compound-with-a-bunch-of-psycho-military-types kind of film. To make sure we know this is no longer a zombie flick, a big group of zombies launches an attack on the compound only to be massacred with machine guns and land mines.<br/><br/>This half of the film, I don't dig nearly as much. Zombie flicks always have trouble filling out their whole hour and a half time slot. Even with a good introduction of characters, and a slow build to zombie free-for-all there is still plenty of filler time. Here, the filmmakers seem to have decided that they might as well dump the zombies and give us some other tension filled concoction. But, there isn't really enough time to develop the military end of the story and it feels wrong.<br/><br/>It's too bad too, because that first half was really promising."
"BigBadaBruce","8","1","2","1 May 2005"," 3 Years Later
","It's been three years since I first saw 28 Days Later and still get the creeps over this movie. It has plausibility and has great elements of psychological horror. Cillian Murphey is good as the hero, someone who wakes up to a world where a disease has taken over the majority of people living in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>My favourite is actually Christopher Eccleston, who is actually extremely creepy in this film. The third act has hints of Freudian techniques with mans need for females in a harrowing scene which almost includes a 14 year old girl being forced to have sex.<br/><br/>The end is a bit flat compared to the rest of the movie but is kind acceptable as the end of a roller-coaster ride that is this movie. A lot better for a horror than half the movies out there.<br/><br/>""A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realising that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them."""
"dan_the_omnipotent","4","1","2","7 April 2005"," For a zombie movie, boring and drawn out.
","To tell the truth, I am not a zombie movie aficionado. As a matter of fact, I rarely watch scary movies, so when I do I expect some moments of fear. I waited for those moments, and this suspense of suspected horror was the most intense feeling I got out of this movie(except for disgust). There was little action, little suspense, no zombies jumping out of nowhere, so I was bored. Every time a zombie attacked, the diagonal camera view illustrated the fact that it was coming.<br/><br/>The beginning was good, and I felt drawn in by it at first. However it quickly got worse. This seemed to be a bad imitation of Dawn of the Dead. If you haven't seen Dawn of the Dead, watch it and don't waste you're time on this movie. If you truly love zombie movies, rent this movie if you have a weekend with nothing to do."

"marknovack","5","1","2","25 March 2005"," Not at all what I expected. Just another zombie movie with a bad ending.
","After reading the the reviews I took the time to see the movie. What a disappointment. Well made, reasonably budgeted, not terrible acting, what started out as a promising movie turned into a monster movie thriller of zero depth after 10 minutes. There was a good shock scare in the first twenty minutes, after wards, all the horror relied on gore and camera angles because the story lost any sensible momentum and direction and proceeded in a direction that reeks of lazy writing and a ""just get it into the theaters"" attitude. If you are looking for a thriller with a message, keep looking. Battlefield Earth had more of a message than this film, at least it had a betrayal. I gave it 5 stars because its better than a B film, but if I was rating it on what it claimed to be, it would have earned only 1. The ending was also weak. Filmmakers should be aware that writing a weak and confusing ending is not the same as being artistic and creative. Its like they hope viewers are all so dimwitted and will be so confused that they think its awesome because its beyond their comprehension, except that in this movie there is nothing to comprehend. Its a shame because the opening moments gave promise and hope for a good film.<br/><br/>NOTE: I think kids will LOVE this film. Parents must determine if they are mature enough to handle watching because the only message contained in the film is that British soldiers become rapists in times of zombies (poor taste). It will keep them up for nights on end terrified of the dark."
"steve-1297","4","1","2","7 February 2005"," low budget post-apocalyptic drama plays out by the numbers
","WARNING - SPOILERS! Contrived, tedious and derivative. Large parts of this film are so utterly devoid of imagination that only my faint hopes of watching the deeply irritating leading man suffer a hideous and hopefully prolonged fate kept me watching. Director Danny Boyle has a strong background in television and this film looks like a TV movie shot on low budget DV. The plot draws heavily on ""Survivors""; an old BBC post-apocalyptic drama series that routinely displayed far more imagination and invention than this rather feeble effort. The cast are adequate for the undemanding roles they are required to play and the story unfolds strictly by the numbers. It might have made the grade as a TV pilot and would make a reasonable 'Friday-night-in-with-a-pizza' movie, but as a cinematic experience this film leaves a lot to be desired. 4/10"
"miken-3","5","1","2","24 January 2005"," Nowhere near as good as a Romero film
","This movie got a lot of attention like the Night of the Living Dead. I recently rented it and was greatly disappointed. This movie deals with a virus that makes people almost like mutant crazies that go around attacking other people. A group of people wander London trying to get back to ""civilization."" While the characters in George Romero's classic were interesting and you really felt for them, these characters are dull and sometimes act crazy themselves.<br/><br/>The British accents were very difficult to understand at times. The climatic ending is in no way as good as Romero's film. In this film the survivors of the group keep trying to catch the attention of some overflying aircraft. They rig a big message and I guess they are rescued because the next scene is says it is 28 days later and the main character is in a hospital. Not worth buying."
"silentcheesedude","8","1","2","23 January 2005"," 28 times better then some Hollywood horror films
","Ah, zombie horror films. When I think about watching movies like the Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil, I think of taking off my brain and leaving it in a big mason jar in the refrigerator for a few hours. I won't need them where I'm going. Let's face it. Zombie films aren't exactly fine cinema. But with 28 Days Later, that seemed to change.<br/><br/>Our main character, Jim, wakes up in a hospital in London with no one in it. Matter of fact, when he walks outside he can't see anyone for miles. Coming out of a coma, he's a bit out of it, but soon encounters infected people that chase him, looking to eat him. Eventually he meets up with survivors from this outbreak, and learns that he should never come into contact with any fluid from an infected person (monster?), lest he too wind up like them.<br/><br/>Rather then going towards the Dawn of the Dead type of zombie, it instead places a more real-feeling 'Rage' virus that is deadly. These people are still alive... but not really. They may as well be dead. They think only of anger, of killing and eating.<br/><br/>And if Danny Boyle left it at that, it would be like any other Zombie movie. But he didn't. Like Trainspotting, he can take a very ordinary premise and make it franticly artistic. Feelings of despair and sadness, and the very real fear of dying are conveyed through our characters in good form, making them more believable. <br/><br/>With a low budget, mostly unknown cast, and no special effects to speak of, 28 days successfully pulls off what could be one of the best zombie/biohazard virus type of horror film. It's well acted, and that's not supposed to happen in a movie like this.<br/><br/>It becomes more relevant on the film's last half as to the message that is being sent: ""Who is more dangerous, the zombies, or the humans?"" A question brought up by Day of the Dead, though it is laid out much better here.<br/><br/>Still, the movie may be a bit preachy for some, and those that do not like horror or violent images shouldn't even be anywhere near this sentence. But if you like your horror well brewed with a large portion of thought processes, then 28 Days Later won't disappoint.<br/><br/>8 out of 10, 'cause IMDb won't let me put 8.5"

One thing that sticks out in the movie is the beginning where Jim walks around an deserted London looking for anyone. One of the best cinematic opening in a movie. From that point the movie grips you in till the end.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie starts out with some animal activist trying to free some apes in a laboratory not knowing they are infected with rage. 28 Days Later we find Jim waking up from a coma. Jim does not know what is going on and does not know where is everyone and neither do we. We find out when Jim finds out.<br/><br/>Overall, this was one of the best movies of 2003 and Danny Boyle did a terrific job. He should make more horror films."

","28 Days later,from the outset is about a rage virus, and the horror of the decimation it brings, and poor Jim's attempts to weather the storm of rabid carnage left in the wake.However, despite the large plot holes in the script, Alex Garland and Danny Boyle were trying to make a point. The virus wasn't causing this chaos as such, but bringing to the surface the vile,ravenous bloodthirsty base urges within all of us.The rage is a virus, but only metaphorically- in the form of an increasingly angry,violent society...that people aren't really as civilised as they would like to think, and that anyone could go mad with rage and that the real horror of this film was in the blood red grotesqueness of human nature- not some mutant super-virus. Truly scary and disturbing in that respect.A true horror film."

","A man wakes up in a London hospital, presumably from a coma and finds that he is eerily alone. The room he is in is empty, the building is empty, and what more is that the entire city appears to be empty. Before this scene, we get a hint that some horrible virus might have been released into the population and all doubts are soon confirmed as our hero is attacked by vicious, red-eyed, blood thirsty people dubbed 'the infected.' <br/><br/>The movie is highly reminiscent of George Romero's 'Dead' trilogy as the characters try to come to grips with a seemingly hopeless situation. There are many terrific frightening moments and despite many limitations during production (budget, permits to shoot in places, etc...) the film is a solid fright-fest. There is a nice balance of eerie atmosphere and action, and, probably most significantly, the film is obviously not Hollywood fluff as there is no over-concentration on effects and gore. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R: graphic violence/gore and profanity"

","I recently saw this film on video for the first time and was impressed by how intelligent and well-made it was. And scary to boot. The scenes where the main character wanders around London by himself, in the church where the infected priest comes after him, arms jerking and flailing, in the stairwell on the way to the top apartment, and in the tunnel when the tire was being changed on the car, each of these was terrifying in its own right. In some of the scenes, I was reminded of The Omega Man with Charlton Heston, another ""zombie"" film where the zombies didn't eat their victims, but used night-time to hunt down the non-zombies. Another scary film. I found myself watching 28 Days Later and thinking, this could happen. I mean, scientists could isolate a gene for aggression, rage, whatever, test it in animals, and what would happen if it escaped and crossed over into humans? I definitely thought about this film for days after I saw it."

","All that was good about this film borrowed heavily from the Day of the Triffids, a well written and utterly convincing book by John Wyndham.<br/><br/>For example, the wake-up sequence, the deserted hospital, the deserted city, meeting other survivors and the retreat to the countryside at the end. The solutions that people offer in the book are much less crude and more thought provoking than the stupid soldier ending to 28DL.<br/><br/>I think that because of the similarities in plot and the fact that permission to shut bits of London and the M1 motorway isn't afforded to many films DOTT will never be made into a British-based film.<br/><br/>It's a real shame because the story is very cinematic and the subtle way the author deals with the inter-relationships between the living, dead and blind characters would lend a very solid plot, with a much better ending than 28 DL.<br/><br/>Plus the infected/zombies in this film were too OTT. The relentless march of a slow moving but deadly army of genetically modified plants would be more apt to 'now' and would be less 'then' (ie 70s/80s gore horror). <br/><br/>Shame. But 28DL was great until they met the soldiers. One of the best films I've seen in ages."
"garboventures","9","1","2","11 September 2004"," striking, stylish, sometimes harrowing
","28 Days Later is a fine piece of British film-making. For me, (as a Brit), this post-apocalyptic film, replete with striking, often stirring images of a desolated Britain, resonated that much more than the typical US-set disaster movie. The deserted London streets were especially effective. The road trip mid-section is also worthwhile. The effects and overall camera-work are used judiciously and to stylish effect.<br/><br/>The film also features some fine performances - Cillan Murphy in particular. (SPOILER) His final, raging killing spree, bare-chested, gleaming pallour, splattered with blood, is slightly reminiscent of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. This sequence of events comes across as somewhat shocking, as up to this point (bar a cold-blooded incident with a baseball bat and an infected child) Murphy's character has appeared too gentle, even for his own good. <br/><br/>Less impressive were the red-eyed, blood-spewing Infecteds, Christopher Ecclestone's over- wooden performance, and a slightly confusing 'happy ending'. Unlike other commentators, I didn't find this ending too trite or unwelcome, but more explanation would have been preferred."

","Alright movie. Neither here nor there really. I would have to say though that it kept the excitement throughout the movie very well. I thought the acting was pretty good and they used my horror movie philosophy and didn't bring in any big stars. I thought that Jim could've been a bit more shocked when he had just got out of hospital at the start. It seemed as if he knew what was going on or something. The directing of the movie seemed poor from my point of view. At times it was hard to tell what was happening from the camera angles. Another thing that had me thinking was that when the infected people caught on fire they were fine and could still chase the uninfected but when they were shot a few times they went down. Also the ending was butchered. They could have done so much with that kind of a story for a twist at the end."

And in the next scene you see Jim walking down another road, still yelling ""HALOOOOO!!"" and still totally alone. Now, what happened to the dude at the other end of the road?

But i think the funniest part, in this deadly serious movie, is where our heroes (yes Jim manage to see other people) has stopped in a tunnel, and one of them says something like ""Hey, can you hear something?"", and then you see about 2 dozen ""zombies"" in all ages come sprinting down the dark tunnel. I'm telling you, i was so close to laugh my guts out in the cinema while thinking "" oh ooh, here comes the insane joggers"".

"morris8277","Null","1","2","13 August 2004"," A psychological thriller....but not scary in the least!!!
","First off, let me start by stating that I didn't hate this movie. It had a psychological edge that's not present in a lot of films of this genre, especially the living dead genre. But I have to go on by saying that I didn't quite enjoy this film either. <br/><br/>This film is very complex, and exhibits many different styles and allows the viewer to see just how big of a melting pot of cinema is responsible for Danny Boyle's foray into film. It stretches from the mad vision of Stanley Kubrick all the way to the films of George A. Romero. His post-apocalyptic vision of the U.K is perfect as it is startling. I can't imagine anything worse than waking from a semi-coma, naked in an empty hospital, and then wander out to find the usually bustling and loud streets to be ominously quiet and void of life, especially in the middle of the day.<br/><br/>Thats just exactly what happens to our hero in the story, Jim. He awakens 28 days into a killer plague, after an accident put's him into a slight coma. Groggy and in a sort of trance, Jim wanders into a local chapel to find it filled with the ""infected"". His ensuing escape from the ""infected"" is how we run into the heroine of our story, Selena. A rough and tumble brit who has been hardened by her own experiences of survival and her own tragedies of the plague. It is at this point where we discover the true nature of the destruction of life as they knew it. This is where Jim is made aware of the startling reality that his family are in all probability dead, as is all of Jim's friends, and co-workers.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not going to delve into any more of the story as most have probably seen this film. So let me just analyze what I took away from this picture. For one, THIS IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!! A lot of people like to label it as such when it clearly IS NOT. These people are clearly infected with a disorienting and violent disease and are blissfully unaware of what they are doing, imagine an mega version of rabies, but they are certainly ALIVE! I came into this film expecting to see a zombie flick, with our heroes being chased through the streets of London by legions of the living dead. This film is far from it.<br/><br/>I was not ""scared"" by this film. It was a psychological thriller on some levels, especially because I would not want to go through what our heroes went through to survive. I guess it taps into our most basic primal instinct, survival. No one want's to imagine a life in our day and age where we must fight and fend off brutal attacks by mindless hordes on a near daily basis. But that was the extent of the ""horror"" of the film.<br/><br/>This movie was neither a horror film, nor terrifying. It didn't have the shock factor of ""The Exorcist"", nor did it have the psychological edge of ""The Silence of the Lambs"". It kinda slipped through the cracks and lies somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Before I saw this film, I had heard a lot of people proclaiming this to be one of the scariest films of all time, this is far from the truth. This film was only moderately scary if not at all. The plot was predictable, the ""infected"" were no more scary than they were Zombies, and the story progressed too slowly. One of the keys of a good horror film is the quick progression through character development to the life and death struggle with a homicidal madman or madmen. The only exception to this rule may be John Carpenters original, ""Halloween"" (1978). Carpenter used timing masterfully in that film and that is why ""Halloween"" has withstood the test of time And the hordes of sequels and copycats it spawned. ""Halloween"" began methodically as it built up to it's heart-pounding climax. 28 days later... on the other hand, started slow and ended slow. This may just be the style of an eccentric filmmaker, but it makes for a poor suspense film.<br/><br/>Again, let me sum up that this is not a Zombie film. If you want a gory Zombie film full of scares, I would recommend anything from George Romero, or better yet, just check out Tom Savini's masterful 1990 remake of Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead"". It takes Romero's original characters and ideas and adds a bit of style and flair to it, not to mention great special effects by the master of gore, Tom Savini. You could also check out the new ""Dawn of the Dead"". It is good as well, especially if you want a more up to date version of the living dead films. It starts off with a bang and never looks back. But for a slow moving, tedious attempt at a suspense thriller check out 28 days later...., but be careful, do not attempt to operate heavy machinery or drive while watching this film, it could put you right to sleep."

","One of those damned pesky incurable virus', playfully nicknamed ""rage"", starts running rampant through the world, turning people into mindless, blood thirsty animals. Our quote unquote ""hero"" Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital and wanders around looking for help and eventually runs into the mannish Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Mark is later killed when he is suspected of being infected and later Jim and Selena run into a lovable family man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Together they make a trek to find some army guys who might help them, but Frank is gunned down after he becomes infected and later on we find out that most of the soldiers are horny bastards, which puts them and their leader Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) at odds with Jim. Well, Jim eventually uses his wits to overcome the evil soldiers and escapes with Selena and Hannah, and they eventually get rescued or at least alluded to getting rescued.<br/><br/>It could be argued that this really isn't a zombie film, seeing as how zombies are resurrected corpses and these are once living people who have been turned into killers thanks to the virus. <br/><br/>It's pretty fun to watch overall, with lots of dark atmosphere and a moody score, though it runs out of a steam a little bit towards the end. In terms of actual acting, well, the truth is that cold fish Cillian Murphy and the rest of the cast are all easily out-shined and out-acted by Brendan Gleeson as the teddy bearish father Frank. I'm sorry but Brendan Gleeson brought a warmth and humanity to the film that made it a lot more compelling when he was on the screen. Once we lose him though the film becomes a tad boring, but only a tad."
"Cinepierre","8","1","2","12 August 2004"," The most logical horror film I know. (Beware, behind you : BIG SPOILERS !!!!)
","I really liked ""28 days later"". For the first time in an horror movie I believe in the characters. usually, there are always people chased by the villain who take the wrong way, react the most silly way and finally.. get killed (or get saved by another hero without explanations).<br/><br/>In this film, the characters seemed ""real"" to me. They act and react like you and me could act and react in those kind of situation. There is no big hero, there are humans afraid and fighting for there lives.<br/><br/>When the two young heroes meet the father and his daughter, a kind of family link is created. I found this part very sweet in this horror mood, together they are able to face their destiny.<br/><br/>But the arrival in this army camp destructs this feeling of ""together we are stronger"" because, unfortunately, the soldiers are really human too ! They want to have fun, they need to rape the two poor girls. And Even though it is unforgivable, this is terribly understandable ! They are men. They are alone. They have no future. They deserve to die. But...<br/><br/>The moment when I stop following the hero, Jim, is when he kills all the soldiers one by one. The first murders are forgivable : he wants to save the girls. But the last one he kills, he kills him like if he were a zombie himself. I was thinking : okay, the message is, whatever you are infected or not, when you are a killer, when you get used to blood, you're not a human any more. <br/><br/>But I guess I was wrong, because of the romantic and happy end... Jim is shown like a regular nice man, the hero of the movie. And that is weird because, for me, He crossed the line : he became too much violent, a part inside him is ""zombie"" for ever...<br/><br/>But, even if the end is going a little too far for me, I really enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading me, sorry for the English mistakes I could have done."
"basrutten","8","1","2","1 August 2004"," Dark, atmospheric, and fairly good
","I didn't know what to expect of this movie, but ""28 Days Later"" turned out to be a fairly good horror/thriller.<br/><br/>The thing I liked best about this movie was the terrific atmoshpere. From the shots of totally deserted cities to the desolate manor later in the movie, ""28 Days Later"" really succeeds in creating a dark and creepy atmosphere. In addition, there are some good scary moments and some gore in the movie, but it never goes over the top and degenerates into a hack-fest.<br/><br/>
The plot is above average as well. Although it borrows from other sources and has isn't always entirely convincing, it's good enough to carry the movie and has a couple of unexpected twists. It's also a lot darker than that of most (especially American) movies. I also like the fact that the movie gives you just enough information to figure out what is going on, instead of boring you with long explanations that ultimately only undermine the credibility. <br/><br/>Ultimately, while this movie can be a bit slow at times and certain parts seem a bit far-fetched, this movie is certainly worth watching if you're looking for an atmospheric and creepy thriller. <br/><br/>**1/2 out of **** stars"

","************************SPOILERS************************<br/><br/>In my opinion Boyle tried to make one single movie out of Romero's Living Dead Trilogy, you have most of the themes and ideas explored in these cult classics such as a society destroying its predecessor, the military base, the characters helping themselves in shops...etc. The problem is that Boyle never really develops any of these ideas as Romero did. He talks of the uselessness of money and criticizes mass consumerism but seems to completely forget about this idea when the second part of the movie starts. As soon as the characters are taken into custody by the army he completely forgets his first message and criticizes martial law and other things. Although there are many good ideas in the movie I just get the feeling that Boyle got most of the ideas while watching the Living Dead movies.<br/><br/>An other major problem with this flick is that it really lacks character development. Firstly there aren't many characters who survive throughout the story and you don't really identify to them. Secondly the back up characters such as Hanna really lack presence, you don't have a clue who she is and what she's like. The army men are empty shells and Franck who is the best secondary character dies in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>I give it a 6/10 because the directing and visuals are good and because there was quite a lot of potential to the film."
"jcanettis","7","1","2","23 July 2004"," Generally Good, But With Plot Gaps
","""28 Days Later..."" succeeds in its basic target: To provide two enjoyable hours to its audience, full of suspense and action. Although it is a film that is characterized under the ""Horror"" category, it does not overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary and tiring gory scenes; instead, the director manages to achieve the horror element mainly through the psychological pressure that the plot generates. There are some quite scary and bloody scenes, yes, but they are not dominant in the movie; the fear, distress, and panic of the characters is what raises our adrenaline.<br/><br/>So what is ""28 Days Later..."" about? The story is as follows: An unknown and highly contagious virus escapes a research lab, and it quickly produces an epidemic. The people infected by it enter a state of murderous and destructive rage, becoming in effect a form of killer-zombies. Within 28 days, when the civilization seems to have been fatally shattered, Jim (Murphy), a hospital patient who was in a coma due to an accident, wakes up and discovers a totally new world surrounding him. He begins a quest to find other uninfected survivors, of which there are unfortunately very few. In the process, he and his companions realize that there are more dangers in this new environment than simply the virus itself...<br/><br/>Although the story is interesting, it has the problem that it features some disturbing gaps that cannot stand to some scrutiny. I do not want to enter into much detail here, as I will have to reveal spoilers, but what I can safely mention, without revealing the plot, is the following: The main point of the storyline is that the infected are portrayed as zombies who have no consciousness or logic at all, but their only activity is to massacre in a raving state whoever is near them; they do not eat, drink, or perform any basic human function. However, the above fact should mean that these zombie-people would be  totally unable to group together and attack others; instead, it is rational to assume that they would simply start eliminating each other, while their lack of reason and functional capabilities would make them easy prey to the rest of humanity who would probably isolate and cure or annihilate them without letting the damage spread for long. This is not what happens in the film however, as we see an unlikely scenario in which these infected zombies not only manage to devastate an entire civilized country without anyone being able to stop them, but they also form groups and attack our heroes in unison in occasional scenes.<br/><br/>Despite these gaps, the film overall manages well. The actors, although not widely known, perform fine. The scenery, and especially the portrayals of the empty city streets and buildings, are fascinating, despite the production's low budget. A 7/10 is a fair grade in my opinion."

","This Danny Boyle's action sci-fi flick, which illustrates a nightmarish near future, holds some artistic values but overall it is a big mess. While metaphors of AIDS and nuclear war are well-presented, towards the end, political power conflicts and fights in the army ruin the chance for the film to be successfully coherent.<br/><br/>Some notable merits include casting, art direction, and editing. The combination of a white male anti-hero type and a decisive black female is freshly contemporary. The opening sequence shows one of the most memorable sci-fi art directions in recent years: caged monkeys exposed to video monitors that display footage of war and violence. Fast-paced editing on attacks of the infected, without clearly showing the attackers, effectively produces the fear of the attacked."
"supramaxx","Null","1","2","5 July 2004"," Disappointing...I cant believe I bought this movie.
","28 Days Later....I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a great zombie flick, turns out its one of the worst I ever seen. Turns Out, Resident Evil is 20x better than this movie. There are just so many plot holes and the mood of the movie is way too light for me, throw that in with almost no blood and gore, and it turns out to be a crappy movie. First of all, London is completely empty?!? Fine I got to admit there are some great shots of London being empty, But it just doesn't work out. There has to be at least 5 million ppl in London and most of them infected with ""RAGE"" as the movie likes to call the disease. but when Jim is walking the streets are completely empty. What is this, the zombies cant come out in daylight?? ""WHICH WAS NEVER EXPLAINED IN THE MOVIE"" and throughout the scene Jim only encounters about 2 cars, one the Mercedes that he touches and the other a Double Decker Bus, C'mon there has to be more cars somewhere in London, does everyone walk???? I would've made a bunch of cars on the street flaming and burning crashed into each other a bunch of bodies burning in the streets, Stores broken and stuff. But not just completely empty streets seems like everyone disintegrated. The most cars u see are in the tunnel, anyways I have much more complaints about this movie. Second of all the mood was just to light for me and this MOVIE WAS NOT SCARY AT ALL. Kids could see this movie and not get scared, there is no blood or gore. And in the whole of England there is just like 15 survivors out of a country of at least 50 million ppl. C'mon!!!! And why diddnt Jim let the army guys ""mate"" with his female companions, HELL if the survival of the human race were at stake, I would say Hell Yes!!! and the ending is just way too happy for me. This Movie really Blows!!!! If u want to see a light-horror flick which isn't well done, please see this movie. Some of the scenes reminded me of the green scenes from the LoTR, there is just too much greenery, not enough zombies, not enough destruction, not enough survivors to make this believable, Do yourself a favor and see either Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil which is much better than this crap! i'm getting ready to return this movie as I type this.

"mkipage","Null","1","2","26 June 2004"," Great film, terrible and rage envoking ending.
","SPOILER ALERT. ENDING REVEALED.<br/><br/>I am writing this review because I am enraged. I am not sure if this was the intention of the film, but I feel if I have been 'infected'.<br/><br/>This could well have been the best film of this, or perhaps any genre for me. It had everything- a great premise, atmosphere, a cast of more than adequate 'unknowns', the occasional corny dialogue (which added rather than detracted from the film), appropriate graphic content (I must admit I expected more gore), social commentary (both overt and implied, provoking thought and conversation) and a great use of audio and visual effects. This film was near 9+/10.<br/><br/>Then came the most lame and disappointing final sequence I have seen for some time. While I could suspend disbelief throughout the film for the sake of enjoyment and escape, I could not swallow that the protagonists were able to ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Yes I admit I have a tendency to rewrite the ""Hollywood ending"" of films in my mind to provide a more satisfactory, and some would say pessimistic conclusion to many a screenplay. However given the content of this film, there was no other possibility but a ""unhappy"" ending. Humankind, whether it be ""infected"" or caught up in road rage or mob mentality or bullying or any show of abuse of power (please excuse me if this is not the underlying message of this film), will tend towards a path of internal and external destruction.<br/><br/>If the three main characters died when they crashed through the gate, while trying to escape from both the infected and non-infected pursuers, wouldn't that have been ironic. Or if that is too pessimistic, why not end the film just before the impact. That way those who wanted a hopeful and rosy ending could have walked away with the possibility of this, while those who prefer a meatier conclusion could also dream up their own finale.<br/><br/>I will conclude by saying that I am glad I only spent AUS$15 on an ex-rental DVD copy of this film. Mind you I will watch it again, but I will have my finger firmly on the stop button at the end, to prevent feeling so angry again."
"geopat2004","Null","1","2","21 June 2004"," It's own niche, and not a bad one..A SPOILER, I guess
","Maybe a SPOILER-- rather have you see the flick-- you should, it's at least an 8 -- and then compare your take with mine!<br/><br/>Trying to keep my eyes open on Monday after planning to watch ""just 20 minutes and hitting the sack early"" on Sunday nite...Couldn't turn it off..... Right, it's not a zombie flick, dead rising etc., but the very plausible premise of a virus-fueled extinction of an entire island nation is a wonderful excuse to explore the darker survival instincts of a variety of characters. I've turned off Romero flicks because I was ""too scared"" to endure the shambling corpses stalking lone victims in abandoned graveyards and lonely farmhouses.... and then returned to them to savor the horror. I stayed with this in order to see to what ends the heros would go to survive.<br/><br/>Does the hero turn ruthless killer in the end? No, he simply understands the rules of survival and is crafted by the author as a survivor. The heroes actually employ the rage victims against the establishment (such as it is). Is it incongruous that one lone jet-fighter appears after humanity is apparently wiped out by rage? Not really.. Why not craft a political lie to keep the infected island isolated. If Tokyo and NYC are germ free-- they won't be for long... and don't tell the army about it, hell, they've got the means and muscle to make the trip. Keep 'em isolated and let it run its course... then go back and look for survivors. Makes for a neat little survival microcosm-- like others have said, compare to ""Lord of the Flies"" -- how about ""The Stand"" (the book)? <br/><br/>Use this movie to delve into your deeper survival mode. Could you do what needed to be done to outlast terror and evil and survive whole? Give it an 8 for its genre-- well acted, well directed, nicely lighted and shot, believable special effects (killer of a lot of OK films), disturbing, and certainly thought provoking."

","Directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), 28 Days Later is one of the best films of the past 10 years. Featuring an previously unknown cast, the film tells the story of a rage virus, unwittingly set loose on England by a group of animal activists. Our protagonist, Jim, awakens 28 days later in a deserted hospital, completely unaware of the rage virus and what it has done. He wanders through desolate London, searching for someone, something, that can explain to him what is going on. Eventually he finds it, a newspaper reading EVACUATION, missing posters, and desperate notes for loved ones left on a communal message board. However, Jim still has no idea about what has done this and that he is in danger. He finds his way to a church only to encounter an infected priest and to be chased by various others. Luckily he is saved by Selena and Mark, two other survivors who are doing their best to live. They inform Jim of what has happened, the rage, the deaths, the evacuation and so on. This is a lot to take in and Jim refuses to believe that his parents are definitely dead. The next day the group sets off to Jim's home, where they discover his dead parents. Later that night the house is attacked by infected and Selena has no choice, but to kill Mark. Jim and Selena flee the scene which will soon attract more infected. Eventually they come upon a father and daughter family surviving in a block of flats. The group sets off after hearing a radio broadcast telling of the cure to infection. However, there's more to that promise than they expect.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is an excellent film which forces the viewer to think and feel. Though exploring familiar territory, Boyle does an excellent job, giving new life to the story."
"TheSolarSailor","Null","1","2","17 June 2004"," A More Realistic Style Of Horror...
","Five out of Five Stars<br/><br/>I am no fan of zombie movies, but 28 DAYS LATER is not exactly what I'd call a zombie movie, but rather a well crafted, apocalyptic tale of the end of humanity - so to speak. When a virus created by the government called Rage gets set loose upon the populace of Britain by animal rights activists who 'think' they are doing good, the entire country's population quickly becomes infected. The virus is spread by a victim's infected blood (which they tend to spew up uncontrollably) entering the body of another persons (through the mouth, nose, eyes, or a cut), which then completely overtakes them within 20 seconds. Jim, who has been in a coma since before the outbreak, suddenly awakens in the hospital and begins his confusing search for answers in the eerily deserted streets of London. He quickly finds them as he encounters infected multitudes in a church and is rescued by a couple of un-infected survivors named Selena and Mark. That is simply the basic opening premise to the film, not the whole story!<br/><br/>The movie introduces you to several well developed characters that you will really come to care for as the story progresses. You really are concerned over who may die, or what the group's fate will ultimately be. Basically, you will be drawn into their struggle for survival, as well as enjoying the lighter moments as the group bonds and becomes more like a small family. There are many unexpected incidents that keep you guessing throughout the entire movie, creating a very unnerving mood overall. Filled with disturbing images and ideas, this movie will definitely leave you with lots to think about after the credits roll. These are the signs of a film succeeding on a higher level than most these days. <br/><br/>The visual style of the movie is not to be ignored either. Danny Boyle's choice to film it using a Digi-Cam was brilliant. It adds to the realism of the entire film, bringing to light the loneliness of the world around. The horrific scenes depicting Rage-infected men, women, or even children crawling and running up towards the camera are terror inducing and really manage to drive the horror of the character's situation home. Director Boyle also masterly crafts some very surreal dream sequences for Jim that perfectly depicts what pent up worry and fear can cause the mind to imagine.<br/><br/>All of this is capped off by a well written score that compliments the film in every way, from the intense and very stressful scenes to the quieter, character driven moments. Very impressive work overall!<br/><br/>Some may not like the ending, but after all that these characters have been through it was nice to walk away from this film with some happiness and hope. Not everyone could have pulled off such an idea, but it works well here. It is a relief not to be stuck with a shock-value ending, or some weird twist in the story during the last frame that seems to have become common place in movies of this genre. I recommend this film to everyone who is old enough to see it. 28 DAYS LATER is truly an artistic masterpiece that actually dares to have a point behind it!"

"crazy_children69","Null","1","2","12 June 2004"," Not the best zombie-movie, but truly Disturbing
","Well, there are just so much to say about this film. When I first saw the review for the film I was skeptic, it's just another zombie movie (I don't usually find zombie-movies disturbing since I don't believe that zombie movies are logical) to watch, but I figured ""Oh what the hell, might as well..."". However, after watching it I find it too be one of the most disturbing films that I have ever watched, the horror doesn't come from the film itself (the blood and guts can't get any worse) but from the story.<br/><br/>First, I think that the filming techniques are excellent, from the angles to the shades and shadows to the emptiness (particularly the scenes in London, how did they make everyone disappear in London?), although it fails to give the visual impact to the audience as other more conventional zombie movies would. I have no comments on the acting except for the long conversations and the silence in pretty much the rest of the movie. The music is the worse that I have ever seen, the director spoiled everything by choosing the wrong music for this movie. The ending is also something that I don't understand, for the last 56 days or so there has been no signs of human civilization except for a ruined country and a few other things, but where the hell did that fighter come from (I thought the whole country was infected)? Isn't it weird that there is still a army pilot left to fly a fighter that works perfectly?<br/><br/>Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, the horror comes from the story. The story shows the ugly side of human nature, what we can do when things come to the situation as seen in the movie. But what I find disturbing the most is Rage, the disease that pretty much destroyed human civilization within 28days and also realizing that the person next to you can turn into a zombie/psycho within seconds and you have to kill him/her in any means possible.<br/><br/>This film is not for those who crave to see blood and mutilation but for those who wants to watch beyond the visual horror. For me, I am still feeling quite disturbed when I go to sleep even a few days after watching the movie, never knowing what's going to come through that bedroom door..."

I had never heard of this guy before, but after this movie hit me so hard, I will certainly be sitting in the audience of ""Batman 5"" (not that I wouldn't be there anyways).

","I disagree with the prior review. I thought this film did quite a lot with its limited budget; it did what you should do when you can't blow bucks on special effects - focus on story and character. The people in the film are folks you root for; they grow, they fight, they survive. Well, some of them do. <br/><br/>Important notice - this is no zombie movie. There are no zombies. There are victims infected with a ""rage"" virus. It's a decent premise, with a very difficult opening as we see chimps tortured and turned into monsters in the name of science. (It's too bad that animal rights activists are made the catalyst for the virus's escape into the world, but who said horror is politically correct?) The film grows out of the John Wyndham school of disaster story, and does well by the tradition. Like ""Triffids,"" the hero comes to in a hospital after everyone in London has vanished. Gradually we learn what happened, without a lot of dull exposition. Well done. After that the attacks of the ""infecteds"" are filmed in a very interesting sped-up, grainy style that is truly nerve-wracking. It may seem a bit overdone, but the style is used again at the end, when the hero, uninfected, has to use his rage to save himself and his friends; this leads to some very interesting questions, and it was a good piece of film-making.<br/><br/>There are some major plot holes, there's a bit of casual racism (which is noticeable and therefore quite powerful), a touch of sexism in the denouement (but the characters have shown themselves more than self-sufficient beforehand), and there are moments that are difficult to sit through because they're so grim. But the film deserves its good reputation and is well worth seeing."

(I.E. government experiment gone awry.)<br/><br/>Those infected with ""rage"" are not really walking dead (thus the unfair comparisons, imho, to the Living Dead movies) - they are mortal. Although it is evident that the infected die from starvation, they don't ever appear to be feeding on humans, only either quickly passing the infection on, or quickly killing their prey off.<br/><br/>On one level, the infection is less the dilemma in this film - almost like a side-note. The real problem lies in how the uninfected react.<br/><br/>The military was chosen very intentionally for this film to represent an institution of civilization. Major West demonstrates to Jim how well his soldiers have kept themselves organized; how civilized they have all remained with a boiler for hot showers and a fancy dining room in which to eat meals.<br/><br/>Yet West is not the noble officer he appears to be. He sits on a richly upholstered chair from the mansion his team has helped themselves to, and surveys his domain like a king. During the ""toast"" at dinner, he helps himself first to the meal (what kind of officer feeds himself before his soldiers have been fed?) During the attack, he remains seated at the table to finish his meal. He later informs Jim that he promised women - now meaning Selena and Hannah - to his troops (not that the promise was his to make in the first place.)<br/><br/>Even when we all have a common enemy, we still cannot get along and make ends meet. At the end of the film, the look of startled confusion on Jim's face in response to Selena asking him if the pilot had seen them this time seems to ask, ""Does it really matter? Because what are we being save from, and where are we being saved to?""<br/><br/>********End of Spoilers**********<br/><br/>28 Days Later does a fantastic job of showing how civilization does not come from without - it does not come from luxuries, riches, or ownership.

And it also challenges us to look at our own recognized institutions of civilization: have we built them upon false premises?<br/><br/>This movie will be enjoyed by readers of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Heart of Darkness"". Chris Eccleston is subtly excellent as the manipulative, yet still complex, Major West. Cillian Murphy, who plays Jim, possesses an amazing array of body language and facial expressions that augment not just his own character, but the general themes of the movie."

","Wow!  I saw the movie poster and it had a zombie statement.  I was wayyy excited.  A new Zombie movie, sweeeeet!!!  Well, it came out and there was all these reviews of people saying they peed their pants it scared them so bad.  So I ran to see it (insert uncomfortable silence here).  Don't get me wrong, it had some nice gore and a few creatures that were like zombies, but what the hell is up with the long drawn out boring-ass dialogue scenes in European movies?  Don't they know that us Americans have the answer with gore, loud music, sex, and nonstop action?  The thing that got me the most was, didn't monkey-boy (well, he did look like a monkey with that full facial beard) get a clue that yelling ""hello?"" in a room full of resting zombies didn't work when they almost got him in the church?  Next time he's in a room full of dead, what's he do?  That right, yells, ""hello?""  And he kept doing it through the whole movie.  He was about the only one who deserved to die and managed not to.  Oh well, it did give me a chance to get drunk by drinking a beer every time he said hello.  I tried to count how many times he did, but got to drunk.  I'll stick with the real zombie movies, like Dawn of the Dead."

First, most of the world is dead and we have these 2 strangers who want to hook up by the end of the film.  Then we have some army guys who are only looking for women  to rape.  Just ridiculous.  And I never understood if the dead only come out at night or what. Why didn't they attack that building the army guys were in constantly instead of only at night.  And why didn't the army guys go empty a grocery store instead of eating rotten eggs.  And why did they decide to kill Jim by walking him out in the woods. Why not just throw him outside the fense around that building.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: There are much better horror movies out there."

","If you have not seen this you are missing out and this gives away a little of what the films about. It is funny, gorey and grim (eye scene) but excellent story with great actors. Strange how they end up fearing other survivors more than the undead types roaming about. I liked the way it was done. The male survivor whose name i forget told a great bit about his fight to survive which was very visual and you could imagine it happening. God forbid anything like that ever happened to the real world for the majority of us would be dead e.g. 99.99%. I liked the strong female prescence and her change througout the movie from hard ass fight to survive to a more mellow person who realised what she had to live for other than simply existing."

","I thought this was a very interesting premise for a film.

From other comments I think this background was lost on the American audience.<br/><br/>I do think that the problem many people have with this film is that it was marketed as a horror film. Certainly I was expecting more of an 'aargh! zombies! run!' type film, but I was not disappointed to find it more of a character study of the aftermath. Though I think die-hard horror fans will be putt off by this.<br/><br/>I also loved the empty streets of London, unlike many people on this comments board I have no problem suspending my disbelief in order to appreciate the feel of the opening sequence and Jim's bewilderment.<br/><br/>Overall I think it was a very good film, though perhaps not a good horror film..."
"werelion","Null","1","2","2 May 2004"," 28 Minutes Too Long
","With the current worries about bird flu and SARS, this could have hit a deep nerve. But instead this is an unforgivably mediocre movie. Things start to go wrong from the foundation up. There's no clear premise or metaphor, just some random and not very coherent thoughts about man's violent nature - not exactly a unique theme, and one that's been handled much better elsewhere.<br/><br/>
Technically it sucks too. The direction is lazy and haphazard, and it's obvious from the deleted scenes and alternative endings that the director and producer had no clear vision of where they wanted the story to go, or much of an idea of why they were trying to tell a story in the first place. (Although getting loads of cash to play with is always a good incentive.)<br/><br/>The photography is laboured and self-indulgent, and in spite of some wide pans manages to feel claustrophobic, as if most of the story were happening elsewhere. The acting is average, and the script is a mongrel rip-off of countless older films. The writing uses swearing, of which there's plenty, as a substitute for passion and excitement, of which there's almost none at all.<br/><br/>The bottom line is the film gives the viewer absolutely no reason to care about anything that's happening on the screen. If you've never seen a horror movie before you may still find it kind of creepy. If you have, it comes near the bottom of the pile.<br/><br/>But it's not a dead loss. Ironically, the film's real value may be as an unintentional slice of life mockumentary of the Britain of the early 21st century - superficial, detached characters, charmless emotional calculation, and ugly urban sprawl. Capturing the feel of England today is the one thing the film does very well. (Then again, it hard not to wonder what it means that it does it so successfully with 99.9% of the population either dead or absent.)<br/><br/>Overall, this is just an English B-movie and would probably have worked better on TV. It's a decent enough filler, but not worth more than 6/10."

","A cure for insomnia.  The same marketing strategy was used for the DVD of Ghost Ship:  when you have a real turkey, ship HUGE quantities to the stores so people will believe it's worthwhile (otherwise, why would to store stock so many copies?)  Plus, the distributor has to get them out before word of couth can sink the sales.  Incredibly boring movie, virtually no characterization, the cliche'd evil zombies are shown for a total of about 7 minutes throughout the film, it uses the now stock shocker of a child-zombie (first used to shocking effect in Romero's Night of the Living Dead) and when the film-makers run out of plot they revert to the old ""Mars Needs Women"" ploy.  I'm not a feminist, but I found that turn offensive to both men and women....and creativity.  This movie is good for background noise when it comes to cable - write a letter, read a book, do some home repair, and look up occassionally for a distraction.  But under no circumstances buy the DVD or otherwise invest money directly in its viewing."
"mauvais","4","1","2","26 April 2004"," Day of the Triffids minus the triffids
","**Possible spoilers**<br/><br/>This movie would have been so much more fun with the triffids.  After all, it preserves almost every other character, locale and plot twist from the John Wyndham novel (without attribution).  Rage as a disease transmitted through blood and bodily fluids is the menace here, and an enthralling premise.  But it disintegrates when our hero goes native to defend his womenfolk.  What are we to think as our gentle, boyish leading man half-nakedly pounces on a would-be defiler and gouges his eyeballs with his bare thumbs?  Perhaps that rage is part of the human condition, and that it can be put to productive use when administered by slender, handsome boys with an accute sense of justice and chastity.  It's not a message that resonates with me.  This is one of those movies where, halfway through, I start rooting for the monsters.  The characters are cool kids wandering through an appocalypse like advertisements for the Trainspotting generation, totally unaware of their own glamour.  They elicit about as much sympathy as Tanqueray models (with the exception of the father character, who should have been the one to survive, but who could not have been in this movie since he's over thirty).  I will say that there are some lovely cinematic moments, particularly in the first half of the film and the sequences of a deserted London.  There are moments where the narrative pauses so that the lens can make leisurely poetry.  But ultimately Boyle and company have failed to take into account the lesson of previous apocalypse films, including one of the greatest, Dr. Strangelove: that you cannot tell such stories without a sense of humor.  Even George Romero knew that."

","Even if you're a cynical movie watcher, I challenge you to watch this movie in a dark room, suspend your disbelief, and not be frightened.  I won't claim this is a perfect film.  In fact, it seems as if either the creative forces behind the movie lost their edge at times or some Hollywood producers got their hands on it at some point.  As a whole, however, 28 Days Later delivers the goods.<br/><br/>Once you can accept a disease consisting of pure rage is infecting humanity turning everyone into zombies, you're good to go.  The most compelling part about the film is its characters.  They are actually more than pieces of meat waiting for the next act of utter stupidity to lead them to slaughter. Their humanity in the face of oblivion is absolutely believable.  This is not to say that they don't do things that put them in danger of getting shredded by zombies.  But, more often than not, zombie encounters are an organic part of the plot, not contrivances to eliminate a character who has hit his or her expiration date.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once the few central survivors have bonded over narrow escapes and nights spent huddled in fear, the movie switches gears and leads them to an encampment of soldiers with the weaponry and defenses necessary to fend off the zombies.  At this point the film takes a totally different, but fascinating take on human nature as it pertains to impending zombie takeover.  Of course, it wouldn't be any fun if the zombies didn't breach the sanctity of the makeshift army base.  The film unfortunately ends in a way you'll have to see to disbelieve, though the DVD has deleted endings that you can easily replace the real one with in your mind.<br/><br/>[end spoilers]<br/><br/>The important part here is that you'll be scared.  I've had nightmares about this movie, so be forewarned if you're impressionable.  I'm not normally entertained by horror movies.  This is not your run of the mill zombie flic, though."

I liked the first half of the film in where our protaganist Jim wonders londen trying to figure out what is going on.  yes it has been done many times before, but still is fun to see (the quite earth comes to mind---again the sci fin theme)  after he mets the other uninfected people, we get a road trip with frank his doughter, jim, and his girl. all this was still ok with me.  they heard a radio broadcast, and decide to drive to manchester, in the hopes that a cure is there, or the army that might be there, can offer them protection.<br/><br/>As soon as they leave london, the film goes downhill fast.  Frank was dead from the first moment we saw him, and the way he died was not very clever.

","This is profoundly not a horror movie, never in Danny Boyle's life would he tie his films down to any notions of genre or audience expectation. Most audience members expect a true genre movie, but this was not Boyle's goal. Some don't find the film scary enough, but do they not find the idea of being isolated and practically powerless in a nation overrun by a virus nobody can stop slightly disturbing? Or would they prefer Arnie to come out of a bush with a machine gun and obliterate some zombie scum? the disurbing thing about this film is that it seems so real, for example, it takes ages to kill a zombie because the survivors are not superheroes. it is shot like any social-realism film, like Boyle's Trainspotting it remains as true to the actual nature of humanity as possible, even though it discusses zombies and post-apocalyptic Britain. Sorry, it's not dawn of the dead, but it is real and in that respect it is disturbing. Perhaps the American audience would also benefit from background information, like all the havoc that viruses like BSE and Foot and Mouth have caused in the UK in order to find the film more disturbing? It may suffer from being a bit too culturally exclusive, but this did not hinder my enjoyment. I found it cool and wouldn't object to seeing it over and over."
"scarletminded","6","1","2","9 April 2004"," Ok, but seen parts of it before in movies like Cube and Night of the Living Dead...
","May contain spoilers...do not risk infection...<br/><br/>It was an ok film, but I was expecting more.  The acting was fine. I like the empty shots of London and the way the infected were filmed faster, creating a chaotic effect. <br/><br/>But, I have seen this film before.  Ok, pieces taken here and there from other films. A film where people get thrown into a place where there are few of them and then turn on each other, while trying to fight for the cause.  It should be a sub-genre and it does get boring. For those who have seen Cube, people are stranded alone in a cube and have to work together to get out...and, of course, the cop who is supposed to be a good guy is the killer in the end, much like army people whom seem to be the ones who will help, become evil. I get really sick of seeing this plotline played over and over again.  No group of men could possibly want to help others, with their guns and hormones...there is nothing for them but to rape women? I find this very hard to believe. It is like I had to suspend my disbelief over and over again. Annoying. <br/><br/>28 Days Later seems like a lot of films I have seen. First off, Night of the Living Dead, when people get stuck in a house and have to fend off zombies. Except, I don't think the people in this film are zombies and that was a bummer for me because I wanted to see crazy zombies not infected people!  Anyhoo, this also reminded me of the werewolf film Dog Soldiers, where Scottish people in the army are fighting against getting infected with Lycanthropism.  Of course, there are fights between these humans too. The empty London area reminded me of Vanilla Sky which was a better film, though not a zombie or horror film.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of gaps in it.  I wonder why monkeys and people were infected by this virus but not other animals?  All the other animals seem fine.  Is that supposed to be a metaphor that the Earth is better off without us?  I am confused since many animals share a lot of the same genes that this infection would only infect primates. Why were scientists even making a ""rage"" virus?  Is it a metaphor that activists that are supposed to be good in this film, yet bring about its destruction? Was another idea that Selene didn't trust others, but when she did, she suffered for her trust? It was sad to see her strong character change into a whiny mouse, having to have Jim save her. It just seemed so stereotyped for that to happen. I wanted to see Selene fight!<br/><br/>I was unsure if only the UK was infected, but I am positive I heard Selene say something about New York and Paris being infected before the TV stations stopped airing.  Then I read on some reviews that only the UK had the virus. I am also confused with the idea all of the UK is infected, yet England and Scotland have the highlands and many other far out areas, so it makes the idea of an all consuming plague hard to imagine...but it could move easily to the rest of Europe if one person that was infected got on a boat and sailed over, infecting people as they went. See that is my problem. Paris is much closer to London then, let's say, Wick, Scotland...yet Paris wasn't infected? Doesn't make any sense whatsoever. <br/><br/>This film is worth a watch and is better than a lot of horror films out there, but doesn't live up to all the hype I heard about it. The characters and motivations are 3D, yet slowly slip into 2D stereotypes quickly.  I was hoping for more. Those looking for gore won't find it, people looking for a great storyline will be left in the dust too. It would probably be a good rental or something to watch when you don't have anything else better to do. <br/><br/>6/10 Zombies"
"audiosabbath_29720","6","1","2","5 April 2004"," These are actually zombies, but just a little twisted
","SPOILERS SO BE PREPARED<br/><br/>First things first, these are zombies.  I know some of u are thinkin ""no, a zombie is a reanimated corpse."" well lets be honest people, these ""infected"" are as good as dead they have no resemblence of life more than zombies. They cant really do anything except run, kill, and sleep. They cant do math, read, have a conversation, understand that a bed is a place where u sleep; no they just kill and if u think about it they do go thru a process much like the process of becoming reanimated. The infected in this movie could be killed easily if hit in vital parts, but the infected were not responsive to pain and would not die or stop running if hit in parts of the body that arent critical to survival, much like a zombie not being able to be killed unless shot in the head. Is nobody catchin on yet.  The people who become infected are talking up to the point that they become an infected just like a person who becomes a zombie and can talk until he/she becomes a zombie. So these are zombies. In case u wanted to say that the people are crazies well thats somewhat impossible bc a person cannot be sane one minute and be given a virus that makes them beyond crazy and still be considered human bc that is basically zombification in a more indirect way. BUT ENOUGH OF THE ZOMBIES IN 28 DAYS LATER. Down to bidness. OK yes this movie does owe some to the original dawn of the dead and to day of the dead but thats ok. This is the positive section. OK a virus is released in england, but we dont get to witness all the devastation bc this movie is 28 days later and it just shows the aftermath. A creepy and somewhat effective notion. Jim wakes up from a coma and finds an empty london except for a lot of trash. Now some people say there should be more devastation and destruction and blood but Boyle was goin more for a spine-tingling effect and an odd effect which is understandable maybe not likable, but it depends on who you are. I was actually p***ed when selena killed mark and thats good bc it was a moment where i actually had an emotion instead of being like ok and so what. Brendan Gleeson had a great role and his death was also nerve-racking. The thing this movie did best was use references from dawn and day of the dead. This movie did not just basically have sceens that were almost direct rip-offs from those 2 movies but instead had sceens that were very similar but different enough not to deter anybody from the movie. The infection was also a good idea bc this gave these zombies a more original feel than what had been used over and over and over again in the past.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. This could take a while OK this movie had its moments of bad, neutral, and wouldnt be a bad thing if it made sense to what was goin on. The greatest example of wouldnt be a bad thing if it made sense to what was goin on is the soldiers who feel the need to procreate so that a new civilization can begin. This would not be a bad idea if ALL OF THE WORLD WAS OVERRUN WITH INFECTED but only england is infected so the soldiers need to procreate is a little bit pointless and does yet again bring about an example of an old cliche which will remain nameless. Now to the virus and how far it spread. Most of the movie gives the impression and even mentions that the virus has spread across the world, but we later find out that it is only in england and the rest of the world is keeping england in quarantine which really takes the fear of a ""rage"" virus down a few notches. This type of virus althought ludacris in thought would have the potential to bring down society over here in the western hemisphere but if its just in england the fact that it spreads in only 20-30 seconds would keep it in england so no need for us here in America to fear a ""rage"" virus comin from england. The movie is a little bit uneventful, but it is 28 days later so not a lot is goin on at that time. Its now time for my take on Jim transforming from superbitch bycycle courier to special operatives killing machine. I dont know how this is possible in the span of 2 days with no special training but he does manage it by god, and although incredibly stupid does give some action to the movie which was necessary bc this movie had to end. The end although not a terrible sceen is a bad sceen bc it puts the final nail in the couffin for any fear of this virus bc it shows humans in control for the most part and the zombies in a decaying state so that ruins the whole terror the the virus. This movie although not horrible, wasnt great either and ends up defeating itself throughout the movie."

!SPOILERS!<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Yes, some very cool and original things, like the coma storyline, Selena's take out of her partner in the house, the rats and of course the empty streets.<br/><br/>But then again, for a national capitol's streets to be SO empty, soon became 'false' - I found myself thinking ""Where is Everybody!!!"" like that airline commercial.  Not good.  I mean if the infected are alive, then it would stand to reason that when they attacked, some of their victims would be killed and there would be a lot more corpses about.  Not to mention abandoned cars.  Finally, the city would be burning in a lot of places.<br/><br/>The opening sequence in the lab was ridiculously lame as were the Director's comments about his ""statement"" about the virus.<br/><br/>I like Brendan Gleeson, and actually thought the characters were as cool as those in similar movies.  But a bicycle messenger's miraculous transformation into a soldier killing machine had me groaning.<br/><br/>As for the infected? REALLY disappointing.  When they stopped chasing the cab at the end of the tunnel sequence, I realized these 'monsters' are pussies.<br/><br/>Easy to kill, the only scary things about them are that they ambush and they are super contagious.  So why use edged implements like machetes with the STATED risk of getting blood in the mouth?  Apparently the writer couldn't be bothered with his own movie's logic or continuity.<br/><br/>Don't get me started with the whole ""Army Guys"" as bad guys clichÃ©. Ho-freakin-hum. Been there done that too often - Day of the Dead, Night of the Comet etc etc etc.<br/><br/>I suppose if I were female the whole ""Joy Division"" concept would have personally been more rattling, but by this point in the film, I was just waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>I just HATED the whole campout at the church ruins scene, from the insipid horses to the Valium nonsense to the complete breakdown of the character/circumstantial logic.  I mean drugging yourself to sleep in the wide open when there are INFECTED running about???  Then the way they offed Brendan Gleeson's character...<br/><br/>As I type this I realize that anything I liked was just the occasional cool scene or concept that shored up a lot of rather uninteresting, repetitive and ultimately disappointing story.<br/><br/>And the endings? ALL OF THEM SH_TE!<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about this is that having bought it on DVD I can trade it in for credit.<br/><br/>I chalk this one up in that same bewildering category as The Ring.  My sister and I were literally RAISED on horror films, we watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre as KIDS.<br/><br/>My wife and her friends got nightmares from watching The Ring.  My sis and I got bored.  How anyone could be frightened by a soggy chick crawling out of a TV set is beyond me.  It was stupid in Videodrome and Shocker, it is stupid here.  But I digress.<br/><br/>I really can't fault anyone for liking ANY movie; I certainly like some films that are greatly disdained.  And in the end it is only opinion.<br/><br/>And in my opinion, if all I can expect these days for horror is The Ring, 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, The Others, House of a Thousand Corpses and the BEST is Dawn of the Dead 2004, then I must sadly conclude that horror as a genre is DEAD.

It took me through a ride of emotions, from fear to relief, to pity, to just sheer horrified.  The acting was believable and natural, extremely well played.  Probably glad that I watched it during the day though. A movie that can make me believe in a natural way and have me thinking for a while later, even if it means having nightmares!!! A film that can seem real, and prevent you from being aware that it's made up, these are the kind of movies I prefer and ""28 days later"" certainly manages that, without even trying."
"bradpenn","8","1","2","1 April 2004"," interesting take on 'zombie' movies
","***spoilers*** This absolutely has to be the most well thought out zombie movie that I have ever seen.  It starts out in a fairly typical fashion: virus spreads and completely eliminates pretty much everyone except for a few who struggle to stay alive without a shred of actual hope (although the idea of Jim waking up without a clue is an interesting way to add some suspense/scariness to the beginning by focusing on the desolation and devastation of the disease before introducing too much gore). As with many zombie movies there are some really funny parts (I especially like when Jim hits the priest who is trying to eat him and then profusely apologizes while running away). However, what makes this movie really interesting, and sets it apart from many other movies of the same genre, is the seed of hope that exists due to the disease only spreading on an island rather than definitely affecting the whole earth.  Where other movies of this sort force the protagonists into a fairly absurd struggle for mere living, there is always the possibility that the rest of the world is not infected (realized by Jim while talking to the sergeant and when he is about to completely give up hope and he sees the plane overhead).  It is this ability for hope/heroism, while still maintaining the humor and gore of a typical b-movie that make this particular film so interesting to watch. Also, the segues between shots of the sky (where you can see the next shot in the upper left corner) fit really well with the movie and was quite brilliant.  If you hate every zombie movie you've ever seen and aren't much for horror, odds are you will dislike this movie.  However, if you've always been vaguely fascinated by zombie movies this is a truly innovative one."

","*Possiable minor spoilers*<br/><br/>It is really one of the best horror movies in recent years and thank god. The nineties were a dark age for horror for a while there wasn't anything then a reasonably good horror flick comes out, strikes it big and now were plagued by a bunch of crappy carbon copies and it was like that for years until 00' rolled around then things started looking up. We got movies like Ginger snaps, Dog soldiers, Cabin fever and of course 28DL. I wouldn't hesitate to call this one of the best horror movies in the past oh say 15 years. The directing is excellent poetic and beautiful (which can be said about the entire film) the score and writing were both just as good the performances were all great. And it was genuinely scary some very intense scenes and very well executed suspense. And very much like Romero's Dead trilogy the real enemies are not the infected (there not zombies) but the other survivors.<br/><br/>This film owes quite a bit to the DEAD trilogy and 28DL pays ample tribute.<br/><br/>So I say watch this if you want a thought provoking powerful and very frightening film."

I think all the special effects with blood were really cool. I do not want to give the story away, but the idea that animal testing could result in such a massive 'infection' is really scary.

"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","1","2","29 March 2004"," Great for the first half only!
","Possible Spoilers!<br/><br/>This film was turning out to be one of the best post zombie films I had ever seen.  There was nothing about it I didn't like until the end came upon us which I think  got a bit silly and out of touch with the story.  You don't really rate this film as part of the zombie genre amongst the Evil Dead and The Night of the Living Dead Trilogy, but it's the closet thing you can compare it to.  This is the kind of struggle that could happen to us any day now, not in the same context but something similar.   What I really took a shine to with 28 Days Later was it dealt with the loss of people you loved. When Jim leaves the hospital in a complete oblivious state to the new world that has fell upon him he meets with two strangers that help him escape two Zombie like characters from a petrol station and they fill him in on the recent happening.  When they tell him what has happened , the scene where Jim thinks of the relatives and loved ones he might have lost is just heartbreaking as you have to find your own way of dealing with it.   When he and Selena meets Brendan Gleeson and his daughter the plot thickens and they all try to come to terms with what has happened. Then they decide it's best to just try and get out of London and go to a place where they believe there is refuge and on the way they overcome many obstacles and see how much life has changed since it happened and it does it superbly when they are having a picnic and they a see a few horse running in a field.  It is a beautiful scene where they just look at them and think of what they have lost.     I think the movie does tend to shy away from the plot the moment they the soldiers at the barracks.   For a while it's really good and when Jim is trying to get his two friends to safety it is still very good but you start to see a different to Jim without really explaining why he is like this. The scene where he has to kill the father he resists for a second, whether because it's in front of the man's daughter and just hesitates to make sure she doesn't see it but he just turns into this crazy guy without a care in the world.  It reminded me of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now when he goes to kill Colonel Kurtz and he comes out of the river with cam flash all over his face.<br/><br/>It's a very meaningful film with a lot of messages about loss and starting from the beginning with excellent cinematography and a great soundtrack to go with it.  But I think it strays away from the plot towards the end and I know it shouldn't ruin it but for me it does."

","**some minor spoilers follow**<br/><br/>There's been a bizarre renaissance in zombie movies lately.  This is my favorite one, probably because it's merely zombie-like.  In place of the usual cannibalism and excessive gore you'd expect from a film like this, ""28 Days Later"" focuses more on character development and atmosphere.  The early scenes, set in a deserted London, are the most effective; it really does feel like the apocalypse has come, and nothing about the production appears phony or staged.  Later on, the action is confined to the more modest setting of a manor house, and things slow down a bit.  But the opening segment is still some of the most effective horror I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I saw this in the company of a good buddy who thought that the characters were badly developed, and I guess she has a point - we don't get THAT much background - but by horror standards, what we do get is exceptional.  What really matters to me is that I like the heroes (and I do), so I don't want them to get killed.  And that's all you need to drive a movie like this.<br/><br/>Could it have been better?  Well, yeah - everything can be better - but overall, this is a stylish take on zombie films.  My only real reservation is the happy ending, especially since it's tacked on after a sequence in which Jim goes berserk and kills the soldiers.  I get the message - Jim succumbs to ""the rage"" without contracting the virus, proving the theory that ""people killing people"" is the norm for humanity - but how am I supposed to switch over to cheerful mode after being fed this depressing line of thinking?  To me, that's the film's only substantial weakness; a grim ending would have served it better (and such an ending does exist, tacked on to the DVD release as an extra)."

","Before any real review of this movie can be done, there needs to be some clarification on the genre of the picture. The film was marketed as pure horror in the United States. While this angle definitely worked to pack the theaters, it was not a completely accurate summation of the nature of the movie. The movie is first and foremost a post-apocalyptic drama. There are horror aspects, yes, but it is not a scare-a-minute zombie film by any means. This distinction is what makes the film so great.<br/><br/>
A group of animal rights activists raid a primate research lab. In doing so, they release an infection that turns its victims into raging murderers. The infection is carried in blood and will infect a person in less than thirty seconds. A brutal opening to the movie leads into the haunting title of the movie and takes us ahead 28 days later when we meet our hero, Jim (Cillian Murphy).<br/><br/>Jim, a bicycle courier involved in an accident the day the infection was released, has just awoken from a comatose state. As Jim begins to discover that he is quite possibly alone in London, the audience is treated to dazzling shots of an empty, abandoned city. This sequence also highlights perfectly the amazing use of music found throughout the film.<br/><br/>
Jim eventually finds himself under the care of two other survivors. Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris) have been living on the run and have managed to stay alive. It is Selena who explains to Jim that the world as he knew it the day of his accident is gone. Everyone she, Mark and Jim have known and loved is dead and anyone left alive is left to run from the infected that roam free. The group makes its way to Jim's home and there is an extremely touching series of scenes that take place.<br/><br/>
Jim also meets a father and daughter pair. The father, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and daughter, Hannah, have caught a signal from an army officer that proclaims an end to infection. As the group sets off to find these soldiers the movie takes its first major shift in tone as it becomes a road movie for a bit. There will be one more shift in tone after the road trip is over, but it is this tone that most will find surprising and the acceptance of the change of events in the movie is what will determine if you enjoy the movie or not.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be brilliant for unusual reasons. The script itself is nothing new, amazing or all the clever in itself. What makes the movie work so well is a combination of the paranoia found in the first and last sections of the movie, excellent actors that bring a scary sense of believability to the screen and the use of digital video to enhance the raw nature of the events onscreen. Danny Boyle has been, for my money, a very hit or miss director, but has always managed to bring clever and ultimately engaging images to the screen. In 28 Days Later, Boyle takes his digital images and enhances them to make almost every shot memorable. This, combined with several fine examples of how to use music to enhance emotion, makes for a film that goes above and beyond its source material to create more of an experience than a film.<br/><br/>28 Days Later was mainly faulted for its third act and its theatrical ending. The third act takes a turn as the group of survivors end their road trip and meet up with the soldiers claiming to have the answer to infection. While this is an unexpected direction for the movie, I don't fault the film for it. The scenes found in this final section of the film contain the best dialogue and some quality horror elements. I may also be one of the few that actually enjoyed the ending as seen in the theaters. I do, however, understand and am frustrated by a few unanswered questions."

Why isn't his bed full of s***? Why are the streets empty when there must have been a major slaughter going on? Why are the survivors getting by on sugar and fluids when you can find canned food everywhere?<br/><br/>Why are the infected filmed in a way they look exactly like the ratmonkey-thing in Braindead? I couldn't take them serious, looking like clay-figures! Why are the infected dying so soon when they don't kill each-other (they seem to be working together). If the answer is that they don't want to eat anymore, why are they alive after 28 days? Why doesn't Jim ask any questions about what caused the infection (he even threw the newspaper away) or what the infection causes?<br/><br/>Why does Salena say they'll have to get out of Jim's house because more infected will come, while in Frank's house nobody seems worried about ""more of them"" at all. Why didn't Frank look for weapons when he was retrieving buckets and pans from all the apartments?<br/><br/>And these questions just raised in the first part of the movie, I'll spare you the rest.

It is a work of fiction, true, but the main characters do a lot of things in this movie that people in the Real World simply would not do. Their choices and decisions seem to serve only to put them in a position for the next shocking scene. Speaking of which, once I started thinking about the virus that infects the population of the UK, I kept wondering ""Why aren't these blood-spewing hyperactive zombies attacking each other?

","I truly don't understand why some people have a virulent distaste for this film. And to say that it wasn't scary?! I wish they would explain why. I got pretty creeped out. Resident Evil was a very similar plot, with a known actress/model as the star, and expensive CGI effects- but the editing and scare gags weren't crafted well enough to make me jump. 28DL didn't have all the pricey stuff, but made good use of editing, camera angles, and the power of suggestion to create a much better atmosphere of dread. The actors were also much much better.<br/><br/>********Spoiler Alert*******<br/><br/>
I think Boyle does a great job with what he had to make an effective thriller. First, I think developing the characters more than most horror flicks was the first step because you then care about what happens to them. Also, the fear of being chased down and torn apart is much more relatable then backing into a corner waiting for the zombies to lumber over and surround you. That reminds me of a scene in Resident Evil when the team gets surrounded by slow moving rotten faced zombies. For some reason it didn't creep me out. But when Jim pleads for Selena to wait for him as they race up the flight of stairs whilst pursued by infecteds that you really don't even get to see, my stomach was in knots. I loved the Selena and Jim romance!!! I knew she liked him because she was mothering him so much- in a brusque way but nonetheless. The bossy little comments like:"" don't get perishable food, Jim. Where are you going, Jim? Why, Jim? We already have enough food, Jim. Why didn't you tell me you were sick earlier, Jim?"" or things of that nature. Her mother role for hannah took me by surprise though. I'm glad it happened but wished there was more development to justify it. The pace slowed down however when they reached the military base. Its not that I didn't like it, but it just didn't seem as suspensful. The third act gave me more of a ""looming danger"" feeling. I knew those soldiers were gonna try something with Selena when they were driving back and one of them was eyeing her. I was afraid that it was gonna get really ugly because I hate rape scenes. When they started tearing off her clothes I started bracing myself to see something more disgusting than the last scene of Hannibal. I can't believe that Boyle said they toned down that scene after the original got a really bad reaction from test screenings. How far did they go? I know Naomie said she felt really bad about filming this scene. Even though its just acting, its still humiliating to have your clothes torn of by a buncha guys you don't really know. I think that the first alternative ending (which was the original one), would be more realistic. For heavens sake, he got shot point blank in the gut! But the theatrical ending would make more sense in the context of the story. I thought Jim symbolized hope and optimism. It's also a nice motif to end with: he wakes up on a bed, starting a new life. I am so glad they didn't even produce 'radical alternative ending.' It was just beyond stupid. Total blood transfusion? Jim sacrificing himself. How truly lame. Boyle should be embarrassed that he even came up with that storyline. About the digital video quality- it didn't have to look that way. Robert Rodriguez uses the same medium and his pictures look good- almost like 35mm. In 28 DL the grittiness works most of the time, but some shots are just atrocious. the worst are the closeups with Priv. Mitchell with Selena in tow, listening apprehensively to Jim moving about in the attic. They look like they used a cheap flashlight for lighting."

","When I rented 28 days later on dvd from blockbuster, I wasn't expecting much: a lot of gore, usual end of the world cliches, and ultimately a bad film. To my dismay, however, 28 Days Later completely surprised me and surpassed my expectations by a lot. This film is scary in a sense, although I didn't have a problem sleeping after seeing the film. What is so great about 28 Days is the director, Danny Boyle, who if I was a member of the Academy, I would have penciled him in for a nomination for Best Director for 2003. Of course, the Academy stays clear of horror films, but in my view, this film would be the exception. His use of the hand held digital camera makes 28 Days Later a surprisingly beautiful film even though its of the horror genre. I would even go far to say that this is the most beautiful (if such a thing is possible) and best shot horror film I have ever seen. In essence, this is an artsy horror film, not your typical action filled film whose only purpose is to scare the audience. This film really isn't about killer zombies, but rather, about how humans act in such desperate situations, or more specifically, how humans completely isolated from the outside world function and interact with one another. Again, Boyle's direction is the best part of the film. The shots at the beginning of the movie of an abandoned London are some of the most chilling ever captured on film. Furthermore, the way Boyle portrays the journey from London to Manchester in the middle of the film is truly a work of art. Other positive features of the film are the musical score, the acting, and the twisted last thirty minutes of the film. Don't buy into the alternative endings on the dvd: Boyle got it right the first time. 28 Days Later was one of the 10 best films of 2003, and I highly recommend this film to any who enjoys good film making."

","While I don't believe `28 Days Later' was the scariest, most<br/><br/>intense movie I've ever watched (as it was marketed), it does do<br/><br/>an effective job generating a threatening atmosphere.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews that debunk all the horror elements from<br/><br/>this movie, but I tend to disagree. `28 Days Later' is not just a<br/><br/>mere suspense thriller. There are pervasive science fiction and<br/><br/>horror movie elements spread throughout that cannot be denied.<br/><br/>I'd like to think of this movie as an amalgamation of the three,<br/><br/>making for a satisfying, albeit unoriginal movie.<br/><br/>There are obvious influences here. Most notably `The Last Man on<br/><br/>Earth,' (the often overlooked predecessor to `The Omega Man'),<br/><br/>and George Romero's `Day of the Dead.'<br/><br/>The premise involves a highly contagious virus called `rage' that is<br/><br/>willingly unleashed by a group of animal rights activists in London.<br/><br/>The infection generates paranoia and madness in its victims, <br/><br/>eradicating any and all `human' emotions. As I understood it,<br/><br/>these `infected' people only seek to kill or infect the otherwise<br/><br/>un-infected.<br/><br/>Anyway, a small group of survivors follow a strange radio signal<br/><br/>that promises `salvation' and a cure. What they discover is ... well,<br/><br/>the exact opposite of what they were hoping and looking for. I won't<br/><br/>give away any more elements of the plot so as not to spoil the<br/><br/>movie for anyone.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle, in my opinion, is a good director that's more<br/><br/>often than not saddled with mediocre scripts. His best work was<br/><br/>`Shallow Grave.' What is often considered his greatest work,<br/><br/>`Trainspotting,' was to me boring ... bereft of any likable<br/><br/>characters. With `28 Days Later,' Boyle tries to re-introduce a<br/><br/>popular genre to an audience weary of bad horror and thriller<br/><br/>movies. The result is a decent film ... but it's neither fresh nor<br/><br/>unconventional. (Though I did read that Boyle shot in a<br/><br/>high-definition digital format ... I suppose that's a trifle<br/><br/>unconventional.)<br/><br/>What I liked was Richard Matheson's iconoclast book, `I Am<br/><br/>Legend.' It was the basis for `The Last Man on Earth' and the ugly<br/><br/>`Omega Man.' In it, a man discovers that he is the only survivor of a<br/><br/>plague that's changed mankind into slow, unthinking vampires.<br/><br/>
I would have liked to have seen something similar to that. A<br/><br/>faithful, modern interpretation of Matheson's novel would make for<br/><br/>an excellent horror movie if done correctly. I guess I was hoping for<br/><br/>something like that in `28 Days Later.'<br/><br/>Also ... and maybe this is just trifling, but I had kind of hoped to see<br/><br/>a couple flashback scenes where London's population began the<br/><br/>mass `exodus.' Sort of a frenzy scene in which general law and<br/><br/>order de-evolved into chaos. However, I understand that the film's<br/><br/>budget probably didn't allow for it."

","** SPOILER **<br/><br/>Having heard from various sources that this was an extreme film, i settled down, fully expecting to be horrified.  Whilst there was a fair amount of blood vomiting and unpleasantness from the Infected, it wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be.  Lovely cinematography, particularly in the shots of abandoned London.  The lack of a 'name' also worked well, as the relatively unknown cast seemed to really gel together.  Some of the soldier's acting was a little ropey, but good efforts all round.<br/><br/>Plotwise, very dark and disturbing, and not exactly optimistic about the general character of mankind, but an entertaining couple of hours nonetheless."

","I watched this movie not knowing what to expect about it. I had heard a lot of reviews of how good it was and I really enjoyed Trainspotting, so I guess I had my expectations a little high but I also wasn't too attracted by it at the same time. Overall the movie is good. It has good acting and an interesting story but I really don't consider this to be a masterpiece or even to be a disturbing movie at all (maybe I'm just too jaded already). The most outstanding features about the movie was that it was made with such a low budget, the story was very nicely told and it's nice to see the characters as human beings rather than unbelievable one dimensional characters which Hollywood is so used to produce. This is a movie that will certainly entertain you if you know what to expect, and I tell you, don't expect too much gore or even to get very scared or disturbed (well at least that didn't happen to me), because I think the main goal of the movie is to tell a story and not just to shock and impress, and I give it credit for that."

Everything about it, the virus, the activists, the soldiers, the emotions, the setting, the shocking revelation near the end and above all the hope.<br/><br/>Not everyone will get this movie, and maybe that is for the best.

","There are a gazillion light-years between british/european and hollywood film-making so there is absolutely no way to compare this film with anything hollywood-ish.

","So, here's an idea.  Let's actually make a movie that scares you or keeps you tense and hire some people who can actually act in our movie. None of these things were in this movie.  I can honestly say that next to 'Vanilla Sky' and 'Bring It On' this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and ironically I saw all three in the theater.  I have said before in other reviews that horror is my favorite genre, and as an expert in that field, I can say with all certainty that this movie was no horror.  Perhaps grosse at times, but not scary and certainly not intense.  I went with a large group of people, and while all the girls were hiding their faces and covering them in the boys' shirts, whilest the guys were on their edge of their seats hurraying and applauding how good it was, I was the only one sitting there yawning and closing my eyes, only because I was bored hoping the movie would end soon so that I could leave the theater. It was boring, and a waste of time and definitely money.  I know it was a huge success, in Europe and America, but I despised it. No interesting plot, the fact that older men wanted to have sex with a little girl disgusted me, and I really didn't care to see the lead character exposed full frontal constantly.<br/><br/>If you want my advice, don't see this film.  Save your money and see a good horror like 'Nightmare' or 'Scream'.  Stuff you can count on to give you a good plot or storyline.<br/><br/>I give this movie 1/2 out of 10 for actually making it to the theater instead of direct to video.

","""28 Days Later"" is the rare film that generates true horror and suspense and then dwelves deeper.  Perhaps one of the most sophisticated thrillers, this film never misses a beat and strives to pummel the viewer into submission by attacking our deepest fears: loneliness, isolation, disease, hate, etc. By examining these issues, Boyle address the true nature of what creates a zombie, while in the process deconstructing the entire zombie sub-genre. A truly remarkable effort from a truly remarkable artist."
"ThurstonHunger","7","1","2","1 February 2004"," Allegory versus Gory
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>For those disappointed that this is not a ""zombie film,"" well I guess we all want to see ourselves on the silver screen.<br/><br/>No, no, no...but ""28 Days Later"" delivered enough for me. I've not seen the ""Triffid"" film others spoke of, but certainly ""Lifeforce"" and John Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" (my idea of a horror masterpiece) were called to mind.<br/><br/>I suspect the blankness of the main character at the start of film, is one way to make it easier for a viewer to identify with him or her. Silence can speak volumes...and win Academy Awards for females. :(<br/><br/>Anyway, images of an abandoned metropolis are always fascinating to me. I didn't quite connect with the espirit du corps of our ragtag heroes (editing *out* the taxi cab vaudeville was a good idea). More backstory on the daughter/dad pair might have helped?<br/><br/>In other extra's we are ""treated"" to three alternative endings, I think that speaks to two things. First it speaks to the power of editing (although one of those endings is presented somewhat spellbindingly with just storyboard and the director and writer reading). Secondly it speaks to a vision of the story here that is not so strong.<br/><br/>Here, the main thread of the film sticks to a ""you gotta have hope when skies are grey...and eyes are blood red"" theme. This gets sealed by a kiss or two. Pretty safe.<br/><br/>The kissers both undergo transformations that come across as a bit abrupt. Jim escapes execution to come back nearly as rabid as a RAGEr. That sort of makes sense, in a ""you-or-me"" assault, and he did have a baptism of blood in a really wrong pitstop along the way. That was a classic, ""don't go in there...please don't go in there""...moment for me. Too many of those can kill a film, hamburgers or no.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Selena's move to de facto motherhood from every-woman-for-herself seemed even more out of place.<br/><br/>All that happens at the outpost at the edge of Manchester's burning. Those scenes, while the most flawed, are the most interesting. What must happen for us to lose our humanity...is a question posed. That answer is not just being infected by some sinister virus.<br/><br/>What is the ""nature"" of man, of the world? Are bloodlust and lust such strange bedfellows? That was tempered by a very leit motif of Adam and Eve chapter two!<br/><br/>Also would the world cut off its England to save its commonwealths? Would we vote the whole island off during this game of Survivor?<br/><br/>Some assail this as it tries to be an ""intelligent"" film, and hey at least it tries. Ultimately the panic of the day doesn't allow for much time to philosophize...the frenetic nature of attacks is well underscored by expensive digital dithering and a far more simple sound effect.  Woooosh.<br/><br/>Again I bought the premise of the demise of civilization, and felt tense throughout without being too easily manipulated. I'll always prefer a film that opts for allegory over the merely gory.<br/><br/>I think one key to these thought-thrillers might be keeping a smaller scope for the story. In the aforementioned ""The Thing"" we get snowed in isolation. ""The Cube"" exists in its own vaccum... Maybe that's a key...work in the cozy confines of a microcosm??<br/><br/>All told, style, soundtrack, odd bits (Jim shaving himself) I recommend seeing this with a<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>and suggest folks who enjoy the film read Jose Saramago's ""Blindness""<br/><br/>Sorry this has been an even more diffuse review than normal, but one more observation. The opening with the ape strapped in front of the multiple television screens showing atrocities, is this the horror film calling the world horrific?<br/><br/>Do images of violence beget violence? That would be quite a controversial stance for a film. That scene with the banks of television stood out from the sort of promethean warning of lab science leading us astray in the opening."

","Imagine this.  You wake up in a hospital after an accident and no one is around.  No people, no nurses, no one.  You pull the tubes from your forearms and pay little attention to the room's door which has been barricaded.  You stumble into the hospital lobby, and again, no people.  You walk out onto the usual busy streets of the metropolis and there is a deafening quietness.  You see cars abandoned on the road and money is flying through the air like pollen on a windy day.  Again, no people.  You walk into a church and see piles of bodies piled one on top of each other rotting in a disgusting stench.  You see everything, but signs of life. Imagine.<br/><br/>28 Days Later's protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) finds himself in this very position after waking up from a car accident only to find that a virus spread by monkey's infected with rage' has overcome the city.<br/><br/>Crafted by Trainspotting director Danny Boyle on a budget of only $8 million dollars, 28 Days Later became 2003's Blair Witch Project wherein word of mouth spread quickly that this was the' scary movie to see this summer, and audiences spilled out $10 million on opening week-end on-way to an impressive $45 million haul.<br/><br/>The film itself is not entirely original.  A virus spreads making zombie like creatures out of anyone who is contaminated with their blood, and a group of non-infected individuals fight with mighty arsenals to defeat the ravaging brood.  Scary, huh.<br/><br/>The story follows Jim as he tries to adapt to his new environment and look for additional signs of controlled life and hope.  Along the way, Jim buddies up with a female survivor and later with a father and his young daughter who are safely protected in a high rise apartment building.  After hearing a broadcast over a transistor radio, the group goes out in search for others, fighting zombies and the disease at every stop.<br/><br/>It is when they reach the army base that the movie begins to slip a little into familiar and unfortunate genre clichés.  Although heavily armed and secure in their location, the new family unit begins to fight amongst themselves and soon they are addressing their animal desires for sex and dominance.   It's hard to believe that when they are all that is left in the world they would sacrifice some for the pleasure of others. <br/><br/>
But let's give credit where it is due.  Although lacking in premise originality, the film is generally entertaining due largely in part to the eeriness of the films backdrop of roads and cities completely vacant of any moving person or object.  And where as most zombie films seem to have creatures crawling out of their graves, 28 Days Later gives us a realistic story as to how the disease originated and how it could spread so quickly.<br/><br/>I guess what ultimately makes 28 Days Later so scary is how believable the notion of a disease wiping out all of humanity could occur.  Look no further than Mad Cow Disease, AIDS or SARS in the last couple of years and you wonder how close to this reality we might actually be.  Scary indeed."

","Every summer, the news media pounds a story or series of stories into the ground until that season is known for it. Consider a couple of summers ago, which was the summer of shark attacks. Or the recent summer of child abductions. In reality, there were not more shark attacks or child abductions in their respective summers, but the media grabbed a couple of high profile cases and built trends around them (road and air rage media circuses also apply here, very fittingly). 2003 will probably remembered as the summer of SARS and monkeypox, which makes it the perfect summer in which to see `28 Days Later'. As the story opens, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma in a locked London hospital room and finds it deserted, the key to his room shoved under the door. In a series of amazing shots, he wanders by Big Ben and through Piccadilly Circus and finds no one. He does find walls plastered with missing persons photos that immediately bring 9/11 to mind (although the film was made before then). He finally finds three people who bring him up to date: a vicious virus was accidentally unleashed by animal rights activists freeing specimens from an Army facility. The virus is blood borne, and if you're infected, you will be dead in twenty seconds. Those infected are overcome with rage, attack those around them, and vomit infected blood everywhere. Get this blood in an orifice or wound, and you've got twenty seconds yourself. In twenty-eight days, England has been wiped out. This sounds like one of Romero's living dead movies (but since the writer wrote the book and movie `The Beach' and the director, Danny Boyle, is responsible for `Trainspotting', there is no doubt an anti-drug subtext here) with one major difference: these zombies are fast. They move like lightening, although they do nothing more than infect the living, not devour them. This virus is not a smart one; without sustenance, the world will be quickly wiped out, and the virus with it. The first third of the movie, the discovery phase, plays like `Night of the Living Dead'. The second third, wherein four survivors search for others, plays like `Dawn of the Dead' (including a deliberate homage, a shopping trip). The end finds them in a military base, like the one in `Day of the Dead', right down to the zombie tied up for experimental purposes. But Boyle did not make a mere horror movie here. This is social commentary with a pulse, fast and furious, and it will put you on the edge of your seat. It's shot in grainy digital video for a documentary feel, and the camera struggles to keep up with the action when it occurs. You think you see more than you do: the savage flashes of marauding monsters will make you shrink away from the screen, but the gore is minimal. Boyle overreaches somewhat; horror fans will no doubt jones for more outright scares, and the audience that would love dissecting the film will be put off by the graphic violence and tone. The cast is game, with Naomie Harris strong as the seemingly tough chick and Brendan Gleeson sympathetic as a concerned but gruff father. Everyone digs deep and seems real enough to make you care, a rare trait in a horror movie, even an arty one. It will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever seen a movie that the military folks are up tp no good (although I would have never guessed their sinister plot), so as the film rachets up the tension, building towards the climax, it actually loses creativity. The shocks here are among the best in the film, but we can feel it running out of speed. Watch the scene with the rats in the pitch black tunnel; that is the kind of nail-biter the last part of the film should have delivered. And the actual finale seems a little too upbeat for such a dark vision; it jars with everything that has come before it. Boyle has said that the movie is about Jim's search for a father figure, but that message is obscured by the seeming prescience of current events the film achieves. Strap in and read into `28 Days Later' whatever you wish to; there's enough here for everyone."

The movie does have some ""authentic"" feel to it during the first 15 minutes, but I never really cared about the characters.

","'28 Days Later' is Boyle's best to date.  It grasped every aspect in film that we all look for and was intricately delivered with masterful vision. This film instantly flung itself onto my personal top ten list, and I feel that it will easily be a reknowned classic in the future, much like how 'Citizen Kane' was overlooked at first and has its towering status now.  The biggest thing it has going against it is how it is marketed-- as a horror film (which was the flaw for Shyamalan's 'Signs').  Horror is an art form that is easily swept aside to make way for the domineering drama pieces. So, even though it isn't horror, it is labeled that because of the unwise advertising choices.<br/><br/> What Boyle acheived was a top-notch thriller with a story that was strangely reminiscent of Hitchcock's masterpieces.  The element of surprise was always there-- if you say you didn't jump, you're a liar.<br/><br/> This superior film is a strong 8 out of 10 stars, and will be one of those few and unique timeless gems.

","It might be misleading to call it the most original zombie flick.<br/><br/>The truth is, it's a zombie flick at heart, it's just a different kind of zombie flick. It plays homage to zombie movies, so a lot of the typical zombie flick formulas are still present.<br/><br/>The typical zombie flick is all chessy gore, and it underlines a subplot of how the evil in human may be more horrifying than the man-eating zombies. Danny Boyle basically flip the typical zombie formula to the other side, it emphasizes on survival and human emotions in an apocalyptic scenario. The zombies are just a backdrop, it could've been any other apocalyptic scenario.<br/><br/>Though he chose to use zombies as the backdrop, and he did well in updating the zombie formula. They run, they're strong, there's a reasonable explanation of where they came from. It's filmed with a lot of mockamentary realism. But ultimately, the movie is a human story, not a horror movie. It doesn't provoke fear as often as a typical horror movie. Though when it does, it does it well.<br/><br/>And for the human story involved, it's simply about a helpless boy who grew to face the enemy for the ones he loved and becoming a survivalist, and the girl who was a survivalist and learned to love and enjoy life again. It's very simple yet well-balanced.<br/><br/>The romance is very convincing, unlike most Hollywood romance that feel tacked on and by-default. When Jim tried to kiss Selena the first time, it was obvious that he did out of desperation, loneliness and helplessness, not true affection. Selena rejected obviously because she saw that, and it didn't matter if she had any feelings towards Jim, she would refuse any emotional attachment to anyone regardless. By the end of the movie, they got together for good reasons, and we are all understand and appreciate how they got there.<br/><br/>The low points: It felt like an 80-min movie stretched out too long. It feels like there's only 2 acts. As a human story, 4 characters are not enough to explore the wide range of emotions and interactions that exist in an apocalyptic scenario.<br/><br/>Shortcomings aside, the movie feels fresh and original. Being a big Danny Boyle fan (ever since ""Shallow Grave"", before the ""Trainspotting"" phenomenon), this movie is a redeeming attempt to the disaster that was ""the Beach"". And I think he won my heart once again.<br/><br/>If you are a typical horror movie fan, this is not the flick for you. You'll probably be disappointed.

"MF210","4","1","2","11 December 2003"," I do not understand the praise for this film
","My Rating: *1/2 out of ****. <br/><br/>Almost every critic praised this movies this summer, especially Rolling Stone. The film also did fairly well at the box office (45 million is pretty good for this kind of film). Yet, when I was done watching it, I wondered if I had seen the same film. 28 Days Later is a stylish, occasionally suspenseful, and a somewhat inventive film. However, it is also boring, has unlikable characters, flat performances, an unintelligent script, a dumb ending,  and to top it off a moment of pretension. <br/><br/>For a while, 28 Days Later appears to be something different from the normal zombie film. The scenes where Jim was walking through London are cool. It is shown as an empty city with absolutely no noise, this makes for a scary place to be. The film has a distinct look to it that reminded me of the look of The French Connection. Like that film, this look gives 28 Days Later a more gritty feel to it. 28 Days Later has atmosphere from the beginning to the end. <br/><br/>Like I mentioned the film does have its suspenseful moments. The scenes where London is presented an an empty city. We do not know what is going to happen but were on the edge of our seats to find out what does happen. There is also a scene where the characters rush to change a tire before the zombies get them. The film also does a few inventive things. The look of the zombies are simple(Red Eyes) but it is effective. Also, I liked the way how the people became zombies (blood in the eye and the barfing was cool).<br/><br/>
However, even though there are good things about 28 Days Later it has alot of bad points. The scenes in London are interesting because of the suspense and style. You briefly get to know the characters too. However, once the characters go on a road trip this film goes down hill. The film becomes boring and you do not like the characters. I mean not every film you have to necessarily like the characters but I really did not care if the characters died here. There is also a pretentious moment during the road trip. How out of place is classical music here?  The film also suffers from flat performances. <br/><br/>As mediocre as the road trip moments are they are not the worst part of the film. Why in the hell did they get the military involved? This part of the film has such a tacked on feel to it. Its also really dumb and not suspenseful in the slightest. The ending is terribly bad too. I really did not want to see the characters survive at all. <br/><br/>The film also feels incomplete because of the unintelligent script. Why are some of the people dead and some of them are zombies? If the virus was released into London why isn't everyone affected? I am not saying a film can not be open ended but the holes here are ridiculous. <br/><br/>I was anticipating alot from 28 Days Later, maybe too much. Danny Boyle proved The Beach was no fluke. He really is losing steam. Yet, while The Beach was mediocre, 28 Days Later is just bad. It could have been good with a better script but from what I see here it is a mess."

As it is, the top zombie movie of all time is still ""Dawn of the Dead"". Everything since then, including the sequel ""Day of the Dead"", has been a shoddy rip-off. Some people will split hairs and say ""these aren't zombies!"" but they really are. They're just zombies that move fast, which was a good idea. In theory it would ratchet up the action. Funny that there is still so little of it in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts out okay, if a little predictably. Some guy wakes up in a hospital to find that the world has been taken over by flesh-eating ""infected"" people. Within the first few minutes the movie makes its first mistake: the man immediately falls in with other survivors, not spending any serious time on his own coping with the problem. His rather fey appearance and wimpish reaction to the situation makes him hard to accept as an action hero later in the movie.<br/><br/>Things quickly start to become a by-the-numbers affair. He meets a coed survivor group, with bulky masculine guy and suspiciously sexy, hardened, ""I don't need anybody"" female. Since the second guy is a problem he is immediately dispatched in a pretty cool scene (but it makes one wonder how the guy survived for so long, if he's so careless). Then the hero and heroine are free to ... ahem ... explore each other.<br/><br/>Here another mistake is made, as they again manage to find two other survivors immediately - a man and his daughter - and team up with them. I am a big fan of Brendan Gleeson and it's fun watching him work. But again the story begins to suffer from this development. Everyone suddenly decides to go try to find an Army station nearby that they pick up on the radio. On the way the crew stumble across a supermarket, with unlocked doors, whose wares are suspiciously clean and well-organized (you mean to tell me during the panic, chaos, riots, and confusion nobody thought to ransack the store?). They foolishly venture into a dark underground passage where they are bum-rushed by a bunch of infected guys, and manage to escape in a highly implausible manner (Gleeson would have to be pretty strong to lift a car with two people in it, and laden with groceries).<br/><br/>When they reach the Army station, everything falls apart. Gleeson dies in a ridiculous manner. The remaining guy and girls are taken to the army base, where the guy is told that the women will be raped and there is nothing he can do about it. He is taken out to be executed and escapes, then spontaneously turns into Rambo, surviving in the wilderness with no weapons or vehicle, then returning to off an entire squad of elite military personnel. Then he is gutshot, but due to the miracles of a quick fade and snappy editing, he is much better ""28 days later ..."" and is able to partake in a cheesy happy ending.<br/><br/>So many mistakes are made in this film. Why is our hero not given a chance to develop on his own before meeting others? Why are the others he meets so darn stupid? The film is strangely patterned after perhaps the worst zombie movie of all time, ""Day of the Dead"", in that it sets aside a perfectly good horror basis - zombies - and instead decides to go the well-trodden route of ""man is the ultimate evil"". The introduction of the squad of soldiers is the death's knell of the movie. From that point it's as if all logic and reason are discarded and a straightforward action movie ending is all the writer and director can imagine, complete with thudding techno music and neck-snapping rapid editing.<br/><br/>The ending is such an insult. We see our supposed hero gutshot, at close range, by a very powerful handgun. But he supposedly recovers without any experienced medical attention. It is true that alternate endings are included, in both of which the main character dies or is dead. But these are no consolation. The alternate ending thing is a cop-out. The movie should be the artist's statement, not a choose your own adventure book. They are telling the story, so they should decide what they want the story to be. Since they went with the idiotic happy ending, I can only assume that this is the story they decided was the best, which just puts the final crap touch on a crap movie.<br/><br/>While writing this review I happened to look up ""Dawn of the Dead"" and noticed that there is a remake in the works. So now the best zombie movie will be ruined too. But I'm sure everyone's expectations will be so low that they won't even notice it."
"flickaddict","Null","1","2","14 November 2003"," anyone read 'Day of the Triffids' ?
","Maybe some other viewers/filmcritics have noticed this too (I haven't read all the comments), but I think this film is just a shameless ripoff of the great novel ""THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS"" by John Wyndham. This story (first published in 1951!) is about a guy who wakes up in a deserted hospital only to discover that almost al people have become blind after watching a mysterious shower of meteorites. Meanwhile the ""triffids"" (a newly discovered breed of stinging flesh-eating plants who are bred for their oil), break free and roam (yes, they can WALK) the deserted streets and countryside. Because the plants (obviously) are accustomed to being blind, they have the advantage now and are killing the helpless blind people by the thousands. <br/><br/>The guy and some other people who (for various reasons) have kept their sight flee the city and eventually take refuge in an isolated farmhouse which they defend like a military base. As years go by the issue raises whether the surviving women have the obligation to prevent the human race from dying out (and consequently have to be forced to have children). ....notice some similarities, anyone ?? Just replace ""killer flesh-eating plants"" with ""crazy screaming zombies"" and you get, surprise...: 28 Days Later! <br/><br/>I found the beginning of the movie rather startling, but mainly because it made me think about the hazards of freeing animals from labs(like many fanatic animal liberation groups are doing today). The rest was just a boring repetition of ""o no, there they come again!""."
"zombiezen","Null","1","2","14 November 2003"," 28 days later i want my money back.
","This was a fun movie with a nice premise that held good through half of the movie. I enjoyed the begining scenes with the monkey and where all that lead and enjoyed the next hour but if you have seen it you know where it lost me. I think it could have worked better without any of the endings they came up with on the disc but a much more dark and visceral one. SPOILER I found the ending way to happy and light and i did not buy it for a sec. Not any of the four endings i watched on the disc. I found them all cloying and to happy. I think instead of ending up at the army base they should have just wandered and ended up turning on each other and then some more of them dying in a city to get food. Then at the end i think the black girl should have had to kill the lead man and the girl. I think it would have really worked had she known they were not infected and just in insane rage and despair butchered them on the spot. Thats how a zombie movie ends not with flags and happy faces. The ending of this movie made me feel like i was getting a hummer and right before i finished the person giving the hummer left. Resident evil is the only recent zombie flick in my opnion that got it half right and its ending rocks, it makes the movie in fact. Zombie movies while you can mess with all the elements of them and about them making them happy does not work unless its a comedy and in that case watch ""my bf back"" instead of this. Im comming down harder on this than i meant to but the more i think of the ending the more i go ick. I love this director though and hes done some great stuff but i expected more. I heard its so dark and negative and i felt like i was watching the wizard of oz. Fun and Entertaining but not scary and not a zombie flick."

","I have to be honest, i expected this movie to be crap.  As i see it, most horror movies are.  i must say, however, i thought 28 DAYS LATER was actually a pretty interesting film.  It had a message worth thinking about, and there is enough symbolism in it for JD Salinger to of wrote it.  But i don't understand why they pitched it so heavily as a horror movie.  I kept hearing that same quote ""Scary as Hell.""  but watching it, i didn't find it scary at all.  It was gory and violent at times, but i'd hardly describe it as scary.  Suspense was also a key factor missing from this movie if it was a horror film.  Everytime something bad is going to happen you can see it coming, there is always a warning.  More obviously though, you can see when something isn't coming, the music and mood is way to nice for anything bad to happen.  Which reminds me, there are certain scenes in this movies that you will swear were taken straight from a car commercial.  Note, at the end of the movie, be sure to notice a certain inserted shot, it may get you thinking.  Overall i'd say this movie is worth seeing, and entertaining, but you have to be able to want to think about it, and don't expect a horror flick.  *** of **** stars."

","I love zombies. Much more so than vamps or werewolves or possessed children vomiting pee soup. There's something so simple - and yet so methodically terrifying - about zombies and their single-minded feeding goals.<br/><br/>Like ""Sixth Sense"" was to ghost movies and ""The Ring"" was to splatter films, I think this movie is morphing zombie flicks, and in a very good way.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple affair (how complicated can a zombie move get?). The opening gives me more reasons to hate ""greenies"" and their naive ways. The protagonist shuffling through the streets of London in hospital digs and a bag of coke cans is just... eerie. Very well done. And the movie does a good job of showing the brutality of the ""undead"" - and later showing equal ""brutality"" with the ""living"" - primarily the rape and a rather gruesome ""live on live"" death where the protagnoist kills the rapist with thumbs in the eye sockets. The man's death scream is very authentic, and will send chills and bumps up and down your spine and flesh. <br/><br/>Worth the price of admission or a rental, and the fact that its set in London adds to the movie's wonderful feel.<br/><br/>8.5 of 10."

","ok, it didn't really put me to sleep and it is a pretty decent movie, it does entertain although it was not as scary as everyone told me and was not even close to as good as 'Trainspotting', which is why i went out and bought it in the first place.  as i was watching it i kept thinking to myself that this movie has the exact same plot as 'night of the comet' and I'm surprised they got away with it... 99% of the population dead and everyone left is either infected and psychotic or completely normal.  the two main characters in this one are Jim and Naomi (personally i'd rather watch the two cute valley girls from 'night of the comet') both films have very similar scenes too: raiding the supermarket instead of the mall, following directions from a radio station, running into a bunch of group of government people who offer to help but are really psychotic. Alex Garland's characters were dull and not developed at all.  At least in 'The Beach', you cared about some of the characters, but in this one the only one you even cared about at all was Frank who Brendan Gleeson did an excellent job portraying.  Cillian Murphy did a wonderful job as Jim (especially the ending) and Christopher Eccleston stole every scene he was in as the Major.  She was not given much to work with as her character seemed to go nowhere, but I don't think that Naomie Harris could act her way out of a box.  Megan Burns did a decent job portraying the worst character, Frank's daughter Hannah, and I look forward to seeing more of her work.  the more and more I see Danny Boyle's pictures, especially  'the beach', the more I think that Trainspotting was a fluke. the dvd features are very good, although the deleted scenes could have been left on the editing room floor, the alternate endings weren't as good as they were hyped up to be and it seems like the filmakers couldn't make up their minds but i did like that even though they didn't shoot one of them, they show the storyboards with audible narration and dialogue.  They really need to make a Trainspotting dvd with the same treatment.  overall i give '28 days later...' 2 stars out of 5"

","Spoilers included<br/><br/>I just watched 28 Days Later last night and must say it could have been better. I have lots of complaints about the plot and story. I believe that there are many questions about the story that just don't make sense. For instance, how can someone be injected with rage?  And if were really possible how are you going to infect someone else?  Rage is an emotion. Now, I will admit that there were scary and intense parts, but the story could have been touched up better. Some of the characters at the end of the film were also not written well. I am refering to the soldiers.  If they were true soldiers they would be more concered with the well being of other humans that have not been infected.  Not raping the only women they have seen in almost a month.  Now yes, I'm sure they were ""in the mood"" but give me a break.  The movie was shot entirely with DV which makes it a better looking film than most Hollywood films. Some of the colors displayed look beautiful. As far as supplemental material goes, this movie has lots of extras including all three endings, which sadly resemble each other. They like the story could have been elaborated on better."

","Now, before you fellow horror nuts lynch me, remember that I am a huge fan of the Romero Trilogy of zombie movies.  28 Days Later does have better zombies, but lacks the tension that Romero displayed in his flicks.  When you only see a handful of zombies in a country that has supposed to be taken over by these creatures, it is a little hard to swallow.  My suggestion, rent Dog Soldiers, it is the same movie, and is much more gory.  Hey pal, stick to Transpotting, you seem to be better at diving into the minds of sick kids, instead of just the sick."
"Unicorn-9","3","1","2","19 October 2003"," A Life Less Zombie-Filled
","I liked the first twenty minutes or so of this movie: in particular, the various scenes of an empty London were well done, though I must admit that even by that point I'd drifted away from the story enough to spend most of those scenes wondering how they'd shot them.<br/><br/>After that, though, it all went downhill.<br/><br/>The main problem I had, other than the confused script that couldn't really decide whether it was a zombie movie or a weak road movie that just happened to include zombies (even though there seemed to be obvious 'homages' to many of the most famous movies of the zombie genre) was that the characters were dumb and caused many of their own problems, leaving me with little sympathy for them. Oh, and the teenage girl wasn't exactly the strongest of actors either.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: First, when faced with zombies carrying a disease that's contagious from contact with a small amount of blood, what do our heroes do? Well, the character who's determined to survive at all costs chops them up with a machete, just to make sure that the blood goes everywhere. Then when they have the choice between taking a tunnel under the Thames or crossing on a bridge, they take the tunnel and, surprise, surprise, nasty things are waiting down there. Then one of them catches the disease by being stupid. Then later when one of them is being chased by a group of soldiers, the soldiers totally forget even the most basic military discipline and let him pick them off one by one. <br/><br/>The only other decent parts of the movie were the rats and the scene where the soldiers were fighting off a zombie attack in the night. More of that, less stupid people doing stupid things, and a decent ending, and it would have been worth watching.<br/><br/>NO MORE SPOILERS: So, while this might have made an OK TV movie in the British post-apocalyptic tradition, I really don't think it was up for theatrical release... and, while they did a decent job of the cinematography considering the cost of the camera they shot it on, I'm certainly glad I didn't have to watch the low-res digital video images in a cinema. Increasingly I'm coming to feel that 'Trainspotting' was a one-off success for Boyle and he's never going to make a good movie again."

","Happened to buy this on a bright red DVD during a visit to the UK in May 2003! I found it to be a combination of ""The World, The Flesh and the Devil"" and ""No Blade Of Grass"" though I found ""No BLade of Grass"" a better and more realistic film to watch.<br/><br/>Of course we are now in 2003, and presumably the public want more bad language, blood and violence than before. So if you like the aforementioned, you will be pleased as the film delivers just that. I personally am not, which is why I preferred ""No Blade of Grass"" as I am more interested in seeing how people react in the face of a national catastrophe. That film did contain some violent scenes and bad language but no more than you would expect in that sort of a situation ( when it's every man for himself  and you have to kill to survive ). In 28 days later the violence is overblown. There is violence for violence's sake and I do not think it corresponds to what would be the reality in the face of such a virus. There are some interesting shots of a deserted London but the colouring looks artificial, as if it were digitally reproduced. I may be wrong, but if it is the case, the cameraman is cheating. There is no need for this. Nature itself produces some incredible lighting effects withough having to re-create thjese digitally. At one moment we see rain falling in a weird way. This looks digitally artificial too.<br/><br/>I like the sort of film where man has to use his resourcefulness in an unforeseen and catastrophic situation, but as I had seen it all before in ""No Blade of Grass"", which did leave some marks on me, I found that ""28 days later"" was just a sombre and more violent update of that. I would give it more marks for the soundtrack as that of ""NO Blade of Grass was tinny, pathetic and too seventies-ish, bar, of course the beautiful title track sung by Roger Whittaker which I have on CD. I cannot recommend nor condemn this film, but the level of bad language and gratuitous violence contained therein is A SAD REFLECTION ON THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR SOCIETY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY if such violence is now necessary to attract audiences to the cinema.<br/><br/>It's difficult for me to be more complimentary about this film.

Alex Palmer walking along the cityfs streets, around the parliament, Piccadilly Circus under the sound of this techno was pretty cool. The zombies were also well crafted. In spite of the obvious holes in the story, the first two acts were interesting and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the last (third) half of the film was terrible.

An group of activists bust in and attempt to free the monkeys, only to be told by an unfortunate scientist that the monkeys are infected with rage. At that moment, a female activist is attacked by a freed chimp, and begins throwing up blood. What was the nature of the infection? How was it administered? How did it spread?<br/><br/>
We are left to assume the progression of events, as the initial scene cuts to a naked man lying in a hospital bed in deserted London. Who is he? Why is he not infected? What part does he play? Only later do we find out he was just a patient in the hospital. This happens throughout the movie: no supporting information to help guide the story along.<br/><br/>Maybe that is the effect the director was going for. However in the first ending, we see a British jet fly overhead, and can't help but wonder, ""where did they come from?"" as everyone had been touted as dead throughout the film.

However, this film showed in the most realistic manner how the human race can destroy itself, and the results of our own ignorance. The ""rage virus"" goes to the theory about how formal communication separates us from the animals, and when certain characters are contaminated, they no longer have that and basically go by primal needs and emotions destroying everything and everyone, pulling the human race back down all the way below animal races. This is expressed best not through a sequence with the ""infected"", but ironically enough by a group of horses which now run free after the incidents, with an entire family of horses running alongside others across a grassy field. It is also shown just how easy it is for a loved one to be taken away from us by such a virus causes some emotional disturbances and a lot of ""what if?"" questions. It also shows how when we're put in a crisis of such high magnitude how even non-""infected"" can revert to primal instincts and once again, we destroy ourselves. This is one of the few horror flicks since those of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""The Omega Man"" to have these social commentaries, and in the world we live in now with terrorist attacks, newer viruses, foreign wars, it makes you start to wonder... how much longer will something like this only be a movie?

And how could the IV bags still have juice in them?"
"trevorhart","Null","1","2","21 July 2003"," a masterpiece of british cinema
","well what can I say?? this film has been met with many mixed reviews, and here's my two pennies worth.<br/><br/>I'll take it for granted that you know the plot, so here's my justification on why this is such a great movie:<br/><br/>this film has the most intense underlying political commentary since Dawn of the Dead, the whole country eats itself up from the inside out, consumed by everything around it. Selfish, unabiding, terrifying. The film dictates something in all of us, rage. This time manifested in the ""infected."" The humans in this film have a harder time dealing with their own personal issues and the abuse of power around them than the actual ""threat"" that the movie concentrates on. Romero-esque cynicism is totally in place here, which boils us down to believing that we really wouldn't be able to deal with an outbreak of this kind. 28 days later takes the very notion of our pent up aggression, the way we are constantly faced with fear in our every day lives, and uses it totally against us. Terrifying. The film isolates us from all the things we take for granted, TV, Radio, electricity, water, etc, and boils down society to animal instinct, battling for survival at all costs.<br/><br/>The cinematography is first class, filmed entirely on DVCAM, with the ""infected"" being shown only in 16,000 fps (this gives the shakey ""not-quite-sure-what-just-happened"" feeling to things, which if you think carefully about it, is exactly the way violent/intense situations play out in the human memory). The long, drawn out shots of Jim walking through central london add tension to every second that you watch it (also notice that when Jim falls foul to the very rage he is trying to avoid, and the camera work adjusts accordingly.).<br/><br/>The characters are strong, unfortunately though Hannah was painfully miscast. Although a pretty and cool looking young lady, her acting skills leave a lot to be desired, and she really lets some of the film down. Selena is the embodiment of the ""ripley-esque"" female lead that we all know and love, while Jim is warm, funny and manic at the same time. Hannah's father (Gleeson) is amazing as the cuddly, friendly father who will protect his daughter at all costs.<br/><br/>I'd hate to sit here and write something like ""the only people who didn't like this film are the ones who didn't get it"" because that would be pushing this film into a catagory that it doesn't deserve. it is totally accessible to all, if you want violence, gore and terror then 28 days later doesn't fail on that. But unfortunately this film seems to be criticised because many people want answers to what they consider to be plot holes. To them I say: fill in the gaps yourself. The main reason I love this movie is because it stimulated my mind in a way that i haven't experienced since watching the Romero trilogy for the first time. This film is there to make you consider what YOU would do should such an infection start out, its there to let you fill in the blanks on what really happened in the 28 days leading up to Jim waking from the coma. its there to make you ask questions about the infected and to justify their actions in your OWN way. Don't leave it all up to Boyle or Garland, where's the fun in that? If you want answers watch a brain dead hollywood cannon fodder movie, because they have a nasty habit of making their audiences feel dumb.<br/><br/>28 days later is a movie that respects intellectualism, it wants you to question things and to question yourself because that is whats going to make you come back to it time and time again.<br/><br/>part of me truly believes that if an epidemic similar to this film DID break out, 28 days later wouldn't be too far from the truth."
"seemantics","3","1","2","19 July 2003"," what the @#&$?
","I will try not to give too much away about the movie, but there aren't many twists in the plot anyway.<br/><br/>
I had high expectations going into this movie, primarily because IMDB indicated a very high rating.<br/><br/>However, I found the film to be poorly made.<br/><br/>I thought the characters were inconsistent, or evolving too fast for me to comprehend--Selena was initially a cold, impersonal soldier who hacked her close friend, Mark, then out of no where she delivers an untimely peck on Jim's cheek, then she breaks down and cries when the little girl's father is killed.<br/><br/>I thought the movie could have been more interesting as a mystery (of course I'm no director) but Boyle gave us the entire story from the beginning. I think if they just postponed the initial laboratory/monkey rescue scene till later, the film would have had an awesome beginning with Jim wondering around trying to figure what's going on as the audience is also trying to grasp the storyline. But instead, we are forced to sit waiting, not for the storyline, but simply the blood and gore to come.<br/><br/>I thought the movie raised a lot of interesting issues. You can read about many of them in the other user comments. But I feel that's all it did. It raised them. Then it left them alone. For example, there's something to consider in how we define the new family institution; how we rebuild the human race with nine men; does it become a moral duty for women to bare the next generation of the species? I felt Boyle lead me to discover these issues, but bullets and zombies quickly killed off the artifacts of this discovery. His answer was a removal of the question in the first place.<br/><br/>Lastly, I didn't find it very scary at all, though this is entirely a matter of opinion. It certainly shouldn't be hailed as the scariest film since the Exorcist.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the title accurately reflects the movie. ""28 Days Later"". Why not ""27 Days Later""? or ""29 Days Later""? They show this phrase twice. But what's the significance...? It seemed totally arbitrary, much like the actions of the characters and scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>
Lingering questions:<br/><br/>1) Why was it safe to travel in the day? Did Boyle ever tell us why zombies cannot expose themselves to the day? Or was it just simply scarier? I still think he owes us an explanation for this. In the end, we do see the military aircraft fly over two zombies in broad daylight. They seemed to be in great pain, they seemed to have lost their Rage. Was this due to the sunlight? Or is this an indication of the starving zombies?<br/><br/>2) Does it make sense that our three survivals are hailing a military aircraft? Aren't they afraid of a repeat scenario? What makes them think this new military unit won't use the women as concubines? Or are we to believe that Jim will be able to pull off yet another impossible rescue mission?"

If you're going to see it as a horror movie... don't, the only part that even startled me was a car alarm going off near the beginning. The first half is slow and very little happens plot-wise, and the second half moved way to fast for me to follow what was going on (maybe because the first half nearly put me to sleep).

","Danny Boyle hasn't done much since the incredible success of Trainspotting. Consider this a major make-up of lost time. I was skeptical about the use of the digital camera, but in the end, it proved to be a wonderful device for this particularly gritty and slightly off kilter zombie film. While the whole zombie genre has fallen on hard times, 28 Days Later presents the subgenre in a way that seems more modern and timely as opposed to some random curse or some explanation that doesn't make any real sense. And the emotions displayed in the movie are so realistic and carnal, one can't deny the idea of these type of actions taking place. What I especially liked about this film was the care and devotion the film makers went through to make this film look authentic and real. With the exception of one shot, the empty streets of London look as barren and hopeless as the continuation of mankind. Cillian Murphy was positively wicked in his role as Jim, and the rest of the cast was absolutely stellar in their simple (yet complex) character arcs. For those that love the horror genre, this is certainly one for the ages, one that will hopefully allow the horror genre to right itself."

But I think that this one is much more scary. Remember, these are not zombies (as to what other people say), there just (just! yeah right) infected humans beings that have speed and a rage to do only one thing : kill, not eat, kill.

If you are expecting Day of the Dead, look elsewhere. 28 Days Later is a people movie, following the lives of 4 survivors of a rampaging epidemic which has all but wiped out the UK population. The character study throughout the movie is what drives it with the zombies/Infected taking a warranted back seat. My wife normally walks out of zombie flicks however she sat through 28 days later and at the end was pleasantly surprised by it's character driven plot.<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic return to form for Danny Boyle and I couldn't recommend this film highly enough. To sum up, this is not a horror or a zombie flick, it's a Character driven thriller that so happens to feature some zombies and and excellent one at that."

Also in the beginning, they 'walk' around London surely it would be far far safer to travel by car.

","""Night of the Living Dead""-styled hybrid about a deadly, incurable virus that spreads like wildfire through the United Kingdom over a month's time and turns its victims into dangerous monsters. By the end of that month the central character (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma and finds that most all of London has been deserted. He finds very few survivors (Naomie Harris, Megan Burns and Brendan Gleeson, the latter's father) and together they embark on a seemingly impossible trek to survive. As time passes they actually find a few more survivors (military soldiers led by the mysterious Christopher Eccleston), but that development does not necessarily ensure the small group's safety. ""28 Days Later..."" starts off very well, but then spins out of control when Murphy actually begins to discover that he is not the only one left alive in his homeland. Gleeson is the only interesting character, but he is not around enough to lift a film that is already starting to go down the drain by the time he appears. The movie just feels very strange to put it mildly. Its editing, cinematography and even its music (its score is copied from recent masterpieces ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Traffic"") mix and mesh to complete a potentially interesting, but ultimately mediocre film-making effort. 2 stars out of 5."

","While this film didn't exactly reinvent the zombie horror genre, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland nonetheless still manage to bring a feeling of jarring intimacy and immediacy to the standard premise by wisely focusing on a small handful of survivors who try to stay alive and retain residual traces of their humanity in an extremely dire and desperate situation. Indeed, Boyle and Garland handle the premise with admirable take-no-prisoners grim seriousness by showing in stark and chilling terms how easily people can degenerate into a horrible barbaric state in the wake of civilization collapsing. In an inspired cynical touch, a group of soldiers turn out to be anything but heroic and helpful as they prove to be more concerned with their own self-preservation over helping others out. <br/><br/>Cillian Murphy makes for an engaging average guy protagonist as the fundamentally decent Jim, Noamie Harris provides plenty of spark as the sassy and ruthlessly determined Selena, Brandon Gleeson does typically fine work as affable cab driver Frank, and Christopher Eccleston likewise excels as the steely Major Henry West. A tense sequence in a tunnel rates as a definite harrowing highlight while the shots of a dead quiet and empty London are quite eerie and striking. Anthony Dod Mantle's rough digital cinematography gives this picture a gritty sense of documentary-style realism. But it's the way this film manages to keep things on a basic human level which in turn makes the horror presented herein so potent and unsettling."

Murphy is the lead in Peaky Blinders on Netflix and Gleeson is the lead on the more recent Stephen King adaptation, Mr. Mercedes, on the Audience Network.

The worst thing about this film is that it somewhat ruins the rest of the genre for the viewer. You are left wondering about glaring plot holes in the ""undead"" variant of zombie flick such as: how difficult could it really be to escape zombies doing 2 feet a minute or less? How does the infection spread if the undead simply eat their victims whole? If the brain is the only part of the body responsible for animation (as in Walking Dead, for example), how do the undead move about without functioning circulatory systems, etc.? 28 Days Later doesn't have any of these physiological plot holes nor does it suffer from a situation where the lead actors are more deadpan than the zombies."

As soon as she is introduced, you can't wait for her to be killed off (except, you know that it's not likely to happen).<br/><br/>Secondly, I hated the whole crazy British Army soldiers situation. Wanting to gang rape an underage girl (or ANY girl, for that matter)... this was really uncalled for, and, for me, spoiled the whole movie.

","The first time I saw 28 Days Later was at a special on-campus screening when I was still in college. I remember watching one or two teaser trailers before leaving my cramped dorm room and thinking, ""Oh—another zombie movie."" It turns out my hasty assessment of Danny Boyle's gritty tale of horror and sociopolitical intrigue was grossly inaccurate, as this is so much more than just ""another zombie movie"" (and really, if you want to get technical, I wouldn't classify it as a zombie movie, because the overly-aggressive beings are, after all, not dead).<br/><br/>The film opens with a group of animal rights activists breaking into a British research facility designed to study primates. Viewers are only given hazy clues as to why the sole lab technician in the building adamantly cautions the activists that they're making a huge mistake by releasing the animals (because ""they've been given an inhibitor"" that's somehow designed to presumably eradicate violent behavior in humans), but they fail to heed his warnings. When one of the freed chimps lunges at and bites an activist, she instantly becomes ill. Within seconds her eyes have turned red, and she's hissing, snarling, and vomiting blood. She's just been infected with the RAGE virus.<br/><br/>Cut to—you guessed it—28 days later and our protagonist, Jim, is just waking up from a stay in the hospital. He was sideswiped by a car while delivering a package somewhere in London, and has been knocked out ever since. As he confusedly wanders out of the abandoned hospital, he discovers that there is nobody around—anywhere. One of the largest cities on earth is literally a ghost town. I don't want to ruin some of the great scares that are associated with the opening sequence(s), but rest assured that this movie is smart, well-acted (and directed), and utterly horrifying.<br/><br/>28 Days Later had an almost immediate impact on me. Call it a heightened sense of paranoia in the wake of 9/11, but the idea of a biological attack incapacitating and ultimately killing millions of people is, at least in my mind, not all that far-fetched. Though it's certainly exaggerated here for the purposes of generating effective horror, this movie feels real. The attention paid to details it what gives it weight (as is the case with so many movies), and when we see Jim running in terror from a pack of aggressive ""infected"" who want nothing more than to spray blood on him and thus spread the virus, it's a chilling spectacle.<br/><br/>And that, perhaps, is what makes 28 Days Later so effective. It all comes down to the very notion that should something like this happen, there would be absolutely no escape. There's no bargaining with those who are infected—they can no longer think for themselves; they're actions are involuntary, and are the direct result of being stimulated by bright lights or (and this is pure speculation because a clear explanation for their behavior is never given) the scent of those who are still uninfected.<br/><br/>This taken on it's own would be enough to sustain an incredibly scary piece of horror cinema, but Danny Boyle decides to throw viewers a curve ball in the final act of the film. Like so many other horror classics, the term ""monster"" becomes loosely defined as people consistently demonstrate the seemingly innate ability to fend for themselves, no matter what. And, of course, the only way to beat fire is with fire. All of this sounds ambiguous I'm sure, but it'll make sense once you watch the movie, and it gives the conclusion of the film a certain subtext that might not have otherwise been present.<br/><br/>The very name of the virus (RAGE) says something about Danny Boyle's intentions with making this film, and it clearly reveals something about Man; something that, as several of the characters assert, has been proved to be true time and again. 28 Days Later is scary enough as a no-escape exercise in aggressive ""zombie"" horror, but it's elevated to modern classic status by its unsettling observations concerning the true nature of humanity."

","One of the most slow-moving movies I have ever watched. I tried watching this movie with a friend, hoping that some of the stellar user reviews and the general score it has on IMDb are correct. I was completely let-down. I don't know what about this movie is supposed to be so good. Is it the emptiness? The sense of nihilism? What? I am not a big fan of slow-moving cinema but I do appreciate when it's done well, to the advantage of thorough character development. I speak of films like 'Gattaca' or the Coen brothers' 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. These films are not heavy on the special effects - there aren't many explosions and such but I've never watched and yawned. This, on the other hand, had my head drooping within the first 45-minutes.<br/><br/>I feel like it would have been better done as a book.<br/><br/>A mediocre production with badly rendered cinematography. You would be better served watching something else if you don't want to fall asleep. I do not recommend this."

","Now when their is a good movie people say it is good and more people see it. I hope by the end of time(2012,JK), everybody has seen this movie. This is by far the best zombie movie in the world and maybe of all time, besides George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. This movie is a British movie that is very scary and is very real. I thought that this could actually happen. The acting is phenomenal and the music is the best music I've heard in a movie. Like the start when Jim(Cillian Murphy),who did his best acting in his career in my opinion,wakes up in the hospital and walks in the streets of London alone.The music starts slow and then goes fast and at the end when Jim is fighting the soldiers. The zombies are scary and fast and I love how you have around 10 seconds until you turn into a zombie. This a very good scary zombie that any zombie horror fan would love."

","28 Days later is my second favourite film ever made. It's superb in the way that the whole of Britain has been wiped out by a virus which turns people into fast zombies. <br/><br/>Jim (Cillian Murphey) wakes up hospital from a coma to find London completely empty...except for the infected. He eventually finds 2 survivors, Selena (Naomi Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Selena and Mark explain to Jim about what's happened in the last 28 days. The 3 of them journey to Jim's house to discover his parents dead. In my favourite scene from the film, Mark gives a chilling story about what happened to his parents. That scene is well acted by Noah Huntley and it makes it even more shocking when Mark is hacked to death by Selena moments later. We grow attached to all the characters in the film and i thought that Mark would play an even more important part. Jim and Selena then come across a man called Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The 4 of them hear a radio transmission from soldiers in Manchester and that makes them journey there in a cab. The 2nd part of the film is really Jim, Frank, Selena and Hannah trying to make there way to Manchester. But sadly Frank gets infected and dies when they finally meet up with the soldiers. The last part of the film i don't really like because it goes down a darker road than the rest of the film. The lead soldier, Major West (Christopher Eccleston) has promised the rest of his soldiers Women and Selena and Hannah are on the verge of being raped. Jim, Selena and Hannah not only have to fight of the infected but also the soldiers. <br/><br/>Overall 28 Days Later is an excellent film and it never gets boring. The sequel was OK but not as good as the original."
"screenman","5","1","3","24 February 2009"," Highly Overrated.
","It began with a very interesting premise of a young man waking-up all by himself in a chaotic hospital. I dunno how long he'd been out, or how he alone got overlooked, and why he hadn't died of dehydration, the disease, or whatever, but it left a number of big question-marks to juggle with. This intro was pioneered by John Wyndam in his 'Day Of The Triffids', so it was nothing new.<br/><br/>The scenes of a deserted capital were extremely dramatic and well done - better even than the 'Triffids' movie. But this dimwit aimlessly wandering about in his hospital pyjamas with a vacant stare, left me wondering who were the real zombies. Getting your kit on before going outdoors would surely have been foremost in his mind. Then again; he was a cycle courier so perhaps we shouldn't expect too much. Even so; his total lack of interaction quickly became a bore. And it was highly unlikely that he could have walked right across central London in his condition. He'd have been pooped within a few hundred yards.<br/><br/>And I'm afraid it quickly went downhill after that. Movies about extremely ordinary people may be realistic but they can also be very, very dull. This item slouched about on the edge of a soap-opera canyon.<br/><br/>From time to time things livened-up when the 'zombie-flesh-eater' type things kept pouncing, but really - how many living dead movies do we actually need? It's old hat, for Gawd's sake.<br/><br/>And that was about it. The story dwindled away as each unprepossessing goody died-off. Even after I thought it had ended; the movie, like the dead, coughed back into life again. When, in truth, the last rites had been said within 30 minutes of the intro.<br/><br/>Britain just doesn't do this kind of stuff very well any more. Even with the considerable budget that this work must have enjoyed, you can find far superior efforts funded by comparatively tiny budgets from years gone by. Just think of the 'Quatermass' movies of the 1950's or how about 'Village Of The Damned'? This came over too much like 'Flood': a well packaged empty container.<br/><br/>The first half-hour is well worth a look, but don't get too comfortable."

","28 Days Later successfully takes the zombie genre to a new level, this movie is far more than just a horror flick. There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.<br/><br/>The story is well written and avoids the clichéd cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And i must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.<br/><br/>For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.<br/><br/>I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - i am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.<br/><br/>If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention."

A man who wakes up from his coma 28 days after a terrible virus was accidentally unleashed on Great Britain. The virus is very contagious and just the slightest bit of infected blood can infect you and within 10 seconds after the blood is in your body, you lose control. The virus enhances rage and all the infected are in a permanent state of rage running at incredible speeds after anyone they see.<br/><br/>Jim wakes up to find the streets of Britain deserted and it wasn't till he was chased down the streets by infected that he realized what had happened. Jim then meets Selena (Naomie Harris), a survivor who helps Jim to safety. Then, Jim and Selena come across Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns). Frank says that he has been listening to his little radio constantly since the outbreak and reports of the virus having spread to Paris and NY. Frank also says he has heard broadcasted ads that the military are taking in all non-infected people and that meeting them at a certain point will ensure their safety.<br/><br/>The rest of the film chronicles the group's travels to the military base and what happens there after. The film's main moral comes into perspective towards the end of the film where safety isn't always what you think and how in desperate situations like this, humans will do anything to satisfy themselves.<br/><br/>Not very scary, but very horrific makes ""28 Days Later..."" one of the best horrifying films to date.

As Chance has it, a man survives and stands witness to the end of society.<br/><br/>But to my surprise and distress, this man just happens to be one of the most stupid persons who walk the earth (and ""happens to be"" is a poor excuse to base an entire film on). He wakes up in an obviously devastated hospital, and doesn't get it. Walks around for hours in an obviously devastated town, and still doesn't get it. Picks up a news-paper, takes a brief look, and throws it away (shouldn't he like to learn what had happened?!). Then, he goes to a church where he meets a monster-like priest, eyes popped out, blood all over his face, sounding like a enraged wild beast and he asks, gently ""father, are you alright?"".<br/><br/>And no-where do we learn that he'd sustained some brain damage and that's why he's acting so bizarre, to say the least. Did I mention that he was screaming all over the obviously deserted, empty town-square 'hello, anybody'? That must be learned helplessness from some other stupid film, cos any real person would've looked for other people in a more practical, reasonable way.<br/><br/>So, the poor man who spent hours walking around the town finally meets some other healthy people and suddenly he remembers he has a family! And suddenly becomes very, very emotional and concerned for them, throwing a temper-tantrum at the mere thought of not being aloud to go home.<br/><br/>The rage metaphor is great, and the real-life footage in the beginning is very moving - but this is a badly written story, and poor characters.<br/><br/>I won't even mention the fact that they blame the demise of the human race on the save-the-poor-animals activists (way-to-go, guys! they're not that smart, either, are they?!?).<br/><br/>If you have a brain and can't give it a brake for 110 minutes, don't.

","Wow, this sure was a very very bloody film, which starts out very calm and quiet, with a guy in a hospital bed and then he finds himself wandering all over London, England. This poor guy winds up meeting another human being, a female who gives him guidance and romance. However, I forgot to mention that there also was a scene in the beginning which dealt with monkeys in a laboratory who seemed to have very bad tempers. All I can say about this picture without making it a SPOILER for everyone is this: It is the most horrifying, blood thirsty film I have seen in a very long time; there are even French Kissing with blood all over the lips and face. This is just a warning!"
"basula07","8","1","3","23 January 2006"," Powerful, horrific, emphatic....all at the same time
","This is a film that is macabre yet aching, violent yet emphatic. Take a would-be mediocre apocalyptic zombie flick, add some philosophy into it coupled with a haunting setting and atmosphere, and you have a great zombie flick that reminisces the 1940s' Dawn of the Dead.<br/><br/>A team of human rights activists breaks into a lab and attempts to free a bunch of infected monkeys. The scientists warn that the monkeys are infected with 'Rage', a newly discovered virus which spreads by blood. Those who are infected with 'Rage' will develop a thirst to kill in 10 seconds, and once they have, they cannot be stopped without having to be killed. Unfortunately, the scientists' warnings fall on deaf ears and the monkeys are freed...and to put it to words, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>28 days later, a guy named Jim (Murphy) wakes up in a hospital to find that the whole of London is desolate. He learns that the 'Rage' virus had spread throughout London and caused everyone to kill each other. So everyone is either dead or evacuated. He manages to catch up with some survivors and joins them in their fight to survive. Much to his dismay, he learns that now he cannot afford to trust anyone and in order to survive, friends, family and even allies have to be killed. The intensity of the situation and the will to survive has brought the worst out in everyone, and those who should really be their true allies might turn to be their real enemies (you will learn about this at the end of the movie).<br/><br/>The factor that stands 28 Days Later out from most zombie flicks is the incorporation of a more visceral twist to the story; this movie asks questions that challenge the darker sides of human nature -- in a desperate situation such as this, will you let your emotions kick in? Have the survivors themselves become killing machines in their own right? Have we become like the 'infected' themselves -- slaying families, friends and allies with no mercy, all just in an attempt to make it out of a seemingly hopeless situation? The only law that applies to such a situation would be 'survival of the fittest', that is, the strong will survive and the weak will not. But is surviving really worth it, after shedding so much blood from those you used to know, love, care about? Are we, after all, the real killers? <br/><br/>For the second part of this movie (which a lot of people deem as unnecessary and incredulous) I have to agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers who say that it is an important part of the story. Could the people who are supposed to be our true allies (the British soldiers) be after all, our true enemies? The answer might be a little bit psychological; it seems that they have been so emotionally shaken and traumatised by such a catastrophe that they become no longer humane. And in the end, is it better to live in such inhumane and horrific conditions, perhaps for the rest of their lives, or to die? <br/><br/>Powerful, horrific, emphatic, compelling...all at the same time, 28 Days Later is a horror film like no other. A true masterpiece."

","This was a pretty decent recent horror movie. However, if British accents annoy you at all, just watch ""Dawn of the Dead"". It's probably a little better of a movie, and the actors have better teeth (just kidding)! No but really, this is a pretty decent movie. However, if you haven't seen this or ""Dawn of the Dead,"" rent the latter. You can actually understand the words of the movie (other than the zombie ramblings, which sound about the same with or without a British accent). The bottom line of this movie is that if you are an environmentalist, do not let experimental monkeys out of their cages!! They are not friendly like on ""Smokey and the Bandit!!"" Trust me, MT."

"Strayer","10","1","3","25 June 2005"," Different from other zombie flicks
","28 Days Later is, in a way, like your usual horror flick. Disease, in this case Rage, gets out and wipes out many many people. We see the main character, Jim, wake up in a hospital and wander around the now abandoned London as he searches for any sign of civilisation. He then meets the infected, people who have Rage, who chase him and try to kill him. Rage will make you a merciless blood-hungry beast. Jim soon meets Selena and Mark, two survivors who hide in a deserted shop. Jim begins to panic and after hearing that there is no government, he says a line which really makes you think: <br/><br/>""What do you mean there's no government? There's always a government, they're in a bunker or a plane somewhere!""<br/><br/>However we know he's wrong. This movie shows, in my opinion, that everyone is truly equal. The government and military aren't stronger than the average person. Unlike other movies the government doesn't escape from the virus in this one. Almost no one can.<br/><br/>When the survivors meet Frank and his daughter Hannah. They then come up with a plan: to follow the directions a Major Henry West has given over the radio. As they arrive, they soon discover the daunting secret the nine soldiers keep.<br/><br/>After seeing 28 Days Later, I began to think of most of the other zombie flicks I had seen before. Many rely on gory and sickening scenes with rotting flesh and lots of blood, as well as lots of screams and surprise moments. 28 Days Later doesn't rely on these facts. Unlike most zombie movies, there are some peaceful moments.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, with the abandoned streets and buildings. The characters also aren't two dimensional people who do the same thing over and over again. These people really seem like they have lost their families, they grow and develop, they express their feelings and they realise what they've got right and what they've got wrong.<br/><br/>The horror scenes are well made with the infected people acting like what a real zombie would be like in my mind. They run, gurgle, scream and swing around their arms. I don't exactly like the traditional disheveled zombie which walks around and moans a lot. So this was a nice change of pace.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes is the shopping scene. It's a beautiful happy part where the characters seem to forget their troubles as they take some the food. The music sets the scene perfectly. We even see them bond during their little spree. This part made me truly smile.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie for people who either a) are just starting to watch zombie flicks or b) just want to watch a great movie."
"mondo_kane","2","1","3","7 June 2005"," The First of a New Generation (and you can keep it)...
","When this film was first released in 2002, it was considered by many to be the first wave of a new generation of smart, original horror movies that broke the conventions of an admittedly tired genre. Considering the mountains of praise heaped upon this film it must have worked for some. At it's release it was touted as the future of ""zombie"" movies (though the film doesn't feature a single zombie) and another triumph for director Danny Boyle (who's only talent seems to be for tapping into the zeitgeist-de-jour of the time and churning out dull movies that end up being adored by the readers of the NME and GQ magazine - just look at TRAINSPOTTING).<br/><br/>28 DAYS LATER tells a pretty damn formulaic tale of a lone man who wakes up in hospital to discover the London he left behind is a deserted ruin of overturned vehicles and blowing litter. Hiding though in the shadows are a bloodthirsty throng of mindless victims of a accidental viral outbreak. Our lone protagonist finds other survivors and together they attempt to find a safe haven from the contagious horde forever at their backs.<br/><br/>So far, so OMEGA MAN. After the predictable deaths along the way, the survivors travel to an apparently safe military compound, only to discover the soldiers there are as desperate as they are and have unpleasant motives of their own, leaving our hero to save his new friends from the dangers within and without.<br/><br/>A horror story is only as good as its monsters. The Infected Masses are single-minded beings, existing only to kill and run about howling. They appear not to eat, ignore injury, and enter a kind of torpor during daylight hours. Since these aren't cannibals or animated corpses like most monsters that fit this cinematic ""zombie"" prototype, the ""ugh"" factor comes from the fact they constantly vomit large quantities of infected blood, obviously inspired by real-life diseases like Ebola.<br/><br/>On the other hand you have the soldiers, who harbour a plan to collect women, reconstructing ""humanity"" and rebuilding their cabin-fever-shattered mindsets via rape, (all of which is approved of by their commander), leaving us with a tired question of who really is the monster - us civilised humans or the primal screaming horde outside (who are at the end of the day are just us anyway - the kill-or-be-killed instinct hiding under the veneer of ""humanity"" in every one of us) but by this point I didn't care.<br/><br/>The story is cliché from moment one, leaving the audience with nothing to cling to but the characters. No bad thing, but the script is dire. Most of the cast do as well as they can with what they have, which includes some serious talent like Eccleston and Murphy, but it's an uphill struggle. The camera-work and editing is frenetic and perfect for MTV viewers, people with ADHD and those who think this is a hallmark of modern cinema and not just irritating. The movie is hip for certain, but clothes do not make the man. Don't even get started on the holes in the plot... most of the time you can forgive such things in horror movies but here they're glaring and obvious.<br/><br/>28 DAYS LATER seems to be so much more to its fans, but to me it is no more than yet another sorry collection of horror clichés presented in a way that seems to be original until you realise you've seen every scene before in some other movie, most likely handled better."

The tone of both films were pretty much the same: I couldn't care less over what might happen to the boring characters.<br/><br/>Seriously, 28 DAYS LATER is extremely derivative and it reminded me a lot of the Roland Emmerich & INDEPENDENCE DAY school of filmmaking: take your ideas for your script from every film or book imaginable. Everyone has made fun of Roland Emmerich or other Hollywood filmmakers for doing this and yet many have applauded Danny Boyle for doing the very same thing because it's a ""low budget"" independent movie. Yeeesh. Well not me. This movie is redundant and because I've seen all of the films mentioned above, I didn't like 28DL simply because I've been there and done that."

","This is a perfect example of just how far movies have deteriorated as we enter (can you believe it?) the second century of filmmaking.<br/><br/>It also reveals how a limited director, such as Danny Boyle, can show some flair when working with a decent script and characters he understands (""Shallow Grave,"" ""Trainspotting""), but stumbles badly when coping with underdeveloped and poorly conceived material such as this dead-on-arrival, no-brainer -- a dreary, glacially paced, uninspired rehash of your standard issue, B-movie, end- of-the-world, man vs. homicidal zombies science-fiction yarn (or should I say yawn?)<br/><br/>The filmmakers were clearly lost.  The story, such as it, concerns a young man (Irish actor Cillian Murphy) who awakens in a London hospital (naked, for unknown reasons) to find the population decimated by a deadly virus.  He teams up with a young black woman (Naomie Harris), and together they find a man  (Brendan Gleeson, the only ray of light in this dreary sky) and his daughter (Megan Burns) living in a London highrise, decorated with blinking Christmas lights (apparently these lights attract only normal humans -- not murderous, infected ones).<br/><br/>While exchanging mundane conversation that reveals nothing interesting or profound, the foursome conveniently hear a radio broadcast which inspires them to travel north to join other survivors.  In typical B movie style, they each follow the Stupid Rule in their own way (arming themselves with knives and bats instead of guns, driving into darkened tunnels, sleeping in the open where they are vulnerable to attack, etc.) and hiss or mumble their lines in terse, often unintelligable, English-accented snarls and grunts.  Things only go downhill from there.  In fact, this somber snorefest proves not only that comedies are becoming Dumb and Dumberer, but thrillers are in serious trouble, too. Scary as hell?  You better believe it.<br/><br/>In the good old days of Hollywood, of course, an experienced director or producer would have ripped this script apart like a backfiring jalopy. He would have broken it down, analyzed it, improved its structure, cleaned it up, replaced its bad parts, and put it back together so it ran like new.  In short, he would have made sure the damn thing was revving like a Ferrari and whistling Dixie out its tailpipe before even THINKING about exposing a frame of celluloid (or in this case, an inch of videotape).  ""What's this story about?"" a director must continually ask himself.  ""What do I want to say to people?""  And -- more importantly -- ""Is it really worth making?""  Hitchcock once turned down a project which others felt was worthy.  When asked why, Hitch responded, ""it's not necessary.""  My question, then, to Danny Boyle and everyone else involved in ""28 Days Later..."": ""Was this picture really necessary?""<br/><br/>Movie making isn't rocket science, but it does requires a little common sense. Too often the forest is obscured by the trees during the long haul of getting a picture made.  But a good director has a vision, and he keeps it intact -- all the way down the line (""2001"" and ""Blade Runner"" are good examples.)  He or she knows exactly what he wants, and has sound answers to critical questions such as, ""What ideas am I trying to communicate""  What should the audience take with them when they leave the theater?  How will they be entertained and/o enlightened by this story?""  And perhaps most importantly -- in this era of been- there, done-that audiences -- ""What will I be giving them that they haven't already gotten a million times before?""<br/><br/>Pretty basic questions, right?  But apparently none of them were asked during the writing of ""28 Days Later...,"" or if they were, they weren't sufficiently answered.<br/><br/>What we basically have here is a slow-moving, empty-headed, European remake of ""I Am Legend""/""Last Man on Earth""/""Omega Man"" -- with a little of ""The Stand,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Night of the Comet"" mixed in -- but with none of the originality, logic, insight, topicality or especially humor of those pictures.  It's being advertised as an amped-up, action-packed, ultra-violent zombie pic.  Sounds great, right?  Would that it be so.  In fact the picture is such a grim and joyless pseudo-art house bore that from the beginning I wondered if I was in the right theater.  To add insult to injury, it's simplistic, sophomoric and morally and poliyically empty as well.  As opposed to a complex, well thought- out morality tale like ""The Omega Man"" (or almost any episode of ""Star Trek"") -- where we not only sympathize with both protagonist's and antagonist's point of view but get a powerful antiwar statement, too -- there seems to be literally NOTHING on Danny Boyle's mind except leaning out at the audience and yelling, ""Boo!""  The characters have nothing on their minds but basic survivial, and the zombies are of the insane, homicidal variety -- nothing more than foaming, rabid beasts that need to be killed ASAP.<br/><br/>John William Corrington, on the other hand, adapting Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend,"" gave the vampires of ""The Omega Man"" not only personalities and intelligence, but a believable agenda as well: as victims of modern warfare, their mission was to return to a pre-technological age, before chemical and biological weapons disfigured them -- and sometimes Mathias's arguments made more sense than Neville's.  In this way, the structure of ""Omega Man"" is exemplary: both hero (Neville) and opponent (Mathias) are well-matched, and both want the same thing: death for the other, and possession of the girl (Rosalind Cash). And of course the great Boris Sagal added his personal touch with unforgettable scenes of a lonely man quietly going mad (playing chess with his dead friend, hearing imaginary phones ringing) while trying to pretend he has a normal life couped up in his high-tech penthouse.  Heston is a master at this kind of role; he gave us another complex shell of a man in ""Planet of the Apes.""  (And don't even get me started on that piss-poor remake that Tim Burton actually passed off as a film.)<br/><br/>To his credit, Boyle -- who never misses an opportunity to show his male actors nude (thanks a bunch, Danny) -- gives us a few good shots of deserted London. But because we care so little about our main character, and know nothing about him, these shots have virtually no impact, no point of reference. There's no point of view in this film; the directing style never really lets you know who you should root for, or why.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear one of the monkeys at the beginning of the film directed it (actually, that's not fair -- a monkey might have shown a little life).<br/><br/>There's also a potentially nice sequence involving wild horses running free in the countryside.  This could've worked well in the hands of a good director; as it is it, the focus of the scene -- and the one memorable line -- is inexplicably given to a secondary character, Frank (Brendan Gleeson, excellent as always) -- reminding us for just a moment what this picture might've been like if Boyle had been sharp enough to give Gleeson the lead instead of Murphy.  Which brings us to one Cillian Murphy.<br/><br/>Murphy, a young Irishman who girls probably adore, plays Jim, the young man who awakens 28 days later to find his world forever changed.  He's good- looking, and reads his lines well.  But the LAST thing you need from your lead in a picture like this is a good-looking guy who reads his lines well!  You need personality, you need complexity, you need -- Chuck Heston!!  This unfortunate bit of casting was the final death knell of the movie.  Not only is the picture lackluster and moronic (Gleeson raves uncontrollably for about a minute before someone announces ""he's infected""  Yeah, no kidding!), it's saddled with a main actor so dull and ordinary that thirty years ago I doubt he would've been hired as Vincent Price's or Charlton Heston's houseboy, let alone be allowed to play their parts.  And never mind that he's a decent actor.  TONS of decent actors do small parts in A films or big parts in B films every day, and for good reason: they lack the charisma or screen presence to successfully carry a major movie. Paul Walker's a decent actor, so is Thomas Jane.  Both good-looking guys, both capable.  But neither of them have the personality of a James Dean, or a Monty Clift -- and they never will.  Hiring Brendan Gleeson was the best casting decision Boyle made on this turkey -- and then he kills him off halfway through the second act!   Arrggghh!!!<br/><br/>To be fair, Murphy was working with a handicap -- NO PART!  No character! Nothing.  Zip!  Talk about your underwritten roles!  The only thing we learn about Jim is he was a bicycle messenger.  That's it!!  We also see his parents clutching a picture of him as a child.  But who really cares?  I don't recall hearing any weeping in the audience.  Here's a guy who's completely ordinary. There's absolutely nothing special about him -- nothing -- he's just an ordinary Joe like you or I (maybe a little better looking).  And why am I paying ten bucks to see someone as ordinary as you or I?  That's what I asked myself for 112 minutes. The other three people in the theater were probably asking the same thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps most problematic of all is that the film relies on a confusing, almost incomprehensible editing style during the action sequences, and the same narrow-shutter strobe effect that's become popular since ""Gladiator"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though it's used to excellent effect in those films).  It also suffers from a third act ""Lord of the Flies"" twist so hackneyed and out of place it might have been pieced together from discarded pages stuck to the bottom of a trash dumpster found outside Ed Wood's apartment about half a century ago.<br/><br/>I realize what Boyle was going for -- he wanted to make an ""Omega Man"" /""Night of the Living Dead""/""Assault on Precinct 13"" for today's twenty-somethings who have (hopefully, God willing) never seen those great films.  And he wanted to do it using a Lars Von Trier, Dogme 95 style -- hoping this ""hip"" approach would scare the hell out of people just by virtue of it seeming real.  (Not a bad concept if it was done this way, but it wasn't.  Unlike the Hi-8 camcorder approach used on ""The Celebration,""  ""28 Days"" -- shot by the same D.P. -- uses a PAL DV Cam for an almost-film look, and uses little handheld stuff.  It might as well have been shot on film in the first place.)<br/><br/>And, like ""Blair Witch,"" I guess the idea was that the realism would be heightened by the use of largely unknown faces.  And of course the zombies would be meaner and grosser and scarier than anything George Romero or Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ever cooked up in their stupid films.  That was Boyle's idea, and it's a damn fine way to make a movie. Right?<br/><br/>Wrong!  FIRST you come up with an interesting character or two, an involving story that makes sense, a resolution that resonates, a theme that carries some weight, and ideally some sort of variation or improvement, if possible, on the kind of film you're emulating (avoiding ripping off the interracial relationship from ""Omega Man"" or the waking-up-in-the-hospital-and-finding-everyone-gone scene from ""Day of the Triffids"" wouldn't be a bad idea either) -- THEN you pile on your handheld video.  Your neat-o strobe effects and your with-it machine gun editing.  Your young, hip cast and your trendy contemporary soundtrack.<br/><br/>Got it, Danny boy?  Starting to sink in?  Or should we take it again from the top, a little slower this time?<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER*****<br/><br/>Still, the film is considered a hit -- though it seems to be leaving the theaters pretty quickly.  And now I understand (egad!) a new ending is about to be added.  The original, darker ending Boyle apparently wanted in the first place (but that didn't test well) is about to be shipped to 1400 theaters across the country and spliced onto the last reel -- AFTER the credit crawl!  No, that's not a joke -- this is right out of the L.A. Times.  Beginning July 25th, this copycat clunker will have a final scene added, probably something nice and uplifting -- like Selena becoming infected, then Jim killing her, then himself. Something cheery like that.  Just exactly what we need today, I figure.  Which reminds me -- anyone know where I can get a gun?"
"BruceMc","3","1","3","12 July 2003"," How can a zombie movie be so boring?
","With the exception of a couple of sequences, specifically the opening and penultimate, this a surprisingly boring movie.  The violence and suspense we'd expect from an end-of-the-world/zombie move are mostly absent and have been replaced with an uninteristing commentary on family and civilization-- think ""Lord of the Flies"" (of which both versions are better than this snoozer).  I suppose the reason for all the mundane scenes of shopping, eating, driving, sleeping, etc., are to make the ""exciting"" and ""suspenseful"" scenes more ""exciting"" and ""suspenseful,"" but instead this is just a stunningly boring movie."
"Aaron1375","3","1","3","28 June 2003"," They said ""if you like Dawn of the Dead, you will love this"". They were wrong.
","I had heard all the hype and read the reviews. Everyone said this was a good movie...a ""Dawn of the Dead"" type movie. This movie doesn't even come close. First of all, it is not a zombie movie at all. The people seem to have rabies and are called the infected. Sure they may attack humans, but that does not make them the undead. The undead are usually a lot tougher to kill. This one starts out promising enough with a guy waking up in a hospital naked (could have done without the full nudity) and everything in the city is deserted. The movie makers did a great job of making the city look empty. The guy goes into a church and encounters one of the rabid infected people and makes a run for it. He runs into two survivors and there are some good scenes here including the only gory death in the movie when a gal has to kill her friend. Then the movie becomes very dull and the infected are seen almost not at all. I think the ""Hulk"" had more screen time than the so-called zombies in this movie. The two remaining members end up finding more survivors. A father and his daughter and this dude with a bat who for some reason is only shown once and never seen again. The group has this peppy conversation on how they need each other and decide to go on a road trip to a place they heard about on the radio. I was waiting for them to start singing ""There's got to be a morning after"". They embark on their road trip and it is a three-day trip. During the trip they have a rather good stop in the tunnel, one of the last good scenes in the movie where they encounter the infected. The rest of their road trip is nice and bland...they stay out in the open and no ""zombies"" bother them. The ""zombies"" apparently are drawn only to candles and not to bonfires. The heroes get to the army base and of course the army has ulterior motives that have nothing to do with the ""zombies"" and the rest of the movie just sucks. I am still waiting for the violent, gory finale I was promised by a reviewer. I really have to wonder if those who compared this to ""Dawn of the Dead' have actually seen Dawn? Sure Romero used a story too, but he had lots more action and gore and horror. He never forgot that the main reason we went to his movies was to see zombies."

","Although the zombies don't eat brains, and are more accurately infected, this is a good presentation of the apocalypse in Britain.

The soldiers are believably shown, and overall the characters are good. The depiction of the apocalypse in Britain is well depicted. A good addition to the genre."

It is essentially a zombie film but there is so much more intelligence compared to your average gore infested zombie flick. This is thoughtful, provoking, clever and overall an amazing film throughout. Only minor criticisms come from the occasionally scrappy looking digital film used and some niggling continuity errors.

"jeffrey-utley","8","1","4","20 July 2013"," The Poor Beginning To Modern Zombie Movies
","An English zombie movie, which was the beginning of 'Zombieland', 'World War Z', 'Dawn of the Dead', and many other zombie movies. '28 Days Later' came out in 2002, so it is relatively old now... But it looks horrible! I will let the low budget of this movie pull it's rating down. The zombies were not done well and made stupid sounds. The acting wasn't good, either, and many parts in this movie were extremely boring. Here in there, there would be some enjoyable scenes, but it would go back to being boring soon. Only good part in this movie was the end. I liked that part.<br/><br/>The movie has an interesting plot and some good ideas, but all of the characters are bland and I didn't care about any of them for a while. Some good and smart events happened that sometimes made the scene enjoyable, but that would be that would be the leading event of the scene that carried it. The dialog made most of the scenes that were boring become boring. It would seem unrealistic and just not be interesting, because the characters were so bland that we didn't care what they said and how the acting was bad. It would also be the situations that they were in. By ""situations"" I mean consequences, chances, choices, and tasks. They had no thought behind them and went on too long. They weren't realistic so that would also bring them down. The fighting scenes also had basically no climax. They stayed the same through the whole scene and stayed uninteresting and unexciting. This was because until the movie was almost over, so I didn't care if they all died so there wasn't nothing necessarily to go for. (This excludes the end) There was bad music and unrealistic fighting, too. The movements of the infected and people were did not seem like they would happen, the way the humans defended themselves seemed ridiculous, and they isolated certain characters and major aspects of the plot of the movie so the scene go a certain way for our ""enjoyment"", which just made it less enjoyable for me. Also, the infected were unrealistic. They're zombies: they're not supposed to see that well, and they just go after a living thing they hear or smell to try to eat it. They're not smart enough to stop and listen when someone gets away and they don't know to wait for things to happen... And, they can't see that well, as I said one sentence ago. In this movie they went mainly by sight. That's not what zombies are.<br/><br/>Now for things I did like in the movie... A much shorter list. The partially enjoyable actually had some somewhat clever dialog that seemed a bit enjoyable, but only worked because we had no idea what the character's were like, because they weren't introduced, so we wouldn't think that would they would be saying would be ridiculous for the character. Sometimes, the circumstances for the characters would be interesting, and what the characters had done as solutions in past circumstances would be interesting. Some of the choices the characters made and the chances the characters took would also be interesting. About half way through '28 Days Later' an event happened that I thought was smart, but strange. The introduction of this event was enjoyable, because it introduced new characters and places and did well. Sadly that's the only good thing I can say about that event, though, until the end. Now, here's what I thought about the end: It was enjoyable, and made sense sometimes, so it was good. There were some intense moments and some battle scenes that were cool. Some of the things in the end were realistic and made sense. It had some smart events that gives props to the movie. I also liked what they did at the very end. It had some more clever events, character's actions, and good dialog. It was also kind of realistic in some parts.<br/><br/>This movie had a good ending and some partially enjoyable parts, but it had bad acting, bad dialog, bad battle scenes, unrealistic events, bland characters, bad music, and boring events and situations. My 4/10 rating means '28 Days Later' is not very good. It's not exactly bad, but it's not good and I didn't like it. I will not buy this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone who is considering watching it."

Stop calling it a zombie film and pay attention to the story. I'm no critic nor do I pretend to be but at least I know what this excellent film is actually about. Yes, it has touches of the Romero type zombie films, and yes, there are questionable zombie references in its pretty good sequel (the scene where the helicopter kills a load of the infected springs to mind, with some of the infected still raging on after losing limbs, guts, etc) but at its heart and sequel aside this was a film about an epidemic and not of the walking dead kind."

","This movie is yet another case where it takes a beat-down plot, and starts out a movie with something seemingly interesting.  Zombie movies aren't original, but nothing really is, technically.  The first 10 minutes of the movie rocked, with the mysterious ""rioting"" scenes and the whole monkey-setting-free scenes.  It made me think that this movie would actually be good.  I nearly shat my pants though, after the whole cool monkey-infection part, the very first thing you see is Jim's [the main character] penis.  It's a good 5 minutes of penis too.  It was really really awful.  Then he had to rub it in by showing everyone his naked butt for another 5 minutes.  He starts wandering around town, and the movie stops being good after the first song stops playing.  After the dramatic bridge [the drum part] with Jim looking at the wall with ads of dead people, the movie turns into a living crap machine.  The movie switches genres a good three times throughout the movie, starting out as a kind of cool zombie movie, switching into a hippie hitchhiker movie, into a gay-bashing fest [where everyone makes fun of the fairy that cooks in the military camp]. The middle hour and 45 minutes of the movie is a blur, with highly predictable plot ""twists"" and ""edge of seat"" suspense sequences.  To top everything off, though, the movie ends in a vague fashion, completely confusing anyone who was unfortunate enough to spend two hours in this bore-fest.  Keep in mind, this is just my opinion, and I'm no expert by any means, but this is truly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, managing to beat out ""Darkness Falls"" and the god-awful ""Legally Blonde"". Remember - Shop Smart, Shop S-Mart."

Secondly the movie is too predictable. you can guess most of the times about the plot and what would be the result. As the movie nears to its end, it becomes more and more unclear that what exactly the director want to show! is it about the virus that is spreading fast or is it about the psycho soldiers that are left alive.

There were more holes in it than a string vest and even with a late appearance by Eccleston, thoroughly unconvincing as an armed forces commander, could not possibly be salvaged. Instances like the fact that they claimed that they would have to wait until morning before it was safe to travel- then a few minutes later being outside a tower block in the dark!! They took their food from Budgens! Obviously Sainsburys and Tescos were not good enough for them ! And after four weeks all the fresh food was in absolutely pristine condition!!! The list of errors and weaknesses are endless but to its credit the opening scene was splendid and did give me hope that it might be sustained-but it was nothing but false expectation! Right from the outset when the main character regained consciousness after his road accident in a hospital there were encountered the initial germ of flaws-why was he stark naked on a NHS bed!!! Yet enough of all that, I could forgive the lack of accuracy in the first part of the film because of the excellent photography and succeeding in the naturally difficult task of capturing a deserted London-no mean feat! But the second half just lost the plot entirely! It was like I had started watching another film! It was incoherent and seemed as though the writer had just given up on it!

","This movie is a total disappointment. I feel utterly indignant and cheated as a movie-goer and a consumer of the movie ticket. I also find myself a complete idiot to have even considered seeing this movie in the first place. Not only was this movie a humiliation of the viewers' intelligence, but it was also a complete failure, either as a scary movie, or a zombie movie. Basically, it's a movie that you want it to end, but it just doesn't and keep going nowhere.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie never explains clearly why it starts off the way it is (why's the protagonist, Jim, lying alone on a hospital bed. As well, the beginning is a complete drag as it's almost a fifteen-minute running around in a city in England that are already evacuated.<br/><br/>Secondly, very much part of the movie is unnesessary. I'm not going to elaborate it as I don't want to give the plot away. And most of the 'jokes' are so pathetic that the audience would laugh at, but simply because there's nothing else in the movie that the viewers could appreciate and worth laughing.<br/><br/>Thirdly, if you're looking forward to seeing a scary zombie movie, I'm sorry. The episodic and predictable zombie popping out of nowhere can only drive you crazy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie could've redeemed itself when it comes to the part when the survivors meet the soldiers if it dwells on a little bit more on the intrinsic evilness of human and makes it the movie's theme. But instead, this part is shown so ambiguous and hasty that Jim comes off as a reckless maniac and a psycho. Hence, the movie ends up going nowhere and having no theme at all.<br/><br/>This movie simply doesn't make an iota of sense (if most part of England was infected, why isn't there any foreign assistance?). The title 28-days have nothing to do with the plot but simply just a haphazard number of days that the story goes along. The scenes are gross and crude but not SCARY. They're only meant to gross the audience out. The British ended up being a despicable copycat of the American resident evil by producing a sub-standard version of a zombie movie. In conclusion, why can't the British make something better out of their sophistication? I thought this is part of their tradition, but maybe I'm mistaken."

On the upside, the flick is well done in a smart and gritty style, only has one dream sequence, and doesn't throw cheap shots at you.

","Zombie movies are a rare type of genre within movies and many of them are similar but certain of them have something which distinguishes itself from the rest. 28 days later is a target British film and at times the accents can take away from the joy and become distracting.<br/><br/>Solid characters to root for and the film is mildly entertaining but as a whole, does think isn't as great as it's been received. It is far tamer in terms of violence and horror jump scares than expected. This is a very mild horror film and most of it isn't scary. It is more of a virus based drama than a zombie movie. Though the buildup and explanation of the virus was well done. It does keep it intriguing.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat different as we see the lead protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) turn into an action hero- where he didn't show any tendencies of such prior. Also there is a supermarket scene which feels out of place, but perhaps was added to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>The film is mostly predictable as we know the main characters are going to survive but along the way we do see things come in their way."

Quickly filmed in cleared streets in the pre morning rush hour in when dawn is early.<br/><br/>Boyle uses digital cameras to aid the quick setting up of such scenes in a wsy that traditional 35mm cameras wouldn't allow.

","If you are so smart to work with a deadly virus you at least have to think about a minimum security, but what the hell? If no then the life would continue as it was, so forget about the basic regulations and keep the infected specimen as they were just in the animal shop.<br/><br/>What follows the major screw-up of a human existence is one of the most predictable but astonishing outcomes. Deserted streets of a big city, devoured carcasses of cars, empty buildings. That alone could drive me crazy. But what if you somehow missed the outbreak? Once again Cillian Murphy instantly catches your eye and ushers you into the doomed contaminated world having as little idea of what's happening as you.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle has orchestrated an incredible show with only a few characters but on the massive scene. The acts interchange and throw you from hot to cold, at one moment you heart beats peacefully enjoying warm company and beauty of untouched nature and then it suddenly tunes into the rhythm of dozens of feet thumping the ground. That's when your hands get sweaty and through all those throat-tearing screams you can hear the death chasing your precious life.<br/><br/>The change of the usual social ceremonies is shockingly cruel and incredibly convincing. Even the stranger valued more than anything, because you don't know whether it's a last human that you will ever see. But don't lose your vigilance, no matter the connection: friend or family, got infected - got killed.<br/><br/>We all know that extreme situations pull the best of every person. Sometimes that best is the worst, so with all masks off you have to step on the path of survival. That's exactly what is shown in this grim installation of the world on the verge of extinction. And the way it's done is simply stunning: going from true friendship to basic human instincts ruling over the intellect.<br/><br/>Looking over my shoulder I would say that the picture is a surprising example of a fascinating and thrilling science fiction mixed with horror, giving you both creeps and understanding that life worth living and even smallest things can bring you joy. Definitely worth watching."

","A man awakens in a hospital after being in a coma for about a month. Getting out of bed, he walks out of his room to an empty corridor, an empty hospital, then onto the streets of an empty London. He soon comes across the only living inhabitants of the city; savage, wild and red-eyed people trying to bite him. He's picked up by some other survivors, and we learn that England has fallen to some kind of infection, carried through people who bite others or spit blood on them. With no power, no phones, and no sign of any help, the survivors band together and live to escape, any way they can.<br/><br/>28 Days Later took this once tired genre into new territory in a blistering, no-holds bar kind of way, showing us what it might be like were zombies to be real. However, you won't hear the word zombie uttered once in the film, as they are simply called ""The Infected"" here. The film's stark imagery, realistic undertones, well-drawn characters carried by brilliant performances, and a never-ending sense of foreboding and dread, created a formula of zombie's films which took this genre to a new place. Suddenly, the fall of the world to the rise of the undead became seemingly possible, and we met characters who weren't just two-dimensional idiots posing as zombie food waiting to be picked off, but rather real people, with genuine emotions and motivations, trying to make sense of life after most had died.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Initially I thought this was a zombie/ horror movie and I do not normally watch these. But as it turned out, it is not technically a zombie movie and even if it is edging towards that, it is so much more than that and I am glad now to have it in my collection.<br/><br/>While of course you can watch it purely as entertainment or a warning about how easily a pandemic or other events can upset everything we take for granted, it contains a much more universal truth which makes this movie so special to me.<br/><br/>(spoilers ahead)
At the beginning of the film we see the main character of Jim (who is played by the superbly talented Cillian Murphy) lost, alone and feeling depressed. What he is looking for throughout the movie is something we consciously or subconsciously all chase: reaching an inner serenity, a feeling of coming home, where we feel secure, peaceful, to belong somewhere. Although this is primarily something inside us, we often tend to seek it mainly on the outside. We think: when I complete this job, get this house or this partner, I will finally be able to relax and be happy. But by doing so, we make our happiness dependant on things that are subject to frequent change. Whenever we seem to reach satisfaction, it slips out of our hands again. In the film it becomes even more apparent, as the apocalyptic setting finally makes it impossible to seek stability on the outside.
Whenever Jim finds a father figure or a place of rest, something happens and he has to move on or flee again. Near the end of the film, when there is no prospect of help and there is nowhere left to go, he finds that quality in himself, he steps up to protect Selina and outwits the soldiers. And in the moment where he has found that in himself, it manifests on the outside, in the love of Selena and the peaceful spot in the countryside. That is why I am so glad they went with the ending of the film that they did. The last shot of Jim looking so calm, confident and optimistic and no longer depressed brought it full circle for me."

But the filmmakers counter these questionable qualities with solid performances, an intelligent script, and sure-handed direction. The result is a movie that kept me involved from start to finish. When Boyle wants to shock us, he has no trouble doing so. There's a little of George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead) here. Several scenes in which the infected attack are genuinely creepy. One sequence in particular - in which Jim and Frank race to change a tire while a band of infected relentlessly approach - generates as much tension as any other 2003 motion picture. This is followed in short order by an effective character building sequence in which the protagonists enjoy a picnic while ruminating about what, if anything, the future might hold.

","Though '28 Days Later... (2002)' uses digital cameras in an undeniably groundbreaking and trendsetting way, watching this 'zombie movie' (even in HD on its Blu-Ray transfer) really just reminds you how far we've come in today's world of super-crisp, high-definition, 'film-competing' digital cinematography. It's often, to an extent, an exercise in resilience, as you sometimes have to squint and strain your way through its most 'SD' of sequences. It's the energetic way that Boyle uses the camera that makes the piece work, though. The influence of the feature is undeniable and even reaches to its fast-moving fiends, for this is the feature that first introduced the world to the 'runner zombie' and, naturally, it's also the one in which the concept is arguably done the best. Its creatures are surprisingly, creepily versatile and viciously relentless, to boot; it isn't hard to see why they were essentially copied across many a film to come, with varying degrees of success. The narrative itself is full of subtext and often pulls back to focus on the too often overlooked, eerily quiet aspects of a near-extinct population. All of this makes for a refreshing genre experience with a phenomenal score that's only really hampered by some dated visuals and a story that only goes so far in being entertaining. 6/10"

British films in general are not usually that good at all especially Horror movies so when 28 came out i was blown away by this terrifying infection film.<br/><br/>This is the greatest ""Infection"" or ""Infected"" film ever made or side by side with Eli Roth's CABIN FEVER, & the greatest Zombie movie ever made is the George Romero 1985 Masterpiece ""Day of the Dead""
My other favourite ""Infected"" movie is Eli Roth's 2002 Cabin Fever & then there's the excellent, Will Smith infection Thriller ""I Am Legend"" all great films in the Infection Sub-genre.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The look of the film is amazing, it's very real & very gritty & has a very unsettling atmosphere. The infected people are ridiculously scary lol the make up fx look stunning & no use of c.g.i so it's amazing to look at the infected running through the abandoned London streets!!!
There's so much good stuff in this film that makes this a classic Horror movie.
28 days later also has that very old school feel to it, that dark & moody gritty low budget approach like those old 70's Horror Thriller films such as SHIVERS (1975) & RABID (1977) two excellent Infected David Cronenberg films & 28 has that feel intentional or not?
The cast are excellent & give great performances especially, Cillian Murphy who gives the standout performance here & who became a big Movie star after this in America. Also we an excellent Naomie Harris as the tough & brutal warrior survivor, Salena, also a strong solid performance from the great Brendan Gleeson (Lake Placid) as a good man & father trying to keep his daughter safe & another great performance comes from Christopher Eccleston as a sinister Army captain with scary motives, a superb all British cast of top talent here!!!<br/><br/>The empty London here looks so scary & menacing, also the music is excellent some times very sad & scary that it captures the loneliness & other times very almost 80's style but always excellent!!!
So yes a very surprisingly excellent British infection film by a director that i would Never usually be interested in or watch his films at all!!! I Hated the DEPRESSING & GRIM overrated ""Trainspotting"" & i didn't like ""The Beach""
But his, 28 days later is a great film & is extremely powerful & suspenseful & is actually an important film in the genre.
Raw, real & scary as hell, also scarily more relevant each year!!!"
"paulclaassen","6","0","4","28 June 2018"," Very good horror thriller.
","The use of extreme close-up photography (in the beginning) makes it difficult to follow the action at times. This is the most realistic zombie film I've seen to date. I though Cillian Murphy in particular was very good and convincing. The music was lovely and tranquil, in direct contrast to the situation the characters found themselves in, but I thought it worked incredibly well. As the film progresses, it becomes less about the zombies and more about Man's unquenchable desire. Man against Man, as it has always been, regardless of the circumstances. Very good."

","Four people desperate to survive a virus that turns people into maniacal, rabid killers make a desperate escape out of London. With a taxicab full of food and plenty of hope, they gamble their lives on a place that offers food, weapons, and protection. But what lies in wait for them may be a bigger nightmare than the hundreds of thousands of the infected.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""28 Days Later"" is the scene when Cillian Murphy (playing the lead role) is chased by the infected who were lying in a dormant state in a dark church. To me, this was the scariest part of the movie, and it shows early on the skills director Danny Boyle has in creating a horrifying and suspenseful atmosphere.<br/><br/>As far as I know, ""28 Days Later"" is the first movie that has fast moving, non-zombie/infected/seriously angry people who can infect others within seconds, so it gets a special mention for that. Although technically not a zombie flick, I put this movie in the same category as zombie movies, and it is one of the top 10, best zombie movies ever made. Yes, it has some shenanigans such as: the taxicab able to ride over a heap of abandoned cars in a tunnel; and the bad guys unnecessarily moving someone miles away from their base to kill them, which leads to an escape (reminds me of those old, corny James Bond movies where Bond escapes because the bad guy wants to be too fancy with the way he wants to kill Bond). But everything else works very well, and it was all done on a low budget, which makes this movie more deserving of praise.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"brianberta","9","0","2","31 July 2017"," A chilling zombie film with a deeper meaning
","Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" is my favorite zombie film by far. It may not be as popular as some of the other zombie classics out there, but I think it rises far above all of them. It's not only an entertaining and well-done zombie film, but a smart film which has a deeper meaning.<br/><br/>After a group of animal activists release a chimpanzee with a dangerous virus, a zombie virus breaks out. 28 days after that incident, Jim, a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma only to have to fight for his survival along with a few other survivors he runs into.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of this film is its political allegories. Its political allegories give an example of what the government/military would do in a situation like this. Boyle is saying that if a zombie outbreak were to ever happen, the government, soldiers, and politicians would be safe in a bunker while the rest of the world would be left to fight for themselves. You could probably get some help from the army, but they may want to get rid of you or other people traveling with you. They might even have violent intentions towards the people they keep with them. The military soldiers we saw in this movie went to unsettling lengths. They tried to rape Selena and Hannah, killed their own soldiers for disagreeing with their actions, and, most importantly, kept one of their fellow soldiers who turned into a zombie alive and chained up so they could see how long it would take for him to starve (an action which resulted in their deaths). Also, the final scene is delightfully ambiguous, because it makes you wonder whether the military will even try to rescue anyone else.<br/><br/>The character arcs of Jim and Selena are also impressive as the 2 of them appear to swap personalities over the course of the film. When we are first introduced to the characters, Jim appears to be terrified of the zombies while Selena seems like a strong, fearless female lead. After she kills Mark early on, she tells Jim that if he ever turns, she will kill him in a heartbeat. After they discover two more survivors named Frank and Hannah, Selena appears to show little interest for helping them. Over the course of the film, however, she slowly befriends and accept them. The most important aspect of her change, however, is how she slowly develops a relationship with Jim as she said she would never do so early on in the film. As for Jim, on the other hand, he changes from fearing the zombies to becoming increasingly violent throughout the film. His first instance of violence is when he kills a zombified boy. However, the most notable instance of violence is when he kills several military soldiers in the final act of the film. This shows that threats to his life or threats to other people he cares for can bring out his animalistic instincts. My favorite moment surrounding their character arcs is how Jim reunites with Selena after he kills Corporate Mitchell. The scene where he gouges Mitchell's eyes out with his fingers is probably the most gory scene from the film (or, at least, in my opinion it is). It shows how much the outbreak has effected him. The moment when he reunites with Selena is very interesting though. Early on in the film, Selena said that she would kill him in a heartbeat if he were to turn into a zombie. However, the fact that she refuses to kill him (even though she clearly thinks he's infected) shows that both hers and Jim's character arcs are complete. I think that what director Danny Boyle is saying here is that you may try to act a certain way if you're put in a situation like this. Over time, however, the apocalypse will gradually bring out your true colors to a point where they will eventually be uncontrollable.<br/><br/>On top of its deeper meaning, I also found it to have several memorable and brilliant scenes. The first of which were its shots of a deserted London. I thought it was impressive that director Danny Boyle was able to make all of those highly populated areas of the city look deserted. From what I read, Boyle had the streets closed off at 4:00 am and sometimes had only a couple dozen minutes to film. Another great scene is when Jim kills all of the remaining soldiers in the bunker as this scene is both suspenseful, but, like I said above, it shows the character arcs of Jim and Selena at their finest. Also, the song ""In the House, In a Heartbeat"" was well-written and memorable. It's one of my favorite soundtracks for a horror film. It fit the movie really well. Personally, I didn't have any major issues with this movie. I thought it was all masterfully done.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is one of my 10 favorite films from the 2000's, because of its deeper meaning. As I said, this is my favorite zombie film of all time (I even like it more than the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", which I actually consider to be overrated). I thought its sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" was alright, but in my opinion, this movie is the best that particular genre of film is ever going to get. I strongly recommend it."

","28 weeks later is a post-apocalyptic film directed by Danny Boyle. One of my favorite paintings on the theme of a zombie Apocalypse. Watched the tape a dozen times, including all additional materials, both in Russian and in original language. To this day, for me, this movie and the sequel 28 weeks later, but it is a little bit later, is the standard zombie-genre world of film. <br/><br/>The film is set in what was once an amazingly beautiful country with a rich history of great Britain, stricken with an incurable virus, leading to instant infection. Upon contact with a human, the virus turns them into insane killers.<br/><br/>Unlike other films of this genre the infected are alive. They are fast, rabid, angry, hungry and insatiable creature. Danny Boyle opened a new world of ""living dead"" is not only world cinema but for the interactive entertainment industry. The second important fact is that the Director, in most cases, refused to computer graphics and hand-drawn special effects. Instead, the gallons of fake blood, tons of makeup, and many non-professional actors in the role of fast zombies.<br/><br/>Happy in the movie and memorable music written by the British composer and musician John Murphy, which complements the atmosphere of despair, of madness, of fear and impending doom brings to us what words cannot, and most importantly, doesn't distract from the movie itself.<br/><br/>I advise to all, this cult film from the famous Director, ushered in a new wave of zombie horror in world cinema"

","If you love zombies & the whole post apocalyptic world thing, then this a movie for you. In this Classic(in my opinion) zombie flick you really get a sense of the terrifying yet very real struggles it might be like if we should ever be faced with an outbreak resulting in a zombie plagued world. It has everything from gory scenes, prodigious zombie battles, struggles of all sorts, & it even fits in some self growth aspects. As for those prodigious zombie battles, you won't be let down by non realistic survival skills that you hate to watch & roll your eyes at. There won't be any of that. It's as pretty close to what it might be like & what an everyday person could accomplish if faced with trying to survive a deadly zombie virus outbreak. I would have to say it's an amazing mix of blood & guts, human struggle & Zombies!"
"mistoppi","9","0","3","18 March 2017"," Excellent!
","I like zombie movies, I just don't watch them as much. My current favourite is Shaun of the Dead, which isn't exactly that serious. 28 Days Later is probably the first more serious zombie movie I really like. Of course the problem is most of these movies have a similar structure to them. It's always about survival, having to kill someone you care, all that. Comedies of course take different kind of turns.<br/><br/>Plot structure to 28 Days Later seems pretty similar to the other movies I've seen or heard about. There are still some twists I really enjoy, and very many scenes I like. <br/><br/>But the main reason this movie stands out is because of the characters. I usually am not extremely fond of characters in horror, because you never know what's going to happen. But then I realised how attached I was to the characters of this movie. That realisation happened during some of the most serene and so very nice scenes, like the one at the grocery store. Those little scenes are so nice and heart-warming it makes everything else even more painful. You just want them to have nice, good lives, but horror movies are what they are.<br/><br/>The cinematography is interesting. It's annoying at first, because it's grainy and really poor, but it keeps getting better. Also I really like the music in this film. It's simple, it amplifies the feeling in each scene, and it isn't just scary music used to make the scenes seem more threatening. It's a perfect soundtrack when you don't want to take any risks.<br/><br/>All in all 28 Days Later is a great genre movie. Danny Boyle sure knows how to direct all kind of stuff, huh?"
"william-258-512675","Null","0","1","4 December 2016"," Brilliantly shot, amazingly written
","I came into this movie expecting a horror movie, with some drama undertones. When I watched it, I found it to be the opposite. Drama with horror undertones. The film was written in a way so that scenes that were intended to be dramatic were dramatic, instead of the outcome being predictable. I felt that most of the characters could die at anytime, which added to the tension. The movie didn't scream horror at me. It focused more on the idea that the characters find a new source of hope, only for it to be taken away. I felt that each character had a unique personality. There was one moment right at the beginning that made me shed a tear. There were some filming choices that I enjoyed, and some that I didn't. I enjoyed some of the film's choices of slowly panning the camera to the area with the most impact. I personally didn't enjoy the scenes where it seemed more like they were slowing down the frames per second of the camera to add the look of more spastic zombie movements. Overall, this is a movie that I found well above average."
"videorama-759-859391","8","0","1","1 July 2016"," Dawn Of The Dead London style, marks a new dawn of zombie film
","Danny Trainspotting Boyle proves he can make all kinds of stuff, a director of versatility. Here he's made a very impressive, unsettling and believable film, a more serious take on the zombie films, we've grown to know and love. Coma patient Murphy, wakes up on the blackest of days, to find good ole London, void of human life. Some wide spread virus epidemic (though we don't find out it's cause) now in it's fourth week (hence the title) has spread through London, where bitten humans take zombie like form, but are much faster and agile, where only a small number of the unbitten and uninfected remain. Murphy meets up with a woman survivor, a teen girl and her ""old softie"" father, and a family type friendship forms. It mirrors some similarities of the Dawn Of The Dead remake, only this is a much smarter and better film. After a tragedy of misfortune within the group, they are taken in by an army of organized soldiers, who are dealing with the crisis, their way, where the film then draws shades of the original Day Of The Dead, even one scene kind of in unforgettably bad taste, with the woman and teen girl, are all doled up, for the men's pleasure. One other scene stays with me, played against the haunting beautiful score where 4 horses freely gait about. On the whole, this is one movie, like I said, which really impresses more than anything, a more seriously approached and well utilized film, that just doesn't go straight for the jugular. It has some truly scary moments too. Murphy is great, where the others do well too, but it's his intensely engaging performance that'll grab the viewer's eye, two years before he played that particularly nasty passenger in Red Eye. Watch for a kind of after ending, the credits."
"benatarandres","7","0","1","19 May 2016"," A return to Normalcy
","One of the core concepts of human nature is our propensity to survive, most often through dire measures. Whatever way we manage to cheat death, or delay the inevitable, the drastic measures taken bring us towards a greater fear and significant contradiction. The film's presentation, although less cynical than his previous film Trainspotting, is equally grim in perspective as director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland tackle the subject of human survival, within the confines of an issue that rivals the controversies surrounding nuclear annihilation and global warming awareness. With biological warfare, 28 days Later paints a brutal and terrifying vision of a world that is merely a reflection of our own ignorance. After the outbreak of an infectious virus called ""Rage"", the population of London is crippled. In merely four weeks, the population has ceased, with very few people left, and the infected running rampant as they resort to the more primal aspects of human behavior, going further back to our own ancestors. The infected hide among the bodies of the dead, the shadows of abandoned buildings, and within the very darkness that the resourceful survivors will be hesitant to venture. With only four survivors, Jim (Murphy), an every man of the sorts, having just woken up from a coma, Selina (Hariss) a ruthless and determined survivor embodying a coldness to her drive, Frank (Gleeson) and Hannah (Burns) a father and Daughter dependent on each other, journey into the whole of Manchester. Their journey is in search of what a radio announcement called ""The Answer to infection"", when really it was a prime example of humanities resilience, and it's more prevalent and damaging ignorance when merely seeking survival above all else. After acquainting themselves with the resourceful, but morally questionable Major Henry (Eccleston), the survivors find themselves in conflict with a group of soldiers, who's own drive to survive not only decimates and destroys their conceptions of morality, but further poses the question as to what is normal, when really that is just a word, and based on a concept we invented. Now with regards to the reasons we took it upon ourselves to establish such a concept was no doubt a prejudice that further reflects our complete lack of knowledge in comparison to a Universe that is vastly more intelligent than we are. The human species has walked this Earth for about several hundred thousand years. There is no exact estimate, and people like the Geneticist Francis Collins, or the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins have their own approximations ranging from a hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand years since homo-sapiens emerged. Regardless of which one it is, be it more or less, out of the 4.6 billion years in which the Earth has existed, and the total 13 billion years since the Universe originated, human kind's emergence pales in comparison to such magnitude. If we were to suddenly up and vanish through some means of extinction, then that would be a merely be a return to what we call normalcy. This sort of philosophical speculation is expressed within the calm and quaint remarks of a rather wise and spiritual sergeant ( McQuarrie) within West's brutish and stagnantly ignorant unit of young soldiers. It is sad to know, but honest in such introspection within our existence. Whether it be it by divine authorship, or an accidental result of the big bang, we've only been here for a short time, and it's even harder to say how long that will last, or even if its normal to accept that it will most likely eventually end. Darwinian evolution by natural selection, although resilient in sexual selection and competitive amongst other organisms, is not always directional nor meant for adaptive evolution in matters as destructive and as incomprehensible as bio warfare. Even when a species such as ours is able to adapt to our surroundings, so do the very parasites that place us within the verge of a viral epidemic. Be it either the foot disease, the bubonic plague, or the passing of one organism to another. The sadness of it all is more conceived within our inability to determine the future outcome of when it will happen, rather than by what means. 28 Days Later envisions that potential outlook, be it within the desolated streets of London, the collapse of a societal infrastructure, and the chaotic/nihilistic portrayal of human destruction through desperation. Along with the lessons presented within the film, viewers obviously felt enthralled the by the horror aspect, mixed with the Apocalyptic vision of a world we are not very far from. Also the depiction of the infected was brilliant with them being more primal and ravage in their nature, then the typically dry and mindless monsters you get in a horror flick, thus exploring the notion of human nature, and how our more behavioral standards are a result of our evolution. An excellent amount of praise goes to the principal actors, Murphy, Harris, Gleeson, Burns, and Eccelston as they each exemplify the many forms of contradiction within the human animal, attempting to make sense of and rebuild a world that could easily become a reality, merely out of the very lack of understanding that characterizes human thinking when tackling higher playing fields of universal knowledge."
"joshuafagan-64214","9","0","1","30 April 2016"," The Definitive Modern Zombie Movie
","The key to a great post-apocalyptic movie is contrasting the loud with the quiet. Everyone knows how important the loud parts are. Who wants to watch a post-apocalyptic movie with no action. Okay, maybe I would, but that's not the point. The survivors need to run into cannibals or evil military leaders or zombies or something to keep the audience's attention up. I've kept this in mind as I write my own dystopian novel, ""Coming to You Live From the end of the World"", coming out about two years after I get someone to represent it.<br/><br/>But shameless advertising aside, quiet moments are as important. Relentless action doesn't give you time to breathe in your environment and get to know your characters. Even MM:FR had a good fifteen minute block of quiet in between all the madness. Any post-apocalyptic environment is by definition quite different from normal. That difference needs to be explored. Sometimes, it's ugly. Sometimes, it's beautiful. Sometimes, it's both. But it's always interesting when done right.<br/><br/>And 28 Days Later definitely does it right. This is the best zombie movie I have ever seen. It is not the best piece of zombie fiction I've ever seen. The Last of Us and McCarthy's The Road are superior, and if I am to be honest, calling them zombie fiction sounds more than a bit demeaning. They are more than that. This, on the other hand, while there are a lot of themes bouncing around, is definitely a zombie movie. And despite what I have earlier said, that is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, a group of crazed activists try to free a couple of monkeys that are being experimented on. The scientists try to tell them that the monkeys are infected, but like any group of people committed hard to a cause, they don't listen, and the monkeys are set free. immediately, one of the monkeys bites the activist and turns them into a zombie. Thus, the apocalypse starts.<br/><br/>28 days later, the entire country of Britain has been decimated by the apocalypse. A man, Jim, who had been in a coma, wakes up and starts exploring the ruins in one of the movie's many great sequences. Soon, he meets two survivors, a man and a woman. The man gets overtaken by zombies, but the woman, Selina, survives, and the two of them run off. They soon meet up with an older man and his daughter, and the four of them make their way to Manchester, where a cure for a virus is said to be.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of taking from the classic zombie formula while adding its own twists and turns and wrinkles, and the result is a brilliantly paced, brilliantly shot, brilliantly scored film that revived the zombie 'genre'.<br/><br/>Our four protagonists have great charisma together. You want to see them survive this. You want to see them go off and prosper. That kind of investment is always important, but it's especially important for these types of movies, which would otherwise make the viewer rather apathetic.<br/><br/>You never know which way they're gonna go, and so you're on the edge of the seat throughout the entire movie, but you never feel cheated or disgraced. Everything feels earned. And you are less confused at the end of the movie than you were at the start of it, which is the way these things are supposed to work. Bravo.<br/><br/>I also love how this film fixes a lot of the problems I have with zombie films. This is not the first movie to make zombies move fast, but it was certainly a good decision. It makes everything feel more real, as does the decision to employ some sort of logic and reason. Don't worry- you won't get bogged down with information, but you will be enlightened. Movies like this don't have to employ completely sound logic, but if they do employ some sort of logic and stick to it, the atmosphere is enhanced.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is enjoyable, terrifying, and a stunning piece of art. If you're interested in zombies or post-apocalyptic fiction at all, watch it."

","Danny Boyle has made a name for himself over the past twenty years with movies like ""Trainspotting"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"". But ""28 Days Later"" is also worth checking out. It's not a zombie movie in the general sense. Rather it's a look at what could happen to society if every person were allowed to unleash his/her deepest, darkest emotions. In this case, a rage-causing virus decimates the UK's population, leaving only a few people alive. While there is a lot of gore, the emphasis remains on the characters. Probably the thing that makes the movie especially unique is what we eventually find out about the troops.<br/><br/>Boyle said that he took some inspiration from ""Day of the Triffids"". Watching the movie I could see the similarity. I also got the feeling that ""Contagion"" and ""World War Z"" took some inspiration from this movie. Most importantly, this is one movie that you have to see. I have a feeling that if a virus wiped out most of the population leaving only a few people, those few people would REALLY have to hustle to figure out how to survive.<br/><br/>I recommend it."

I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it's duration. Being a fan of horror movies, this is a big deal for me.<br/><br/>2) It's realistic: Diseases on our planet mutate. This is factual. There are some that mutate from being spread by physical contact, to being spread through the air. In other cases, diseases that once could only infect one species, mutate in order to be able to infect other species'. This happens on our planet. The writers of this movie dare to ask the question, ""what happens if a truly terrible disease, like mad cow disease for example, jumps to the human species?"" Don't worry, this is not a spoiler. <br/><br/>3) This movie will make you feel every type of emotion possible. You'll laugh during this film, cheer during this film, and cry during this film. It's not just a horror movie, it's a romantic comedy at times, an action flick at times, and even an adventure / road trip feel at times. I'm not familiar with many movies like this one. Which leads to my final point.... <br/><br/>4) It's a unique film. Is it scary? Yes, uniquely though. Would you compare this film to many others? No, I definitely would not. It's in a league of it's own, and I CAN'T STAND when people call this a zombie film. <br/><br/>If you're not a fan of horror, I'd still give this one a shot. It's fantastic.

I just think it's brilliant: it's got a great plot with a decent twist, enough jumpy moments and good-quality make-up and effects to make it genuinely scary, action packed but also builds up the characters well enough so that you care about their survival, plus it's got a great soundtrack.

It is similar to the David Cronenberg film Rabid, with references to the rapture. Activists break into an animal testing lab to free the chimpanzees. A lab assistant pleads that the chimps are infested with a deadly virus through blood called Rage. 28 days later a man awakens in the hospital and learns that everyone is infested and pursues him with animalistic hunger. He is aided by a black female who swings a nasty machete, and another male. They are soon joined by a father and son duo. Detailed screenplay until the third act where it turns to guck with human forces battling each other as well as the zombies. It also doesn't help when the ending gives off a sort of happy-go-lucky feel. Story gives no answer to the virus, but it is director Danny Boyle's best film since Trainspotting. Cillian Murphy pulls through as a survivor who awakens to the nightmare. Naomie Harris plays his female companion who ends up the victim of male sexual violence. Christopher Ecceston plays a corrupt military person with sadistic plans. Megan Burns plays another survivor. It regards mankind and destruction with little hope for reparation. Score: 8 / 10"

Can we just mention music?<br/><br/>John Murphy's In the house - in a heartbeat is just a perfect music for the climax of this movie, and the usage of Godspeed Black Emperor!'s East Hastings, although shortened and including only one part, is haunting whilst the main character Jim walks the abandoned streets of London.<br/><br/>The whole movie was shot on DV (using Canon XL1 cameras), and it gave off the feeling of everything being more realistic, grittier, and after all, more believable. <br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you are not too fond of the horror genre. This is much more than that. It has elements of drama, post-apocalyptic movies, etc.<br/><br/>It is followed by the graphic novel 28 Days Later: The Aftermath which sets its story between this movie and its sequel 28 Weeks Later. Although not bad either, that movie is nowhere as great as the original, mostly due to the overuse of the shaky-cam and some unexplained things about the Infected, mostly regarding a character who had some memory preserved even after his infection.<br/><br/>28 Days Later gets 10/10 from me."

","28 days later isn't like any other zombie movie where all it is are zombies being shot with blood and guts going everywhere. Instead it's more about the things that make people happy even though it is a dark world. The infected was what made the characters develop during the film which was why it was better than many other zombie movies.<br/><br/>The movie starts off quite slow but towards the end, you know that this is how people should be making zombie movies. The acting was great, the action was enjoyable and the music connected well to the scenes.<br/><br/>The only things I felt were wrong was the fact that the quality was so bad, it was like the whole film was blurry. Another thing that annoyed me was sometimes there were camera angles where you couldn't quite see what was going on.<br/><br/>But other than that, I guess you can say that this is an enjoyable post apocalyptic film that was fun to watch."

","It's pretty much taken for granted that '28 Days Later' is a seminal British horror film. And it is. It helped revitalise the 'zombie genre' by making the undead into more than just - George Romero-style - 'shufflers.' It also started a trend in 'disaster movies' showing well-known locations (in this case London) eerily deserted.<br/><br/>Everyman, Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a disease has spread through Britain turning everyone into zombies (or the 'infected' if we're being technical, as they're still alive). Now he must look for survivors and stay one step ahead of the psychotic enemy.<br/><br/>You'll find not many people will say anything too negative about 28 Days Later. It's actually pretty good from beginning to end. However, there is a distinct change of tone midway through the film that does seem to grate on even the most die-hard of fans. It's like two horror films stuck together. The second could be completely independent to the first.<br/><br/>However, both halves have their merits. The first half is creepy and sets the tone for a different type of ending that what's to come. The second half is more action-orientated and the infected (of which have been the bad guys during the first half) seem to take a back seat to human adversaries.<br/><br/>But no matter how much the change annoys you, the acting is still fine, the sets terrifically creepy, the characters charming enough for us to care about their fates and the direction - naturally - slick, courtesy of Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a British classic horror that has spawned numerous inferior imitations. If you like your horror gritty, then this one is for you."
"hoxjennifer","7","0","1","16 November 2014"," Interesting take on the zombie genre
","The re-invigoration of zombie horror in pop culture within the last decade can probably be attributed, in large part, to this movie. ""28 Days Later"" is not just blood and gore (although they do a good job of it), but it is a reflection on human society as a whole. <br/><br/>The beginning is a bit slow-paced and slightly difficult to comprehend, but by the middle-end of the film, there is tons of fast-paced action. For those that like to ponder and analyze films, there are some interesting quotes in this movie:<br/><br/>1) Major Henry West: ""This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people. Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection, and the four weeks before that, and before that, and as far back as I care to remember. People killing people. Which to my mind, puts us in a state of normality right now.""<br/><br/>2) Selena: "" All the death. All the sh**. It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because... Well, she's got a Dad and he's got his daughter. So, I was wrong when I said that staying alive is as good as it gets.""<br/><br/>If you look past the seemingly pointless killing and blood-lust in this movie, there is a really deep side to this movie that tells us a lot about the good and bad sides of humanity. Just taking a closer look at Cillian Murphy's character, Jim, can exemplify this point. By the end of the film, we see his fight for survival and the protection of those close to him by giving into his own inherent violence. Similarly, Salena, whose only concern is for her own survival develops attachments to those around her and slowly starts to stop putting herself first. <br/><br/>Excellent film - I would give it a higher rating than 7, but the slow beginning did throw me off a little bit. And, maybe because I'm watching in 2014, it's really not as scary as it's made out to be - but it does make you think."

","First and foremost, if you haven't seen this movie - Go see it! Now! If you're a fan of horror movies in general, you can't complete the genre without it.<br/><br/>Regardless of how good any single horror movie was before 28 Days Later, they all seemed to steer in a few major directions; in that they either aimed at creating the best jump-scares, the most realistic violence/gore, creepy bad guys, or cringing suspense. At the end of the day, you could look back and say, ""Thank God it's just a movie."" They were all caught up on creating a surreal scenario that was then brought as close to reality as they could get. Primarily, every movie had a key person/place/thing that, once on screen, you knew it was time to be scared, and in between scenes you could take a breath. <br/><br/>28 Days Later goes in the opposite direction; throwing the notion of any key person/place/thing to be scared of out the window, and instead creates a living atmosphere to the entire movie that keeps you tight-fisted the entire way through.<br/><br/>The greatest thing is that instead of trying to be preachy, or pulling at you emotionally through character development, it's the empty scenery, the sometimes purposeful lack of music or sound effects, the lack of relief, the lack of heroes, the silence, and the unknown that create more eeriness and emotional helplessness than any amount of blood, gore, terror, killers, or zombies ever could on their own.<br/><br/>No matter what horror movie left the most memorable impression on you before, this movie will add a new category to those impressions that have you looking at horror movies from a different perspective.<br/><br/>However, the reason for giving it an 8 out of 10 over a perfect score is that although the movie begins insanely strong, and stays there throughout nearly the entire movie, there are some seriously out of place detached plot/scene/character/pacing changes that happen between the last 1/4th of the movie and the near-end (although it does get back on track before the actual ending). It's not enough detachment to undo the impact of everything else in the movie, but gives you that sense of ""bleh, please tell me it won't be like this for the rest of the movie"" (if that makes sense to you).<br/><br/>Those who may not be fans of the horror genre, or are interested in this movie simply because ""yay it's a zombie movie"", you *must* reset your expectations before seeing this. That does not mean this movie will disappoint you at all! It simply means it can not be forcefully lumped into either of those categories, and will give you a new perspective on what you thought a zombie horror movie could be.<br/><br/>If you're still on the fence about seeing this, and you've read this far, then stop reading reviews and go watch it !"
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","14 October 2014"," The Dawn Of A New Era Of Zombie Horror
","Signifying the dawn of a new era of post-apocalyptic horror, Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later... is the biggest leap zombie horror has taken ever since George A. Romero established the sub-genre in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead. The film discards the now outdated concept of reanimated corpses & replaces it with a contemporary idea of a viral epidemic, thus changing the supernatural phenomenon into a psychological one.<br/><br/>The film opens with a prologue that teases with the origin of a highly contagious virus which amplifies the rage behaviour in infected humans, thus turning them into aggressive, zombie-like beings. The story concerns Jim who wakes up in an abandoned hospital 28 days after the disease outbreak only to find the entire city of London completely deserted. The story focuses on the struggle of Jim & few other survivors who try to cope with this unexpected turn of events.<br/><br/>Directed by Danny Boyle, the film is as enjoyable & entertaining as it is inventive in reimagining the entire notion of the living dead. The concept takes a more realistic approach than before, adds several upgrades to the zombies' characteristics & many of the sequences depicted in the film serve as an allegory to various current events happening around the world. Screenplay lacks a certain level of depth yet it manages to work well for the most part.<br/><br/>Cinematography makes excellent use of digital photography with many sequences having the appearance of being shot on a camcorder, whose grainy resolution adds a grisly tone to the whole picture. Editing skilfully trims & rearranges the different angles into one chaotic shot throughout its runtime and never lets the viewers settle down. And John Murphy's score covers a wide range but the best track is saved for & plays a key role in its perfectly executed climax.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, the film features an unusual cast in Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson & Megan Burns but it's their balanced performances and wonderful chemistry with each other which adds little warmth to a rather gloomy feature. Also, the decision to make the zombies run faster rather than limp all the way turns out to be a masterstroke as it makes them all the more frightening than ever before.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 28 Days Later infuses new life into the genre that was slowly heading towards the grave, and presents Danny Boyle at the top of his game. It begins a new era of zombie films & its influence can already be felt in many flicks of its genre that followed it. Violent, chaotic & unsettling yet beautiful, amusing & entertaining, 28 Days Later is one flick no horror fanatic should miss out. Thoroughly recommended."

","28 DAY LATER I love zombie movies and this one definitely met with my approval. Cillian Murphy wakes up in an empty hospital after suffering an auto accident. I know you've seen these types of scenes before in movie where the main character wakes up in a desolate world and you need to find out what happened when they were unconscious. It's sad and creepy and chilling. The TV show Walking Dead, I am sure borrowed from this movie and that's OK. They are both still well written and very entertaining. This disease called Rage gets lose after a monkey attacks some scientists and desolates the world population pretty quickly. It takes place in England, but you assume it's the whole world that's effected. It revolves around four people who come together to find sanctuary somewhere from the walking, or in this case sprinting dead. These aren't your Night of the Living dead slow type zombies. They are fast, violent, strong and very destructive. It only takes a drop of blood in your eye to get it. That's how contagious it is. Of course, as in most zombie movies, you find out the real enemy is us. Unlike the dead, we are self-aware and still capable of horrible things. I know the zombie genre can be limited in what they can do and this one is no exception. It has to borrow from a lot of other stuff too, but I still recommend it."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","8 July 2014"," A modern horror classic
","Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" arrived at a time when zombies in film and TV weren't nearly as popular as they are today. The movie reinvigorated the zombie sub-genre through its unique spin on the creatures that departed from traditional representations.<br/><br/>Here, the 'zombies' (who are never referred to as such in the film) are human beings infected with a virus that turns them into mindless, raging brutes. Thus, they represent a significant deviation from the shambling monstrosities popularized by George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"".<br/><br/>The movie is set in England and takes place 28 days after the introduction of the virus into the population. At that time the country has mostly been evacuated, which leads to an eerie sense of desolation in the early stages of the film. This effectively sets the stage for the chaos to come. From there, the movie mostly steers clear of cliché horror devices and makes good use of an intelligent script.<br/><br/>The cast is a well assembled unit headed by Cillian Murphy. Brendan Gleeson makes a memorable appearance in support, as does Christopher Eccleston. Naomie Harris also proves capable in the lead female role.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's direction is as appealing as always but the use of digital cameras resulted in a not especially attractive look, mainly due to the lower resolution in comparison to film. Meanwhile, the movie's score and soundtrack, while effective, are rarely as memorable as in other Boyle efforts.<br/><br/>Overall, ""28 Days Later"" is an effective horror movie with considerable artistic flair. I don't think that it's flawless but it's definitely worth watching regardless of your affinity for the genre (particularly if you're an admirer of Danny Boyle's work)."
"ScottAmundsen","10","0","3","19 February 2014"," Truly Frightening Twist on the Zombie Genre
","28 DAYS LATER... is a magnificent example of what talent, imagination, and technical skill can do on a minuscule budget. Filmed for only about eight million dollars in an era when most movies' budgets are in the hundreds of millions, director Danny Boyle and company have managed to give us one of the most truly frightening entries in the zombie genre, with a terrific script and the usual cast of English actors who always seem to me to have an edge on American talent; the people in this small, almost intimate horror film are individuals with distinct personalities, not the stereotypes one often finds in horror movies.<br/><br/>The story, it has to be admitted, makes up in power and energy what it lacks in originality; Boyle and his screenwriter Alex Garland acknowledge debts to all the DEAD films of George Romero, Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND (also filmed as THE OMEGA MAN), John Wyndham's THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, and other worthy entries in the annals of the zombie film. But it must be said that the genre is a narrow one and similarities are inevitable.<br/><br/>Having acknowledged this, 28 DAYS LATER... is not quite your typical zombie film; the zombie motif has here been crossed with OUTBREAK and THE STAND. The movie opens with a group of very passionate but VERY misguided animal rights activists raiding a research lab and releasing a bunch of chimpanzees, despite the desperate pleas of the lab personnel that the chimps are infected with a virus that causes uncontrollable rage and that is highly infectious. Naturally enough, their self- righteousness renders the activists deaf to the scientists' pleas and they open the cages, and in very short order total chaos ensues and every person in the lab is dead.<br/><br/>Fast forward four weeks. In a hospital, a young man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma to discover that the London he remembers is no more. The city is still there, but the people are...just...gone. He wanders around calling out, and he grows increasingly desperate until he finally locates a couple of survivors: Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley. Selena, a tough, cynical survivalist, soon gives Jim a brutal lesson with regard to the Infection: once an individual is infected, you have twenty seconds before (s)he becomes a raging, ravening maniac bent on killing. And it isn't long before it happens to Mark and Selena, seeing it before Jim has even a clue, hacks Mark to pieces with a machete. She then informs Jim that she'll do the same to him if necessary.<br/><br/>They move on, picking up a couple of other survivors on the way, until they hear a call on the radio from a quasi-military base near Manchester. The rest of the film chronicles their journey to this ""blockade"" and what happens to them when they get there. Some of the very last part of the film, at the ""military base,"" is annoyingly predictable; at least I found myself doing a bit of eye-rolling, but in the end it takes away almost nothing; the tension remains high even when some of what is happening on screen gives the viewer a touch of déjà vu.<br/><br/>All told, this is one of the most exciting horror movies I have seen in a very long time. The director and screenwriter have taken what is an old horror meme and presented it with fresh eyes, literally: most of the movie was shot with a Canon high-speed video camera and the result is sometimes a jerky, almost stop-motion effect, only much quicker, that adds to what is already very unsettling stuff. And they are aided and abetted by a great cast that never allows all the ""horror movie stuff"" going on to rob them of their humanity, even when they are forced to do and witness the unspeakable.<br/><br/>I loved every bone-chilling minute of this one; it may well be the scariest thing I've seen since THE EXORCIST."

Why do film schools still teach the importance of including such artificial conflict like this - MEH. A good zombie film shows people trying to work together and still not pulling it off, now that's scary. Walking Dead has the same flaw, good otherwise. The scenes from the start are good - of the guy waking up alone in a hospital, a deserted city, a couple desperate normals now transformed by necessity into capable zombie killers, fighting for their lives.

When they break the monkeys out the monkeys attack them and when one of them escapes the virus is on the loose and it's only a matter of time before it engulfs England and then the rest of the world presumably. <br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is great as the film's hero who wakes up in a hospital (seeing this made me realize either it copied the Walking Dead comics (haven't read it so don't know for sure) or Walking Dead the TV show took the idea from 28 Days Later. It's great though and the director does a fantastic job building tension.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much but it's a very engrossing movie and I think fans of any kind of ""scary"" or psychological movie will enjoy it a lot.

","Garland and Boyle created a wonderful post apocalyptic world filled with living, rage filled, homicidal zombies.<br/><br/>*I doubt this message actually contains spoilers but better safe than sorry.<br/><br/>Those who claim they couldn't be zombies might do well to acquaint themselves with a fairly extensive collection of films that predate even Night of The Living Dead in which the word zombie is frequently used in the titles. In the lexicon of common terminology there are TV zombies, internet zombies, texting zombies, smart phone zombies etc. They all fit a broad definition of people that have lost their self awareness and aren't using their brains- to one degree or another. In 28 Days Later the victims of the virus are not acting rationally, but rather have been reduced to an animal-like furious mental state which causes them to seek out and destroy/infect those that are different. The George Romero style undead type of zombie and the ones in 28 Days Later are in more ways similar than not. Having written several novels involving zombies, both undead and living insane ones, I feel arguing about what constitutes a 'true' zombie is a pointless thing until we someday find them roaming the streets outside our homes. In Valley of Death Zombie Trailer Park, a fairly well received FREE novel, there are actually both types mentioned above. A virus creates the maddened furious living zombies which when killed reanimate as the undead variety. 28 Days Later was a very good zombie film, but had the killed infected then reanimated and continued their antisocial behavior it probably would have been the best."

","I was never a zombie or horror film fan when this movie came out, but then I got hooked on ""The Walking Dead"". If I would have seen this film before TWD, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more and found it scarier than I did. A lot of quiet roaming around and very few zombies actually appear in the film (though I guess technically they're not zombies, just Rage-infected humans). Much like we learned in season 2 of TWD, other survivors became the worst threat in a post-apocalyptic world (again, would've been more intrigued by that twist had I not already seen TWD). Cinematically, the overall look of the film appears older than it is, maybe because I'm spoiled on hi-def nowadays. Interesting bonus feature: every alternate ending has Jim dying from the post-climactic gunshot wound - only in the true theatrical release does he survive.

","I'm not gonna lie. This movie doesn't really get on its feet until Brendan Gleeson makes in appearance. Before this moment, there's an unnecessary expository prologue and then Cillian Murphy wakes up in a hospital (apparently zombies are like T-Rexes: they can't see you if you don't move)... and once he's up and walking the streets of London, he acts mostly like an idiot, guzzling a Pepsi in one clean gulp, and reading the most awesome Headline ever before tossing the paper away without bothering to read the story (in a similar situation, I would have read every piece of news I could get my hands on).<br/><br/>Zombie movies are never scary and since Romero seemed to set in stone the idea that they must be allegories of our baser natures, every one has managed to try to say something about us through this motif (well, every GOOD zombie movie). I sound cynical about this one, but only the first quarter of it disappointed. Once it becomes interested in the characters and stops trying so hard to be a ""post-apocalyptic zombie film"" it really begins upping the game. People stop taking turns acting like idiotic pricks and start caring about each other and suddenly we have a movie worth watching on our hands. Does that make it less stupid in places? Nawp. Does it make it any less entertaining? Oh, absolutely not. There's enough action porn, suspense, and semi-plausible developments to keep most everyone tossing their popcorn; and isn't that the main reason horror movies exist?"

Suddenly, even more begin to attack him and he is rescued in the nick of time by ""Mark"" (Noah Huntley) and ""Selena"" (Naomi Harris). Taking him to a safe haven they explain the viral epidemic which has taken over Great Britain and left the three of them terribly out-numbered. At any rate, rather than giving all of the details to this movie, I will just say that this is a first rate zombie film. Both Noah Huntley and Naomi Harris do an outstanding job as does the director, Danny Boyle. Now, I fully understand that there are a couple of differences with these zombies which contrast with the more traditional view. For starters, these zombies don't stumble along like ""normal"" zombies. They run. Very fast. They also don't seem to need the mandatory ""headshot"" that ""normal"" zombies require. Claymore mines and machine guns seem to do the trick quite nicely. Likewise, while they attack humans, I didn't see them feasting on human flesh so much. But that may have been understood and therefore considered unnecessary to show. Additionally, their ability to infect humans is much faster than usual. Sometimes as quickly as 10 seconds. So in that respect there isn't much response time or waiting around. Still, all things considered I really liked this movie and I think most zombie fans will too."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","17 November 2012"," New style of zombie horror
","In many ways this film lead the way for the new age of zombie horror. It's a film that takes its setting seriously and treats it with dignity and forethought. No longer are we supposed to fear zombies that shuffle ridiculously slowly through open fields where we can see them coming miles away. These zombies are vicious, fast and absolutely brutal in their search for human flesh. This idea had been seen before, but this film helped to popularize it and nowadays it's pretty much the norm for zombie flicks, which is great in my opinion as it increases the horror and makes the film more exciting, because you know that in physical confrontation with these zombies you'd almost surely lose.<br/><br/>I also liked how they treat the human aspects of a zombie apocalypse. This was one of the first films of its kind where the true horror didn't come from the undead or the infected, as they are called, but rather from the other survivors. The zombies are a plague, a force of nature, in that they're utterly predictable and unable to reason or to be reasoned with. They're scary and to be avoided, but they're not malignant in a true sense of the word. Rather they're just driven by their instincts. Humans, on the other hand, are capable of true malignancy. They're capable of making the right choice, but they often get distracted by their urges and will make wrong decisions, quite often believing that they're justified in their behaviour. And that's what makes this film truly terrifying: watching as the last vestiges of civilizations bend, crack and crumble under impossible odds.<br/><br/>So the basic story is good, it's very good. I also liked the main actors, who all felt like wholesome characters with their own motivations and urges. They also managed to grew and flourish throughout the story and none of them ended the story as the same as they had started, which is always a good sign. On the other hand, the antagonists felt rather hollow. They didn't grow all that much and we didn't learn anything worthwhile about them. They were just there to provide suspension and threat.<br/><br/>The visual style of this film is something that divides opinions. It's rather bleak and other-worldly, with strong vibrant colours clashing with shades of brown, grey and black. It looks dirty and unpleasant, which fits the tone of the story, but is still somewhat hard to look at for prolonged periods of time. I didn't particularly care for it - except for few particular scenes - but I get its purpose. They way the film is shot also manages to save a lot. Lots of weird camera angles and clever settings make the film interesting to follow.<br/><br/>In the end this is a zombie film that every fan of the genre should see. It's not the greatest in its genre by a long shot, but it has good character, suitably brutal action scenes and few storytelling tricks that have since become extremely popular, largely thanks to this film."

","28 Days Later (2002) has firmly secured its position as one of the greatest zombie films ever made. The film made it début back when the zombie franchise was at the height of its popularity, and rode the roller coaster of success. It's a superbly made film, and well deserving of its title as a modern classic.<br/><br/>The film's protagonist, 'Jim' (Cillian Murphy), wakes up in an abandoned hospital with no knowledge of recent events. When examining the streets of London, Jim discovers that the city has been completely abandoned, or so it seems. Jim is soon attacked by people infected with 'the rage virus', a highly contagious disease that forces its host to go on a rage induced killing spree. Now, in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, Jim must work with other survivors in order to stay alive.<br/><br/>What made 28 Days Later stand out from other zombie films was that it gave a scientific explanation for the zombie apocalypse. Most films, up until that point, had a supernatural explanation, or avoided an explanation all together. While earlier zombie films played on audience's fear of the supernatural and the unknown, 28 days later, plays on a more modern fear, the fear of disease. This modernising gives the film a sense of believability, while also making it more frightening than films before it.<br/><br/>The zombies are more modernised themselves. These aren't the stereotypical zombies of past films, pale creatures who slowly stumble towards their prey. These zombies are fast, deadly and have the physical endurance that would rival an athletic sprinter. The virus is carried in the victim's blood, and if even a drop comes in close enough contact with you, then you have less than a minute until you become one of the 'infected'. The very idea of how vulnerable you are too infection is in itself a real life fear. This plays on the audience, making the film far more terrifying. Disease is the one enemy that you can't fight with conventional weapons.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job in this film, showcasing their characters and being very convincing in their roles.<br/><br/>If you were expecting a movie where a bunch of survivors take charge with guns and start cutting down hoards of the infected, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. You never even see a gun being fired until the last quarter of the film, and even then it's by members of the Army. 28 Days Later is more than your standard action flick, creating atmosphere and suspense through the use of timing, visuals and soundtrack. There's an uneasy quality about the whole film, making it great at what it's trying to do. There are a lot of shots in the film that have no music in them at all, giving an unnerving quality to scenes that were already unnerving to begin with.<br/><br/>The film also makes use of 'shaky shots', particularly during suspenseful action scenes and when showing close-ups of the infected. This gives a sense of instability, like the audience is running alongside the characters, especially when the shots are taken at eye level. This technique also makes it difficult to get a good, proper look at the infected, giving a slight mystery to their full appearance. It also reflects the nature of the infected, as they have a tendency to twitch uncontrollably.<br/><br/>There are few zombie films that can reach this standard of quality and horror. It has a lot of strengths and not many weaknesses. If you're a fan of zombie films or a fan of the horror genre in general, you need to see this movie!"

","Adapting zombie horror to modern times by completely turning zombie monster movie establishments and rules on their rotting heads. Zombies are now fast as cheetahs, and even more terrifying predators than they were before. Giving the decomposing corpse of the idea of zombies a modern horror style make-over. A 21st century atmosphere rich with decay and disease supports the spin-tingling currents of fear and suspense running through this flick, and it all comes together by displaying true and beautiful humanity through superbly acted characters that you can generally care for. This does so much more than properly modernizing one of the most classic of horror monsters, and goes as far as to place them in a movie that has better gore and action than anything like Resident Evil, but uses them as something more than just shooting material in mindless modern action/horror such as Resident Evil, and contains what those movies do not, integrity and vision within the confides of modern horror cinema. Something that has been long missed and is much needed now more than ever, and 28 Days Later has it while still beating out its relatives (that are only concerned with thrills) at their own game. If you're looking for intelligent horror, or even if you're a zombie-like moviegoer craving only action and blood and guts, rejoice! Because this movie has enough brains to go around for everyone, for all reasons and uses."

","28 Days Later is probably one of the best horror movies of all time. The characters were realistic people I cared for, and I was actually worried for them - at certain points, I really thought something terrible could happen to them. Cillian Murphy (Jim), Christopher Eccleston (Major Henry West), Naomie Harris (Selena) and the rest all give amazing performances, really showing how well they can all act. Probably one of the best parts of the entire film though is the soundtrack. The main theme (I think it's called ""In a Heartbeat"", but I'm not sure) is brilliant, and whoever composed that music is a genius. I'm not an expert on films (or anything, really) but this is definitely something worth watching, if you haven't already."

","Yeah zombie movies has been done many times. But what makes this movie stand out is the atmosphere, the way it's directed and the feeling of being alone during the chaos. As the movie progresses you don't know what is going to happen next. This isn't just a zombie movie well it is, but it also has a bit of humanity in it as well. The origin of the zombie virus is irritating to watch but is also a plus in a way as well. This is also probably the first movie I seen with Cillian Murphy and the guy is a very good actor. And the way he portrays a character that is alone and doesn't know what is going on is very believable. So the premise is after the spread of a virus that turns people into zombies, Jim played by Cillian Murphy is alone and doesn't know what is going on in a abandoned London. But is in for a whole lot of zombie chaos and something more. Also what makes this movie more frightening is how turning into a zombie isn't a slow process in this, you turn from 10 to 20 seconds. The directing is done in a way that is grimy and gritty, which works for a movie like this.<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","3 February 2012"," Not truly a horror film, but pretty decent in any case
","When I first heard about this film I completely wrote it off believing that it was a sequel to a Sandra Bullock movies that I simply was not interested in (that being 28 days). However, others told me that this simply was not the case, and was in fact a science-fiction horror film, so when I finally got to watch it for the first time round I repented of the fact that I had so pre-judged this film.<br/><br/>Basically this is a zombie film, though the term zombie, or living dead, is never used (in the same way that the term vampire is never used in I Am Legend, which indicates very good writing), rather they are termed as The Infected. The movie opens in a lab were some animal rights activists release a chimp, but the chimp is infected with the Rage virus, and when one of the activists is bitten, it sets off a chain reaction. More on the background to the Rage virus and the actions of the activists can be found in the graphic novel 28 Days The Aftermath.<br/><br/>28 days later Jim (Cilliam Murphy) wakes up in a hospital and discovers that London is completely deserted. Has he wonders around he encounters a couple of the infected (in the form of a priest) and kills him. Then he stumbles across a couple of survivors, and after hearing a radio message, travel to Manchester to attempt to find safety. Basically civilisation as far as we know it has completely collapsed and everybody is dead.<br/><br/>The main part of the film deals with the interactions with the remains of the army battalion whole up in a manor house outside of Manchester. In a way, the infected simply play a bit role in the film. We know that they are there, and we even encounter them, but they are not the major antagonist in the film, the remnants of the army are. As Major West (Christopher Eccleston) says, by themselves the men have no hope, but with women around, there is hope because they can repopulate the land. This is when things get desperate, as Jim must then outwit trained military personal (no mean feat in itself) and then rescue his two female travelling companions.<br/><br/>The film apparently has up to 8 endings, most of them resulting in Jim dying. It was suggested that Fox did not like an ending where Jim simply did not die, or it was too inconclusive, so the current ending, where all three of them are waving down the Finnish airforce jet was the one chosen. In the end, it was believed that this film was so bleak, that it had to have some sort of satisfying ending."

","Don't be fooled by my 7/10 rating because this movie does a great job but remember it is still a zombie movie. Zombie movies are.. zombie movies so basically you have to do something with the zombie to make it different from the other movies and that's what this movie does in some ways. It makes a heart pounding zombie movie that will make you sit up in your chair a little. By the way, I love how this movie starts. UK did a great job with this one and pretty much owns it. Even the sequel was good. This is worth a watch if you're into zombie movie but I'm sure if you are into them then you've seen this before and you're just going around randomly reading reviews on IMDb. More power to you. The special effects here are OUTSTANDING for a nonhollywood type of movie. Little wonder why fans are so crazy about this movie."
"LgmK","8","0","1","13 November 2011"," Worth it
","First of all, one of the things I loved about this film is that it's not a zombie film. Yes, indeed. It's not about people who get bitten, die and somehow, without any explanation, come back to life. They are infected with a blood virus, which contains rage. I also love another thing about this movie, the fact that it shows you that there are worse things to fear than your own death. Like the death of your loved ones, family. This was shown with Frank's death, which I think was masterfully done, one of the best, most touching death scenes ever. The last part of the movie where everyone is basically killed, except for the three main characters was a bit abrupt, in my opinion. Still a great movie, with meaning. It also contains some of my favorite actors, like Brendan Gleeson, Cillian Murphy and Christopher Eccleston. Watch it, it's not a clichéd horror zombie flick, it's a well written drama."
"geminiredblue","9","0","1","26 October 2011"," It's All The Rage!!!
","I have been a fan of Danny Boyle's work for a number of years now. He always finds a way of merging intuitive camera-work with a compelling story. When I learned he made a zombie movie, how could I turn it down? At first, when I started watching 28 DAYS LATER, I thought it was going to be one more standard-issue zombie film. But right after the chilling opening scene, I was joyously thrilled and confounded by his new breed of zombies. Though not entirely original, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD beat Boyle to it some 15 years earlier, his movie definitely redefined our old notion of the slow-moving, flesh-crazed, mainly-stupid zombie. Instead, we're presented with living humans infected by Rage, a rabies-like virus, that causes them to turn murderous. So onwards they come, running and howling like banshees. Actually, the zombies are kept to a minimum as instead we witness the horror and drama unfold as a handful of non-infected persons learn to survive in a post-apocalyptic London. And along the way, the film has some poignant existential messages to leave with us. To be certain, the film is chilling and uncomfortably realistic. In fact if there were some sort of real zombie epidemic, a Rage-type virus would probably be the culprit. But aside from that, look at what this film managed to do. It inspired a whole slew of fast-moving zombie movies including DAWN OF THE DEAD (the remake), REC, QUARANTINE (its American remake), BERLIN ZOMBIE (AKA: RAMMBOCK), and the upcoming WORLD WAR Z, to name a few. So please gentle viewer, if you haven't already, put this on your must-see list!!!"
"canes_31","Null","0","1","13 October 2011"," Not Your Everyday Zombie Flick
","28 Days Later is not your stereotypical zombie film. Technically speaking, it is not even a zombie movie. The zombies are not undead, but infected with a virus known as Rage. The symptoms are simple and self explanatory; infected have uncontrollable rage towards anyone who is not infected and will do anything to kill of infect them. The infected are like zombies in that they have little reasoning skills and disregard self preservation. Despite the technicalities, the concept is the same; a small group of survivors attempts to evade and survive the mass hordes.<br/><br/>The plot to the story is very similar to others of the same genre. However, the focus is quite different. The main focus is on the interaction of the people with each other rather than how the fight of the zombies. One interesting element of the film involves the characters' own personal values in a post apocalyptic world. Different values clash as some characters do anything to survive and others choose to help those in need. The plot is very character driven and causes a strong bond between the viewer and the characters. This allows fans to become truly invested in the movie.<br/><br/>The mood of the movie is also different from conventional methods. The actual zombie scenes are very limited. This makes the scenes much more dramatic. The drama builds up with every scene. It adds to the suspense since you do not see the infected as much as in other zombie movies.<br/><br/>Overall, 28 Days Later is a very well made movie. It is able to stay true to the standard zombie genre while adding its own twist in order to add depth the characters, plot, and overall suspense. However, if your type of zombie movie involves nonstop action, blood, killing, and horror, then this movie is not for you. If you prefer a movie with an in depth plot, suspense, and that challenges you as a thinker, this movie is just for you."
"elvisrivet-1","8","0","1","6 October 2011"," A Horror Movie, with style.
","28 days later is one of the best horror films I've seen a while, the plot of the film is simple but effective. The film has a slow pace to it, but it works well for the film. The movie while not scary is quite creepy in a lot of ways. The plot of the movie is about a virus that escapes from a British research facility, then 28 days later we meet our main character Jim, and well the movie just continues on from there, if I said anything else, it would spoil the movie for you.<br/><br/>The story in this film works quite well, even though it's a simple one about a virus that infects people, it still works quite well. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it did, if it didn't such a great script. The film itself is slow paced, it takes time to develop its characters, instead of just killing them before we get to know them, and this is a nice change for once. This film isn't another mindless horror film, but a smart one that dares to be different. There are a few jump scares in this film of course, but they work rather well, and they're not the stupid, typical, crap that we usually see in horror films. The true horror behind this movie is not the virus itself, but the humans in the story, the humans that haven't been affected yet. I'm not talking about our main characters, but characters we meet later on in the film, who we think we can trust, but we really can't. The characters in this film are all developed in a great way that shows that a horror film can have characters that you actually care for, and not want to die. The film has a few surprises in it, that you won't see coming, now I won't tell you what they are, because that would spoil the movie for you. There's a scene towards the third act of the film that was disturbing, it's a scene involving our main characters, who just happen to have met up with the wrong people, this scene works quite well, because you're not expecting it all, you thought you could trust these people, but in reality you never could. I have to say that this scene was the best in the film, because of the way it was directed, the way the script work, but most of all because of the actors portraying the characters, I don't think the scene would've worked nearly as well, hadn't been for the actors portraying these characters.<br/><br/>Now the acting in the film itself is actually quite good. Each of the actors, give their best performance in the film, even if they're just in the film for a few moments. I have to say though, that the best actor in the film would have to be Megan Burns, she did an amazing job with portraying her character Hannah, the performance she gave, was just such an amazing one. Now the rest of the actors all did great as well, but Megan Burns just stood out from the rest, she had that charm that the rest of the actors didn't have. But like I said, they all did well in their own way.<br/><br/>Overall I would say watch this film, even if you don't like horror movies, I think you'd enjoy this one. It's not like every other horror film; it has a different feel to it."

"PippinInOz","10","0","1","20 September 2011"," Brilliant film of many layers......
","As I've admitted before: I do like a dystopian end of the world narrative. Some films of this genre are fantastic, others dire, but this one, well.......<br/><br/>Just viewed this again for the umpteenth time after waiting a few years since the last I watched it.<br/><br/>I'll cut to the chase: if you have not seen this before and are looking for a fast, at times nerve wracking experience complete with believable lead protagonists, then give it a go. <br/><br/>Okay, as the message says SPOILERS ALERT.<br/><br/>Cutting to the Chase: This film never ever lets up. However, rather than the unwatchable smash bang wallop of films like 2012 (yes, I detested this) this is how it is done. Each scene links on to yet more fear and horror, all the time introducing little facets of the major characters' personalities and just how they are transforming themselves in a bid to survive a world where most of the population are 'infected' with rage. I have always thought that what makes particular horror / dystopian stories WORK is our investment in the people trying to survive. The more realistic they are, the more we engage with them. The 'infected' move like lightning, adding to the fear and loathing that permeates this film. The editing is effective and you feel, with the characters, that you are on edge, looking over your shoulder<br/><br/>Jim: 'Everyman' - one of the most effective - and affecting - decisions of the film makers here, is to make their lead character so unlike a gung ho hero in waiting. Jim is sensitive, scared and at a loss. It is no mere coincidence that the very first shots of the film reveal a monkey pinned down by scientists on a bed, the first time we see Jim, the shot is mirrored. As we see Jim 'pinned' down with the wires and paraphernalia of the modern hospital intensive care unit. I feel the audience is positioned with Jim, he is 'us' if you like. His journey and transformation sees him change (like the monkey on the hospital bed) from sensitive, scared man to a man infected by RAGE - he doesn't catch the disease of the blood, but his actions towards the end when he 'rescues' the two women (Selena and the young girl) see him behaving in an almost identical way to the infected. The knowing look from the infected black army fella, who has been kept tied up 'to be watched' when Jim sets him free, suggests a kind of understanding. His journey from gentle bloke ('Hello? Hello?') to a man who has to kill an infected child, to a man who can dig his fingers into someone's eyes, is terrifying. <br/><br/>When he wakes up in the cottage at the end, he has already had a premonition of the place earlier in the film (blink and you'll miss it), but in the premonition the word 'Hello' says 'Hell'- so the ending is not without its disturbing echoes. The end is a mirror of the beginning. Jim waking up after being seriously hurt - and surviving. The ending is so ambiguous, while on the one hand the 'infected' are dying, that faceless helicopter, after the army guys we meet earlier in the film, suggests threat and danger as much as rescue. <br/><br/>Look, if you want to watch this as pure entertainment, you can. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a film that is layered and keeps revealing more each time you watch it, or you want a good film to write an essay on, this is your film. <br/><br/>Well worth repeat viewings, get the pause button ready. Some of the scenes are just so powerful and revealing. <br/><br/>Yes, I love this film!"

A fun, unpretentious horror movie that Danny Boyle is crafted in such an unpretentious way, that is memorable. <br/><br/>Using its low budget to its advantage, it swaps typical CGI for gritty realism, which is something that works in its favor. Well acting by Cillian Murphy, bringing more to the typical 'average- Joe', he is a character that is interesting enough to care about. It could be argued that the ending could've been better, yet 28 Days Later creates enough thrills and scares for that to be forgotten.

","First of all: this is a nice movie and I would certainly recommend it. As sort of a British version of ""I am Legend"" it surpasses it's American counterpart by far. However, the amount of product placement in this movie is worse than in all James Bond movies combined. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!

This advertisement is by no means subliminal, but I hoped the director thought: let's get it over with in the first five minutes of the film. How wrong can one be. <br/><br/>The guy, Jim, strolls out of the hospital onto the empty streets of London. It shows some beautiful images of all the famous landmarks completely deserted. The desolate feeling is intensified by a dramatic score, but when he picks up a newspaper in order to find out what has happened, we unfortunately see another can of PEPSI. <br/><br/>He has his first encounter with zombie-like creatures (called ""the infected"") and is saved by two survivors who take him to their hide-out, filled with PEPSI cans and a big PEPSI poster on the wall. They team up to check out Jim's parents' house where the female lead Selena takes a PEPSI out of the cupboard, and when Jim can't climb a stair, Selena accredits it to lack of sugar, not just handing him a PEPSI but actually naming it. And this is just thirty minutes in! <br/><br/>I understand filmmaking is a costly business, but there has to be a way of financing it without constantly showing PEPSI, Nescafe, Kellogs, The National Lottery, Heinz, Maltesers, PEPSI, Mars, PEPSI and PEPSI (just to name a few)"
"DavidSim240183","8","0","1","3 March 2011"," It's all the Rage
","Danny Boyle, after a productive stint in television, moved into feature films with the blackly funny Shallow Grave. A confident, terrifically assured crime caper, it established Boyle as an immensely promising new talent burning on the horizon. He followed this up with the grandslam of Trainspotting, a coarse, gritty insight into the surreal life of a drug addict. It was a trippy experience, and one that won it a well deserved cult audience.<br/><br/>The problem with making two impressive features in a row so early in your directing career is that you've set the bar so high for yourself. And when you make a film that doesn't scale the same heights, critics gather like jackals. And certainly since the twin hits of Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle has proved a very hit and miss director.<br/><br/>After enjoying such unbridled success, Boyle plummeted to the opposite side of the spectrum. First there was A Life Less Ordinary, which only wound up baffling audiences. And then the nadir of Boyle's career, The Beach, which was quite possibly the worst film of the year 2000. The Beach is a film that could easily have torpedoed Boyle's career. And to make sure that didn't happen, Danny Boyle would have to come up with something special for his next film.<br/><br/>28 Days Later... isn't quite the classic it seems to think it is. And its not terribly original either. But it was a definite step in the right direction for Danny Boyle. It brought back to him many of the plaudits he had lost on The Beach. And it was the big hit he had been looking for. The one that put him firmly back on the playing field.<br/><br/>Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find himself in a deserted hospital. He goes outside to an equally deserted London. It seems he's the only person left in the city. But he's not alone. While searching a local church, he barely escapes a ravenous, red-eyed mob. He gets rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark, and learns what's happened while he was out.<br/><br/>28 days ago, a group of animal rights activists tried to liberate chimps from a lab. What they didn't realise was the chimps were infected with a virus. When they contracted it, it induced in humans a state of permanent, murderous rage. It wasn't long before it swept the entire country. Only a few have managed to survive. When Mark succumbs and has to be killed, Jim and Selena team up with a father and daughter to reach Manchester, an apparent safe haven from the virus, without being killed or infected themselves.<br/><br/>28 Days Later... definitely sees Danny Boyle regain his stride. He tells a quite involving story of a man who wakes up to a world he no longer recognises. He does a fine job (particularly in the early scenes) of showing us a devastated London. The scenes with Cillian Murphy wandering the streets in almost complete silence are extremely eerie (although it is spoiled somewhat by the unnecessary soundtrack).<br/><br/>The way Danny Boyle shot these scenes is a story in itself. They had to wait until the early hours of the morning to get the proper look of a deserted London. And they could only hold up traffic for a few minutes at a time. Yet the way the camera encompasses the London landmarks, the overturned buses, trash blowing in the streets - it's all quite dazzling in its depth and clarity.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle also has a fine cast at hand. Cillian Murphy is perhaps a bit flat. By the time of Red Eye and Batman Begins, he'd polished his acting considerably. Here he's a bit introverted. He doesn't make a very convincing hero, especially in the second half when he's running around barechested with a rifle. Naomie Harris is much better. She gives a tough, determined performance that completely commands the picture. Yet she also shows signs of vulnerability, just as upset as anyone at the sad state of the world, hidden behind a cynical front.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns are equally good as father and daughter Frank and Hannah. Gleeson plays Frank as an ordinary man trying to hold together in extraordinary circumstances. When he gets infected and knows he's about to turn on his daughter, his death is tragic and very affecting. Burns (who hasn't acted since) turns her slight woodenness towards a sad acceptance of what the world has become.<br/><br/>The second half is a bit more predictable. When they get to Manchester, they fall in with a group of troops (led by an excellent Christopher Eccleston) who have lured them there with promises of a safe place, when really they need women to repropagate the species. I managed to predict that long before the characters did, although Eccleston gives a beautifully judged performance of a soldier doing what he thinks is right for a better future. Even if it isn't.<br/><br/>Aside from a plot that's a bit linear, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. The film seems unsure of itself at the climax, as if Boyle and Alex Garland weren't sure where to take it next. The ending comes with a sudden abruptness that leaves everything unresolved. And the various endings that were filmed and storyboarded only confuses the issue further. 28 Days Later... pilfers a bit from The Day of the Triffids and Day of the Dead. And while it never adds anything original to the genre, Danny Boyle's kinesis makes 28 Days Later... a fairly scary world to look on. One I'm glad we don't live in."
"vanhelsing19","9","0","1","28 January 2011"," Tense, scary and no it's NOT a zombie movie
","28 Days Later is not a zombie film, well it is sort of...OK it's not... It takes a clever twist on the traditional Romero films and instead of the dead coming back from hell (because there's no more space) instead these fellows are filled with rageThink traffic jam on a hot day and the air con is broken or you're married to Lena Headey (only to wake up and realise it was just a dream). Anyway Beautifully directed by Danny Boyle in essence it's a survivalist tale with some gruesome scenes and Lord of the Files morality. The landscape of England is a brutally scared and this disturbing setting for the film is shot gloriously with digital hand held cameras. Boyle also chooses to strip some of the colour out of some shots and enhance it in others. Indeed, the film boasts some startling imagery - most notably Jim on a deserted Westminster Bridge at rush hour, Jim wandering London's City and West End, the group driving up an empty M6 and greeted by a burning Manchester (Boyle's home town). If by that particular scene Boyle hasn't managed to drown you with a tangible sense of hopeless and bleakness you're probably already dead The story revolves around several survivors of the virus (which is passed by fluids)and their attempt to find shelter and safety in the ravaged landscape of Britain. I don't want to spoil it too much for you but the plot ticks along nicely within various vignettes along the way. The highlight is the ending with John Murphy's amazing piece of music 'In the house – in a heartbeat' which you will recognise no doubt without me even describing it to you. The final scene in the house ranks in my top 20 film scenes of all time.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy, looking disturbingly sickly and pale, plays Jim, the hero to the story. Murphy is terrific in this role because he is very believable and human – clearly there was no temptation to cast him as some action hero – in fact for most of the film just the opposite – a superb decision by Boyle. Naomie Harris plays Selena, another survivor who ends up teamed up with Jim after saving his life. Megan Burns plays the young girl and Brendan Gleeson is her father Frank; they make up the small band of survivors. Mention to should be made of Christopher Eccleston (as an army major) who appears towards the latter 1/3 and is chillingly competent.<br/><br/>Oh yes and less we forget 'the infected' which are beautifully made up and move with a grace that reminded me of how James Cameron had the Aliens move. Very different from Romeros zombies; rem these aren't Zombies? but the infected can move quickly, if a little randomly and occasionally spurt blood ala The Exorcist. It's not without a couple of minor flaws but the film is a very good British horror film – yanks might wonder 'why don't they all have guns' or 'why is there no scary build up music to tell us when something is going to happen' but that is because this is a British film and not a Hollywood one..."
"stathisvoukelatos","7","0","1","16 January 2011"," Best horror movie of the last decade
","28 Days Later is in my opinion the best horror movie of the decade.The movie begins in a clinic where scientists are doing experiments on monkeys and create a virus that can be transmitted through blood and saliva and makes the infected being extremely violent full of rage.Unfortunately some activists are releasing the monkeys and as one can imagine the virus within 28 days has been transmitted all over the United Kingdom while the only survivors in the island seem to be Jim a man who just woke up of a comma just to find out that while you see someone getting infected you have 24 seconds to kill him ""no matter if he is your brother,sister or the oldest friend"",Selena a woman that saved Jim's life,Frank and his daughter Hannah.These four people are trying to survive and get to the camp they heard about in a recorder message in the radio.After two days they make it and arrive to the camp only to find out that the infected people are by far better than the filthy,h*rny soldiers who had been promised women in order to join in the army who try to kill Jim and abuse Hannah and Selina.Jim makes it,escapes and gets revenge from the Sergeant and the soldiers.The film ends with no clear indication of what happened while Jim,Selena and Hannah have gone from the camp and are trying to make the passing by airplanes see that they are down there and save them...<br/><br/>To sum up 28 Days Later is an extraordinary film with a breathtaking rhythm,great direction,good acting and many commends towards society and government."

","An intensified version of the George Romeo zombie films which brings a stronger introduction to new and more frightening zombies. One of the decades most popular horror films, and one of the most popular films of the year.<br/><br/>We take a horrific look into Danny Boyle's vision of zombies roaming London, England 28 days after a evil raging virus outbreak. A survivor named Jim, (Cillian Murphy) as well as three other survivors fight to stay alive as they make their way to an army bunker post, seeking refuge.<br/><br/>Zombies like they have never been done before. A lot more scarier than the Romero ones, these have a lot more creepy features, not to mention they run, and are a lot more threatening. Some might argue its just a simple zombie apocalypse movie, which it sort of is. But regardless, its pretty darn scary. Not just jump out scary, but psychologically as well.<br/><br/>This is the film that created running zombies. 2 years later, the Dawn of the Dead remake will be using them. The first five minutes of the film I was already like, WTF. But by the end, I was pleased. Though I do have to say the rest of the film gets a little weird when they get picked up by the soldiers, turning to a completely different plot. But it still finds a way to keep the mood the whole movie.<br/><br/>So yeah, its not as good as Dawn of the Dead, but its definitely a worthy horror film for all the fans out there. Check it out, and get ready for a heck of a scare."

It was made with a small budget, but Boyle shows you don't always need a ton of money to make an effective film. You just need good ideas and a solid cast, which 28 Days Later has. Great score also.<br/><br/>As with Sunshine, the script weakens itself a bit by going nuts in the final act.

After an hour or so, we realized it doesn't get better...that was about it.<br/><br/>It wasn't original or clever, it wasn't smart, it wasn't artistic (unless you consider some of the gore ""art"").

From the beginning of the film, right until the closing credits, the lead characters consistently put themselves in danger by ignoring warnings, instructions and common sense, and put their lives in danger. This is not just limited to the lead characters mind you, the authorities make some horrendously bad calls and have an astonishingly lax attitude to security at crucial points in the movie, much to the viewer's frustration.<br/><br/>I recommend giving this film a miss, there are many other very similar movies that you will find much more watchable."

","The easiest thing to put immediately to one side is that Danny Boyle is a fine director, his broad range of work and varying styles is an excellent body of work.<br/><br/>So it is no surprise that visually we have a film that works. It looks more expensive than it is with a budget of around 5 million (almost equivalent to the budget given to Shaun of the dead) Boyle makes the most of it with ingenious methods for getting the shots that he wants giving the film a scope beyond its limitations.<br/><br/>In all but detail it is a zombie film. They maybe quicker and technically not dead but it is a technicality that the viewer will soon forget.<br/><br/>Credit to writer Alex Garland who takes time to explain the cause of the infection without bogging down the story in needless exposition. Also credit too that he creates realistic characters, survivors who we can relate with.<br/><br/>Yes the film falls away into convention later on with the meeting between survivors and British military (Why do British soldiers seem more unnerving?) and has a few questionable moments which could make you go ""what?!"" but you have to forgive it for these conventions."

","...not even close. The only time I even flinched was when Jim set off the car alarm by accident! Still, 28 DAYS LATER is a very enjoyable horror movie. I don't know why they call it a ""zombie"" movie. There were no zombies. They weren't ""undead""! The ""monsters"" depicted are people infected with a virus. A nasty one indeed, with rage and blood-red eyes and other yucky symptoms. <br/><br/>The playfully twisted personality of Danny Boyle is what really makes this horror film (not my favorite genre of course) work for me. I loved TRAINSPOTTING and SHALLOW GRAVE, and this film has those bits of dark humor throughout. Loved the grocery shopping scenes and the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The strong cast is another reason I enjoyed it. Each actor had a role for the viewer. I love Cillian Murphy (the soul whose confusion, fear and later, strength and resolve we all experience from the start of the film),Brendan Gleeson (the heart! more on that below) and Christopher Eccleston (the brain that ends up losing ability to reason), and I really enjoyed Naomie Harris (the brawn, relentlessly brutal when she's wielding that huge knife), who I hadn't seen before this film. The characters of a film to me are very important, and these characters, all their interactions and experiences, the family dynamic (Gleeson, in particular gives a beautiful performance as the father figure to the little cluster of survivors), make this one several cuts above the standard crappy horrors that are coming forth these days.<br/><br/>Took me a while to warm up to it, but it is actually quite the classic."

","When I first heard this about this film, I thought it was just going to be one of those zombie films where they producers don't take it seriously and it ends up being a joke. This film is not a joke. It is scary. Zombies that can run. Slow zombies allow you to take their time and you can walk around them. These zombies will already be on you before you know what happened. This movie takes zombies to a whole new direction. The plot anyway works well. It leaves some loose ends but that allows the viewer to imagine what happened like how the virus spread and such. I liked also how it showed how people would change. In conclusion this is a revolutionary film, you should see it but I wouldn't recommend it to those whop are easily frightened or dislike blood and gore."

","28 Days Later is the sci-fi horror thriller that brought zombies back to the mainstream in style. It and the Dawn of the Dead remake were mostly responsible for putting zombies back in the mind of the general movie going public, and making them actually exciting again.<br/><br/>This is a very British movie, and the style reflects that. It has a measured pace in some places, and the occasional humor is very dry. But when the action hits, it hits hard and it is frantic. It's an exciting film, to say the least.<br/><br/>There are a few recognizable faces here, but none of the actors involved were big stars at the time it was made. Which is great, because it would be a very different movie if it was just a vehicle for an actor or actress. 28 Days Later is more about the potential violence and rage in ordinary humans, than it is about the infected who have brought so much destruction to England. That's one aspect of the many that gives it appeal beyond the traditional audience of zombie flicks. Great movie."

","I recall when this first came out I kept hearing it was a zombie film and I love zombies so I watched it. I can see where people got that idea, but these were in no way zombies, just infected people wanting to attack.<br/><br/>This film is about a man who wakes up in London and the entire cities population seems to have vanished. He is confused and soon finds the city is crawling with these crazy blood thirsty killers. He finds a couple of survivors and they tell him what has happened and they go out and their only purpose is basically to survive. They later find more survivors and hear a radio transmission from soldiers telling them to come to Manchester because there is a cure there. They head out and find there is no cure, no other survivors, but only randy soldiers.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle had directed a few movies I enjoyed, Trainspotting being the one that stood out to me the most. His direction on 28 days later was some of the most beautiful cinematography and direction combined footage I have ever seen on film. His long wide angle shots and use of color was breathtaking. He used an 8mm for some flashback scenes and even those were so fitting and brilliant. The first of the movie with the boy waking up nude was a beautiful concept too. There is no better way of symbolizing being alone than being naked and bare. That scene was an homage to The Day Of The Triffods, but Danny's over the head shot showing how stripped and naked Cillian was, just gave such a nice setting and direction for the movie.Being able to get some heavy traffic areas of London shut down to shoot the scenes was wonderful, there wasn't C.G.I. and fake shots, it was real and definitely the best post apocalyptic deserted shots I have ever seen in a film before or sense. Dannys use of dark colors for the gloomy side of live and bright colors where life was to be symbolized was brilliant too. Later at the mansion the reverse of color after we find out the guards are wicked is such a nice trick too.<br/><br/>The music and score for this film was so perfect too. It set the mood so well. Acting was great by everyone. Cillian Murphy did a magnificent job especially.<br/><br/>I liked this film lots, and this was maybe my 3rd or 4th viewing and it still had the ability to keep me interested.

Even though it's a virtual retread of 1971's The Omega Man.<br/><br/>Well, whatever: 'The Beach' writer Alex Garland and Boyle's very English apocalypse still contains enough dazzling set-pieces and scary moments to hold its own with the best of them. Take that powerfully effective opening scene for example: Danny Boyle's conceit of a desolate metropolis (a nightmare for some; a wonderful dream for others), which was achieved by roping back pedestrians during early morning shoots.<br/><br/>Or that upturned, shattered double-decker bus, grimly calling to mind the events of 7 July 2005 in the capital. Above all, those speedy, rage-filled 'monsters' (in gurning, imperfect imitation of their previous humanity) perfectly compliment Boyle's own zippy cameras.

","28 Days Later is one of those movies that grabs your attention the instant it begins, and holds it with a tight vice grip until the end credits roll.<br/><br/>Just the sight of London completely deserted, and the chilling silence as the main character Jim, who is played by Cillian Murphy brilliantly, is walking through the once famous city turned ghost town, is enough to really get you thinking. For a solid three minutes, all you see is Jim walking through the city and exploring the places he has come to know, which have all been completely left behind. It may not sound like anything too special, but sitting for three minutes and watching someone walk through a deserted city with complete silence around them is pretty freaky in itself.<br/><br/>From that point on, everything unfolds at a perfect pace, and when you are introduced to the zombies of the film, which are labeled simply as ""The Infected,"" you can feel your heart pulsating in your chest, constantly alert for any moment when one of the Infected will come jumping into sight, and in many ways, it feels like you are smack in the middle of the film, staying on your toes and watching for any Infected that may come bounding recklessly towards you. And believe me, that feeling makes this film very, very fun.<br/><br/>I don't have an awful lot to say about the acting, other than it was great, particularly Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris.<br/><br/>To be honest, I think this film wasn't quite deserving of the R rating. In my opinion, it could have been one of those PG13's that pretty much walk the borderline, because pretty much the only things that got the big fat R slapped on this were the brutal and gory scenes (especially towards the end), plenty of F-bombs, and a few scenes containing brief nudity.<br/><br/>But in all honesty, who cares?

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","13 June 2009"," A zombie film with brains, not just eaten ones
","Just because it happens to be a very good movie, calling ""28 Days Later"" more than a zombie flick is inaccurate: Gore and other general zombie fare that's turned these movies into a genre are still the film's main vehicle for delivering entertainment. What it does differently, however, is make you think a bit more, make you feel a bit more. The zombies might be mindless, but director Danny Boyle's film is far from it.<br/><br/>The premise is one we've heard before: an uncontrollable outbreak of a disease turns people into raging zombies who lust for blood and violence. The location is London and the protagonist who doesn't get infected is Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up from an accident 28 days after the breakout to find London abandoned. In his quest for survival, he meets other uninfected people and together they try to find others to begin life anew.<br/><br/>The first thing worth mentioning is that if ""28 Days Later"" were just another zombie movie, it'd still be one of the best because of Boyle. The ""Trainspotting"" director's style is unique, striking and suspenseful. He gets multiple angles for many of the major scenes and edits them to fire off rapidly or slowly to give a sense that the characters are being watched. He places the camera in all kinds of intriguing places to get provocative shots and it gives the story its own special life.<br/><br/>Alex Garland's screenplay is also special. In his second time working with Boyle, Garland creates a concept that doesn't merely serve for great suspense, but acts as a social metaphor for war and violence as indicated by the opening seconds of the film. The mere concept of ""rage"" spreading quickly like a disease is quite smart. It's not allegorical or driven all the way through the film, but it's there and it makes the film more respectable and interesting. Jim is also a great protagonist, being both innocent toward the beginning but willing to take risks and he evolves into quite the hero in the film's final act. Murphy is a definite talent: a subtle one, but very good.<br/><br/>Then again, ""28 Days Later"" is also just a good suspenseful zombie movie with a very fine director who understands how to apply his style to a different genre effectively. Everything else is sort of like free dessert."

","George Romero shocked the world in 1968 with his film, Night of the Living Dead. It shocked audiences of all ages, disgusted the world, and even helped create the MPAA rating system. It is hard to watch any zombie movie without thinking about Night of the Living Dead.<br/><br/>I myself would have to say that 28 Days Later is the most influential zombie movie since Night of the Living Dead. It might be risky to say that for two reasons: It is hard to compete with a classic, and the zombies in 28 Days aren't truly ""zombies."" Let's put that argument aside.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is about an infection that almost completely wipes out England. The film follows around a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a hospital to empty England. He soon meets up with several other survivors as they try to survive in the zombie infected world.<br/><br/>After several of the survivors incidentally get wiped out by the infection, the two surviving members of the group meet up in an army base with a squad of army men. This is where the movie truly began to fall for me. It started out almost perfect, but then we had to be introduced to an entirely new location, which ruined the originality of the first two-thirds of the movie. I didn't like the army scenes and thought that they not only ripped off George Romero's 1985 film, Day of the Dead, but they dragged my interest away from the true problem.<br/><br/>Putting the final piece of the film aside, 28 Days Later has a number of suspenseful and enjoyable scenes which never fail to keep the viewer hooked. However, most of the movie felt like a build-up that ended in disappointment. <br/><br/>What the movie DOES accomplish is the fact that it has a good cast, not a GREAT cast but a good cast. It was also able to create a whole different kind of zombie film (running zombies). The zombies in 28 Days may be nothing more than infected people, but they are still zombies when it comes to how they're shot. The Dawn of the Dead remake, as well as several other 28 Days Later rip-offs have taken the idea of running zombies of off this film.<br/><br/>Another thing that 28 Days Later manages to do is to entertain, which is one of the key points in making a good movie."

","28 Days Later was such a cool movie. It was a different take on a zombie movie, in the sense that it was more explained. It had fantastic characters and actors and the plot wasn't boring. It's one of those movies that when I watch it I'm not comparing it to others- it's too good. I'm also the type of person who needs an explanation for everything, so it was nice to know why they were zombies and that they could actually starve to death. I guess I liked it because it takes place in London, which I know and don't know. The emptiness of it is great, the feeling that they are truly alone and there is such little hope when London is completely abandoned. You don't see that too much, no movie portrays this feeling of emptiness as well as 28 Days Later did. It was a do or die situation for the characters, which made it extremely a better movie.

","Let me first say that 28 Days Later is not for everyone. This film shows, right from its chilling opening sequence, that you should have a reasonably strong stomach for what is about to come. This film has a considerable amount of blood and gore. But, unlike other gory horror films, 28 Days Later isn't using the blood to power the story. Instead, this film is using it to enhance the story.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is one hell of a horror movie. Not only does it have the quintessential ingredients for a successful horror movie (intense atmosphere, nail-biting suspense, sympathetic characters etc) but it also throws in several other advantages, such as compelling direction, confident performances and a genuinely scary and clever script, which squeeze all of the terror out of even the quietest scene. From the word go, this film just doesn't let up.<br/><br/>A bicycle courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital. Upon further investigation, he discovers that the situation is the same throughout the whole city of London, and he soon discovers why. Upon being rescued from strange, rampaging people by survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), it is revealed that a deadly virus has been unleashed. How far it has spread is unknown, but a certain fact is that anyone who is infected transforms into a snarling, ravenous monster craving human blood. Upon the way to safety, the survivors encounter a father and daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns). Together, they trek across the country in an attempt to escape from an horrific fate. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the film's biggest achievement is the way in which it accomplishes the huge feat of making us believe that large cities such as London have really been deserted (well, mostly). The gritty and realistic way in which the filmmakers complete this task is both powerful and iconic, and is likely to be the thing that people remember most fondly after watching this movie.<br/><br/>As with any horror film, the force which threatens the characters should be starkly terrifying if the film is to truly make us wonder who will survive the ordeal, and 28 Days Later has a hell of a threat on display; a highly contagious and uncontrollable virus. Once someone has been infected, there is no hiding it, like if a film character was bitten by a zombie. That person has from 10 to 20 seconds before they become a blood-thirsty, rampaging monster, not quite a zombie but entirely devoid of human instincts and rationality. These guys are fast, nasty and utterly horrific.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent throughout the entire course of the film. They are given terrific material here, and all of the cast sink their teeth into it. Even the smaller characters, such as Noah Huntley's doomed survivor, are given moments of such character-defining brilliance that we immediately come to care about them and their fate.<br/><br/>As the film's lead character, Cillian Murphy carefully constructs a journey from a humane presence to hard-edged hero, whereas Naomie Harris takes the audience on the opposite journey. Both actors accomplish their separate stories with excellent humanity, vulnerability and grit. As the father and daughter in the middle of the crisis, Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns are both superb, creating a believable bond between the two characters which is at times extremely powerful. A gut-wrenching moment when Gleeson's character is struggling to say goodbye to his daughter is both incredibly poignant and grippingly urgent, and it is absolutely devastating to watch. And finally, Christopher Eccleston brings a sense of flawed yet understandable humanity to Major Henry West, a soldier whose ideas about surviving the virus are almost as sinister as the Infected themselves. Many of the actors in this film have since gone on to star in major franchises (Batman, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean etc). Based on the incredible strength of their performances here, it's not difficult to see why.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle provides terrific direction. He ensures that the thrills and chills on display rarely ever let up, and creates several harrowing highlights. Some of the prime examples are the opening scene, a tremendously gripping sequence in which the group race to change a tyre as the Infected approach and a bloody one-man stand between Jim (Murphy) and a group of men who are holding Selena (Harris) and Hannah (Burns) hostage. However, he also provides moments of superb characterisation (a disturbing moment when Jim encounters an Infected boy shows how far the character has progressed) and moments of eerie calm (an all-out shopping spree through a deserted shop is quietly chilling).<br/><br/>The production is also helped immensely by an intelligent script, which asks serious questions about the nature of human rage. Indeed, in the climactic house raid, Jim is becoming what he has been fighting to survive against, in an attempt to save others. This is a horrifying moment when the writers and Boyle are delving into the central idea of the storyline, rather than shying from it like other horror films. Also, the film offers a realistically powerful view on how different humans may react in such a horrifyingly hopeless situation, creating a smartly grim view on the proceedings. There is also some clever social commentary here. One character comments on how ironic it is to need rain so badly in England, while it is a genuine shock to see London in such a barren, deserted state.<br/><br/>Overall, 28 Days Later is a thrilling, chilling and thoughtful look at how humanity can survive in the face of great peril. I admit that the ending wasn't as strong as it could have been, but neither was it as weak as it could have been. I was thoroughly gripped by this film, and even though I am not the world's biggest horror fan, I am not willing to let that get in the way of me recognising a great film when I see one."

","The film is shot with hand-held DV-cameras (Digital Video) to make it looks like some kind of documentary film; for me, it just make it even more scarier. And kinda you can say it is a documentary, as director Boyle says, he in a way ""warn"" us. In ""Pure Rage: The Making of 28 Days Later"" scientist studied a Ebola, which the Rage Virus in the film is based on, and says that it is not impossible for virus to do as much damage as in the movie! My and my family rent the film back in 2003 when it came out. Actually I wouldn't see it at this time, but my sister's friend said that it was awesome, so she absolutely WANTED to see it too I saw it that evening Oh my God!<br/><br/>When Jim walked out the hospital and out on the empty streets with Godspeed You Black Empore's ""East Hasting"" playing in the background, my first thought was: How did they do that?! I mean, how did they shut down the streets in London? Amazing scene, one of the best made, actually. The first big chase-scene starts about 10 minutes into the film, were Jim enters the church. That scene scared me a lot first time I saw it. The chase-scene ends with a huge, cool gas-station explosion, that cost the crew £250,000 in total. The film has many other chase-scenes, like in the tower block, just before Jim and Selena meet Frank and Hannah, I think that it is a cool scene; good edited by Chris Gill. I think Danny Boyle has created a new type of film making: He uses abnormal camera-angels that I never ever have seen in a film before, he accentuate the colors and then he makes a fantastic atmosphere The film ends with a impressive climax-scene, which I mean is the best climax-scene, I've ever seen. <br/><br/>I don't just recommend this film for horror-fans but for every movie-lover, because for me, it's more than just a horror There's action, thrilling, scenes that makes you jump, there is love, it's sad 6/6 stars!"
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","1","16 April 2008"," Like Lars von Trier feeding off the corpse of George A. Romero... a subversive delight
","This is perhaps one of the most subversively topical British horror films ever made. We open with a primate tied to an operating table, forced to watch images of war, death and bloodshed unfolding before his teary eyes. As it happens, these various monkeys - caged and chained in a secret lab - are being used by government scientists to breed pure-rage. Once passed on, those infected will be blinded by rage to such an extent that they revert to the state of mindless zombies, their only concern, to destroy anything in sight. 28 Days Later... Infection has spread; full-scale evacuation has taken place. Jim awakes from a coma, naked and alone. He wanders around a deserted London city centre picking up scattered notes, filling plastic bags with free chocolate and soft drinks, whilst impotently searching for any signs of life. His only allies - and the only people seemingly unaffected - are Selena, a no-nonsense young woman who has learned the rules of survival, Frank, a cockney cab driver, and his young daughter Hannah, who Frank has been forced to raise alone following the death of his wife. Together the quartet set out for Manchester, where a rouge military unit has been broadcasting messages that promise a cure to infection.<br/><br/>Here, the topical reference points are fascinating; enriching the drama on an entirely believable level but never getting in the way of the thrills and spills that we would expect from such a genre. If you're looking to read more into it, just look at the opening scenes. It begins with monkeys - a signifier for the human race - being force-fed images of war and social evils. The images are given an unbelievable sense of potency in the wake of September 11th; as do the images of a deserted metropolis, abandoned cars, houses and money; a cinematic ground zero brimming with hate and confusion. Then we have the notion of infection; something very relevant when we think of the recent worries about Anthrax and more pertinent woes such as BSE, Foot & Mouth and the South East Asian pandemic of SARS. Then there is the use of a militant threat; the juxtaposition of uniformed evil, as the supposed protectors of piece, turning out to be the true villains of the story. However, more importantly, 28 Days Later represents a fear on the filmmaker's part of living in Blair's Britain. Admittedly, this is tapping into Romero territory somewhat, with the deeper elements of political satire at work in films like Night of the Living Dead (1968), Day of the Dead (1985) and the recent Land of the Dead (2005), but clearly the statements made here are potent, and should be understood by the film's detractors who see 28 Days Later as a simple B-movie pastiche.<br/><br/>The inclusion of current, semi-social iconography is clearly intended to give the film a more intense sense of realism, again, subverting the usual B-movie stereotypes and creating something that kind of works within the context of the low-key cinema that England is famous for. Here, director Danny Boyle manages to give the film a wonderful-contemporary style, with his cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantel using digital video in a much more traditional way to how other filmmakers employ it. Boyle resists, for the most part, shaking the camera around wildly. He composes his images, uses a steady-cam and there are also a couple of decent crane shots. He also works fantastically well at wringing tension from Alex Garland's often heavy-handed script, giving us scenes of cinematic excitement to rival Hollywood, with the standout scene being the depiction of an abandoned London. In Vanilla Sky (2001) Cameron Crowe shut down Times Square to convey Tom Cruise's metaphysical alienation. With 28 Days Later Boyle goes one further... he closes down an entire city.<br/><br/>The end of the film juxtaposes a stately country manor - the desired setting for numerous, iconic British dramas - with scenes of unbelievable violence. Some have complained about the sparseness of gore in the film, but it is my belief that the filmmakers are half struggling with depicting violence in a real, horrific way; rather than the over-the-top blood baths of the recent all-knowing slasher flicks, or the violence of the more recent gorno horror of Hostel (2005) and Saw III (2006). This goes beyond the ten little Indians method of picking off characters; here we get an emotional connection too. The final scenes are without a doubt the most visceral, with Garland and Boyle again referencing Apocalypse Now (1979) to great effect, or at least to a greater effect than their somewhat toothless attempt at it with The Beach (2000). Here we get the last hurrah; a staggering example of mood and atmosphere, as one grisly murder follows the other and the message of rage - and what it does to a human-being, infected or not - is finally revealed.<br/><br/>Cut to 28 Days Later... after this, you could argue that the dénouement falls apart, seeming far too rushed and too unfocused. Apparently the filmmakers were unclear of which of their many endings to go with, and the haste of their decision shows. Regardless, acting is sufficient, with standout performances from Christopher Eccleston as the mysterious Major Henry West and Brendan Gleeson giving a great deal of humanity as Frank, the film's surrogate father figure. Murphy does well as Jim, but on the whole the younger actors struggle to convey real emotion, coming across as far too smug and insincere. Had the script been given a little more attention this could have been a masterpiece. It doesn't quite reach that level, but it is very good, and definitely represents an exciting step forward for British genre-film-making and the so-called new horror revival. Boyle and Garland have coupled some weighty social issues to a genre that people want to see, resulting in a film that is visually stimulating and on the whole, excitingly cinematic."

","It's not often that fans of the horror genre are treated to an original twist in the genre and it is even rarer to be treated to a truly scary and well done zombie movie. However 28 Days Later attempts to do just that and succeeds quite well in both regards.<br/><br/>The story is set in England in where animal right activists break into a research facility in an attempt to free captive animals being used for medical experiments. Unbeknownst to them is the fact that these animals are carrying a highly dangerous and contagious disease known as Rage which is passed and contracted via bodily fluids and ultimately turns the infected hosts into blood thirsty zombies. 28 days after the animals are released the population of England is all but decimated by the disease and a few handful of survivors are clinging to life trying to survive the days and nights hiding from hordes of raging zombies. Our story begins when Jim, a patient in a hospital, awakens from a coma to find that the hospital and the city around him are vacant and destroyed. Jim, unaware of what has taken place over the past 28 days, sets out to discover what has become of not only his family but everyone around him. It isn't long before Jim encounters the blood thirsty monsters and his quest for answers is turned into a battle for survival. Along the way he makes contact with survivors and does his best to find his way in a terrifying new reality where anarchy and social rules are all but done away with.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie was that unlike most horror movies where the main characters have virtually no common sense and spend their time splitting up and systematically being killed off one by one, the survivors in this movie realize that it is in their best interest to stick together in order to better their chances of survival and only leave each other's sides out of necessity. The fact that a ""logical"" approach was taken towards a genre which has often seen little logic truly makes this movie frightening, as even though they attempt to make logical decisions, they still sustain losses.<br/><br/>What I also liked about this movie was the originality of the way in which the ""zombies"" originated that being via a disease/virus. This theme has since been copied many times over and with little shame in doing so.<br/><br/>The acting was good and the fact that there were no big names added to the thrill of story since one never really knew who was going to survive and who was going to die, making every scene that much more tense.<br/><br/>In the end, even if this movie never got the press it deserved and wasn't hyped to the level of other lesser movies of the same type, this remains one of the better movies in a genre sorely in need of better quality films."

","28 Days later is a brilliant horror movie.But it is much more than just a horror.It is a drama about human emotions,moral choices and the dark side of the hummanity.The director of this movie is skilled British director Danny Boyle who often films very dark movies.Movie that he made are not good for anyone,they are dark moody,gore and they show the best and the worst in human beings without an excuse.I am looking forward to watch some of his new movies.Cillian Murphy is perfectly selected for his role,He is a talented young actor and there is a great future in front of him.I watched him in Hollywood blockbuster Red Eye,and he was also great but he deserves to get a chance to star in much better movie than Red Eye.The supporting cast also did their job without any mistakes,they were all decent in their roles.I must admit that in the beginning of the movie I didn't expected such depth in this movie,also I didn't expected that this movie will be so intelligent and gory.I would not recommend this movie to people under the age of 15 because they probably would find this movie as just another gory and boring movie,but this movie is not just gory and action-packed.This movie has tension,brilliant direction,intelligent screenplay,great acting and I would recommend this movie to people who like horror movies and people who like quality masterpieces because this movie is a quality horror masterpiece and i know that this movie will become a classic in the 21st century."

","The plot: (No spoilers, just things you will see in the first 5 minutes) Animal activists get in quite a slip-up when they try to free rage infected monkeys. And the virus contained by them, known as the 'infection' quickly spreads throughout the UK, where the story takes place. The protagonist Jim wakes up in a hospital from what seems to be a comma, with no one around. Shortly, he realizes that he is the only one there. But when put to the test of life-or-death, he manages to survive with the help of others the attack of the infected.<br/><br/>Every year, the movie industry comes out with movies that makes you just think...""Why did they even make this?"". Well not 28 days later. This British 'zombie' flick has many of the needed qualities to make a good scary movie. It has good acting by the leads Cillian Murphy AKA Jim, and Naomie Harris AKA Selena. And the talents these actors contribute to the movie is definitely good thing. With distinctive personalities and relatable qualities, you really root for the characters. With an interesting plot that thickens when the main character steps into the almost un-real world of the time after the ""infection"" started. Jim keeps the story going with the curiosity of this phenomenon. And the duel antagonists counter each other yet both contribute to Jim's struggle, and keeps you wanting more. The scares are very scary, weather it's pop-out-at-you scary, or just teeth-clenching scary. Even the obvious ones, just psych you out more knowing that something scary is going to happen. With different ways of showing something scary, this scare-factor is fresh and out there, yet it works fantastically. This has your heart racing from the beginning and never lets off. This movie will seriously draw you in, and have you literally screaming at the characters to keep going when they are in danger. I've seen good horror's, but nothing similar that is as good as this. No twist ending, but for-sure an ending worth seeing. The over-all job done on this movie is amazing and seems to have very good direction. Everyone should give this movie a chance.

","A movie in two acts. After a pulsating prologue of a break in at an animal test laboratory, all goes quiet after the deafening crashing against metallic cages by chimps-this sound is relentless and cuts to the quick. After the simplistic title fades into view (and fades out...) we meet the protagonist, Jim (played with shocked bemusement by Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a deserted hospital bed in London (28 Days Later). This is where we witness film making at it's best as Jim walks around a completely 'empty' London and sees various clues as to what's happened over the last month. As a member of the audience, one begins to imagine the calamity and horror that mainland Britain was subjected to. Jim sees clues on notable landmarks(Picadilly Circus)of letters of bereavement which were very similar to those in New York back in Sept'2001.<br/><br/>Jim meets with fellow survivors and gets to grips with what's happened and what to do. The second act is just as powerful as the survivors head North to meet a deranged army unit. Is this their salvation? <br/><br/>Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland cook up a film treat that is so much more than a shock horror film-it's deeper, witty, horrific and strangely realistic. Released a year after the very real horror that was the attack on America on 9/11 and faced with political paranoia of the end is nigh, if watched in a surround sound situation in a multiplex, this must have seemed downright unforgettable. A superb movie to watch for horror buffs and enthusiasts of quality British cinema-awesome!"

","28 Days Later has gone down in the United States a pure work of art and genius craftsmanship. Anytime I ask a person what is their favorite horror or thriller film, 28 Days Later pops up 9 times out of 10. For the past five years I have heard almost entirely positive reviews of the film but never managed to watch it. I wanted too but had trouble finding any time to do so. Finally it appeared on HBO and I was able to view it for the first time and I must say I am very impressed with the film 28 Days Later. After a first view I was no longer questioning why people found this film to be such a good member of the horror genre.<br/><br/>The film begins with a virus known simply as Rage is released accidentally by a group of animal rights activist who think they are freeing harmless monkeys from a research lab. 28 days later, a man by the name of Jim awakens in a deserted hospital after being in a coma. He wanders out of the hospital to find that all of London is quiet and still. There is not a soul out. Through his wondering he is attacked by infected humans who seek to kill him. Jim is picked up by a woman named Selena who along with a few others attempt to survive the Rage infested United Kingdom and hold out some hope that somehow they will survive.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy has been making quite a name for himself as of late with such films as Batman Begins and Red Eye. He has shown extreme talent and a knack for playing villains but in 28 Days Later Jim stars as the protagonist. Murphy gives a solid performance. He seems well relaxed and suited for the rule and really shows off the fear his character is experiencing during the movie. This was no doubt a role that got him on the fast track toward success in mainstream films. Murphy overall gave a solid performance though there really wasn't much to it beside looking scared and confused most of the time. Nevertheless solid performance.<br/><br/>In support is the beautiful Naomie Harris as Jim's companion Selena. Selena is difficult character to portray considering her complexity. She has more of a background then Jim which makes it even harder for Naomie to portray the character when their is more complexity. However, Naomie is quite strong and talented and does great in support, she also is something to look at in this overall dark film. Harris' performance is stronger then Murphy's simply because Harris had to act more, plain and simple, She is the force behind the acting in the film and I would not mind seeing her in more films.<br/><br/>What makes horror films is the tone and setting of the film. One of the largest cities in the European Union hardly seems like a place to focus on for a horror/thriller film. However the tone is set in the opening shot of a deserted and abandoned London, England. Not a single person is on the street and you can't help but sit there and think ""My God!"" It is shocking and scary just to see a city utterly deserted. The tone for the film works perfectly and helps set the stage for the story in the film. Kudos to Mr. Boyle and his crew.<br/><br/>Another thing that 28 Days Later does so well is the mysteriousness behind the infected. They are 'seen' numerous times throughout the film but usually very quickly for only a few seconds or in the dark for longer. This adds to the overall scariness to the infected. They are constantly hiding and can strike at any moment. This adds to the shock that many thriller and horror films fail to capture. Infected can come out at almost any moment and attack and most of the time the audience is shocked and frightened by it. I overall enjoyed the frightening moments and the dark lighting and couldn't help but feel a bit freaked out afterwards though that is not a bad thing, that is what a horror film should do to a viewer.<br/><br/>The film is very dark and filled with violence and gore, some rough language and nudity. Definitely try to avoid letting kids who aren't yet in high school from seeing this. They will not understand it and will be horrified by what they are presented with on screen. The plot is not too hard to understand, mostly a survivor story and quite a good one at that. One thing viewers must remember is that this film is not meant to be a happy one, it is bleak and does not care much for the sympathy of the audience. You have to adapt to the relatively despairing feeling you will feel when you watch it. You won't feel too happy afterwards but it is a horror film so why should you? Overall the film is quite good, some characters aren't developed well enough but the whole plot and story behind everything makes up for most of it. Genius work by Boyle, a masterpiece of British film making.<br/><br/>4/5 Stars"

","It's not often Britain produces a post apocalyptic drama of the quality of 28 Days Later. But then it's not often Britain produces a director of the calibre of Danny Boyle. From the breathtaking opening sequences of Cillian Murphy's Jim, awaking four weeks after a catastrophic viral outbreak and wandering the deserted streets of London (in a scene clearly inspired by Day Of The Triffids) to the final reel's horrific and violent conclusion, this is a film that stuns and awes with a variety of tactics. <br/><br/>Firstly, that opening sequence.outstanding! Never has London been captured looking so still and convincingly lifeless. To call it atmospheric does not do it justice and full credit must be given to Boyle for utilising digital cameras to enable him to capture such effect. The entire film is shot on digital camera and there are a lot of hand-held shots which were obviously used so that they could get some extremely tricky shots done quickly and they also put the viewer in the thick of the action.<br/><br/>When Jim does find signs of life, he soon wishes he hadn't as he encounters people stricken with a virus turning them into contagious violent sociopaths. Encountering other survivors, 28 Days Later tells the story of this disparate group and their struggle to survive in an incredibly hostile world where even potential saviours are not what they seem. As with all great zombie films (pedants insist ""It's not a zombie film"" but whatever) the most sinister threat does not come from the infected, but from conflicting interests between the survivors. This is a film about people, with zombies, and not the other way around. It is not a horror film it is a human drama, mainly about relationships. The final set piece is the only time we descend into horror film territory with a thunderstorm and many more typically horror conventions being utilised. <br/><br/>It could be argued that 28 Days Later struggles to live up to the promise established in it's opening half hour, but when you consider just what a feat of film making this first 30 minutes is, this is really scant criticism. Besides which itcouldn't be argued that the dip in quality is any where near substantial enough as to render the rest of the film uninteresting.<br/><br/>Unlike the redundant Dawn Of The Dead remake that came soon after this film the violence is not forgettable nor gratuitous. There is action, but it feels gritty rather than stylish and unlike that film, the violent scenes are memorable because we have feelings towards the characters as they are more developed than stereotypes. <br/><br/>Cillian Murphy turns in agreat breakthrough performance as Jim. He displays the appropriate level of confusion and disbelief at the beginning and shows compassion to the people he meets before finally being utterly merciless to those who've wronged him and tried to harm his companions. Credit must also go to Christopher Eccleston who puts in a solid performance as Major Henry West, commanding officer of a group of soldiers who is easily the most interesting character in the film. One gets the impression that before the outbreak, the Major was an upstanding English gentleman and model soldier. However when we meet him he is in an extraordinary situation and he is prepared to be merciless toward those he is trusted to protect in order to maintain his position. He makes for a most interesting villain as it would be too easy to simply label him a ""bad guy"", rather he is a desperate man stuck between a rock and a hard place. Eccleston's performance makes it clear that he is not at ease with what he is trying to do, but that he feels it to be the more preferable of his available options.<br/><br/>A treasure of modern British cinema, Danny Boyle continues to show he is not confined by the concept of genre and is one of the best British directors going.

","There is something odd about the way movie promotion teams make their movies look like what they actually aren't, weather it's with terms of genre or quality. Please don't laugh but back in 2002, when the movie came out in the UK (which is of course the country where this movie originates from and takes place at), I was terrified of seeing this movie purely because the poster scared me enough! I saw it because it was playing on Channel 4 not too long ago, playing in the same room where I was busy on the computer I use and I slowly found myself watching it out of blind curiosity so then after getting into it, I logged off and started watching it properly and I was very delightfully surprised by it.<br/><br/>I do not consider ""28 Days Later"" as a horror of any real kind but I more consider it as a very tense sci-fi thriller. This is great for people like me who really are not fans of the horror genre but that said, the movie still has some haunting elements and quite a bit of bloody violence so people who love horror wouldn't feel too disappointed neither. There are a lot of other reasons why this movie is so unique, it's use of digital video to shoot the more intense scenes is an ingenious idea and makes the whole experience even more adrenaline-filled, exciting and in the right moments, a bit scary too.<br/><br/>Other things to mention is that the story is very clever and the screenplay by Alex Garland delivers it incredibly well without lacking in any place throughout the movie, the direction by Danny Boyle is very professionally done, the score by John Murphy is very original and atmospheric and the acting is superb, especially for a movie like this.<br/><br/>So to round things up, if you don't like horror, ""28 Days Later"" is the best alternative to the genre around. To those who do like horror, ""28 Days Later"" won't disappoint you there neither. Definitely worth checking out! Just be prepared for a few gruesome elements and some bloody violence.<br/><br/>I give this movie, 4 out of 5."
"DVD_Connoisseur","Null","0","1","21 June 2007"," A gritty, gripping and realistic zombie picture from Danny Boyle
","""28 Days Later"" is a powerful British horror movie from director Danny (""Trainspotting"") Boyle. When animal rights activists free contaminated apes from a laboratory, it's only a matter of weeks before Britain has been decimated. Infected individuals are kill-crazed zombies that move quickly and show no mercy. Cillian Murphy is the reluctant hero of the movie, a young man who was unconscious when hell broke out throughout the country. We join Murphy as he awakes from his coma and tries to find fellow survivors.<br/><br/>The beautiful Naomie (""Miami Vice"") Harris plays the feisty Selena, a woman who is determined to survive.<br/><br/>This is an excellent addition to the horror stable. The real horror lies in the activities of mankind rather than the acts of the infected population. The scenes with Christopher Eccleston and his group of soldiers are chilling and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Definitely at least an 8 out of 10 for this low-budget movie. Recommended."

","The movie has a superb entry. Our patient wakes up in his bed, gets out of the hospital and sees that London is quite empty. No one is around. Meanwhile there starts perfect song that fits the scene. This entry makes us think that the movie will be splendid. But the second part is really a big disappointment. Rescue scene of the patient is very good. You feel the tension but do not fear. As a matter of fact, it is not truly a horror film. Tempo slows down in the second part and the movie sometimes gets annoying and lets you down.

But the scene was quick, and his penis was small, so I wasn't intimidated by it. So, after that scene, we find out that he was in a coma for who knows how long. He exits his hospital room, to find no one. Complete emptiness. He goes out side, still in hospital attire, to find that the streets of London are also completely empty. Well, as a run of the mill zombie movie would go, him being alone...guess whats going to happen-a zombie strikes. But never fear, because two people come to his rescue. And the survival begins from there. I won't spoil anymore.<br/><br/>This movie is well written, has some nice cinematography, and Cilian Murphy always is a good actor in my books. Some cons may include that the last half hour feels out of placed and rush...but it was still a great zombie movie. Go see it if you haven't yet. And then, heck, go see the sequel. It's guaranteed 100% less Cilian Murphy penis. And that's fun for the whole family. 7/10"

","This film from acclaimed director Danny Boyle and novelist Alex Garland, opens with the release of a devastating virus, which causes extreme rage and aggression in it's victims, and then moves forward to 28 days later (obviously) where Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital to find himself in a deserted and devastated London. Before long he realises that he is not alone, because the city is teeming with people infected by the virus, which is transmitted through blood and saliva.<br/><br/>The film, which is shot on Digital Video, has almost a documentary look, and also makes for some impressive camera movements. The film alternates scenes of calm, and occasional humour, with sequences of sudden and brutal violence.<br/><br/>This is definitely recommended for horror and action fans."

","A team of animal rights activist break into Cambridge University's primate testing lab to free the caged monkeys. In spite of the dire and stressed warning of the scientist on hand, they released one of the chimps and then all hell broke loose. I wonder what the message there was? Anyway, 28 days later a guy wakes up in an empty hospital to find out that absolutely no one is around.<br/><br/>This is, by far, the best zombie (or zombie-like) movie I've ever seen. A different yet interesting take on the whole zombie idea. There weren't leagues of zombies crawling all over the place leaving hardly any place to hide, instead they were scattered and largely hidden. Plus, I like the idea that they weren't dead, just infected, so know limbless or severely maimed dead people motoring around looking for brains or flesh to eat. And no shooting people in the head only to take them down.<br/><br/>I guess what I liked most about the movie was the sign of hope that was present. With the other zombie movies I've watched the zombies are all walking dead; which is to say, since they are already dead they aren't going to effectively die again unless a bullet is put in their head. There are only so many bullets and the walking dead seem limitless. In this movie there was the very real possibility of life continuing, or better still, a cure being found because it was a disease after all.<br/><br/>This was an excellent movie leaving very little to beef about. I especially liked Naomie Harris' character (Selena). She was tough and non-cliché. The moment she suspected her accomplice had been infected she proceeded to chop him up with reckless abandon. Although she did partake in the ultra-cliché passionate-kiss-while-still-in-danger later on in the movie. There was also a good sub plot with the precarious position Jim (Cillian Murphy), Selena, and Hannah (Megan Burns) were put in with the British army. Here it is, they finally believe they are safe once they are amongst the army and away from the carnivorous infected, but they jumped out of the pan and into the fire. They escaped the blood thirsty infected to the sex hungry army.<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" is a new and interesting spin on zombies worthy of merit. With this new version of zombie there is a greater vulnerability of being zombized (just see how Frank was infected in the most astronomically infinitesimal way), but on the other hand there is a greater hope of survival. I like it."

"Thorsten-Krings","10","0","1","16 May 2007"," Nailbitingly exciting
","The post doomsday genre is not exactly new so there is a limitation as to what you can achieve in terms of originality. Granted, Boyle lifted a lot from Dawn of the Dead/ Day of the Dead, The Omega Man and most importantly from the BBC low budget series of Day of the Trifyds. The debt to the latter is the most obvious one where you can see that Boyle really almost took complete scenes. But Boyle achieved to create something that's better than all the films he uses as raw material. As opposed to Romero's works there is not an awful lot of gore although the film is very violent. But the fact that all the killings are done by hand rather than through firearms makes it seem even more real and immediate. The film is absolutely atmospheric and frightening, well paced and well directed. And that is also something Romero never managed. So essentially 28 days later is finally fulfilling the promise of a great post doomsday film- which Romero never managed to achieve because of his slow pacing and unreal violence and the BBC did not quite manage because of budgetary restraints."
"jaredmobarak","8","0","1","13 May 2007"," That was longer than a heartbeat28 Days Later
","In anticipation for the sequel 28 Weeks Later, I decided to revisit the superb zombie entry 28 Days Later from director Danny Boyle. I remember back to when I first started hearing the buzz about this film and how surprised I was that it came from the guy who brought us Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary. However, because this was the guy who made those films, I decided to give it a try, as I am not the hugest fan of the zombie flick or even horror in general. As far as these films go, though, 28 Days Later has got to be my favorite entry to the genre. It could be that there is an actual story involved and an intelligence that is usually lacking in favor of gore and sex, or it could be that this film isn't really very much a zombie film per se at all. The movie is not about humanity surviving against a race of undead beings, but instead about man fighting man, as they always have. The only thing these infected beings bring to the forefront is that rage inside us all, on the surface and unable to be suppressed behind a falsely neutral façade.<br/><br/>Our zombies here are not dead and living to kill. The victims have been infected by a virus, which makes pure rage takeover their bodies. One does not need to be dead in order to become a zombie; all that is needed is a drop of blood or saliva to enter the bloodstream. Whether through a cut, your mouth, your eye, or any other exposed orifice, one tiny drop is all it takes for you to crave murder and flesh. Thankfully some people have stayed behind in England to survive and try to find others who have luckily escaped exposure. Our heroes are than common people striving to get through the horror that is happening all around them. Cillian Murphy plays our lead protagonist, helping out his new cynical friend Selena (played realistically by Naomie Harris who has been seeing more and more roles since), yet holding on to his feelings of compassion and needing to help others. Selena is very in the open about her own survival and the fact that when push comes to shove, it is her neck she will save. Murphy's character Jim tries to bring a bit of humanity back to her, tries to subvert the carnage she has seen that has darkened her soul. I believe this is the true crux of the story right herewhat is the point of saving humanity from extinction if you can't see the invaluable worth of the life of those around you?<br/><br/>You cannot survive alone. This moral comes up often in the film and really drives it during the numerous stretches without zombies. True, the action scenes are completely riveting throughout, the quick paced editing and sharp movements of blood and violence are harrowing to watch, and the chase scene in the tunnel while trying to change a flat tire gets the pulse running high. However, it's the quiet points really allow the story to mean something with the viewer. The relationship between Brendan Gleeson's father and Megan Burns' daughter are heartbreaking moments. They are only alive because they have each other, someone to love and survive with within the growing isolation and loneliness surrounding them. Their bond shows what living is about and helps break the harsh façade Harris' character has built up to cope. Each does their hardest to never give up hope and their emotions run high at times, but also have show lapses of joy and happiness to counteract it all. I love the scene at the supermarket when they go shopping for food. Gleeson's rant about good wine and his leaving the credit card at the end brought a much- needed smile to my face and totally entrenched my attention into what would soon happen afterwards.<br/><br/>It is the end that brings up the political connotations of what has happened and the necessities of life. Whereas most zombie films end with the military coming in and saving everyone from death, here Boyle subverts that into a more telling truthcynical yes, but true nonetheless. These army men, led by a fantastic role of duality from Christopher Eccleston, have created a bunker to try and rebuild society with. Their answer to the zombies is to arm themselves and make a life inside their quarantined home. This is a military state, however, and a utilitarian one. In order to recreate society you need procreation to keep the generations going. With only two female characters in the movie, you can imagine where this goes.<br/><br/>Sure the ending becomes a bit too much like your run of the mill actioner, but overall, one cannot ask for more from it. You learn what it is to survive and that you need to have a reason to live and someone to live with. Murphy and Harris deliver the goods during their fight to get out of their island prison. You see, as we later find out, the virus has been contained on the island. England has been quarantined from the rest of the world and sacrificed in order for society to continue on unfettered. The infected are dying of starvation, and salvation seems to have finally come. Now if that doesn't scream sequel, I don't know what does. Hopefully Boyle's producing credit on the follow-up will mean quality and a keeping of tone as well as meaning from this well-done original."
"Radu_Vladislas","9","0","1","13 May 2007"," A very nice entry to the British horror movie scene, and to the horror genre as a whole!.
","I loved this movie from the get go, what with the whole idea of an apocalyptic vision of Britain, and the inclusion of ""The Infected"" running around as well wiping out, or infecting, all remains of human existence they find. It thrills me even to this day.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie gives off the feeling of there really being no more hope for those spared the initial outbreak, and killing spree, caused by those infected with a rage virus. It makes you feel as if you're vastly out numbered and in danger no matter where you go or where you hide.<br/><br/>The ghost town like London was executed well, well enough to fool you into thinking ""how could they make this happen"", we get over turned buses and abandoned cars and fully desolate streets (no sound what so ever). It's creepy, if viewed in the right frame of mind. <br/><br/>Movies like this and Hot Fuzz and also Dog Soldiers and The Descent makes you proud of the British movie industry, instead of ashamed of it. Very entertaining movies they are as well. Unlike Hollywood where they remake classic after classic and Americanise foreign horror movies in the current rut they are in. Instead of being original to some extent!.<br/><br/>Well done, Danny Boyle, and the rest of his crew for a job well done."

","I haven't read all the posted comments yet (I browsed through several late last night after seeing this visually stunning and atmospheric film on TV).<br/><br/>A few posts mentioned a ""happy ending."" The version broadcast here in Melbourne last night did have a happy ending (the three survivors have escaped to the Lakes District and are apparently about to be 'saved' when their large fabric HELLO sign is seen by the jet fighter pilots), then we had all the credits.<br/><br/>This was followed by a black screen with the words ""...what if"" in the lower right corner, followed by another sequence (a coda) in a hospital operating room, showing Selena's unsuccessful attempts to save Jim, after which she and Hannah leave and walk away into the distance along the hospital corridor - The (real) End.<br/><br/>While this sequence cast a suitably bleak pall over the entire movie (bleakness was one of its strong points), and was a more fitting conclusion than the earlier, clichéd ""happy ending"" it also made sense of a very short out-of-context sequence seen earlier (Selena filling a hypodermic needle).<br/><br/>There was an interesting scene earlier in the film (when Jim, Selena and Hannah and her father are trying to sleep outdoors) where we're led to believe that what we're seeing is actually happening, only to find that it's Jim's dream.<br/><br/>The whole of the pre-credits sequence (the 'happy' ending, including the deux ex machina of the jet plane) was also Jim's dream, but this time as he was dying, despite Selena's efforts, from his gunshot wound."

","28 Days Later was too scary for me the first time I watched it at age 14. When I tried again at age 17, I was scared again, but it still kept me interested...all the way to the end, and boy am I glad I did. Witness the rebirth of the zombie/survival horror film by watching Danny Boyle's masterpiece, 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes in a London hospital to find that he's alone. That's fine, as many patients are alone when they wake. The problem is that he's literally alone. Everyone seems to have vanished. The hospital is completely empty, and as he journeys the streets of London, he finds they are empty too. Finally, he finds some people, people who upon seeing him, pursue him with the intent to kill him. Eventually, he finds other people who explain that the others have been infected with a rage virus that turns the victim into a rage driven killing machine.<br/><br/>The film is more than visually scary, but the physical violence is quite brutal. The zombies themselves are very scary with what appears to be eyes soaked in blood. It's classic horror in the modern era, and that's why the film will appeal to so many different horror fans. Psychological horror and slasher fans will both be very happy. The film is also a drama about the fight for survival, centering on the characters played by Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) and Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest). There is no real villain of the film, but Christopher Eccleston's character definitely can be considered a bad guy. And he does one hell of a job with it as a military commander. Murphy plays the classic hero, but at the same time he is not the nicest guy in the world. The ending shows what happens when you tick off a guy like Jim. Naomie Harris is likable as well despite her character's blunt and rash behavior, which is a sign of a job well done by the actress. Brendan Gleeson adds a sense of warmth in a supporting role, delivering, as always, an enjoyable performance.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's direction is stellar as he creates an apocalyptic vision that can really scare you to the bone. Like I said, not all the horror is visual and physical. There is also a good deal of psychological horror, and any horror film that balances physical and psychological horror is well on its way to being a classic, which 28 Days Later is. Written by Alex Garland, 28 Days Later is the best horror film of 2002 (Sorry, The Ring wasn't this good), and one of the top 5 of the 2000's. It's a classic that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"
"oneloveall","7","0","1","8 May 2007"," One of Horror's most artistically ambitious films struggles to resolve itself
","The thinking man's zombie flick 28 Days Later, at it's best a frighteningly stylish British apocalypse, though at it's worst a technically overwrought stew of disjointed action and theme, nevertheless accomplishes elevating the horror genre to inspired new levels. With a strong first half, director Danny Boyle capitalizes on being an outsider to the zombie genre, shown by his evocative capturing of England through the eyes of one just waking up to this future-less nightmare(Cillian Murphy). Boyle takes this tried and true end-of-the-world scenario and instills a new artistic integrity into the carnage. Capturing the British landscape in such a desolate manner paid off in making this film something far more memorable then any plot specifics could. The eerie, vast stillness that serves as the film's superior first act will eventually become sidetracked by a confused, action-intensive finale, but during this awkward transition Boyle does not forget to maintain a psychological edge to parallel the progressive decay.<br/><br/>Essentially split in two distinct movements, the action-packed showdown does not live up to the first half's sensually broadcast set design. Boyle and writing partner Alex Garland are to be commended for turning a horror found inside these enraged zombies unto ourselves for analysis, but in their overwrought hyper-kinetic style and morality logistics, manage to make the overall experience feel duller then the gorgeous setup would suggest.<br/><br/>Whatever setbacks the cluttered second half demonstrate, it still only robs a uniquely great scary movie from being brilliant. How Boyle technically captures the infected (sped-up and annoyingly visceral) becomes more distracting then helpful, which a devolved but thematically viable climax attests to, but with the last lingering frame of haunting ambiguity, one remains in awe of this elevated fright-fest. Certainly one of the few zombie-type films that will ever grace a certain demographic's appreciation, and in that alone an instant triumph for Danny Boyle which continues to prove his adept range as a filmmaker."

I know many have complained about these not being ""true"" zombies in the Romero sense but it was about time for a make-over and Boyle killed it. The energy and mood of this film was spot on and Cillian Murphy gave a star turning performance as Jim. With its bleak look at the future it has a similar feel to this years terrific Children Of Men - though much grittier as it was shot on DV not the polished 35mm cinematography of Lubezki.

","Apocolyptic movies are always something to look up to when such a disaster strikes. ""28 Days Later"" is one movie that really intrigues me. Being set in London, it's always easy to see what life is like after a deadly virus spreads out England. Thinking that you are all alone would be a factor, it goes to shows you're wrong all the time. This man Jim(Cillian Murphy) finds survivors in different locations. With everything down, and people died out, they can survive well without looting because there's no lawmen around the bloody place. Syphoning gas from other vehicles, and trying to find sanctuary is also needed as well. There are more survivors though, but these guys are up to something, and it's not good. The hospital victim does one good deed, that is save the two ladies from the soldiers who captured the infected ones in their quarters. The young girl may have been orphaned, she was still a strong character in the movie. And Selena(Naomi Harris), doesn't play around herself. She watched Jim like a hawk.

","Though it's not a zombie movie, per se, it's still got the stylings and themes of one, and just because it was falsely advertised doesn't make it any less of a film. In fact, it's pretty brilliant. The story is the typical post-apocalyptic survival framework until the soldiers enter the picture, when it becomes metaphorical and existential. Jim's transformation from a cowering bike courier to a rage-filled lunatic is quick, but it feels real, and makes the climax all the more thrilling. The film is making some pretty profound statements on humanity and the nature of survival, turning this from a pretty good zombie flick into something more. It's backed up by some gritty but effective camera work, solid performances by then-unknowns and character actors, great and fitting music, and, of course, lots of gore. The portrayal of the 'infected' is pretty frightening, to me at least, and the attack scenes are suspenseful and exhilarating. A top-notch sci-fi/horror."

This is all I will say about that, I don't want to spoil it.<br/><br/>The thing that made this film stand out, both in the horror genre and films in general, was it's style and craft. The photography is shot in a way that keeps on the edge the whole time, and the music is not your typical horror symphony, but rather simple electric guitar and percussion. This having been said, it was no doubt some of the creepiest film music that I have ever heard-it sent shivers down my spine! But this is all I should really mention-in order to truly enjoy this gem, you've got to see it and find out things for yourself. So do yourself a favor-leave your computer, grab your jacket, head to your local Blockbuster, and pick this up! I guarantee you will enjoy it."

","Let me make this clear this is not a zombie film. In London people have been infected with rage which is very contagious. This film follows Jim who has awaken from a coma to find there is no one else in the hospital and follows him as he discovers what happened while he was in his coma. He meet's others in his journey, and loses some too. When Jim and the other survivor's find safety that was offered by the army, they discover it was all a ruse and a new nightmare begins. Jim struggles to save the last 2 survivor's Selena and Hannah before they are raped and is almost killed himself. Jim spot's an Air Force plane and it gives him what he needs to save Selena (his love interest) and Hannah. Jim get's shot in the process and survives. The ending is hopeful, and I won't give that detail away. This is a good film and I highly recommend you see it before you see the sequel that is due out later this year."
"dkeppens","6","0","1","7 February 2007"," Day of the Triffids meets George A Romero
","A bunch of activists break into a research center involved in primate testing to liberate all their furry friends in a commando-style operation. Although warned, this way, they also unleash the highly contagious virus called ""rage"" that the test subjects were infected with and keeps them in a persistently bad mood, aka, makes them attack anything in sight. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) comes out of what must have been a coma in a totally abandoned hospital and sets out to discover what's going on, only to find the world a desolate and very dangerous place. <br/><br/>This movie is a bit of a mixed bag, which does not come as a surprise seeing as it tries to blend an action-oriented 'dawn-of-the-dead-remake'-like with a lot of elements of Wyndham's masterpiece, where analysis of feelings and moral dilemmas are only slightly interspersed with ""action"". Especially because the latter is best understood by the feeling of impending doom conveyed upon us by slowly building up a futuristic view of the us-against-them struggle. Some scenes though, are very powerful and work extremely well, like when Jim enters the church with all the bodies and a few infected people. Or where he and his companions sleep in the countryside and he dreams about waking up alone, left to insanity by his travel companions. The confrontation with the out of this world reality and all its consequences are the true merits of the film. It's too bad that some of these potentially strong scenes choose instead to flush all atmosphere down the toilet. A perfect example is when they hesitantly drive in a tunnel to leave London the fast way, only to find their path blocked by piles of wrecked cars. Instead of building atmosphere and tension or even smacking us in the face with mangled corpses which should be omnipresent, Herbie goes bananas and we are left with nothing to do but shake our heads in disbelief. <br/><br/>I guess that's what happens when two very different problems that should be handled in movies with very different styles get smacked together in a single film. While Wyndham chooses substance over style and clearly identifies the most important post-apocalyptic problems when waking up in an ""friend outnumbered by foe"", almost abandoned world, such as solitude, survival of the species and, last but not least, having to choose between helping others or focusing solely on the survival of the fittest, Boyle under-uses or almost completely ignores these powerful elements. Jim killing of a young infected kid with a baseball bat without a doubt in his mind ? I beg to differ. I can understand his hard-ass female companion can take such actions without hesitation since she has been forced to live with these circumstances for 28 days, but Jim just woke up... Maybe the director should not be blamed entirely for this sudden jump to total detachment instead of working towards it. More convincing performances by almost all the leads (except for Brendan Gleeson) would not have hurt. At times, it really felt like these people grew accustomed to extraordinary circumstances or even the loss of a loved one, in the blink of an eye. The lack of profound usage of the more interesting elements is especially clear when one starts asking the obvious questions raised in the first ten minutes. If this virus has an incubation period of about 20 seconds, then why is central London empty ? Where are all the cars, where are all the bodies resulting from traffic chaos alone ? While seeing Trafalgar square and others totally empty is painting a powerful image in itself, it is far from accurate in case of this ""rage"" catastrophe and a more accurate image would have certainly had an even greater impact. There are other questions to be asked as well. Supposing everyone was inside at the time, why do some people get killed and others just infected ? What's the decisive factor here ? As far as the musical score goes, it's fine in all action-oriented scenes, but is a bit overused in all others. Over-dramatizing can be annoying. Especially when followed closely by more fast-paced, zombie-like action. <br/><br/>But i do not solely intend to trash this film. As stated, some scenes are pretty powerful on its own, and at times where Boyle goes full-out for either style, making you forget the mish-mash feelings from before, the result is quite entertaining. For instance, i highly enjoyed the ""day of the dead"" homage where we have a military base that fights of the infected people at the perimeter and even a nod to ""Bub"", the trained zombie in Romero's third outing. <br/><br/>The conclusion therefore is, that although both styles are mostly better executed than any other film in their respective genres, the mixed end result is, ultimately, a bit flat. Do not buy, rent, decide for yourself, but be sure that it is still far better than most post y2k entertainment imitations Hollywood spewed out."
"refresh_daemon","6","0","1","3 February 2007"," Better than mediocre zombie/disaster movie
","Horror movies. To be honest, the great majority of them are pretty darn bad. The zombie movie: conceived by George A. Romero with The Night of the Living Dead and followed by countless clones and sequels. Most of these, like most horror movies, are pretty bad. At least Romero's films had some measure of social commentary to balance out the general ridiculousness of the films.<br/><br/>28 Days Later does nothing to restore my confidence in zombie movies or horror movies as a whole. A disease breaks out and turns people into rabid killing machines hell-bent on killing all living people (but not each other). The dialogue in the film doesn't do a whole lot to help it make too much more sense. Then a handful of survivors try to... well... survive.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Yep. The zombie movie genre is actually a cross-genre hybrid of the disaster movie and the horror movie. Lots of spooky scares from zombies popping up everywhere and general gotta-survive-at-the-end-of-the-world tenseness. And it's tense and there are plenty of spookies to keep the audience trembling in their seats. The film (after the weak introduction) starts off pretty well, showing a post-apocalyptic London.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film falls victim to a pair of problems that are opposed to each other. First of all, the setup takes a long time. There's a lot of running around with little character development. Second, the last act of the film introduces the film's ""larger themes"" which really serve against itself. I think if the characters were better developed and the story more thoughtfully wrought, then it would've been fine, but it all just drops out of nowhere and is almost a second story in itself. A lot of the development that happens in the first two-thirds of the film gets annihilated in the last third because the film takes a very different turn. And in it all, it tries to make a statement about the nature of humanity, but it's really cliché and poorly drawn out. Oh yeah, like many other horror movies, there are shower scenes and quite a bit of basic nudity, courtesy of the male lead's character.<br/><br/>The direction and the photography isn't bad, although it stumbles here and there. The acting ranges from just passable to mediocre. The movie has cute references to other films and sources, which is neat if you can get them. But in the end, this is a slightly-better-than-mediocre horror film. It's okay for a once-over but I can't really recommend it. 6/10."

","This film is best when looked at as anti-apocalyptic. I heard people say this was anti-white. It talked about survival and culture clashes. Being blunt helps. People think situations like these are times to enact upon their darkest impulses. (i.e. Katrina tragedy) Victims are more than the zombies. It is the tale of misogyny justified. People spend more time thinking about themselves yet not on a global scale. I think this speaks to a current age of wartime and who are the real victims. Jim is a representative of the decent people who are oblivious to the dark side of human nature and when he finally awakes he becomes what he would have feared during his ordinary lifetime of being a normal law abiding citizen. What I mean to say is that he wasn't mentally ill, a road rager, etc. yet ironically he is the one blindsided in a car accident and it makes him realize the great and ultimately most damaging negative feeling in humanity is not despair but anger turned inward. I feel an objection however in the fact that selena and hannah were just used as props and archetypes. Selena starts out as a strong female/heroine yet ends up the victim so that Jim can uncover and unleash his animal nature to save her. It is a film that comes full circle I must say. A primate releases the infection borne of human rage and human anger leads to uncivilized animalistic behavior that saves Selena and Hannah in the end. However it is sad that the true ending would have been more poignant if Hannah and Selena internally and externally(verbally) confronted the despair of losing Jim and their families. In the end, the film is a film about irony and making allies in tough times. Also human nature is usually unpredictable in the worst and best circumstances."

I found it scary and touching, horrifying and exciting. The acting is first rate, and I think Cillian Murphy did an incredible acting job.

","28 Days Later effectively does what a film of it's genre should do - scare the crap out of you! What makes is so effective is that it takes place in surroundings that are familiar - Downtown London, surrounding suburban towns. Just the thought of something like ""rage"" actually happening is very terrifying. I think it's also good that no big name stars are in the film. Sometimes big names can be a distraction. With all the talk about avian flu, and other pandemics, rage doesn't seem to far fetched. That in itself, makes this film frightening, indeed. You could imagine this scenario taking place anywhere in the world. However, London seems the most plausible due to the fact that it is the capital city of an island. I would love to see a sequel!"

The only odd thing was that it didn't scare me - not even a startle-scare.

Why were they walking around with baseball bats and machetes when all the gun shops would have been open for the taking? Next, why did the army have only one of the infected chained to see how long it/they could live without food? Would it not have been better to have two, and see if they could feed off each other? Why was the M-way void of cars, when everywhere else was full of vehicles? And the smell would have been horrendous. We saw people covering their faces a time or two.

"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","0","2","31 January 2006"," Aahooo! Zombies of London...
","28 Days Later is a post-apocalyptic horror movie whose excitements fail to outweigh its disappointments. Director Danny Boyle, of Trainspotting fame, has endeavored to bring the schlocky zombie-movie routines of George Romero up-to-date by pumping them full of extreme-cinema steroids; the result is a tottery fusion of Romero and Gaspar Noe, a gory splatter-movie adorned with the trappings of a visceral Euro-art-film.<br/><br/>The intriguing set-up involves a bicycle-courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy), who awakes from a coma to find the whole of London apparently abandoned. What Jim doesn't know is that the country has been overrun by a strange infection unleashed from a laboratory, and that most of the people have been turned into raving, bloodthirsty maniacs. The story then becomes a familiar survivors vs. zombies scenario: Jim meets a pair of toughies named Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris), who've learned to kill the homicidal Infecteds with Molotov cocktails, and to subsist on candy and soda. After Mark is bitten by a zombie and mercifully macheted, Jim and Selena encounter a father-and-daughter named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and Hannah (Megan Burns), who have a crank-up radio and a gassed-up taxi, and convince Jim and Selena to accompany them to Manchester, where there may or may not be a military base.<br/><br/>Some of this is genuinely creepy. The initial images of the deserted London streets, shot on DV and digitally altered to remove traffic and other signs of human habitation, are eerie and bleak, evoking the end of the world as envisaged by Lars Von Trier. If Boyle didn't insist on going for the jugular with almost every shot, the movie might be a classic. The problem is that there isn't any real suspense, because Boyle doesn't allow the suspense to build. It's hard to become involved in the plight of the characters when the director is constantly trying to dazzle you with jump-cuts, and loud music, and bursts of violence that would be punctuative if the rest of the film weren't at the same manic pitch already. The story, weak to begin with, completely disintegrates in the second half. The survivors are taken by soldiers to a secluded manor surrounded by mines and floodlights, and anyone who's seen a George Romero movie immediately suspects that the soldiers are up to no good.<br/><br/>It's amazing how fast a stylish, high-intensity movie can become a deadly bore. The actors, some of whom seem fairly talented, are given no chance by Boyle to assert their personalities, so the film becomes a nearly-dehumanized exercise in technique. And even more disappointing are the zombies; Boyle can think of nothing more creative for them to do than hiss like bad-movie vampires and vomit blood. Romero at least always bothered to give some of his lurching undead funny little bits of personality, and used them for satiric jabs. Boyle may be more accomplished visually than Romero, but he's nowhere near Romero's class when it comes to old-fashioned schlock-meistering."

","I hated this film the 1st time I saw it, because I was expecting a British zombie film, similar to Resident Evil, which I had seen just a few weeks prior. However, 2 and a half yrs later I watched it again & have to say as far as a virus infecting the population film & turning them into rage-infested murderers, it was a very decently made film. I really like the director Danny Boyle, who directed one of my all-time favorite drug films, Trainspotting (a great novel,by the way) & the very good Shallow Grave as well. And then he has done stinkers like Alife Less ordinary, & The Beach. 28 Days Later kinda is better than the latter but not as good as the first two i just mentioned. Cillian Murphy is very good in this film as Jim. After waking up from a coma after being out of it for the past 28 days, he has no idea that the isle of the UK has been either evacuated or is dead or is infected by a virus called Rage, which was released by a group of Animals Rights activists, who upon feeling sympathy for the chimps who are being subjected to the virus, are let loose out of their cages, even while the scientist is screaming at them to not let it loose. And, upon the chimp being set free,he bites the female in the group, who proceeds to & after a visually distributing scene of her rising within seconds, hissing & her eyes having turned completely blood-shot begins puking blood all over her compatriot, whose then infected & then you see Jim awaken in a hospital. Unbelievable, as most coma victims can't walk for a few days after due to being bed-ridden for so long, but Jim gets right up & starts walking miles through the abandoned city of London ( which is visually stunning work,that Mr Boyle did awesomely, by filming really early in the morning,before the city woke up to go to work) & you feel for his character, the anxiety & fear he has, as he seems to be the only living person left in London. However,soon enough he runs into the infected & while chasing him he encounters a man & a woman, who save him & take him & explain what he's missed by being a sleep. Naomie Harris does a great job in the film as well. Christopher Eccelston shows once again that he's great at playing bad guys, as he plays the Military general who by leaving a radio message out to be broadcast to any survivors that he has the cure to the virus. Jim & company make their way to Manchester (on streets way too unbelievably without traffic) to find a Military group with only 2 things on their minds: Sex & Survival. And,Naomie 's character & the young 14 yr old girl are going to be the Breeders of a new generation, whether they want to or not. Some very intense moments, where you think the 2 girls are about to be roughly & grossly gang-raped & the scenes where Jim is being taken to be executed for not just allowing the Military guys to rape his friends & then him escaping into the wilderness, where many of the infected are still roaming, was scary. And,the infected black solider, who the live military guys have chained,like a dog in the backyard, when Jim sets him free to help him by attacking & infecting his still alive com padres was intense as he's scary looking.I loved it each time he basically, vomited blood all over the soldiers infecting them. Why, this is listed as a Zombie film, I'll never know as it has a virus being let loose on the public similarity like nIGHT oF tHE lIVING dEAD & Resident Evil, but in those films, they die first, then come back to life to eat the flesh of the living, hence infecting them. In this their living infected people who aren't interested in eating human flesh, just infecting new people. That doesn't make them Zombies,people.I also wonder, as they never mention it but was the UK countries of Scotland,Wales, or Ireland affected at all? And, i heard their in pre-production on doing a sequel 29dAYS Later. i wonder how their planning on doing it & will Alex gARLAND BE WRITING THE SCRIPT?

They've all been infected with this ""Rage"" virus thingie. So all they want to do is kill people. Even eating is not on their to-do-lists anymore. Or washing, or going number two, for that matter(oh, the humanity..). I thought this was a brilliant idea, totally original and handily used-If the survivors just wait it out for 4 weeks (28 days again!), the maximum period of time the human body can survive without food, the Ragers will just..die! Ever see a Zombie starve to death, hmm? Well, at the end you see some poor ragers collapsed from starvation, out on the road. For me, that was one of the (many) great perks of this movie: Original Content! Let's not insult it by lumping it under the wrong header! If this movie is to be compared, it should be Cronenberg's Rabid ('77).<br/><br/>"" Are you sure this is the Sci-Fi convention? It's full of nerds!"" Homer Simpson"

","An early movie in the DV release bonanza of our current age of film-making, Boyle's 28 Days Later... is a zombie movie that challenges the automatous hordes of moviegoers to treat them to a movie that first redefines zombies in a new and appealing way, and then proceeds to set them loose in a three-part story arch that explores the depths of humanity's inhumanity to other humans.<br/><br/>Most viewers need little experience in the zombie genre to recognize the impact of Romero's infamous zombie trilogy on almost all subsequent zombie thrillers ever after, and while this one definitely has its nods, it takes more inspiration from actual crimes of humanity (Bosnia, Saddam's gassing of the Kurds, an explosion in northern Ireland, Sierra Leone, and Pol Pot, amongst others) and the anxiety of a modern world set to eventually face a great pandemic, and compresses it into a theme of apocalyptic emptiness set to Godspeed You! Black Emperor! Sound good enough yet? It also contains fantastic performances and a huge presentation of substance-based style that pulls together a story arch bound to be entertaining for anyone ranging from zombie-buffs to serious cinema enthusiasts always looking for the next post-modern symbolism launcher.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

But the problem is that I simply can't believe the disease. I mean, it is not any effort to imagine a tragic illness that can drive the people crazy and spreads so fast that it results in chaos and death. But the attitude and behavior of the infected people is ridiculous. They're supposed not to be able to do almost anything, but they coordinate themselves to attack. Also, they are TRIBAL. Infected people live, sleep and act together, so they can attack the normal ones more easily... this is quite absurd. I couldn't understand why the father and daughter insist on announcing their presence to everyone, infected or not, by lighting on all those Christmas lights...

The cinematography was fantastic; especially the usage of a digital video camera, which gave it an urban and gritty look, that accommodated to the desolate and grey city of London.

","It's scary and suspenseful because of the situation they are in, but it isn't dead people walking around because of some voodoo, magic, or satanic karma nonsense; they have a disease, kind of like rabies, only much faster. This is the kind of thing that could actually happen. The movie follows one guy in his struggle to survive as he joins with others to form a small group. As the group gets bigger, the dynamics of the relationships these people have with each other become strained, and that's where the real story is. Our main guy stops running scared from the infected. He takes the offensive against the real bad guys who are other uninfected people. At least they're uninfected by the ""rage"" virus, but they have some lustful desires that they are too eager to act out with unwilling women in the group. Now that makes for an interesting dynamic!"
"lucid_dream08","10","0","2","22 June 2005"," 28 Days Later...
","28 Days Later is an amazing film. It's not a ""zombie"" film as critics call it. It's more deep than that. There aren't really zombies in the film at all, there are the ""infected,"" who are infected with rage and are compelled to kill anyone and anything in their path. Unlike other movies that are realatively close to the same genre, the movie is not focused on the ""infected,"" or zombies as most call them, but the survivors (Naomie Harris, Cillian Murphy, Megan Burns). The ""infected"" are second in the film. What I like most about this movie is the ending (of course the alternate because all of the main characters live) because it has a twist to it. Not only that, but the ""infected"" do die off, which gives the survivors, well, an actual chance to survive. Danny Boyle really does a splendid job directing this movie, and Alex Garland has a thing for writing, also. Another thing I love about the movie is the way it is filmed. It's filmed with mainly digital cameras, which gives the film a realistic look. I think that this is by far the best movie created, and, in my mind, everyone should see it :)"
"heypete","6","0","1","14 June 2005"," Good cinematography, weak plot...
","Although this movie is an interesting diversion for an hour or two, and a fairly good zombie flick, it's not a great movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts out like any normal zombie movie, with the main character waking up in a completely abandoned city (think of how the first ""Resident Evil"" movie ends), meeting up with a small band of uninfected humans, and seeking shelter elsewhere. All this is well and good, though a bit slow -- London is completely empty, and the film demonstrates that abundantly through breathtaking wide-angle shots.<br/><br/>Up until the point where the soldiers attempt to rape the female lead character and the young girl, everything was believable, though it left a few ""realistic"" concerns unaddressed (I'll address those later). Everything from that point on is just a bloodlust-filled rampage shot with grainy film (to good visual effect, but not terribly good in terms of plot), ending with a ""Sound of Music""-type perfect ending where a Finnish fighter jet notices the small group and signals for their rescue.<br/><br/>Given that zombie movies are usually pretty cheesy, 28 Days Later was, for the most part, an enjoyable if somewhat bland movie. The last 30 minutes or so really ruined it, in my eyes, however.<br/><br/>Being an individual who prepares for various emergencies (I live near a major earthquake fault in California, though I admit to being less-than-prepared for a full-out zombie invasion) and former US Army soldier, I had the following observations:<br/><br/>1) With practically all of England infected, there is no facility for manufacturing ammunition, and certainly no importation of such. Why the British soldiers are so indiscriminate about full-auto fire when they believe the rest of the world is infected (and thus no hope of rescue) is beyond me. Shouldn't they be conserving their ammunition to make it last as long as possible?<br/><br/>2) Why did it take 56 days for observation planes to arrive and start looking for survivors? While it's unlikely that other countries would immediately start sending in ground troops (for fear of infection), there's no reason why they shouldn't send observation planes to look at what's happening.<br/><br/>3) Along the lines of #1, why did the British soldiers use their generator so much? They had a wood-burning boiler (where'd the water come from?), which made sense as they were in a wooded area and had plenty of fuel, but no resupply of gasoline or diesel. Even major internet data centers have only enough fuel for a week or two, certainly not 28 continuous nights, particularly so when they're hiding out in a captured mansion that doesn't have the existing infrastructure.<br/><br/>4) It seems clear that zombies cannot climb sheer walls. Since the male lead character Jim had to scale a wall to flee the crazed soldiers, wouldn't it be fairly trivial to ensure that any breaches in the perimeter wall (gates, for example) were secured, and then clear all areas within the wall of zombies, thus being able to live in some degree of security? Additional reinforcement of the walls (perhaps with downward-pointing spikes, water-filled moats, or other barriers) could come later. Simply counting on all the zombies to come from one direction, crossing a minefield, and into your existing fields of fire (who's on duty all the time? There's not enough soldiers to stay awake 24 hours a day.) is rather silly from a tactical perspective.<br/><br/>All right, enough nitpicking. As far as zombie movies go, this one's all right...but zombie movies aren't generally that great in the first place. Great visuals, good first 2/3rds of the film, terrible ending, and overall weak-to-moderate plot."
"darkcybergeek","10","0","1","12 June 2005"," ""That was longer than a heartbeat."" - Jim
","28 Days Later for me is the best zombie movie I've seen in a while (For me it was better than Dawn of the dead remake, Shaun of the dead, Resident evil 1 and 2). I mean the movie had this sense of desperation, and this realistic look that gave me the chills. I haven't seen a zombie movie that scared me this much, although it wasn't much of a zombie movie. It was more of a drama about this 4 people trying to survive in a world gone more mad than it is. Anyone expecting a Resident evil will be completely disappointed with this one. The script was excellent and i must congratulate the writers. The acting was very strong and i think they all did a hell of a good job, they were totally credible. The characters were very well develop and by the end of the movie you care about them which gives the movie more intensity. My favorite characters being Jim, Selena and Hannah...they were all very complex. The story well it wasn't that original really but as i said before it was played more differently than the usual zombie flick. The music/score was fantastic, it was very moody and definitively not usual for this type of movie. Great job! The suspense sequences were very intense especially the tunnel sequence still has me on the edge of my seat. For gore fans well this movie has plenty of gore and some really disturbing scenes (the eye popping scene....DISTURBING!) The great cinematography added more feel to the movie and the shots of London desolated were brilliant! The shots also were very creative and very beautiful indeed. And last but not least the ending, most people had a problem with it but i know i didn't i mean i think it was necessary in order for the movie's message to hit. Easily the best, scariest horror movie of 2003, well for me at least. (*My point of view of the movie was that every bad situation has a way out, and you should never give up.*)"

","""28 Days Later"" would be a much better movie if the film makers had known what story they wanted to tell. As it is, they start with a high-concept apocalyptic plague premise that degenerates into a slap-dash, jumbled action movie. I suppose Danny Boyle and screenwriter are trying to make the idea of people being infected with rage relevant to our current troubled world state (the film begins with an image of multiple T.V. monitors each showing news footage of one violent action or another), but I think they are much more taken with the idea of making a gross-out movie that will appeal to the alternative grunge crowd, not realizing that grunge is now cliché. What is supposed to feel cutting edge feels stale and like something you've seen done before and done better. The movie gets kudos from me for its visual look, and I do admit that it's never boring, but there's a general feeling of senseless nastiness that negates any message you're going to get from this.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"carlphillips1","8","0","1","19 April 2005"," Was a surprisingly excellent film.
","When I first saw the previews for 28 Days Later, I figured it was simply another middling zombie movie: crowd-pleasing, but shallow. After its release onto DVD and video, however, I saw that it was given very good reviews, and I decided to rent it. I was amazed.<br/><br/>Besides being chilling and exciting film, many parts of it had a genuine atmosphere. The visual effects, including the key color- red-, give the story a dream-like authenticity. Sometime while watching it, it hits you that the plot is actually fictional. Though it is easy to realize that many of the most eloquent scenes are set up in previous ones, if you think about it for a while, you'll only remember the stunning imagery, interesting camera angles, and the simple but spine-tingling music.<br/><br/>The acting in 28 Days Later was also quite satisfying. Cillian Murphy gave a good performance as Jim, who's mysterious and strategical sides are revealed when he is on the run in a temporary military post in upper England. Naomie Harris also performed very well as Selena, a kind and motherly young woman, who's main concern is protecting Hannah from the raging zombies as well as from the military soldiers who, dazed by isolation, are trying unnecessarily to procreate.<br/><br/>I believe one of the most chilling moments is when Jim (Murphy) looks up into the sky and sees a plane flying across. This was when I first truly realized that the only place affected by the dangerous virus was Great Britain. Everyone else in the world was still going about their usual business, and might not have even known of the epidemic. The ending makes you believe that everything is done and over- but truly, is it?"

Cillian Murphy ( Girl with the Pearl Earring ) is perfect as Jim, the bewildered, confounded and scared young man who wakes up, naked in an abandoned hospital bed 28 days after a viral attack in London, promulgated by an animal rights group who released contaminated monkeys from a research lab.

","First off I would like to say that I thought this movie was excellent, and I'm not usually a fan of the zombie flick. However this movie was quite different. More terrifying than the zombies was the hard-hitting, all too true social commentary that the movie contained.<br/><br/>The movie is set in england which is perfect because; being and island, it give the distinct feeling of a microcosm of society, rather a smattering of parts of the whole. Being set on an island it give the viewer the ability to take a sterilized view to the carnage, with the rational as that of a scientist viewing a controlled experiment.<br/><br/>The film superficially touches on the topics of love and family, but the deeply ingrained undertone is that: no matter the carnage that is done to humans, it only parallels the destruction that we wreck upon ourselves. The use of an onslaught of zombies is brilliant. We see the characters plagued by these enraged zombies WHO USED TO BE HUMAN(hint.. that is important) and then we see their interaction with the soldiers from the blockade and we see that the interaction is at its core... the same.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, however i suggest not watching it in a dark basement at 3:47 a.m. as you will find it hard to sleep :) The important thing to take away from this film is the idea the no matter what is done to humanity, we continue to do worse to ourselves."

Danny Boyle is a genius, he can go from making one of the best comedy/dramas ever (Trainspotting), to making the best ultra-serious Zombie film ever, and recently made a family film called millions which I hear is fantastic. This films final chapter is mind blowing, especially the scene in which Jim (possibly infected in the mind of Selena) savagely crushes that marine guy's skull.

Having said this, it is very well done as a thriller on it's own as I would find myself pretty freaked out by everything going on. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, as it is shot with digital cameras which according to the filmmaker were used to bring out an ""urban"" feel to the film, and it works very well. The movie is made in such a real way, and I believe there were hardly any special effects used, if any at all. The music of the film always supplies additional emotions to add to the situation, and makes you wonder if there is any hope for the characters. This film is absolutely amazing as it supplies thrills and a very intriguing story, and I suggest it to anyone.

They should make a part 2 about what happened in those days. Or even the days after all the infected start to slowly die off. Would be interesting to see another outbreak somewhere.

The Day of the Triffids is such a classic Sci Fi novel - 50 years strong - and it was pleasantly surprising to see an edgy movie like 28 Days presumably use so much of Wyndham's material (eg: entire opening sequence).<br/><br/>Although 28 Days had got all the makings of a Zombie Flick with its portents of apocalyptic doom, the message is arguably more than this. In The Day of the Triffids, the main story is not so much about the uprising of walking, carnivorous plants as placing more importance on how the survivors respond to the end of the world as we know it. At what lengths will groups of people will go to, to reforge something that is lost? How can 'normal' society be recreated in the context of what has happened? Although Wyndham is able to go into these questions in some detail (he wrote a book), 28 Days attempts to address these issues too, notably when Jim and his crew meet up with the major's lot.<br/><br/>The Day of the Triffids was read post-28 Days, and it was this book that helped me view the film in a bright new light"

(Frida and A clockwork orange are examples of movies with EVERY scene carefully and superbly produced)<br/><br/>style of speech is realistic and down-to-earth, street-like. anti comic book, i'd say. like, in pop American movies characters with over-boosted ego speak in this pathetic unrealistic style, like 'i know i'm a good guy and i'll KILL YOU, and y'know it.'

But the movie itself isn't a simple horror movie. It's way better then a horror movie. It is a realistic view on what could happen if a frightening, deadly disease would break through. How people would react. How people would try to survive. Other movies that are as frightening as this one are 'Boys don't cry' (although complete other story. But even more realistic). This movie gets an 8 from me. Irreversible (again another story) my vote = 7. Gothika ( much worse movie) Gets a 4. The Ring (unrealistic story but really frightening) Gets a 5 from me. So beware, '28 days later' is a horror movie. So if you don't like to be scared, you better don't watch it."

","Danny Boyle (director of Trainspotting) was the last person I would expect to see directing a horror movie. Especially a good one. Scratch that. A great one.<br/><br/>Shot primarily in digital camera, the movie follows a man (Jim) as he struggles to figure out just what in the world is going on after he wakes up in a Hospital and finds the world apparently devoid of all life. Stumbling around he finds his way into a church where he finally finds signs of life. Unfortunely those people he does run into in the church are infected with ""rage"" a virus released on accident by Animal Activists who did not heed the pleas of a scientist to not release a batch of chimps from their cages due to a highly infectious disease they carry.<br/><br/>From there we see Jim meet up with a few other survivors and as the film goes on, we find that the infected are not the only problem Jim and his acquaintances have.<br/><br/>Shot like a documentary the film works on many levels. It scares and at times flat out disturbs the viewer. It's not a horror movie with a ""zombie"" like theme used for an action platform. Instead it's a gritty account of survival, at times in it's most primitive form.<br/><br/>The scene where Jim is shown walking around the vacant city is brilliant. The music for the scene really sets a tone of emptiness and curiosity. One of my favorite scenes of all cinema. Ever.<br/><br/>What this film does, is show a tale of survival. The gore is not too intense, and is instead left to your imagination (i.e: Psycho, Halloween). It works that way, and Alex Garland manages to work fear, wit, and humor into his script in almost perfect harmony of each other.<br/><br/>28 Days Later is no ""zombie"" flick. Yes, the infected act like Zombies, but the movie really aims to show that when no rules are in place, we can be our own worst enemy. Great film. Do not miss it.<br/><br/>5/5. Perfect."

"The_Master_Critic","8","0","1","6 November 2004"," completely worthwhile entertainment
","28 Days Later is about a virus (RAGE) that spreads throughout Great Britain and affects people by turning them into desperate, ravenous, zombie-like monsters. Their eyes turn red, and they scream and growl as they try to rip apart any non-infected humans they can find. The main character of the film, Jim (played by Cillian Murphy), awakens in a quiet hospital 28 days after the virus is accidentally released by animal rights activists who were trying to free chimpanzee test subjects infected with the RAGE virus. The hospital, along with the rest of London, is seemingly deserted as Jim wanders aimlessly through the empty streets. Extremely similar to the opening of Vanilla Sky, this scene is perfect in creating the empty lonesome tone of the first act. The movie follows Jim as he journeys to not only find safety, but to understand what has happened to everyone he once knew and loved. I was left with one big question. If everyone infected turns into one of the 'zombies,' where was everyone??<br/><br/>Right away, I realized that no one was safe in this story. You can't assume that the characters you love will live and the ones you hate will die. One thing I really liked was that once infected, the virus would take hold of a person within seconds. This took out the traditional moments of 'Oh no, so and so is infected and no one knows  I guess we'll watch the virus slowly develop over the length of the film while building a very cheap, overused, yet somewhat effective bit of suspense.' I liked the fact that if someone was infected, you had better kill them sooner than later  or risk them turning on you. Another thing I really liked about the 'zombies' is that they do not stalk their victims by sluggishly pursuing them with a long drawn out groan. These guys are fast! They dash towards their prey while screaming and vomiting blood. It really is gruesome.<br/><br/>Speaking of gruesome, this film very much feels at times like the 'B Movies' it has borrowed from. The gore is over the top and the picture quality of the movie is really poor since it was filmed on digital video. I don't know if it was done solely for purposes of budget, or just to create a low budget gritty feel, but I can't help but wonder if it would have come across more clearly had they shot on traditional film and spared us the halo ridden blur of pixels void of any sort of detail. Then again, the movie may not have worked at all had it been shot differently. It is interesting to note that the final shots of the movie were shot on film. This is clearly significant, but to keep the review clean of spoilers I will say no more.<br/><br/>The all British cast did a fine job. The only actor I was familiar with was Brendan Gleeson who was very good as expected. The other actors may be well known in the UK, but they are all unknown in my mind, and they all did very nice work.<br/><br/>I have a new respect for director Danny Boyle. Some of the shots in this movie are downright terrifying, while others are absolutely breathtaking. The entire post-virus Britain is brilliantly realized, and some of the images will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. I don't think the filmmakers were trying to make any statements about SARS, nor were they trying to draw any other real world parallels, but it is hard not to become just a little more paranoid after having seen the film. Sure it's preposterous that a virus would turn a normal human being into some terribly violent and hopeless monster full of despair and a lust for human blood, but it does make for a suspenseful and at times shocking movie that horror fans deserve after putting up with the dreck that they usually have to settle with. (Now that was a long sentence.) It isn't the scariest movie ever, but it was a Kevin Costner cameo away from being close."

","This movie somewhat related to Resident Evil and Dawn of the Dead series. That the virus came from a certain animal and make us back to the cannibal way of humans in past times. Think running peoples that was infected by the virus looks like much of a kind zombie and running! Maybe they just want a different style of zombies' movements. Running, Jumping, climbing is much suspense than slow moving friendly man-eating guys outside your house. Another difference is that they can only move and have much energy at night. But then, they're much stronger than they look at. Poor people who had been infected. And it was different, if you the infected person had scratch you or entered their blood into your body. It will just took 30 seconds not like other that will take 1 hour. But still, the director make this film horrific and suspense. The graphics and the story is good as in its cover.

"TheOtherFool","6","0","1","19 October 2004"," Horror with a twist
","Somehow, the feel of 28 days later exceeds most horror/zombie/infection movies. If such movies have flooded the box-office these last couple of years, 28 days later is, well, 'something else'.<br/><br/>An infected monkey is freed by activists, not knowing this infection will soon spread among humans. And indeed, 28 days later, the majority of the English are infected zombie-like creatures. But somehow they past by Jim, who has been in the hospital these couple of weeks after an accident. When he wakes up, there's just empty hallways, empty streets... until he gets attacked by our growling zombies. He is then rescued by Selena and the two of them meet up with a dad and daughter, and the four of them try to make it to a, what they think, safe place.<br/><br/>Then the movie turns more psychological, and I must say it's losing a bit of the grip it had me in during the first 45 minutes or so. Although it's still better than a lot of comparable movies in this genre, I was feeling the movie kinda ran out of steam.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle tried something new, and it worked out for at least some parts, although ultimately (and not helped with the ending), I was expecting just a little bit more.<br/><br/>6/10.<br/><br/>PS Fantastic music by Godspeed You Black Emperor in the beginning with Jim wandering the streets."

"sublime501","8","0","1","10 June 2004"," Overdone premise made interesting again.
","28 DAYS LATER is the story of a terrible virus that surfaces from infected chimps and then spreads to the humans in no time flat. Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up one morning to find himself in a hospital bed, with no idea how he got there. He then finds that there is no one else in the hospital, and goes outside to find the streets of London literally empty. Naturally he is very worried about this, and soon wanders away and is saved from infection by Mark and Selena (Noah Huntley and Naomie Harris). These three team up and begin to go in search of a safe area, later meeting up with Hannah and her father Frank (Megan Burns and Brendan Gleeson). The troop gets lead of a military camp nearby, and set off to find some trace of what's left of civilization.<br/><br/>28 DAYS LATER is a smart, well-done horror flick. Though the whole infected/zombie premise is pretty overdone, this movie makes it interesting again. The ""infected,"" as they are referred to, are genuinely creepy, and the sight of the completely empty streets of London in the beginning is chilling. The film creates a tense atmosphere and rarely breaks it, which is a good thing. You can feel the characters' struggle to stay alive and well and can sympathize easily at their fright.<br/><br/>Technically, this movie is very impressive. Good acting all around from virtual unknowns, and good direction. The scenery and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking in parts, adding an ironic sense of beauty to an otherwise depleted world. The screenplay is well-written, with few cliches and little corny moments. Everything looks good.<br/><br/>Overall, 28 DAYS LATER takes an overdone premise and instead turns it into a good movie. You get that genuine horror film feeling while still managing to have a good time. A smart little movie. 8/10."
"craiglockley-1","Null","0","1","18 May 2004"," Great film - sadly a lot miss the point
","28 Days Later is a very good film. Not the best horror film ever, certainly not the best zombie film ever made, but it cannot be categorized so simply. As has been evidenced by many of the people on this board, they simply don't get the point, and as one esteemed reviewer commented, it does take repeat viewings to fully appreciate and you SHOULD buy the DVD. It contains some great cut scenes including the other two, slightly darker endings.<br/><br/>SPOILERS The main point of this film is that it's British and in some ways, other nations are alienated from understanding the subtext. For me, the main thrust is the rage in society today, particularly London. Jim was a Cycle Courier (or Organ Donor as they are known in London) who are commonly the recipients of rage in London (In fact one cut scene, shows him in his former career, contemplating on the rage of other drivers)<br/><br/>Secondly, there is what some here have described as romance in the film. I don't think this was included for the sake of having a romantic thread (both Danny Boyle and Alex Garland are far too smart to try such a blatant Hollywood technique) - it was more like two essentially lonely people thrust together by circumstance and the natural need to procreate, particularly when humanity is under threat.<br/><br/>As for the soldiers, I think a similar thing is going on - the leader is bringing women to the compound to further the race, and the soldiers are fired up with testosterone (as most British Squaddies are!)<br/><br/>28 Days later is a good effort at a British Horror and along with the recent Dog Soldiers, will go down as classics, with or without the London section."

","No Spoilers contained within!<br/><br/>This film works well, the acting is of a high quality, and it scares appropriately. Where this film really excels though is in its presentation of the characters. The film invites its audience to sympathise with the main protagonists, enables the viewer to feel the despair and encroaching madness that such a horrific event would bring to bear on any left surviving. The society left behind after this amazing event has evidently been thought about a little more than most - the audience are presented with those who choose to live alone - those who have resorted to staying in large groups - many different ways of coping from giving up to almost ignorance of what has happened. The score to the film guides the emotion also, one standout moment in the film was when the little girl witnessed *that* - it felt so real, so gut wrenchingly soul-destroying - complemented by superb directing and an emotive score.<br/><br/>Basically the best advice to give for a film that seems to split opinion like this is to just go and buy it for yourself - make up your own mind.

"matrixfighter","Null","0","1","23 December 2003"," ... not bad at all
","What I found infinitely exhilarating and perhaps even fascinating were the scenes of London without Londoners - a totally deserted Metropolis, standing in itself as an unattended museum of the achievements of capitalist civilisation.  One may see certain freshness in these scenes.  It is reminiscent of one scene from Devil's Advocate, but to see London as the desert of the Real itself, to me stands second to none. But the movie itself is loaded with bourgeoisie values, like the scene in the supermarket for instance, projecting the delights of just walking into a shiny supermarket full of `choices' (accompanied by a fairy-tale music) and just simply walking out of it with smiley faces and with no trace of any hard-earned cash involved - a very important scene.  The hilarious and the daft thing, though, is that the advertisements of Pepsi, Lilt and Tango (as the life saving source of water), Maltisers (as the necessary sugar supply), Mars, Heinz, Tablerone, Budgens, Costa Coffee, National Lottery and others could not have been more explicit. After all, somebody must have financed an £8,000,000 project, and I suspect the Royal Army did as well. Succinctly put, the moral of this story is that the hippy activists can cause an Armageddon, while the radiated GM apples are necessary for human survival. This is a British movie and, thus, it is loaded with Hobbesian British common sense.  The setting is, thus, designed to instil a horror in a Brit's heart - as Mark says, `No Government, No Police, No Army' - does that not amount to a tragedy???? Further comments: the scene of Heather's `wise' political speech is just ruinous.  The director, however, must me credited for some nicely angled shots and what they manage to capture especially inside the mansion. The `futureless' being tied with a chain like a dog has to be the black male, objectively observed and commented by two while males.  Good use of DV.  Produces an effective phenomenological sense of the immediacy of the situation. Conclusion.

","This has been the movie that I keep thinking about weeks after I have seen it. I found it a very good movie and a clever style for movies of this genre. Much more than gore and guts. The first few minutes of the movie lead you to believe its going to be only gore and guts, but just hold on and you will find that its so much more.<br/><br/>I am not sure why several have compared this movie ( or at least mentioned The Ring) to The Ring. In my opinion these movies are not in the same class. 28 days is much better, bettter story, more frightening, more believable, more original than The Ring. This is a white knuckle movie.<br/><br/>I am not saying The Ring is not good but I feel 28 days later is that special. I like how the movie was filmed and the music. It has some twists in there as someone has some creative juices flowing. If you like horror/thriller then this is a classic. I know they puke some blood in the flick but too many recent movies of this genre have me ready to puke blood out of my own eyes holes becasue they are so bad. Its a great movie and is very interesting in today's social and political environment."

","I first saw this movie at the cinema in order to avoid trick-or-treaters on Halloween, 2002.  We arrived late, and had to sit at the front, and I found the whole thing very harrowing indeed.  I'm not good at horror films!<br/><br/>Having said all that, the film contains a few beautiful moments amid the horror, and much of the filming is wonderfully artful.  Camera effects and treatments are straight from the cutting edge, the acting is quite arresting, and is carried by a good, solid, simple and utterly plausible script, which, for me, carries much greater weight by being set somewhere that means something to me: England, maybe next month.<br/><br/>The worst thing is that this film, in addition to being possibly as traumatic as spending a couple of hours watching 1969 Vietnam footage, is extremely convincing and explores a serious scientific question - what would happen if an infection broke loose which caused its victims to succumb to a homicidal rage in the space of 20 seconds?  It's provocative science-fiction in the best sense of the word.  Could we be there tomorrow?  Probably not. But 28 days later?  You'd better believe it."

"manalone923","10","0","1","1 December 2003"," Maybe not as scary as you've heard, but certainly a serious, greatly made study of humanity with definite horror moments.
","I LOVED this film. When I left the theater, I felt utter satisfaction and deep despair at the same time. That means the movie definitely worked.<br/><br/>For starters, please don't automatically label it a horror film. It isn't a slasher akin to Friday the 13th or a disturbing no-sleep fest like the Exorcist was at one time, either. What it IS is a moving human drama, very effectively capturing the despair and isolation of a world after apocalyptic disease. This is its strongest point and mood, but at the same time there are several seat-jumping moments, and there are, for lack of a better word, ""monsters"" that are around many corners. I don't anticipate many will walk away from 28 days later thinking ""wow, I was shaking in fear the whole time!"", nor do I imagine people thinking ""What a body count! All that blood and guts!""  Truth is, there are some moments of both, but they are frosting on a story that leaves you with more of a feeling of ""Wow. Loved ones can be lost, times can be impossibly desolate, people can be impossibly cruel. I'm glad to be alive, and I'm glad I live in a better world"".<br/><br/>The setting of the film is London, almost entirely free of human life due to a rapidly spread virus. The infected, the ""monsters"" of the film, are regular human beings who no longer function like regular people but instead are fast, violent, and primal, living only to eat and attack whatever they see. The virus spread wildly due to its high communicability. It transfers through blood contact, saliva, and even through the eyes. It is such that 99% of London was wiped out in 28 days, at the end of which the main character wakes up in a hospital with no idea what has happened. No one knows the answer to a more haunting question either...Is life normal outside a possibly quarantined London, or was the whole world infected?<br/><br/>The movie slowly lets us see what happens and slowly suggests answers to those questions. It unfolds not like a harsh killfest, but like poetry. We are with the main character, Jim, as he wakes up, having no idea where to go or where anyone is. He wanders the starkly empty streets, alone, hoping to find someone who can help,and somewhere to go. He encounters the infected, and he meets some people...All with their own view of their situation and ways of dealing with it. Some live to survive. Some live in despair. Some live with hope.<br/><br/>It's situations like this that are touching. Thanks in part to a wonderful score, the story gives us many moments to take in. Jim heads out to see if his parents are okay. Another man puts out a beacon of Christmas lights on his empty apartment in hopes of finding other survivors. We watch in sympathy as one person remembers a simple, pointless breakfast with the family he/she will never see again. We quietly smile in hope as someone plows their way through a dangerous roadblock through sheer determination for a better place. We close our eyes in defeat as another person who has so much hope and even more to live for still succumbs to the disease due to the most chance of situations. Moments like these- sadness, warmth, hope, despair- are rife in this film, and it is through such moments that it truly feels like a realistic account of what could honestly happen. It is a very human story, and I say that because although there are scenes of violence and death, this overcomes the boundary of ""horror flick"" by focusing most on the people, their plight, and the moments that matter to them. <br/><br/>The acting is thoroughly good as well, with everyone asking realistic questions and doing things that appeal to us in some way or another. There are some characters near the end for example who have their own idea of survival and what it takes, and even though their ideas are horrible we can still understand why they have them. <br/><br/>My only gripe with the film is minor. I enjoyed it all the way, and was satisfied by the last few frames. But the actual climactic event, which takes place in a mansion, was a little frenzied. I don't mind violence or anything, and there are sudden scenes in the rest of the film where things get wild, but the final major event is very harsh and sustained. It makes sense, it's just not as reserved as most of the rest of the film so be forewarned.<br/><br/>In all, I found this movie entirely good. Don't expect the bloodiest or scariest movie ever, but be content with some of both inside a much more mature and emotional film, and you should be happy. I definitely was, and found it one of the most thought-provoking and moving dramas, or horror films, in a long time."

"scotty-37","7","0","1","30 November 2003"," Uneven, But Interesting Horror/Suspense Movie
","28 Days Later was a good attempt to make a horror movie that had something more interesting going on than many horror movies.  The acting works, and it's not all just one big, predictable bloodbath. Though it's enjoyable, it has a number of problems.<br/><br/>********************* Spoilers Ahead **************************<br/><br/>As soon as I saw Brendan Gleeson (the dad of the little girl) I suspected he was there to get killed off since he was a sympathetic character. Unfortunately I was right--and it was too bad since he was one of the more interesting characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The tunnel scene was just ridiculous and manipulative--since there seemed to be no need to go through the easily predictable ""zombie tunnel"" when most of the streets and bridges seemed to be clean and rubble and zombie free.<br/><br/>The ""Lord of the Flies"" military enclave seriously messed up the movie for me.  I had a hard time believing that these men had gone so sex-crazed and raving mad in only a month. It was just stretching things a bit too much for me--especially since the commanding officer was smart enough to figure out that the zombies would die after a while and all the needed to do was wait it out.<br/><br/>In fact, the zombies were really so stupid that I had a hard time believing that more people hadn't survived.  All it would really take to survive was a good supply of food and water and a strong door to keep the zombies out until they starve.  They certainly weren't well organized or hard to outwit--even if they are faster than the old-school zombies.<br/><br/>This movie, as flawed as it was, came off better than a lot of horror movies I've seen.  At least we didn't see anyone getting killed during a makeout scene or any of the ultra-predictable horror cliches.  I liked that they didn't show everything that happened leading up to this state (such as with a montage), and instead left things up to the imagination. I liked the space in the movie that left you on edge waiting for something to happen rather than making everything into a long, boring, predictable fight scene.  The scenes of an empty, silent London were quite cool.<br/><br/>Overall this is an ok movie that squandered its potential to be a much better movie."

This movie, obviously hated by a lot of people, gets high marks for me for a few reasons.  Mainly, the whole overall feel of the movie is very creepy and you feel on edge watching it even when you think the characters are probably safe.  This is a welcome departure from horror movies that just scare you by going from one 'jump scene' to the next or making you see people's guts get spilled.  Also, although the concept is not original (see Charlton Heston's The Omega Man) I think it is well done in this film.  If you don't like indie-style flicks (this was shot with digital film) and like your zombies to be slow-moving and brain-feeding, than this isn't for you.

","I was really looking forward to seeing this film on DVD after I heard all the buzz about the ""alternate endings"". I was very intrigued. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The entire first half of the film I felt like I was watching a video game. It seems so contrived, the lead character walking around this abandoned city finding various clues as to what had happened. I could imagine exactly how the game would play out- read a notice on a kiosk, pick up some soda and some candy bars, meet some people that would fill in some of the pieces, then fight some creatures, collect some more supplies in an empty supermarket, etc, etc. Keep moving on, heading towards the army base,gathering more information along the way until the final climax when you have to save the women from the evil soldiers and the zombie creatures. I don't know if there is a game of this movie, but it seems to me it was created with that inevitability in mind. I feel like I've already played it. The game might be more interesting than the movie although I doubt it.<br/><br/>As far as the ""alternate endings"" go, it just seemed to me that the filmmakers just did not have any idea of how to end this film. The ending that they settled on left me saying ""huh?"" and the alternate endings, including the ""radical alternate ending"" (which is just story boards)were just stupid. I guess I was waiting for something profound.<br/><br/>There was basically no point to this movie.

"ricky-1750","Null","0","1","11 November 2003"," Generally a good film
","First, I found it completely plausible that a virus might spread in this manner.  Pneumonic plague kills in about 3 days and is symptomatic within hours of infection.  So, in this film we are faced with a virus that is symptomatic within seconds and spreads by causing the infected to become so enraged that they will fight with and/or bite another individual.  The virus is spread by blood to blood or saliva to blood contact.<br/><br/>This particular virus does not cause the infected to become the ""undead"" ... so it's not really a zombie movie ... although they are so driven to infect those who are unaffected, that one character is likely correct when he opines that the infected will starve to death after a time.  (So will a victim of any plague if they are to sick to care for themselves and their disease doesn't kill them first.)<br/><br/>What we (and the main characters) don't know is how long the infected will survive and how much of the world (other than the British Isles)  is dealing with the infection.<br/><br/>I found it interesting that the director shows us, on the one hand, the mindless infected causing pain and suffering without intending to do so, and, on the other hand, members of the military who justify the pain and suffering they are willing to inflict by telling themselves it's the only way for mankind to ""survive.""  Procreation as a justification for rape. To me that is a profound idea that goes beyond the typical sci-fi film.<br/><br/>I also found it interesting that the viewer keeps seeing a sculputure of Lacoon and his sons being strangled by the serpent.  It seems to be to be a classical reference to the beginning of the film when a lab worker tries to warn the people hoping to set the apes free from their misery that they will die and cause a disaster.  Lacoon tried to do the same for the Trojans and the gods killed him for doing so ... it was part of the vengance of the gods that Troy was destroyed.  Here you see the vengeance of the ""gods"" potentially destroying mankind, and a glimpse that the world might be better off for our absence.<br/><br/>As an aside, there is a scene in which a charater enters a church filled with corpses.  I agree with earlier posters that most of the dead were probably suicides.  Others may have died from starvation or the exhaustion caused by constant rage.  In my opinion, the few infected that are there are likely asleep until the hero calls out.  After all, they are merely infected... not dead.  There's nothing to indicate that they don't sleep from time to time (even if it's just dropping from the exhaustion the rage virus must cause).<br/><br/>In any event, I found the film fascinating and will certainly watch it again."
"epsilon3","9","0","1","15 November 2003"," Post Apocalyptic Classic
","I felt compelled to add my opinion to the comments here as this movie is being unjustly slaughtered.<br/><br/>It's not a zombie flick - if you're expecting 'Dawn of the Dead' you may be in for a let down. The people who are infected with Rage have a disease and don't eat human flesh. Sure, they run around in packs and attack the uninfected, but the film isn't about claustrophobia and cannibalism.<br/><br/>It's clearly homage to Day of the Triffids (and to a certain extent The Omega Man.) There's nothing wrong with that. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why 28 days later is being attacked here is because of people's erroneous expectations. People watch a movie trailer and think they can tell what the film is going to be like. We should learn that this isn't the case and often trailers just show the most action packed or exciting bits - I thought this was widely known!<br/><br/> To those who were disappointed when they went to see the film because they expected an out and out thriller, maybe they should have done just a little bit of research first. This is why we have the IMDB right?<br/><br/>
To an earlier reviewer who made a snide remark towards British films, perhaps it'd be worth considering how many films are made in Britain compared to the US, and what proportion of those are high quality. Britain doesn't have much of a film industry compared to Hollywood, but I could name lots of good movies from both countries (and lots of Turkeys.)<br/><br/>
******************** ***SPOILERS BELOW*** ********************<br/><br/>Those who point out holes in the plot are being a little harsh. When they drive into the tunnel, it's obvious that Frank (the driver) is suffering from a mental breakdown. Cut the guy some slack! He's just spent the last few days getting over the death of his wife (and everybody else) whilst protecting his daughter from bloodthirsty lunatics with a baseball bat and a riot shield. The guy's feeling a little crazy. Jim points out that it's a stupid idea to go underground but he's ignored.<br/><br/>In response to another point about the way the soldiers wanted to get 'laid,' this is explained by Major West as an attempt to give the men some hope of a future life that may contain some normality (a family and children perhaps.) Clearly, this isn't what happens and the soldiers have turned into callous thugs, but there is logic here. If you were the leader of a group of isolated men in a post-apocalyptic situation, would you not state that it is important to find women and attempt to build families and save the human race from extinction? In situations of extreme stress (like wars) noble men can commit terrible acts and good intentions can be warped by desperation.<br/><br/>If you look a little deeper into this movie, it becomes apparent that it's not about zombies at all, but rather about the perilous state of the human condition. We think we are civilised and 'good' but what happens to us when the excrement hits the fan? Does the 'goodness' evaporate away leaving only savagery?<br/><br/>This movie seems to be saying that we turn a blind eye to the terrible things that are going on around the world because they're not happening to us. Status quo is maintained for those that live in wealthy nations, but as soon as our the rug is pulled from under us, we turn into the same people that we see brutally killing eachother on the six o'clock news. When our security is taken away, we cease to see people as individuals...they become casualty reports. Women become incubators or objects that are easy to brutalize (Bosnia anyone?) <br/><br/>Our morals and civility are eaten away as self-preservation kicks in big time. As Jim finds out towards the end of the film, you don't need to be infected to get the rage...it's already within all of us and is waiting to come out.<br/><br/>If this is the case, should we accept our innate violence and go with it when it's needed, or should fight against it and struggle to contain our selfish desires?<br/><br/>All of the characters in the film (apart from the young girl) go through this moral crisis. Selena learns that survival isn't everything when it's at the expense of one's self respect, and Jim learns that violence is sometimes necessary and in some situations may be unavoidable.<br/><br/>For those of you that have seen Straw Dogs, a similar ethical difficulty faced by the main character. Does one use violence to prevent violence?<br/><br/>The question isn't really answered in either film. I was sickened by Jim's descent into barbarism, but wondered what I would do in his situation. Probably the same thing.....a scary thought.<br/><br/>Lots of other questions were raised in this movie and it left me thinking for quite a while. It also left me excited and repelled by the fact that it is very violent. In response to the earlier comment, which recommended skipping the first scenes if you're watching it with children, take my advice - don't watch any of this film with kids. It contains extreme violence throughout and deals with adult themes that are definitely not for the young.<br/><br/>To sum up, I implore you to not be put off by the negative comments about this movie that are expressed here. If you like intelligent films - this is one to try. Just don't watch it with your auntie Mable - she probably won't like it."

","Spoilers.  The story is OK, but not that original, except that here the real struggle is among the survivors themselves and not between survivors and the infected, as someone might think before watching the film.  The movie is not that scary, but it has good suspense.  For those people that loves suspense, I think this might be a good one, but not the best.  In terms of blood, there are, as I remember, to very bloody scenes that were good.  One when the black lady, sorry I can't remember her name, kills his friend with a ""machete"" at the beginning.  The other one was when Jim killed one of the soldiers by introducing his fingers into the soldiers eyes.  It was disgusting.  The music was good, though.  One drawback about the story occurs at the beginning.  How come a company, having top secret experiments with animals did not have a good security system in order to avoid the spread of the disease if a human becomes infected? I guess that there would not be a story then.  The other drawback for me was at the end.  I think that no one could live with the wound that Jim had, specially by being treated with a person that is not a doctor, in this case the black lady, and without all the medical devices on hand.  In conclusion, for those people looking for good suspense, the movie is good, but it you try to find a good story you might find some drawbacks.  This is why I give it 7 of 10. BTW, I did not like the alternate endings.  Even though, they are more realistic, they do not add too much to the story."

","I went into this film expecting nothing more than another ""Texas Chainsaw massacre' or 'Friday the 13th'. I was completely wrong, while it does have some of the elemnts from those films, this film is light years ahead of them. I found it to be interesting, thought provoking and very intertaining. Every film has faults, and I would consider this film as to having only a few (my biggest gripe is that infections take 10-15 seconds...no virus moves that fast..but hey it is Hollywood, or Londonwood, whatever). One striking point that I find interesting that no one has hit on it yet is the fact that the one group of 'cilivized' people we find in the story has literally lowered themselves to barbaric levels in our to survive. The major says he has pulled these men together by promising them a reward of plenty of women! To make them civilized and organized he has to promise them a reward of plenty of woemn to have their way with. So the root moral out of this movie that I got, was that even when we are reduced to the barest levels of our morality, we will still be nothing more than animals. Anyway, I found this movie to be much better than I thought it could be. Definately a movie I would recommend to others to watch, but don't go in thinking this is nothing more than a brappy slasher film, you will be disappointed as it makes you think. ;-)"

Well where the heck was the heart-pounding suspense?  Where were the thrills and chills?  Where were the goosebumps and where was that rollercoaster ride of terror?  This movie had none of that, just a few scenes with these zombies on speed coming after the survivors, but even those scenes fell totally flat because there was absolutely no build up to any of it.<br/><br/>The scenes of London completely empty were pretty cool, but by the end of the movie, it just reminded me of those scenes in Vanilla Sky and it made me think of how much more I enjoyed that movie.  About the only other positive thing I can say about this movie was that the music was pretty good, but as for the rest of the movie, I guess somehow the commercials had me convinced that this movie was going to scare the heck out of me and it didn't even come close.<br/><br/>And then there were those over-hyped alternate endings.  All three of the endings were weak, and for anyone who actually got lured in to watch the theatrical alternate ending, I feel your anger and disappointment and I didn't even buy a ticket.  The difference between the original theatrical ending and the alternate theatrical ending was so minuscule it was ridiculous.<br/><br/>To sum up this review, I'd say this movie sucked, but it didn't even inspire that much emotion, it was really just . . . blah."

","Although on initial scenes it may just be another 'end of the world' film, it has a bit more substance to it than most. It scratches the surface of the 'what if' scenario, and was done in an interesting way. It provides one with a new way of viewing Zombies, a new way of viewing the survival scenario and what inhumanity exists when humanity fights to exist (as is seen even most initially in the film, and then culminates later on).<br/><br/>Overall, the film is nothing special, and if you have a boring Sunday afternoon it would be a decent way to spend it. The action sequences are decent and the film makes you think (but only a little). The plot twists become mundane as the film progresses, and the ending is too reminiscent of other films filmed in the same vein.<br/><br/>Overall, a respectable film, but nothing truly thrilling or to be greatly distinguished."

","Very few movies have ever genuinely frightened me. ""Natural Born Killers"" was an exception, and ""28 Days Later"" is another. If anything, viewing it again recently on DVD had even more impact.<br/><br/>Maybe my having spent a lot of time in Britain had something to do with it. During the breathtaking opening scenes set in a seemingly deserted London, I kept picturing the situation that would have led to that. Seeing the main characters trying to survive and come to terms with what had happened, I kept imagining how I would behave in the same situation. Any film that can stir that kind of response has to be worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The characterization is one of the main strengths of the movie, but there are others. Music is used sparingly, but effectively. The use of digital video gives the pictures a pleasingly gritty look, in tune with what we're seeing. Violence is not shied away from, but only portrayed as and when necessary - and is used by the good guys as well as the bad.<br/><br/>The original theatrical ending is a bit conventional; the alternative, provided on the DVD, is colder and more hopeless, but more effective. The 20-second time limit - once a person is infected with the rage virus, you have, at most, 20 seconds to kill them before they turn on you - might seem a bit arbitrary, but leads to two scenes of startling emotional impact. The second of these drew a unanimous cry of ""Oh no!"" from the audience in the theater where I first saw the movie.<br/><br/>Recommended then, but not for the squeamish. Rating: 8/10."

","Although this is definitely not an original idea (99% of world is dead or non-human and the survivors try to rebuild and survive), it hadn't been done in a while and I was looking forward to this. The story sounded solid and the trailer looked good.<br/><br/>It didn't take long to lose my enthusiasm. The editing style is very obtrusive and takes away from the story. Skip-frame editing isn't exactly a new idea anyway so this isn't anything revolutionary. This movie just feels like the Director/Editor wanted the viewer to marvel at their wonderful talents when all it did was take away from experience.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the musical score is also apparently bad early on in the film. It reminded me of some of the campy horror movies from the sixties. Lots of psychadelic guitar. Maybe I should have listened to Pink Floyd instead.<br/><br/>The story doesn't have any flaws but again, more should have been done with the idea. There are also inconsistencies is the story. For instance, why are their no abandoned cars on the road? The roads are completely cleared.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if everything has been cleared, why are the main characters traveling what looks like 40km per hour on a main road/highway? It did have one good sequence near the end of the movie with the idea of how the survivors will pro-create and the morality/politics entertained from that idea but it does not save this movie. It won't take long before we start seeing this one in the bargain bins."
"sundog1","Null","0","1","3 November 2003"," Brilliant film marred by its ending
","I highly recommend this film, I think it is well made and is worth viewing even for the atmosphere alone.<br/><br/>Every once in a while a film comes along which plays eloquently, then veers in a strange inconsistent direction, most likely at the request of industry execs to assure mass audience satisfaction. What Lies Beneath was another such film.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers<br/><br/>28 Days is much more than a simple by the numbers horror flick. It addresses themes of paranoia in society, and the dangers that the paranoia can yield. It also addresses the danger of power in a heightened state of fear. On that level, it works very well as a commentary on the current political climate in our world.<br/><br/>From the start, Danny Boyle poses a non-conventional approach to the story. His use of Digital Camera, male as a sex object (as opposed to female), enlightened & strong female protagonists, the destruction of foreshadowing (the 4 surviving horses), etc.<br/><br/>In all respects the beginning carries all the marks of a fiercely independent film, with enough atmosphere to burn.<br/><br/>All this said, the last 20 minutes of the movie feel really cheap. Rather than continue to break convention, Boyle chooses an ending which surely is a crowd pleaser. And even after seeing the alternate endings, something still doesn't feel right. And all I could keep thinking is how I would have liked it to end differently.<br/><br/>Romero's Night of the Living had a daring, disturbing, unconventional ending -- especially for 1968, but of course NOTLD was an independent film... then I looked at the 28 days box & saw the FOX VIDEO logo & realized that beneath it all, it is still a big studio movie... so the ending has unfortunately been comprimised.<br/><br/>Even with the additional endings featured on DVD (and probably because of them), the film feels unstable. The viewer is left with uncertainty of the director's vision & statement. So adding the ""alternate"" endings to the contrived studio ending just leaves more confusion as to Boyle's original message. And this is upsetting because the rest of the film plays out so perfectly.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, my personal gripes aside, I still think it's a brilliant movie and quite enjoyable as a whole. The greatest disappointment is that a film that would strive so hard to break convention would slide carelessly back into it at the end."

Basically, this movie takes Romero's Dead trilogy and condences it to 2 hours, sometimes lifting entire scenes from the other movies.

The heroine lead has a strong dynamic to her, until she becomes a second fiddle in the last part of the movie.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!! What left me disgrunted the most about this movie was the ending, or the two endings, as promoted on TV. The ""depressing ending"" isn't depressing as it is wasteful, as it serves no other point than to end on a down note, without any tragic elements or reason whatsoever. It's a stupid marketing ploy. If this movie wanted to be depressing and still be good, it should have ended with the female lead shooting the male lead after he brutally murders one of the millitary commanders. This would make sense, since he, although human, is acting monstrously, and she told him earlier she would kill him in a second if she thought he changed. Instead she seems to accept the fact he's crossed over into being a human monster and, after this grisly scene, they quickly have a cornball kiss. Please. Give me a break.

Sure, they survived, but then what. The part that got me the most antsy and in a way scared while watching the movie was during the army base section because the ""zombies"" weren't the evil - humans were. More specifically the scariest threat ended up not being the zombies, it became the army whose job and purpose is to be the heroes that save people.

The ending involves scenes cut from the same bolt of horrofics  as Apocalypse Now, complete with a shirtless protagonist in military fatigues stalking a crazed military commander in the rain. The zombie parallels are all cosmetic and this film plays out less as ""run and gun"" monster chase than it does as a post apocalyptic reflection bearing some similarities to On The Beach, by Nevil Shute.

","While the production values of this film are quite good, it strongest point is in the screenwriting, though this breaks down a bit toward the end. Still, for the first 1+ hours, there is a great deal of brilliance.  One of the biggest complaints I keep reading here and on other message boards is how so little is explained about the virus and how it works, but that is why this movie is so clever.  The main characters really don't know what it is, so they cannot explain it.  Neither are they ""experts"" in the field virology that can break it down and come to a conclusion.  They have unanswered questions just as we do ... and they are the same questions.  For the moment, their struggle is just to stay alive.<br/><br/>It is for this reason that this movie is mostly effective.  Because we can't understand the virus, we can't extrapolate a plan of action.  Thus, the main characters are forced to blunder their way through to survival without knowing exactly what lies around the next corner ... or how long they may live.  It is this that creates the tension in this film which is not a horror film, but a psychological thriller with sci-fi underpinnings.  Even when the foursome is watching the horses, there is hope, yet a sense of desperation as well.  Driving down the empty highway there is desolation. There are so many subtle maneuvers in the script that it is difficult to see them all in one viewing.  <br/><br/>One thing I did like about this movie in particular is the fact that it was not nearly as bloody as I expected.  One question I cannot answer, nor did I see anything that might explain it, is: Why didn't the Rage victims attack each other?  Hmmmmm?  Might have to sit through it again to see if I can catch a hint there.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie has some flaws, but is suspenseful, as it should be, and is worth the price of a rental, just don't expect it to be a ""horror"" movie as it is advertised."

","28 Days Later definitely lives up to its reputation as an effective horror film. From the start, it establishes an atmosphere of gloom and chaos that never lets up. What I found very interesting about it was its portrayal of human instincts and evils that we all can possess in our darkest hours. This was not the kind of zombie film I was expecting, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. If you can get past the look of the movie, it is one hell of a ride.

","A terrible virus affecting the mind and the body has spread like wildfire. The virus is pure rage, blocking out all other thoughts and affecting the movement and of the infected. In 20 days, it has managed to take over all of London, and destroy and hope for a goverment or police. That's putting it lightly. There is no one left, no gangs, no nothing really.  28 Days Laters, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital. In a very impressive scene, he finds out all of London is deserted. He learns something bad happened. Soon after he is attacked by some infected, and is rescued by two other survivors (un-infected), Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). However, the plot changes quickly (generally three times throughout the movie), but I will let you see it for yourself.<br/><br/>   This movie has amazing performances. The characters change as different experiances affect them. The direction is great, and the use of digital camera throughout most of the movie gives the film a gritty, tough urban feel to it. <br/><br/>  The horror is terrifying, because of the realism of the characters involved. This is no Jason movie, as we see in the beginning when Jim almost cries in fear from running from some infected. <br/><br/>  However the genius of this film does not lie in the horror. It lies in the film's study of the human soul. We see that the rage of the infected is inside all of us, and in the film, the most horrible acts seem to be commited by the un-infected. Also interesting is how real the threat of an epidemic is. <br/><br/><br/><br/>       This is a great film, and should be enjoyed and studied by all."

","*28 Days Later* was the most horrifying movie I've ever seen. No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I'm not being too easy on it. I am being honest--the simple fact is, no other movie has ever terrified me quite like this one. This film isn't jump-out-of-your-seat scary (although there are a couple of surprise ""Boo!"" parts), rather it is burrowing-under-you-skin frightening.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was perfect, the writing smart, the story horrifying (and somewhat plausible, despite the unlikely nature that a virus would change someone that fast) and the direction raw and crisp.<br/><br/>
I often complain about the crappy world we live in, but when seeing a world as depicted through this movie, it renews your gratefulness of the status quo. Things could be a lot worse.<br/><br/>Kudos to Danny, Alex, and company for a job well done!"

","This film is something I wouldn't have thought possible.  A zombie movie that forces you to think???  That's right!  This movie actually has depth, while retaining and entertaining characteristic.  Not to say it's not flawed, but it's really good.  I'm not one to usually go for zombie flicks, but this film didn't try to even focus on them.  Much of it deals with a world where there is NO ONE (zombie or human).  AND just when you think zombies are the 'real' danger; ***spoiler*** (slightly) here comes the military.  NOW who's the monster here???  Very well done on creating monsters to take a look at humanity's darker side.<br/><br/>All the performances were quite realistic, and when there was fear it wasn't mindless histaria like you'd see in MOST zombie (or other horror) films.  It was the real kind of fear that spurs us to fight for survival.  As opposed to sitting and screeching without any action.  I especially thought that the actor who played 'dad' did really well.  And Seleena's actress.<br/><br/>If you want to know what might happen if zombies were thrust into the 'real' world, this is the movie to see.<br/><br/>ALSO, I like ALL the endings portrayed on the DVD.  The mind of this movie's creator seems to still have that edge (having seen Trainspotting) I know feel compelled to see other of his films.

","**********Possible spoilers***************<br/><br/>After several weeks of mulling it over, I finally got around to sitting down and viewing Danny Boyle's 2002 hit 28 Days Later. I had a lot of apprehension going into this film due to the fact that I was a huge fan of Mr. Boyle's first three films ( Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, and  A Life Less Ordinary) , as well as a huge fan of Zombie movies. With the buzz on this film , my expectations were pretty high, and I could not stand being let down . Thankfully I wasn't.<br/><br/>28 Days Later could best be described as the thinking mans zombie movie. It is a literate post-modern take on the genera. Gone are the voodoo and toxic waste the we settled for in the past, these zombies are the by-product of experimentation on animals. In the film a group of animal rights activists break into a lab to liberate some animals, unfortunately they also liberate a blood-born virus that induces a zombie-like rage. Within 10 to 20 seconds of contact with an infected person's bodily fluids you are infected as well. Within 28 days all of Britain has succumbed to the rage-virus.<br/><br/>Enter Jim, our films protagonist (deftly  portrayed by Cillian Murphy), he has just awakened from a coma into this world and must cope with a world who's rules of survival have changed. Eventually he hooks up with a small band of survivors who try to find someway out of this madness.<br/><br/>Alex Garland's script capture is highly inventive and although the dialogue tends to be predictable, he does add a nice darkly comic edge. Anthony Dod Mantle paints an amazing picture on screen that is at the same time rich and vibrant and dark and foreboding. Some of the acting is below par, particularly from the soldiers of blockade 21. However, Naomie Harris is superb as the pharmacist cum tough-girl Selena.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws 28 Days Later is still an excellent film. It takes many of the conventions of zombie movies and turns them on their collective ears in order to create a swift , yet tense film. It's one of a few recent western made horror films to truly pack a punch in the scare department. All and all, I'd have to recommend 28 Days Later to any fan of the genre and to movie-goers  looking for something unexpected."

Unlike many ""horror"" movies, we care about the characters. Many elements from Garland's previous work comes into play here. The Infected may or may not be the biggest threat to our small band of heroes, but when the world is coming to an end, can you really trust anybody?<br/><br/>People who complain about this movie simply don't understand it... and the ending is NOT tacked on, but a brilliant resolution.

","It is hard to beat a great movie/book about post-apocalyptic life.  Alas Babylon, the book, and Omega Man, the movie are examples. It is just incredibly engaging to think of surviving and rebuilding in a world stripped of unearned comfort and phoniness--particularly now, in the most comfortable and the phoniest time in history.  28 Days Later knows the landscape pretty well, and is good, but it is not great.  I give it a 7.5, a notch below Dawn of the Dead, mainly because Dawn was more consistently  exciting and scary, and its serious themes were just as good.  28 Days Later was  good, but I see no real reason to see it again.  Among its flaws (**may contain spoilers**): Not enough dangerous encounters with the infected, no real footage of the riotous final days in England, and an excessively quick, unearned ending. Also, why the hell didn't the main guy grab a gun from some dead soldier when he was running through the house in the end.  He is no Chuck Heston, and he should have paid for that mistake.  The gouging the eyes out scene was excessive, and also unearned. Lastly, the movie gives a subtle encouragement to use illegal drugs, without giving an argument as to why.

","I was spending several months in Bristol almost two and a half years ago when this film hit British Cinemas. It wasn't until American cinemas received the film that I happened to see it. I was certainly missing an intense experience. Horror is the poorest of all genres. That is to say, there are fewer decent films in the horror genre than in any other genre. I have only one expectation from a horror film - I want to walk out of the dark theatre and drive home looking over my shoulder the entire way. I want to go back to my empty home and spend the night sleeping with my back against the wall. 28 Days Later delivered just such an experience. The film is very stylised in its filming and directing. The various low-grade films provide a harsh, more realistic look. The atmosphere of fear is perfectly developed. This film did not consist merely of the long string of sudden surprises that usual make a horror film. There was much that was genuinely scary. I especially found the chapel scene to be so. As the film moves toward its second half, the focus is taken away from the infected and placed upon the drama of human interactions in this crisis. If the film had a weak point, this was it. By the time the infected appear again for the penultimate sequence, this focus shift had become so resolute that the infected chasing through the manor held little of its previous intensity. As a whole it was the most enjoyable horror film I have ever seen. I spent two nights with my back against the wall."

","As I'm reading the other comments, I think a lot of people missed the point. It's not about flashy Hollywood blood and gore, not about Hollywood baby food for the brain, and it is not about two people trying to ""save the world"".<br/><br/>I though the film was amazing. No sex scenes to take away from the movie, and surprise surprise, the two main characters _did_ not sleep together.  The Infected were not in your face, but just there to scare you and keep you wondering when the next attack will be. The characters were magnificent. The 'traumatic childhood/accident' was not in play, (as it is in almost every anime and what not) giving the characters their own uniqueness.  They didn't live in the past, the information was given to us on a need to know basis - making the movie mass use the gathering of cells known as the brain. The effects used to make the Infected stand out were well thought off and brought extra creepiness to the movie. When the group did make it to Manchester, the military presence was a bit of a disappointment. I thought that a international film could step away from the army saviors. I was wrong - the twist with the British military was well thought of (and was not Garlands futile attempt at making a fashion statement) that brought the audience for another spin. The scene where Jim comes to rescue the girls, in  my opinion, was one of the most spectacular horror/suspense movie scenes. On a final note: It was refreshing to see an international film in theaters that wasn't ""americanized""."

"Nigel St. Buggering","6","0","1","19 August 2003"," A stunning setup that loses momentum
","I find myself more than a little puzzled at all this talk that ""28 Days Later"" has reinvented the zombie film.  I would expect, at the very least, that a reinvention would bring new elements to the formula.  There's little here we haven't seen before, much of it in ""Night of the Living Dead"".<br/><br/>But let's start with the good stuff, which, appropriately, is at the beginning.  The first act is a stunning piece of cinema.  The sight of London completely abandoned is arguably creepier and more disturbing than anything else in the film.  The cinematography employed while our hero Jim wanders empty streets searching for any sign of life is beautifully done, which is all the more amazing considering the use digital video.  Once we're finally given a glimpse of the Infected, they don't disappoint.  Scenes in which the Infected attack are brutal and harrowing; these are not the shambling, easily-outrun zombies of yesteryear.  They are quick, sometimes stealthy, and often extremely frightening.  And refreshingly, when Jim encounters survivors, they have only as much information as uninformed survivors would realistically glean from the situation.  The dialogue, as much as the surroundings, gives us a properly bleak view of their chances.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this promising start fails to pay off much.  The second act is filled with a great deal we've seen before in this type of film.  While it is done very well in places, it begins to feel more predictably mainstream as the movie wears on.  The maverick feel of the first act slips away, and is eventually replaced with a familiarity I found disappointing.<br/><br/>**Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>On the plus side, characters ask many of the questions that audiences would ask.  Won't the Infected eventually starve to death?  How could the infection cross oceans?  Has England simply been quarantined until the plague plays itself out?  These are good moments.  However, the revelation that the survivors can be worse than the ""undead"" is something that we've seen many times before.  Granted, the dialogue here is better than usual, particularly the Sergeant's speech about ""people killing people"", but it's still all very familiar.<br/><br/>However, it's the third act that thoroughly lost me.  The movie has given us an everyman hero, an ordinary guy lost in a hopeless situation.  Why then are we meant to believe that he is suddenly capable of becoming an unstoppable killing machine who can take on nine armed and trained military men?  I understand that we've seen the awakening of his ""killer instinct"", and that male territoriality and mating instincts have been triggered, but isn't that also true of the soldiers?  I simply found it all very difficult to swallow.  This series of events also cheats the character of Selena, who was shown to be the tough, practical survivor early on, on Whom Jim relied. In the final moments, she suddenly becomes a helpless victim, relying on Jim to come and rescue her.  I felt that the characters had become other people, only because the story required them to.<br/><br/>Finally, the much-talked-about alternate ending.  It appears at the tail end of the credits, preceeded by the words ""what if"".  Sadly, if this ending were the one originally presented, it might come as a shock, and leave the film with a final note of surprise.  But with the first ending fresh in one's mind, it's almost impossible not to know exactly what the alternate ending is, effectively destroying any impact it might have had.<br/><br/>**End of spoilers**<br/><br/>In the final balance, I give ""28 Days Later"" a positive score based on its considerable early strengths.  But the pedestrian middle and the unlikely finale do bring it down.  6 out of 10."

","Speaking as someone who was raised on horror films, 28 Days Later is definitely more then your average gore fest. 28 Days Later is the best film of the summer thanks to the great acting of the entire cast (especially Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson), a great plot and wonderful cinematography. In one of the opening scenes rather then just telling the audience that London is deserted, the director Danny Boyle actually showed them with stunning establishing shots.<br/><br/>Aside from just being a great film, 28 Days Later raised an interesting question about society. Within a month of the new society being formed by a group of soldiers, it had begun to repeat the same flaws as the old society. This can be illustrated by the attempted rape of Selena and Hannah and the attempted murder of Jim.<br/><br/>Another great touch on the part of the film makers was the idea of having the virus totally take control of the victim within 20 seconds, leaving out the tired old plot twist of having a main character infected but not telling the other members of the surviving group.<br/><br/>Like any film there were some problems, mainly the lack of information given to the audience about the virus, but since the story is told through people with little information themselves one could argue that the audience was given as much information as the people trying to survive. All things considered, this was a great film and I think that once this summer is over people will look back and realize that it was the best picture of the summer and the best horror film in years."

","I saw this film at a film festival about 5 months or so ago, but since it's just now received a wide US release, I figured I'd post my thoughts. First off, I'd like to put out there I love horror films probably more than any other genre of film, and I really enjoyed Trainspotting and The Beach. Soooo...lets put those 2 elements together, and something great should come out, right?<br/><br/>Not exactly....<br/><br/>This movie is pretty awful. It starts off amazingly enough. The first 45 minutes are great. I was really drawn in, and was expecting to come out of this film with a good experience. But things began to go downhill, and quick.<br/><br/>The first 45 mins are a solid horror outing. There are some great scares, and an excellent atmosphere. Then we move into the second phase of the film, which is a road trip across the UK. Any horror or suspense, or just about anything really entertaining is lost here. But whatever, the movie hit a bump, and the climax should be better.<br/><br/>Not so. This is the worst part of the film. Here we turn a zombie horror flick into a military operation. At this point, the zombie's become null. The whole point of the film is lost. Instead of the zombie's being the problem, it's now the soldiers, and this is where the climax happens.

","Another horror movie very much in the same mold as Resident Evil, 28 days later... goes a step beyond the boring limits that RE created. I´m not going to comment on the facts that make this film a complete waste of time (others have previously done it), so I´m going to point out a couple of 'brilliants momments': **SPOILERS** - I wonder why Selena had so much fun when they get to the supermarket in their getaway to Manchester. She had the whole London at her dissposal, but until that momment she had conformed with cokes 'rich on sugar'... - For the whole movie, you watch how the virus is so easy to infect (see Frank´s death). But, right at the end, when Jim finish his 'evolution' from simple messenger to soldier of elite, he had a passionate kiss with Selena. Not that I have anything against love, but I suppose that with its face covered with infected blood it wasn´t a very good and healthy move by Selena... Obviously, I don´t recommend this movie to anybody, but it´s fair to say that the truly fans of that kind of movies will probably enjoy this film. In fact, if you wipe out the poor acting, the ridiculous screenplay and the complete absence of intrigue (you know all the way who´s going to live and who´s going to be a little more raged) you can fairly say that this is a good movie..."

Most scary movies are contrived, full of stereotypes and are poorly made.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see one that breaks the mold.<br/><br/>While 28 Days Later contains a good portion of the stereotypes almost necessary for any chiller, (a main character stupidly venturing off alone into that dark building (attic, basement, alley-way) where he's sure to find nothing but trouble) we are fortunately free (for the most part) of the more painful clichés.<br/><br/>28 Days' high points are its intriguing story, creative directing, and above all, the coolest, most scary zombies ever to be seen. The characters are relatively well developed, the plot features several twists and turns to keep it interesting, and. did I mention the zombies?<br/><br/>Top rate spookfest for fans of the macabre and normals alike.<br/><br/>[By the way, if you are planning on seeing this movie again for the alternate ending, it was highly disappointing and not even edited into the end of the film.

"chrisamacpherson","10","0","1","27 July 2003"," Wonderfully written and directed.
","Firstly, my hat goes off to Alex Garland for writing such a well rounded story.  This has a bit of everything from love to a great amount of violence and bloodshed.  The cinematography on this film was great.  The way it was shot, and edited added to the film greatly and gave it more of an ""on edge"" feel.  The acting was beautifully done as well.  In reading ""The Beach"" not long ago, and never seeing the movie, then seeing 28 Days Later you can definitley see the link between the two main characters as well.  The writing for this film was superb as I have already said.  If you are interested in a great film for a few good jumps and scares this is a great one.  The entire story was great, there were no flaws, there were no questions left.  Hell, I even went to see it again this evening, just for the alternate ending (which I'm going to have to say licked my balls).  I mean, why try and improve on an already great thing."
"innergrowl","10","0","1","27 July 2003"," Great movie
","I have to say that I love this film. A lot of people are saying that it is not good, because of it's low budget. That is not true at all. The film quality is as great as any other film you have seen. The acting in it is portrayed wonderfully and the script is good as well. One of the things that I like about the movie is that ( in my case at least) it gets you attached to the characters. A lot of films will have a good plot, as this one does, but do not leave you feeling much about the characters. I think one of the things about Jim was when he went to his parents house and found that picture with a note on the back. It really made him seem more realistic as he takes the picture and becomes so upset. I gotta say, he was my favorite character. I also like how Selena develops and becomes more caring as time goes on. Frank is just plain nice, and Jim even refers to him as "" dad"" at one point in the film. I do have to say though, I prefer the first ending to the second one that is now being shown. The second one just doesn't cut it for me. So all in all, this movie is one that that has a great plot, great characters, and a well designed script. I definitely recommend it."

"recyclehumans","9","0","1","23 July 2003"," At times derivative, but overall a brilliantly realized film.
","28 DAYS LATER is currently my favorite film of the year (this may not be saying much given the slate of dreck we've been force-fed so far, but I assure you it means I absolutely loved the film), and probably will be when 2004 rolls around.<br/><br/>Yes, there are elements of the film that are derivative.  This cannot be avoided -- out of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of genre films over the many years, elements from some are bound to be inspiring to a filmmaker.  What matters is how those elements are used in the film, and how they are turned on their ears to become something fresh and interesting.  28 DAYS LATER does this in spades.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle, working with striking cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, creates a beautifully bleak and barren world, devoid of civilization and life (even the streets are empty -- not very realistic, but a strong symbolic image of the isolation we're meant to feel).  The use of DV adds a powerful edge to the film, not for its documentary feel, but for the feel of the story and characters themselves.  Boyle also surrounds himself with incredible talent, including the immeasurable Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and composer John Murphy.  Alex Garland's script is often strong and intense and his character moments meaningful, though his dialogue occasionally falls a bit flat.<br/><br/>Never boring or stale, the film saves its scares and thrills.  The scares do not come often at all, so when they do, their intensity hits hard.  It of course helps that the Infected are by far some of the most frightening ""monsters"" yet seen in the past few decades -- their almost inhuman speed and fury jumps off the screen when they're given their few moments to shine.  In fact, the expanses of time where no obvious moments of danger occur are the most creepy -- the emptiness and quiet of London and surrounding areas is enough to unsettle, and that silence in itself is frightening as hell.<br/><br/>This is a striking piece of filmmaking that is bound to become a modern horror classic (though I would never classify it as horror).  With great performances and technical craftsmanship, this is a film that does what so few thrillers or horror films do -- it tells a story about characters and asks tough questions about just what kind of world we live in."
"leonardo-24","9","0","1","25 July 2003"," Intelligent, scary, well acted film
","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>Like other reviewers who really enjoyed this film, I would like to comment on all the negative remarks posted on IMDB. If one considers who the target audience is for the standard Hollywood horror flick, (young males) then it's really not that surprising that so many people didn't like 28 Days Later. Let's see: there was no bad acting, no senseless gore, no big-breasted bimbos running in the woods being chased by a zombie, no gratuitous sex scenes, in fact, no female nudity of any kind. However, there was plenty of male nudity, including a full frontal shot of the lovely Cillian Murphy. I heard and witnessed the uncomfortable comments and reactions from some of the audience members to the opening scene where the lead character, Jim, wakes up completely naked in a hospital, a rare sight in American movies.<br/><br/>Instead, Danny Boyle has created a thoughtful, intelligent, and well acted film that uses the devastation created by a virus to explore the human condition with all its flaws, weaknesses, and penchant for violence. The movie is filled with wonderful, haunting scenes, I was especially impressed by the opening shots of Jim aimlessly wandering through an abandon London, and by the sight of Manchester burning in the horizon as the survivors reached the army check point. One of my favorite moments was when Jim, Selena, Hannah, and Frank go shopping in an abandoned super market, and for a brief moment forget about the dangers awaiting them.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch, Brendan Gleeson as Frank and Christopher Eccleston, as Major Henry, were particularly effective, while Cillian Murphy turned out to be a huge revelation: a talented, beautiful, young actor, with terrific screen presence. <br/><br/>For those disappointed by 28 Days Later, I suggest you go see Freddy vs. Jason, the trailer I saw promises all the prerequisite gore, stupidity, and bimbos your little hearts desire."

Still the story, about a man who wakes up from a coma to discover most of London has been wiped out by a plague that has turned the survivors into zombies.. is actualy pretty good.. The mostly unknown performers are capable and the suspense builds properly, as main characters become zombiefied without notice...

Probably because it could really happen and probably because Boyle did not use cartoon like computer monsters, but real people and real ideas to send goose bumps up your spine. The cast was absolutely charming and they kept you completely engaged every second of this creepy yet visually and emotionally satisfying film. <br/><br/>I have to say, I've been impressed with the movies this summer (although technically this was originally released in 2002) -- and this one is no exception! Of course I could only expect a lot when I learned Boyle directed it - he has a gift for hypnotizing his film viewers, and I certainly am not immune to his powers - nor do I want to be!<br/><br/>""28 Days Later"" opens with animal activists who free caged apes - little do they know that the monkeys are no ordinary monkeys, but monkeys with a contagious disease. The film follows Cillian Murphy's character after he wakes up in a hospital, naked as the day he was born, to find London evacuated due to an infectious rage among its people that has ravaged the city, as well as other parts of the globe -how far and to what extent we, the audience member, never really learn. But that's not important - the scenario is instantly believable and we are enthralled with the plot right from the get go. <br/><br/>The thought that each one of us, stripped away from rational by a simple illness, can turn into a murderous savage is a hard one to stomach - but also a very intriguing one that can inquire us to determine how far our morals really go when there is no society and when there are only two options - death or survival. <br/><br/>So even if you are a horror flick veteran and an infected won't freak you out - this movie is not one to miss and not one to be taken lightly!"

This is humanity in the 21st century - no more retarded characters, no screaming ""don't go in there!"" at the screen, and, to be sure, it is scary as hell.<br/><br/>Being a girl, I would be remiss if I didn't mention all the cute boys - Christopher Eccleston is always terrific, even if he is totally unappreciated in Hollywood, and the lead, Cillian Murphy, is not only hot, he can act, too.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson's career speaks for itself - Tailor of Panama, The General, and Butcher Boy are some definite highlights, and both the girls, Naomie Harris, and Megan Burns are wonderfully real.<br/><br/>Technically, 28 Days Later is, quite possibly, the first film ever to transcend the visual limitations of DV, via its powerful story-telling and Brian Eno's strong musical score.

","Tedious.  This movie had the potential to be so much more than it came out to be.  The camera-work was so annoying, the direction was pretty pitiful and the story was boring.  The idea of a ""rage"" disease wiping out the human race, leaving a few survivors is interesting - but instead of fighting off zombies, why not add something about reconstructing the human race, rebuilding society?  It's as though the writer started off with a point, but decided to transform it into a horror film and somewhere in between ran out of money.  And if he was going to make a horror movie - do it right! There were so many instances where audiences are relaxed and not expecting a zombie (sorry, an infected) to jump out and attack; instead it's as though the director wants to show you when one is coming so you can brace yourself by showing a shaky camera running at a victim.  The music also made no sense - terrifying sequences usually don't involve a guitar and drum background. I'm sure most would agree that the 3 sequences that occur in the last five minutes leave a lot of unanswered questions; though by that point I could have really cared less.

Apparently there were two DPs: one quite competent, even inspired.  Then when the action scenes happen, a completely different cinematographer seems to take over.  Scenes that should/could be terrifying are sunk by being shot in Confuse-o-vision, a process closely related to Incomprehensoscope.  As a result, we hear loud bad noises, see flashes of movement of some sort, and basically HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL WHAT IS HAPPENING.  The infected ones seem to have been given some very intriguing--and consistent--choreography.  So why compound and confuse all their hard work with an equally spastic camera?  Makes no sense.  SHALLOW GRAVE had such strong simple storytelling--such clear communication to its audience.  I am much more affected/involved when a film lets me in on what's happening (call me crazy).

This was a solid film that I enjoyed watching, because of the script's logical course. I definitely recommend seeing it with a similar lack of expectations.<br/><br/>Now for the nit-picking. I did go in expecting to see a horror film, as advertised. I did not, but I did see a film that is somewhat difficult to categorize. Keep that in mind, as you go to see Danny Boyle's latest directing venture. The directing was wonderful, by the way. Also, there are quite a few artistically incredible shots you have to see on the 'big screen'. However, this film will leave you with a lot of questions. Perhaps, the original script was slim or something happened in the editing process. The bottom line is that this film seems to substitute explanation for action. Now, I don't like too much explanation in movies. I'm smart enough to figure things out, but I'm not psychic. 'What do you mean rage?' may be one of the questions you leave with. I'm not going to give much (if any) of the story away, but they could have thrown some more bones to the audience. Maybe, it was the writer's and/or editors' intent to leave these holes to the viewer's imagination to fill. The seeds could have been bigger or led to more complex solutions, though. You'll know what I'm talking about, when you see it. Aside from lack of any decent explanation in the film, I really did enjoy watching it and the ending is more-or-less open ended.<br/><br/>

After reaching it, the outcome grows ugly but in the end their saviors come and the movie closes on a happy note.<br/><br/>I loved Jim's performance in this movie and I also thought that the daughter, Hannah, was portrayed quite well.  The characters are believable and they react as anyone would do in those situations.  And for those who complain that this is not a zombie film, well you are right, but I am glad that it is not and that it turned out to be something better than that. It had much more important themes, the most important to me was that even though the world can be ravaged by such a horrible disease, that human beings can still be horrible to each other.  It's true in those times, and it is true now.  Overall, I give this movie a 8 out of 10 and I was glad to watch it.  I will buy it once it comes out.  Until then...later"
"twgame","8","0","1","13 July 2003"," Not a Zombie Movie!
","First, let me say I think this is a terrific film. I haven't been so on-edge in a theatre in quite some time, at least for the first 2/3 of the story. Once they get to the military outpost it loses its steam, I think.<br/><br/>Several images and scenes remain in my mind though, like when the guy is walking through his old house with candle in hand and you see the outside POV and the thing starts rushing him. Cool. Also liked how he first saw the jet flying overhead. Loved the look of the film as well.<br/><br/>However, I don't think the ""things"" in the film are ZOMBIES. A Zombie is a dead person who is brought back to life. That does not happen in this film. These things are infected. Once you kill them, they're dead. So if you're bit by one, sure you'll be infected too, but if a thing KILLS you, you're dead, end of story- no ZOMBIES.<br/><br/>A crucial and distinct difference."

","Possible Spoiler!!!<br/><br/>This movie made no sense.<br/><br/>If the uninfected, know that the infected have no organization, never use weapons, and are basically enraged biting machines why don't they use that to their advantage?<br/><br/>Why don't the uninfected get guns.  Why don't they just drive out into the country in a large industrial machine?  Why don't they go into one of London's many police station and grab their loud speaker equipment and call out for and organize other uninfected people.<br/><br/>Finally, the uninfected, made no study of the infected.  Did they bite only once to spread the infection?,  Did they have any language skills?<br/><br/>The only thing that kept me at all interested in the movie, was counting opportunity after opportunity missed by the uninfected to take simple measures to survive.<br/><br/>I compare this movie to invasion of the body snatchers from the late 1950's where the uninfected learn the methodology of the disease, much more interesting."
"boondocksaint20","5","0","1","15 July 2003"," Starts off great, but then begins an unfortunate suck-fest
","28 days later is one of those movies I hoped would live up to its reviews. It is few and far between that you see a horror movie come out that is praised as much as this one and truly delivers.  I honestly can't remember when critics have now, ubiquitously compared a movie as frightening as the Exorsist and their claims to have been true.  Unfortunately, their claims about this one were mostly false.<br/><br/>I won't go so much into plot developments...but the first half of this movie works pretty well.  We are given only the bare minimum of the source of the virus...which in this case, is okay, but just barely.  We are given incredibly great isolated shots of a dead city and a man left alone.  Jim, the main character, eventually finds a small group of people who eventually seek shelter with a squad of soldiers who are broadcasting a signal for survivors.  Through their trek to find the soldiers, the survivors encounter the occasional situation of the undead or the remnants of a lost society. Great direction, wonderful feeling of claustrophobic isolation, intense feeling of futile dread...totally high caliber material here...  So far the movie works better than great...however, the movie begins to truly suck once the survivors reach the soldiers.<br/><br/>As a horror movie, this one is really not that scary unless you have a more vivid imagination than I do (and that's saying a lot).  The scares derived from this one are from loud staccato 'JUMP' scares, not so much tension or fear.  Though there are at least two geniune scares in the first hour, the rest of the movie falls into the category of mediocre during its second half, which should have been, given the story, its most exciting half.<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but survival horror is survival horror.  Dawn of the Dead did this perfectly.  28 Days did not.  True, the soldiers were acting immoral, and I did feel for the women that they were trying to seduce in order to continue the species, but the finale, where the soldiers are the bad guys, in my opinion, truly sucked.  The movie was so interesting with the soldiers cooped up in that castle, that when they made it clear that they wanted the ladies for themselves, the rest of the movie simply falls apart.  There is a lot of holes in the plot that proceed this, and eventually, it becomes a story about Jim, trying to save the two women from the very people that would be their best chance at survival.  Sure, rapists are the worst form of life, and given the situation, who wouldn't at least think of wanting a 'piece of action', but I wasn't truly convinced that the soldiers suddenly turned this way in the story.  They were not portrayed as evil until the screenwriter say so, which ultimately leads to unconvinving assumptions. They are fine one minute, and the next, they turn into unconvinving savages that the script demands be wiped out.  I also was not convinced by Jim's sudden 'Heart of Darkness' spin that was only hinted at when he bashed a zombie off screen with a baseball bat earlier in the film.  Plus, we are given precious few insights about Jim's character that would promote even the slightest hint of simpathy of him.  What ends up is a bunch of 'faces' struggling to survive, and we simply watch to see which 'faces' end up surviving.<br/><br/>If they were trying to convey a story about the struggle of 'humanity' even in its darkest hour, the last 30 minutes failed to convey said message.  All we have is a lack of explanation, a sudden mutiny, or change in character that causes the main character to escape and seek rather sadistic vengeance on the soldiers.  That is the grand finale, so whether you like this movie or not will be based totally upon your involvement in this movie 30 minutes before the finale.  I for one was pretty engrossed with it, until it became totally unrealistic, and just labeled the soldiers as 'bad guys' b\c the script called for it.  Sorry, but that didn't cut it for me.  I just didn't buy the utter stupidity of people during the last half an hour, but maybe others will, and in fact prove me wrong and say that they enjoyed this movie.  Opinions, of course are in fact, personal preference. <br/><br/>
Think of Aliens or hell, even Day of the Dead, and you have superior films that convey a much stronger message.  These movies are all about the acting, the emotions, the character studies, the split second reaction situations involving moral conflict...  This movie shows a couple of these situations very well, but overall, conveys very little, and ends on a note that really lacks emotion towards the survivors.<br/><br/>28 Days Later should have been more than it was, but failed miserably in the final act.  It either should have been a character study, or a zombie flick, but tried to find a compromising medium which ended up being uncomfortable for this kind of movie, so it ends up satisfying few, and disappointing far more too many.  <br/><br/>As I said, the first 90 minutes are pretty darn good, it's the last 30 minutes that are just plain horrible.  6/10 stars for providing a very convincing opening...would have easily been a 9/10 if only they had provided a convincing/satisfying finale."

I read many reviews from others that saw the movie, some praised it and others criticized it. As always I prefer to see movies for myself before commenting on them. 28 days later is by far one of the most superb horror flicks I have ever seen. It opened to little fan fair here in the US, but it seems to be picking up steam. And there is a good reason for that the movie is awesome. I caught it at my favorite theater: United Artists Battery Park Stadium 16, located at 102 North End Avenue, New York NY 10281, across the street from where the WTC once stood. The entire audience seemed scared out of their wits, but no one dared to leave and miss out on the rest of the movie. I myself was freaked out during certain scenes and I love the movie and its director for those reasons. The film is very continuous in its attempt to give off the feeling of dread and horror. Hollywood should take notice of this film and its director. 28 days later was shot on an 8 million dollar budget and has to date raked in $28,505,000 in the US alone. This goes to show you that the studios don't have to waste 100+ million on movies for them to be great. All it takes is a decent Director with an imagination and a good crew and good actors to pull it off, which is something we don't have too much of here in the US lately. See this movie and I promise it will not disappoint, just leave the kiddies home and for those of you that may frighten easily make sure you have someone you can hold on to. I give 28 days later a, well deserved, 10 out of 10!"

"satellitesun","9","0","1","11 July 2003"," An intelligent thought provoking dose of what horror has been missing!
","A lot of reviews you will read on IMDB seem to be anti 28 Days Later, but please read this if you have any interest in seeing this movie at all. First of all, if you are expecting to see Night of the Living Dead, or Resident Evil, then this movie is not for you.  The reason why some people seem to be disapointed with this movie is because they were expecting something else, something Romero.  With that aside, this is an intense movie with great cinematography.  I believe that if this movie was shot with a larger budget it would have been a lot less effective.  The camera adds a sense of realism that is almost creepy, and which helps get the fantasy of this movie accross.  What if this really happened?<br/><br/>The reason why I love this movie so much is that it isn't your typical ""zombie"" movie.  It's not a movie with some hapless heroes running around trying to destroy an evil corporation that is responsible for a virus, it's about survival.  The scenerio of this movie is much more realistic to what would actually happen if infection were to occur.  It deals with morals on many different levels, and it's beautiful imagery provide for some very deep hope inspiring moments.<br/><br/>(SPOILER:  The scene where Jim, Selena, Hannah, and Frank are sitting in the field watching the horses and Hannah asks if they are infected to which Frank responds with ""They are just fine.""  This one short scene is filled with more hope then in any other movie i've ever seen.)<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a slasher filled with gore, maybe you should wait for Jason vs. Freddy to come out.  If you are looking for something well written, well directed, and well casted that will freak you out beyond belief, then please do yourself a favor and watch 28 Days Later."

"TelevisionJunkie","10","0","1","12 July 2003"," Fantastic film that was wrongly promoted
","This is certainly not George Romero's idea of a zombie flick! Nor is it truly a zombie flick... If I had to compare it to anything, the only thing I could compare it to is ""Stephen King's The Stand,"" with less characters. Although the plot makes it sound something like ""Twelve Monkeys,"" it doesn't really fit that mold either. It seems that FOX didn't know how to promote this, so they likened it to zombie flicks and the Exorcist! If that's what you're looking for, find another film in your local listings..... Or if you're so homophobic that you can't stand to see a naked man for a couple minutes, again avoid. Not only was there another comment on the ""dong factor,"" but 3 people walked out mere minutes after the opening scene, where the lead wakes up nude in a hospital bed. Yeah, it was flopping free for a few minutes as he regained consciousness, but it's not like there was a male nurse there performing fellatio on him, so gimme a break....<br/><br/>The premise of the film is truly frightening, more-so because it seems plausible. A virus called ""the rage,"" I believe, is set loose upon society when some well-meaning animal activists break into a testing lab to release some caged monkeys. And 28 days later, the fast-spreading virus has taken over the majority of the population, turning them into zombie-like animals. Our heroes are the few scant survivors who are just fighting to stay alive. But that's not easy in a world turned on its ear....<br/><br/>At times the film does seem slow and overlong, not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but it's called character development -- something that's missing from more movies in recent years than I can count. The performances are all great, and lead to a few real heart-wrenching and gut-wrenching moments. However, there's more scares from the reality of their situation than actual on-screen scares. Not that the film's without, there are a few truly creepy/frightening moments. You don't get too many good looks at the infected, which personally I thought made them that much scarier.  Possible minor spoiler:  The further you get into this film, the more you think ""there's no way this can have a happy ending."" But they pull it off, and not in a contrived, completely unrealistic way.  <br/><br/>Oh, and also to comment on the gritty look of the film, while many people have complained about that, I personally thought the drab picture quality enhanced the moodiness of the piece. Taking place in post-apocalyptic times, one certainly wouldn't expect bright, vivid colors.  The combination of the look of the film and the haunting score enhance it. I couldn't imagine Hollywood taking on a project like this, but if they had, it certainly wouldn't have been as gritty -- which is a pure plus in a film like this.<br/><br/>If you're the type who just likes the gore without having to use your brain, just remember that ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" comes out later this year!"

","A great flick. Certainly it has its roots in such films as Omega Man, Dawn of the Dead (esp. + NOTLD & DofD), The Last Man on Earth etc. But I dare you to do a zombie movie without referencing, intentionally or otherwise, those seminal pieces. It seems to have been produced on a less-than-Hollywood size budget and that works very well for it. It's a little more personally involving that way instead of assaulting you with constant pullbacks, zoom-outs and flash cuts to reveal everything that could possibly blow up... being blown up. Another plus: The drama is not solely derived from the evasion by our heroes and heroines of the infected ""zombies."" The film is richer and arguably darker for making the clever decision to reveal the most threatening villain in the second half of the film to be just plain old uninfected humans... not the zombies after all. Can you trust the human next to you to kill you? Can you trust him to keep you alive? Are you better off amongst the bent-on-destruction, one-track-mind zombies or in claustrophobic quarters with uninfected humans of uncertain morals and questionable ethics? There is room for many stories based on this film's basic premise... all manner of confrontations with the dead and alive can be created here. Luckily for us, Danny Boyle focused on some of the most intriguing tales to share with us. I hope his future work is balanced out with more material of a horrific, dark nature."

There is much symbolism here, namely referencing anthrax, HIV, SARS, ebola, and countless other biological diseases.  I feel this movie is almost an allegorical warning.  Extremely well acted, especially by once-tomorrow-person Naomie Harris, this film does what all great movies do- provokes thought, provokes discussion.  It held me at the edge of my seat.

"alicekim78","8","0","1","7 July 2003"," Why wasn't it released in the US sooner? (contains many spoilers)
","I'm impressed. It just might have to do with the fact that I walked into this film expecting a mediocre horror flick. But I ended up walking out concluding, pretty damn good film.<br/><br/>In the first couple minutes of 28 days later, you see a lab, you see cages, you see monkeys locked up in these small cages. It's just human nature, just like how Adam and Eve were given the right to name the plants and animals of Eden, to automatically name and categorize this film. I started thinking, ""ahh, okay, Outbreak, oh but it's supposed to be a horror flick, so maybe a bit more kooky, so actually 12 monkeys."" Then you see rage. Rage is pretty much the underlying foundation of the film, the reason for the story. Rage is a frightening disease/virus initially transferred from beast to human in this lab when three animal rights activists stupidly trying to be liberal and leftist free an infected monkey, even after numerous desparate pleas from the scientist trying to convince them that freeing it will cause the end of the world. Of course, they free the monkey and it attacks the only female, and you see the effects. It takes no more than 20 seconds for the human to transform into a red-eyed, twitchingly spastic monster void of any past, identity, or thought that has one goal: attack and make others like me.<br/><br/>And as you can imagine, since it takes only 20 seconds for rage to fully take its course, the spread of this disease is monumentally quick -- thus the title 28 days later which is pretty much how long it took to destroy the world, or western Europe, same thing. You do not see the pandemonium that ensues of evacuations or mass exodus, though.<br/><br/>You, are then, introduced to Jim, played by Cillian Murphy. The oddly optimistic and lucky hero who, after waking up from a coma (you don't know how long) and discovering his London to be completely deserted and in disarray, runs into a church full of rage infested humans. (They sleep in churches, you know. They love the pews.) I would have to say that this scene, from when Jim wakes up, up til when he discovers rage, is probably one of the best scenes in the film. The silence is deafening. You wonder, is this a set? Is London really empty now? It's beautiful. You see the streets, in the afternoon, eerily peaceful and void of life. He walks trying to gather information on why things are the way they are and why it is that he's utterly alone.<br/><br/>You realize that the storytelling of this is a bit more sophisticated than your mediocre horror film. Granted, it is set up in a way where you have to be figure out along with Jim what actually happened, and besides the blatant newspaper headlines reading ""EVACUATION,"" you see the effects of what rage might do to a once teeming city of human life.<br/><br/>What I loved is the preparation that the survivors have undertaken to try to live. The survivors that understand the disease fight it. And it's not like ""I know what you did last summer"" where girls with big boobs in wet white tank tops scream ""f*** yous"" into the night, they actually have knives, fire power, bombs, riot gear and know that when they run, they have to seriously book and get to a proven secure place. This is more realistic. You know that normal people's hysteria cause them to go out and make the supermarket run out of their second stocks of bottled water and spam when they hear even a slight warning of hurricane from a local weather forecaster. Then in an apocalypse situation, why the hell wouldn't people just go all out and do anything they can to survive and protect themselves. I liked this.<br/><br/>
You see stronger traces of Danny Boyle's direction, besides his artistic shots of empty London, in Jim's surreal dream of his parents where, present-day Jim seems to be watching, but at the same time part of a home video-slash-memory of his parents unpacking the groceries in the kitchen and asking about his day. Oh, and the chase up the stairs scene: very Hitchcock and Vertigo-ish. I likey.<br/><br/>Another great aspect in the movie is that mere survival and lusty romance are NOT the only things moving the plotline, if at all. Okay, I'm becoming stuck comparing this to regular horror movies, I'm sorry. But it's hard not to, and realize why this really tops out, because it is, even standing against non-horror films, just a well-done movie. But instead, it is the realization that survival is not the only reason for the movie, or for life after rage.<br/><br/>As cheesy as it sounds, glimmers of hope and truer connections become anchoring parts of the movie that not only drive the characters but end up also resolving things. In the horrors of death (survivors killing ragers, remember ragers don't kill, they convert), blood and hanging on to sanity by your mere fingernails, the now surrogate family made up of Jim, Selena (a tough sexy chemist that can kill a rager probably with her bare hands), Frank (resourceful, rightly protective father played very well by Brendan Gleeson who also played Walter 'Monk' McGinn in Gangs of New York), and Hannah (Frank's teenage daughter played by Megan Burns) stop by a deserted meadow where they can have a picnic and relax a little.<br/><br/>
The open space provides easy warning to any intruding ragers, so you feel somewhat safe. Frank and Jim happen upon a family of horses running in the meadow. This scene stands out. Here, you see, the push for why these survivors have traveled this far, why they fight for their lives, why rage is such the antithesis of peace & love and thus, so devastating.<br/><br/>It has so many chances to exploit the ""boo!"" suspense aspect of things popping out here and there and causing you to jump, but it really doesn't all that much. You see how different camera shots represent different points of view - when a rager is running towards a character, the camera is shaking and running towards them as well. And it's more realistic. If a rager is so void of intelligence and is loud (they make ack noises and twitch like no other turrets victim), they could never really sneak up on you, right? You would probably see and hear them coming a mile away.<br/><br/>The film moves on to question organized, emergency governmental systems of survival by the 42nd brigade that the wary travelers have finally found in their long journey by a directional recording that they caught on the radio telling them that ""salvation and the answer to infection"" lies with them. Here you see how it is very much so like ""Lord of the Flies"" but all growns up. Military men, who are not too far away from mere boys playing cowboys and indians or piggy haters trying to steal the conch, set up a seemingly completely safe haven where ragers will never set foot, or if they try, they're blown to bits. However, like all Lord of the Fliesian governments, it falls apart. But here you see. You see the choice that the ""family"" has to make. They are safe here, they don't have to worry about fighting anymore, they can sleep in beds with clean sheets and take showers with hot water, but is the condescension, the sexism (and rape if they had stayed), the testosteroney immaturity better than fighting off ragers everyday on your own?<br/><br/>One scene I found a bit jarring, and maybe only because I am American, is the infected black man chained by the neck in their backyard that the brigade was keeping as a specimen of 'study.' It is a bit whiny and American Studies-ish of me to fleetingly wonder what racial messages of having a foaming at the mouth, thoughtless, fettered black man 28 days later... might be sending, and what the NAACP or Spike Lee would say after seeing that, but then I thought again and realized that rage has been an equal opportunity disease infecting any and everybody throughout the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I like this film more when I think about it more and more. Although my stomach and muscles were tense, and I'd probably rather not watch it too many times for that sake of my own scaredy-catedness, I think that the film is thought-provoking, but not pretentious, and the characters very well-developed."
"GorgonHeep","10","0","1","8 July 2003"," A new favorite of mine!
","Upon seeing ""28 Days Later..."" last night, I quickly added it to the list of my top-10 favorite films. I thought the cinematography was darkly beautiful and rich. It is rare that films are able to capture the environment of the horror they're trying to show effectively. The scenary fit the storyline and action perfectly! Another aspect of ""28 Days Later..."" that I enjoyed was the apocalyptic nuances of the film that were portrayed, such as calling the infection ""Rage"", as rage between people in reality may someday bring about the end of the world. Also, the idea of the necessity of women. The film has an ""excess"" of male survivors, and few female ones (only two that are shown to us in the film). Without women, what is the point of being a survivor when there is no means for reproduction and regrowth of human life. This is realized by some of male characters in the film, and mixed with lust, becomes yet another apparent downfall of some of the human beings in this film; the need for survival versus decency between people.<br/><br/>     The idea of the apocalypse and survival in this film also brings into light the point that people need each other not for just physical survival, but for emotional survival. As the character, ""Hannah"" points out, some of the survivors might need the others more so (due to being physically weaker or slower, etc.), but all of the survivors need each other. Let's face it, if the world was basically over, and what was left was not worth bringing new life into it and starting anew, wouldn't you rather enjoy your present life as much as possible with other people, rather than making sacrifices of others just for a futile attempt at survival? Overall, I thought that ""28 Days Later..."" was an incredible film. I eagerly await it's release on DVD! I give it a vote of ""10""!!"

I am disgusted with the amount of people in the theatre cutting the film down, laughing at nudity (really how old are we?), and saying the movie ""sucks,""  Apparently, I wasn't watching the same movie that they were.<br/><br/>Only a handful of people I've encountered have had the same opinion of this movie as me.  The cinematography was up there with ""Black Hawk Down,"" which, isn't a great movie by itself, but the symbolism and angles of the shots was incredible.<br/><br/>""28 Day's Later,"" alone, as a story was great because the story never ended when you thought it would.  It stimulated thought, fear, suspense, sadness, joy... a full gamut of emotions.  I left the movie theatre completely satisfied with this movie, which hasn't happened in a very, very long time.<br/><br/>The sound track was perfectly in synch with the movie, featuring ""Godspeed you Black Emperor!,"" an incredible band.  The music definitely added a heightened sense of thrill for this movie.<br/><br/>If you didn't like movies that were suspenseful, and unique like ""12 monkeys"" or ""Fight Club,""  and beautiful and thought-provoking like ""A beautiful mind,"" perhaps this summer, you'd ought to stick to something less intrusive, and mature.  For that, I recommend ""Finding Nemo.""  Either way, enjoy!"

Unfortunately Boyle should have realized that if you're going to make a character driven (?) zombie movie you need some compelling characters.   It's the rare film that actually could have really benefited from some star power - had Boyle alum Ewan McGregor been cast as the lead it would have been infinitely more interesting.

"lwjoslin","Null","0","1","4 July 2003"," Zombies? What zombies?
","""28 Days Later"" is a gritty, low-budget UK suspense/actioner, well acted and sharply edited, but not really a ""zombie"" movie, as its ads claim.  More of an apocalyptic plague movie, similar to David Cronenberg's ""Rabid""; the ""zombies"" (referred to collectively as the ""infected"") are, in fact, living people afflicted with a virulent and incurable contagion that causes instant, murderous rage.  (Shades also of ""Last Man on Earth,"" ""The Omega Man,"" and--with its small band of military holed up in a compound--""Day of the Dead,"" which IS a zombie flick.)  <br/><br/>Strange to say, the infected travel in packs, which means they never seem to attack each other.  Wonder why not?  In any case, the only name we're given for their disease is ""rage.""  It's been isolated in a lab and provided with a viral vector: all Hyde, no Jekyll, and no turning back.  One character in the movie suggests that there's nothing particularly wrong with the ""infected"" that we haven't seen before; it's just the darker aspects of human nature in concentrated form.<br/><br/>Tellingly, the Brits have to defend themselves with such improvised weapons as baseball bats and machetes, thanks to the UK's totalitarian anti-gun laws.  Remember the scene in ""Dawn of the Dead"" wherein American ""rednecks"" mount a heavily-armed hunting posse, gunning for zombies?  Nothing like that here.  Only Her Majesty's military have firearms.  And in keeping with Machiavelli's observation that there can be no proper relationship between one who's armed and one who's not, they naturally become part of the problem.  <br/><br/>It's July 4th as I write this.

","""Possible Mild Spoilers Ahead: Proceed with caution.""<br/><br/>
I just saw this film.  After greatly liking Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I was expecting a slight twist on zombies, from what I had read in reviews and so forth.  And that's what I got. Quite scary, rather tense, and greatly atmospheric, the movie, filmed on digital video, succeeds in packing a punch.  However, it was this same filming that irritated me.  Unlike the calm, almost peaceful directing of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""28 Days Later..."" insists on constantly flashing images at us.  So quick and fast, it plays almost like an MTV music video.  It greatly bothered me, unlike ""Lola Rennt,"" which used the same technique masterfully. Nevertheless, I still greatly enjoyed it.  Being a fan of horror films, I wasn't disappointed.  The girl with whom I saw it didn't particularly care for the ending.  But, I ask, how else can a zombie horror film end?  The other endings they filmed are also possible, with Jim dying and so forth, but the best way, in my opinion, is to leave it to the audience to imagine them being rescued.  In conclusion, it's not the best horror or zombie flick, but does add a new dimension to zombies.  However, this was slightly offset by the directing, which irritated me constantly.  In purely technical terms, I would give this a 7 out of 10, but with my bias toward this genre, my final score is 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>P.S. Why the male nudity?  And so much of it.  Is that something British?<br/><br/>Oh, well."

And even in the case of a powerful virus transforming everyone around into killing machines would all who survive pull together? Or would they continue to do what, in the end, appears to be encoded in our DNA? These are the topics which Danny Boyle is, i think, trying to comprehend with ""28 Days Later"". And he does so in a magnificent way; using DV, which is much more realistic and in a way more impressive than 35mm, Boyle follows Jim, Selena, Frank and Hannah in a desperate attempt to survive in a post-apocalyptic Britain. The shots of an abandoned London or the Englsih countryside are beautiful, if not utterly poetic. The talents of Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and of course Cristopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson add up to the film more than having a star cast. Plus there's John Murphy's exhilarating score, enhanced by musicians such as Brian Eno, Grandaddy and Blue States'""Season Song"". Any comparison to P.Anderson's mediocre ""Resident Evil"" is unfair and unreasonable; ""28 Days Later"" is not a nerveless, uninteresting, cliched ""Aliens"" wannabe; instead it's a fascinating but gory study on the very depths of the human psyche.<br/><br/>8.5/10 rating."
"Guyver1_","10","0","1","1 July 2003"," A fantastic film that delivers the scariest zombies yet
","For a VERY long time I have been unsatisfied with any films regarding zombies as the main monster or villain. Always feeling that the genre has so much potential that's so rarely tapped into, I came to fear that ""28 Days Later..."" would turn out like another ""Resident Evil"": a shoddily crafted piece of celluloid sludge made solely to interest the fans of horror films just long enough to steal eight dollars from their pockets and two hours of their time that they could never have back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>How delighted I am that I was wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>""28 Days Later..."" gave me absolutely everything I wanted but could never find in a zombie film while keeping the elements from past favorites such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" that attracted me to the genre in the first place.<br/><br/>
The story begins with an infected chimp attacking a small animal activist group before quickly shifting twenty-eight days ahead to a man waking from a coma in a hospital that's been completely abandoned. He soon discovers that England's been infected with a virus that turns humans into rampaging zombies (and blindingly fast ones at that), before coming across more survivors, and even more terrors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Though Boyle may have used cheaper, digital video equipment because of the budget, I actually found the cinematography truly stunning and beautiful to look at throughout the story (That is, when blood wasn't being smattered across it. And even then in a few cases), and would continually admire the shots he chose during scenes. I loved the grittiness that the digital film granted, and found the lighting and makeup to be wonderful as well. The film feels extremely cold and desolate, and fits perfectly with the ""last humans on Earth"" vibe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps what I enjoyed most about the film is that it constantly takes situations from other zombie films that might produce a frustrated groan from the casual or logical viewer and completely turns them on their ear for much more gratifying results (SPOILER: For example, while in most zombie films someone within the group would become infected and lead to scenes or dialogue about the moral quandry of 'We know we SHOULD kill him, but he's still our friend...! *boohooboohoo*,' in this film the characters take no chances. When Mark, one of the two survivors Jim initially meets, becomes infected, Selena, the other survivor, waits maybe a total of two seconds before hacking away at him with her machete, and notifies Jim that she'll do the same to him should she have to, ""...In a heartbeat."" END SPOILER).<br/><br/>
And the film never refers to the blindingly fast and deadly creatures that litter the film as ""zombies"" at all. They refer to them solely as ""the infected,"" and the script makes the attempt to comment on human nature by proclaiming that they are solely infected with ""rage."" But whatever the reason for their existence, one thing is certain: their sheer numbers combined with the ability to run creates some of the most pulse-pounding and suspenseful scenes I've ever seen in a zombie film (SPOILER: Try changing a flat tire in a tunnel with hordes of zombies coming at you, with rats fleeing before them, and see how YOU feel! END SPOILER). And because the cast is so wonderful and the script so well-written, I actually found myself CARING about what was happening to the characters, which is a surprising turn from the normal ""Ho-hum, wonder if I can guess which order they'll die in"" attitude that zombie movies (or horror movies in general) produce in me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This film offers everything a zombie fan could ask for: (MINOR SPOILERS) an ""apocalyptic, no-communications, handful-of-survivors"" world, terrifyingly deadly zombies, a small band of soldiers armed to the teeth, and even the obligatory ""last stand at the safehouse"" intermixed with ""zombie feeding frenzy"" scenes near the end, all while being held together with a wonderful story and superb acting on all sides.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Oh, and gore. Lots and lots of gore (How's zombies vomiting up blood for ya? Gory enough?).<br/><br/><br/><br/>I can not express how much this film not only lived up to, but exceeded my expectations. If you're a horror fan who believes that there isn't anything wrong with the zombie sub-genre the way it is (Insert shot of old man in rocking chair on porch grumbling, ""In my day, we only had blue makeup, people who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag, laughable dialogue, and a script with plot holes the size of Texas. And we LIKED it that way!"" before vigorously shaking fist while yelling at the local children, ""Get offa my lawn!""), then please avoid this film. For those of you who are tired of the routine, cookie-cutter zombie film that too closely resembles the zombie film that came before it, and are ready for a horror film that delivers the goods in unsuspecting and terrifyingly wonderful ways, then please, by all means, go see ""28 Days Later..."" and enjoy."

The virus deteriorates the mind of the contractee and leaves them with nothing but rage. These vicious half humans scower the earth destroying anything that moves. In other words, it is a socialistic statement about rage in modern society, and how we see it in every day situations; road rage, trolley rage, domestic disputes etc. So there you go. Solved.

I wonder what it would be like if human traffic was no-existant.<br/><br/>This is deffinately a movie that will stay with you.

"uniondrone","Null","0","1","30 June 2003"," Best Horror Flick in Years!
","I have read mostly complaints about this movie on IMDb. The complaints, although there is a thread of substance to them, are mostly undeserved. I am a fan of horror movies, suspense movies, and thriller movies, and I loved this one.<br/><br/>****Possible spoilers ahead*****<br/><br/>First of all, people say that this movie is unoriginal or a rip-off. Well let's face it, any new ""zombie"" movie has to be a rip-off, if you want to use that argument. There have been so many movies about flesh-eating mindless corpses, it'll make your head spin. But then ""Signs"" is a rip-off of every alien invasion movie, ""Scream"" must be a rip-off of every slasher movie, ""The Ring"" is about a video which causes a bunch of weird stuff to happen (see ""Videodrome"", a lower budget but in some ways better movie) the source of which is the ghost of a young girl who was killed and the body hidden (see ""Stir of Echoes""). So, ""The Ring"" must be a rip-off, except that it's a remake of ""Ringu"". Could someone argue that because it's a remake, it's the ultimate rip-off? Maybe ""Stir of Echoes"" really is a rip-off of ""Ringu"" which actually came first. Let me ask, can a movie be made as a homage to earlier films? Can some ideas be recycled, if there is a fresh approach or some new ideas incorporated? If we ask Danny Boyle and Alex Garland (the director and script writer of 28 days later), perhaps they would tell us that 28 days later is the latest installment in the flesh-eating zombie genre. Does it recycle some ideas from ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"". Of course it does. Does it bring a fresh approach, a daring style of directing, and some entertaining twists on a classic genre. You bet!<br/><br/>Secondly, a lot of people complain about how the movie appeared. Some people complained of poor lighting, a washed-out grainy look, and rapid, blurry cuts that were described as ""poor editing"". Can these people be horror fans? How can they not understand that this was done PURPOSELY, purely for effect?!? If I watch a horror film where everything is brightly lit (such as ""Alien:Resurrection"") or crystal clear (like ""Mimic"") the effect is lost. If you use lingering shots and show too much of what is happening, the audience sees too much. Fear and tension are created (I think Hitchcock said this) by what you don't see.<br/><br/>Finally, some complain about the movie having holes and not fully explaining everything. If you want horror to explain everything watch reruns of Scooby-Doo. See above. If the audience sees (or knows) too much, some of the element of mystery, fear of the unknown, and plot tension goes bye-bye! I have to admit there are a few coincidences (the nick of time tire change) and unlikely events (surviving 28 days on a hospital bed in coma without doctor's care), but c'mon this is a movie. I've seen a lot of things that are far less believable in other movies. Maybe a doctor was there until day 26, and he left to look for food. Again a movie can't and shouldn't explain everything. If one's imagination can create a possible explanation, then it's not really a plot hole. It's just something unknown and open to debate.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Great movie! 9/10. Danny Boyle has lived up my expectation, which is high considering that I thought ""Shallow Grave"" was brilliant."

","I think this is one of the best horror/zombie-type films I've ever seen. However, its amazing how similar this movie is to SALVATION, a short film I co-produced with Michael Lalaian and went on to win a CINE Golden Eagle (look it up on the IMDb!).  SALVATION is about a post-apocalyptic world in which ""infected"" people (in SALVATION they're called ""Shadow Walkers"" and they are caused by radiation ... not disease) have killed the families of two lonely young people who decide to stick together and face the world. All four of the protagonists are VERY similar to the protagonists of SALVATION and so is the plot. Many key conversations and situations come directly out of SALVATION.<br/><br/>Despite my jealousy that Danny Boyle got his film produced and distributed before I could produce and distribute SALVATION at feature length, I thought Danny Boyle, the director, was very clever at using limited resources to create a profound statement on human nature.  All of the actors did a pretty good job too, but Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleason's performances were especially noteworthy.  Its also a pretty scary film.

Fist and foremost, yes this movie is not terrifying, yet its intent is clearly not to be.  This movie is a drama with a zombie-horror film premise.  The movie delves into concepts of humanity in a unique way. Strong acting minus maybe the young girl drives the movie.  The cinematography is stellar not only in making video look so good, but also in the often high-past, adrenaline pumping high shutter speed shots.  And I must say that comparing this movie to Charlie's Angel's 2 is absolutely ludicrous in that CA 2 is possibly the biggest piece of garbage released to date this year.  This movie should be seen as a work of art, which is dramatic, fun, exciting, and revolutionary though the its turning of a cheesy premised zombie film into to a top-notch drama.  It should not be lumped in with brainless horror and MTV style films.  Yes this movie may not be ""Scary as Hell,"" but it is so much more; it is brilliant and Danny Boyle's best."
"geoffmart","8","0","1","30 June 2003"," A stylish horror flick that was worth the price of admission
","Let me start by saying that I have never liked a single horror movie in my life. Horror/thriller movies are usually cheap, poorly-written and terribly over-acted.<br/><br/>28 Days Later broke that sad, and often laughable, trend. This film is stylish and relatively thought-provoking, and though it does have some plot problems, I was able to overlook those. Normally, I cannot overlook plot holes or inconsistencies, but in 28 Days Later the problems were far outweighed by the intriguing writing, creepy cinematography and believable acting.<br/><br/>I have a severe inability to suspend disbelief, but 28 Days Later was so unique I couldn't help but get caught up in the story. So ""Bravo!"" for not using A-list actors, not candy-coating the harsh post-apocalyptic setting, and most of all... ""Bravo!"" for creating a horror movie with style."

","In a time when movie goers are forced into being entertained by weak story lines and flashy fight sequences, it is rare to find a film that is both entertaining and intelligent. 28 days later is far more than a Horror film it is a metaphor for human nature. The virus is rage... ""Its in the blood""... it is in all our blood. Humans are capable of scary things. Recent world events prove that much. ***Spoiler*** The main characters spend most their time running from those who are infected, but even those who aren't can't fully be trusted. And you even get the feeling that those who are infected are asking for help. This film is brilliant! It is the scarcest movie I have in a while, and hands down the most Intelligent Horror Flick that has been produced in years!

","Not a fan of Alex Garland, so so for Danny Boyle too but together they combined to make a great effort in updating the Zombie genre. The idea of 'rage' as an infectious disease was inspired and relavent in todays society. I love the first part of this film, truly I was transfixed to the cinema screen on first viewing. The second half was a bit of a let down though, soldiers breaking down kept together with the promise of sex. I just didn't buy it, there seemed to be holes in the plot that just didnt allow for it. The film was redeemed though as our hero 'Jim' explored his own 'rage' to great effect and a fantastic climax. This film came so close for me to being perfect the main cast where brilliant, lighting, editing, soundtrack etc, its just that middle bit!"

","More than a just a juxtaposition of films like SHAKMA, THE CRAZIES, and THE OMEGA MAN (or THE LAST MAN ON EARTH), 28 DAYS LATER offers us an unsettling glimpse into the very nature of Human Nature. The conventions of the genre (fright films, if you will) are employed to great effect. At times frightening in a profoundly philosophical fashion, 28 DAYS LATER is enlightening entertainment. It's good to know that there are still moviemakers out there whose no-budget constraints don't prevent them from producing thought-provoking entertainment. Bravo. Encore."

","I would have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. After reading the user comments about it I was somewhat confused about whether or not this movie was worth my time especially on opening day. But I am glad I chose to see it. Reminiscent of Resident Evil as it may have been I found that in its ""British"" casting and filming it was how shall I say it a refreshing horror flick. I could really find no flaws with the movie as it was the best 8 bucks I could have spent that day. So I say bravo to 28 days later and to whom all that were involved with its creation."

With the zombies taking a backseat, the characters drive the story and draw the viewer in.<br/><br/>Without rehashing the typical zombie story or spoon-feeding us trite, established, Hollywood archetypes, Danny Boyle's direction, Alex Garland's script, and John Murphy's score have made this the best film of the year."
"Nysaya","9","0","1","28 June 2003"," Are people afraid to think?
","I think too much of America forgot how to think with a complex movie like 28 days later.  It's very easy to say this movie is about zombies, but its definately more about survivor.  You can replace zombies with mutant dinosaurs, aliens, and the plot will be the same.  This is not on par with Resident Evil.<br/><br/>The bads of the movie are mostly the low budget, though I think that we're too used to bright special effects.  For the purpose of the movie, the budget was fine.  It was a lil grainy, but the settings, props, etc did fine for the movie.<br/><br/>-SPOILERS-The best part of the movie was the story.  I don't think many saw that the main character was a mirror of the zombies.  Both had to survive, and at the end of the movie, we as the audience could only tell he wasnt a zombie by his coyness and the lack of red in his eyes.  Selena couldn't even tell until he spoke.  He was so desperate for survival, like the zombies, and was quick, secretive, bloody like they were.<br/><br/>UNSPOILERS This movie's theme has a strong focus on the development of a man based on survival, and how mankind as a whole is no matter if theyre not desperate to survival or if they are.  Its important to watch that movie looking for that, and not being being split in half like in Resident Evil.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of Omega Man ripoff comments, and Ive never seen the movie, so I cant say if it is or not, but again I just say look at the theme.  A lot of movies have mankind wiped out completely and some overwhelming force against them.<br/><br/>The characters and setting of the story were great.  The setting is England, mostly Manchester and London I think, with the ruins of a chapel or castle at one point at well.  The house also at the end was beautiful.  The weather often conveyed too with the feelings of the character.  SPOILERS Ive already talked about the main character, Id like to comment on Hannah, Selena, Hannah's father, and the soldiers.  Hannah had a beautiful change.  In the end, she showed as a lil girl, she learned how to survive as well as the others, but also that she still was the embodiement of hope, being youth. Selena also had that great mixture, where she stayed able to fight, save for the Selena and crazed-main-char scene.  SHe softened a lot, but for the better because she survived and had hope.  Its sad what happened to Hannah's father, but it showed the importance of hope again and protecting the youth. Finally the soldiers I think had a giant theme of lack of hope.  They didnt view Hannah, who was the symbol of hope, as a girl but as a woman.  Also, they already said they had a lack of hope because they didnt see what future lay ahead, but so much of that was just lust instead of a real hope.<br/><br/>
Lastly.. valium.  Come on, you all know valium belonged in there.  Lets get realistic.  Its the end of the world, damn straight people are gonna feel good about it."

I had no trouble feeling for the characters, which is a lot to say for a horror movie. Come on, be adventurous and give this film a try over Charlie's Angels 2.

","Danny Boyle has crafted an excellent addition to the Zombie subgenre in this serious, apocalyptic flick.  Skip DAY OF THE DEAD and make this the third film in Romero's otherwise brilliant Zombie trilogy.  The scenes in London are outstanding, reminsicent of THE OMEGA MAN.

","There's much more to this film than what the ""reinvention of zombie horror"" hype would lead you to believe. If all you want is slow-moving cadavers out for a gray matter snack, trot on down to Blockbuster and rent something from George Romero. And if you want that PLUS expensive CGI effects so all the zombies are 30 feet tall and they shoot laser beams out their eyes and they're really cooool, then you should especially look elsewhere. The ""infected"" set things in motion and they're a major, terrifying threat to the characters throughout, but the heart of the movie is about how people deal with one another when things get really, really bad. Which (as we see in the movie) is often quite a bit worse than what the ""infected"" would do. No one ever said the apocalypse would be pretty."

"hpeterji","9","0","1","30 June 2003"," A great scary film!!!
","At last, I waited enough and ran over to the nearest theater by my apartment to check it out as soon as it got released. All the pieces of information that I read on the papers and the Internet gave me an enough insights of the film '28 Days Later...' I just wanted to see it myself so that I could say it was more than what I was waiting for.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle. To me he is one of only two contemporary directors whom I adore from the U.K., and the other one is Guy Ritchie. I don't know what Guy Ritchie will do in order to make up for what he did with the last miserable failure film ever???!!! However, Danny Boyle didn't disappoint me with 'the Beach' last time not as bad as most of critics and fans would think. So, as soon as I saw the trailer of 28 Days Later, I got hooked into it right away and knew something would be different this time.<br/><br/>So there was I. I was sitting among those who wanted to catch the Boyle's new film on the last Sunday of June. On top of hearing all the great backdrops, like it was a biggest sleeper hit in the U.K. last year since it was opened in November and such, the sort of different genre that Boyle was interested in was enough of a catch for his fans, including myself.<br/><br/>The film begins with a scene where some monkeys are locked up in a small glass tanks and tied up on the operation beds, being forced to watch repeated montage sequences of very disturbing and violent scenes, such as riots, fights, war, and etc., on several monitors. And then activists break in to free them but what they didn't know was how bad these monkeys' conditions are, with something called 'rage.' In spite of a lab scientist trying to prevent the monkeys from being freed by these activists, one of the activists unlocks one of the glass tanks. Then it all begins. (I think that is enough of a start...)<br/><br/>What I like about Boyle's films is that he always works on characters more than stories. To me, how he develops each story is that he gives his characters a choice to make and then lets it unfold on its own. Maybe the genre was different but his way of telling a story was the same, like his other films, such as Trainspotting and Life Less Ordinary and even The Beach.<br/><br/>One thing that I liked the most in this film was the twist.<br/><br/>Jim, our main character, and other survivors (Frank, middle-aged former taxi driver and Hannah, his daughter, and Selena, who saved Jim at the first place and became his love interest) were running away to survive from these creatures (something rather than human after being infected with this rage) who would attack and eat them up alive or have them infected and make 'em become one of them to the place where they think they will be protected by the army.<br/><br/>Eventually when they got there, it was the beginning of the next trouble they were about to face. These soldiers wanted to have sex with the two girls by force in order to protect them, and Jim was not happy with the idea and was thrown away to a remote area to get killed. But, he managed to escape and came back with vengeance. Now he became the chaser, not the runner. He was the one who wanted to kill these soldiers to save the two girls. As a strategy to make them confused, Jim freed the strained soldier who got infected but didn't get killed earlier...<br/><br/>The film was shot on video and looked pretty awesome to me. Although there were some scenes that I was thinking would've been greater if they were shot on film. As you know, with not enough of lighting (and even with enough lighting), shooting on video loses lots of details and crispness. However, I appreciated how it was shot and how each shot was composed as far as cinematography.<br/><br/>It was an absolutely ming-boggling experience. I wasn't overall scared too much of the film but there was one scene where Jim decided to go into a burger restaurant while other survivors was getting gas from an abandoned gas tank truck. I asked myself why he was going in there? It was dark in there, which means these infected creatures must be in there... and so on. For a very brief moment, but I was scared. And I believe that is how Danny Boyle explores his characters.<br/><br/>Get scared!!!"
"K-Slicer","9","0","1","28 June 2003"," Could have been worse...
","I saw this movie because I had a feeling that it will slip under the radar and become of a ""UHF"" for the year 2k3.  Understandably, this film may be one of the best films in what seems like, at least in my mind, another summer filled with nothing but more sequels and lame remakes.  After I watched it, I came away with a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my money and time were well spent.<br/><br/>Here are my reasons (spoilers contained): (1) This was a horror movie. There was enough gore and psychosis to go around and the balance between them was perfectly leveled. (2) The cinematography was dark and gritty.  I felt like I was watching ""Trainspotting"" again. (3) Even in a movie supposedly devoid of any real subject matter, there was a bit of thought injected into it.  I especially liked the ranting of the sergeant who was chained to the radiator. (4) Maybe I don't have a sense for knowing whether a film is predictable or not, I found it to be slightly unpredictable and that was good enough for me.  The last five minutes of the film is probably the best example I can cite on this point. (5) Danny Boyle knows how to work with a camera and a cast.  His exemplary direction of ""28 Days Later..."" gives weight to the notion that he one of the better directors currently in the industry. (6) Although nowhere near as compelling as ""In The Company of Men"", I was intrigued by the fact that humans are cruel to fellow humans when infected or not infected with contagious plague.  The one sets of scenes where Jim is talking with Selina and Mark in Jim's home, we find that Mark horribly describes his escape from infestation as people (infected or otherwise) try to escape those in the crowd who are miasmic. (7) Realism plays a key role in ""28 Days Later..."".  In a situation like that, you will never know who you will run into and who you will end up trusting, distrusting, or mistrusting.  I think if I were put into a situation like that, I might end up with only my brother, my third cousin once-removed, and my mortal enemy as my only companions.  I found the film to be a realistic portrayal of fictional circumstances. (8) I thought the best performance of the film went to Jim.  The man was a masterful lead as distraught bike courier and andrenaline-charged savior. (9) This was definitely a retreat from typical summer fare.  I think this might be the best film of the summer.  Nine reasons give a score of nine.<br/><br/>My only beef was with the male nudity.  Too much can make anyone go blind but I guess it was deserved.  How many horror movies have been made with naked females?  It was definitely a retreat from the typical horror junk (like Jeepers Creepers III: He Comes Back for a cheeseburger and Jason XXV: Jason Dies From A Kick In The Shin by a 7-year old girl).  Overall, I found this movie to be worth the time and money so skip ""The Hulk"", ""Charlie's Angels"", and whatever other big name stuff that is coming out and go see something that will disappear fast.  That is why I saw ""28 Days Later..."" now because it may be gone next weekend.<br/><br/>Here ends my rant!"
"kevin86","10","0","1","28 June 2003"," Dodges many of the faults that make most horror movies fall flat.
","Nowadays, truly scary movies are hard to come by. People are subjected to a lot of WRETCHED horror films that contain poor character development, lousy dialogue, cheap thrills, and pointless plots. Most of the horror movies that have been released lately really don't offer much of anything to be honest.<br/><br/>
With that in mind, one might assume that ""28 Days Later"" would simply be another one of those pointless/tedious films that slowly diminishes the intelligence of its viewers with poorly written stories chock full of mindless gore.<br/><br/>Well, I can honestly say that; in my opinion, 28 Days Later has managed to dodge many of these great faults that are usually very common in the horror genre. The film-makers have succeeded in bringing to the audience a terrifying story of primal violence and desperate survival in an apocalyptic world. The film is primarily a story showing the brutal aftermath of a deadly epidemic known as the ""Rage"". Those infected have entered into a state of blood-lust, driven only by a hunger for the flesh and blood of those who have not yet been subjected to the virus. We are shown only clips and portions of the chaos that had followed the outbreak. Massive riots and stories of barbaric killings are told through newspaper clippings and explanations given by other survivors. All of this and much more sets the tone of the movie from the start. Bringing us in immediately.<br/><br/>
But beyond all of this is a simple tale of human nature. 28 Days Later captures the realistic circumstances of survival, highlighting the various ways people cope with things in such horrendous times. Throughout the course of the film, we come across about 13 non-infected people with entirely different personalities and entirely different means of survival. They all have their own opinions on how to survive, and they've all learned to cope with the conditions in their own way. its this aspect of the movie that really caught my interest.<br/><br/>Was the movie flawless? No not at all. NO MOVIE IS FLAWLESS. But like a few other memorable cinematic experiences, 28 Days Later presented something new. It was gritty, weird, wild, and creepy. Just the right mix to give us a break from the typical/cruddy box office ""hits"" Hollywood coughs up every month. <br/><br/>10 out of 10. Full points for being the most entertaining movie I've seen in theaters so far this year."
"Bastian Balthazar Bux","Null","0","1","27 June 2003"," A horror masterpiece, simply put.
","Congratulations to Danny Boyle on creating a zombie movie that is touching, thought-provoking, funny, aesthetic, and yes, very scary.<br/><br/>It is ironic, however, that the major conflict in ""28 Days Later..."", a so-called ""zombie movie"", is not between humans and zombies, but rather between humans and humans.<br/><br/>And this is what makes the film so damn good--it embraces the primal paradox of humanity--we are the only species that both requires company of others to healthily survive AND actively kills each other so often. The film, if anything, is a meditation on that paradox.  Characters need each other to perservere, yet destroy each other nonetheless.  Danny Boyle, as he has with his previous works (Trainspotting, The Beach) is asking us, ""How low can morality sink when survival is on the line?"" He demonstrates this using the zombie-infection as a backdrop story, people killing people to keep themselves alive.  Through the film characters grow and develop, in sometimes very violent means, and this development climaxes in a bloody apex that reminisces Straw Dogs.<br/><br/>But lets not forget, amidst all the violent philosophy, this IS a zombie movie, and it succeeds quite admirably in being a scary one at that, without ever seeming over-the-top or tongue-in-cheek.  The zombies are pretty scary in themselves, but in these post-SARS times, the idea of such a readily-transmittable disease is much more unnerving (""Then there were reports of it in France and New York"").<br/><br/>Kudos to those actors involved in the production as well--these people deserve to be seen in more films.<br/><br/>Overall, ""28 Days Later..."" is a chilling and intelligent horror movie, but moreso, it is a Biblical parable, it is an intense study of the evils and the glories of humanity when it is tested, it is the most impressive work of horror that this world NEEDS to see in these times.  Yes its about zombies, but no, its about so much more."
"deathtostefan","10","0","1","27 June 2003"," 28 days later...and still thinking about it
","Well, it may not be exactly 28 days since I've seen this movie, but you might get the idea. Every once in a while the memory of this movie pops back into my mind, and I'm remembered to make sure to see this film again. I rank it amongst the best zombie movies I have seen. People who are into those old italian splatter zombie movies might not agree, but I often feel that those are a completely different genre. <br/><br/>This work compares to the George A. Romero trilogy night/dawn/day of the dead, where tension is partly build with the threat of the undead, but mostly with the psychological effects on the survivors and the strain, carelessness and inhumanity that comes with that. I have always found it an interesting idea what would happen if suddenly for some reason only a small group of people would survive, there would be a 'natural' enemy again, and all boundaries of human civilization and conduct were to fall away. It is a theme that also can be found in John Wyndham's book Day of the Triffids (don't bother with the film, it stinks), that gives cause for reflection on our society and its rules of behaviour, which are more elusive than we generally stop to think about. (for instance: what if there are only a few people left and you have to build a new society, is monogamy in that case a smart idea or should a man have as many wives as possible just in order to sustain our race?(interesting question, isn't it?)). 28 days later... doesn't go as far as to consider the rebuilding of a civilization, but it touches on quite a few points that are amiss with ours, and makes an interesting search through the different kind of views and behaviour that people will expose in this kind of situation. This gives a depth to the movie that makes it very interesting. <br/><br/>The effect of all this on the movie is that there a quite a few long sequences where you won't see a zombie whatsoever, but where there's still an enormous tension, or sometimes even complete relaxation as the main characters almost seem to forget the situation and indulge in old habits. a fairly human trait I think, just remember people going to the theatres a few days after WTC-incident to forget it all for a moment. But when the undead show up they are really scary. The filmmakers really managed to create monsters that are more effective than any old zombie could have been in a modern movie. <br/><br/>The fairly low budget with which this film was made is also a blessing for the movie I think. It demands from a director to be more creative with his possibilities and the camerawork, which results in very atmospheric scenery and beautiful shots. (keep for instance an eye out for scenes with rain in it, and you'll know what I mean). This all is combined with strong acting and a hell of a soundtrack ( to hear God Speed You Black Emperor underneath images of deserted London sends shivers down my spine).<br/><br/>In short: this film kept me spellbound for its full length and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to see a horror film with depth instead of cheap thrills. And if you like it then you should also check out Romero's Trilogy of the Dead and Wyndham's novel Day of the Triffids."
"w00f","9","0","1","27 June 2003"," This is NOT a zombie flick
","I went into ""28 Days Later"" wearing my zombie gore b-flick hat.  I soon realized that this was no low-budget horror film.  This is a stylish, well-written, well-acted, beautifully painted exploration of the basic question, what is it that makes us human?  Why do we build societies, create art, and make sacrifices for others instead of just being animals?<br/><br/>The question is explored through the interaction of three groups of people. First, there's Jim, Selena and Hannah.  They care about each other and the future.  They haven't given up.  They're fighting for a tomorrow.  Then there's the infected.  The infected are NOT zombies; they haven't risen from the dead looking for human flesh.  They're the victims of a disease that reduces them to an unreasoning, animal state.  They can't even feed themselves.  They're the destructive, self-consuming side of human nature, with no thought of the future and no reliance on one another.  Finally, there's the remnant of an army brigade holed up in a mansion, with no concern other than keeping the infected out and carving an empire from the ashes of the world for themselves.  They see themselves as the center of the future, and they're representative of the cold, cruel, calculating side of human nature.<br/><br/>The infected aren't the stars of the film, and they're not meant to be.  The disease they suffer is a plot device that propels the question at the heart of ""28 Days Later"" across the screen throughout its brilliant cinematography, with its technique of blending stark, horrific realism with artistic, almost hallucinatory, images.  It's the tension between these aspects of the psyche that are really the centerpiece of this movie.<br/><br/>The acting in this film has moments of real brilliance, and there are moments of real horror.  The horror comes not just from bloody images and graphic violence, of which there aren't nearly as many as one would expect in a movie billed as a horror flick.  It comes from the realization that the destructiveness and rage embodied in *all* three sides of the story exist within all of us.  Any of us could be the infected, or the army, or the heroes of the film.  In the end, the film answers its central question with hope.  It's hope that sets man apart from the animals and drives us do great things.  Even without the disease that creates the infected, we learn that our humanity perishes when our hope disappears.  That's true of the infected, and it's also true of the soldiers.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle has served up an excellent, thought-provoking film that deserves better than to be billed simply as the reinvention of the zombie horror movie.  In fact, it is because of this marketing ploy that ""28 Days Later"" will likely escape critical notice and fade into oblivion, even though it is much more in the tradition of films like ""On the Beach"" than it is in the line of ""The Evil Dead"" or ""Return of the Living Dead.""  That's a shame, because this is Boyle's best work since ""Trainspotting,"" and a refreshing change from the usual summer fare typified by this year's crop of ""X2"" and ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.""<br/><br/>If you want to see a zombie flick, go for it.  I love a bad, nasty, gory horror film as much as anyone on the planet.  I've thus seen enough of them to know that what I just saw wasn't one of them.  This may well be one of the best films of the summer, if not the year.  It deserves much more attention than it's getting, or is likely to get.  The scene of the heroes driving down a deserted road bordered with flowers that dissolve into something one is more likely to see in a Van Gogh painting than in a summer horror movie is alone worth the price of admission.  If you can stomach Boyle's mixture of graphic realism with artistic, hallucinatory imagery, and you're open to something more intricate than rampaging green giants and chicks with PVC pants and whips, go see this film.  It may be slow in a couple of spots (especially if you're expecting hordes of the living dead chowing down on live human flesh!), but overall it's fantastic stuff.  You won't be disappointed."

","You must see this movie. I repeat.. you must see this movie. Dannie Boyle once again out does himself. This film is not just another stupid zombie film, it's got moral, horror, intelligence, gorry shots, suspense and fun. There many visually stunning or just plain beautiful shots. Brilliant."

","OK,...saw ""28 Days Later"".....here is what I think.<br/><br/>
I got a 'refreshing' feel from this British-made film.  The acting was above average and the cinematography was wonderful.  I love the backgrounds they used and the longer time spent viewing the scenes as opposed to the much too fast 'American made' movies currently in vogue.  Great music and sound affects used to enhance the isolation.  The lead guy looked like the lead from ""A Clockwork Orange"".  The older girl's face was lovely. I did have a slight problem with the lack of bodies and cars on the streets, but it didn't turn me away.  Yes there was an exodus but surely there would have been a few break downs and out-of-petrol's.   The lack of bodies could have been from the way the ""ragers"" dealt with them.  I also couldn't fathom the alternate ending bit, as it didn't seem to offer any thought-provoking alternative.  (Maybe I just didn't get it.)<br/><br/>Every scene seemed to have been well thought out and presented.  It was visually pleasing throughout. The plot was believable and they kept it simple.  Did the ragers eventually die off?  Starved to death?  It was such a well told story that I get the feeling I've missed something big,...some symbolism or observation. Did the rest of the world cause any of the destruction in order to isolate the island? Loved it.  Just a well crafted movie. --rg--"
