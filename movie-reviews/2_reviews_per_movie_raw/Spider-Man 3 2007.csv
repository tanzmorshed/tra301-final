"MR_Heraclius","7","56","62","24 February 2020"," I enjoyed this movie
","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script."
"OMTR","10","12","12","5 January 2020"," Spiderman Into Darkness
","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign."""
"streetcar1951","5","1018","1478","6 May 2007"," I'm so sorry, Spidey...
","As I was walking down the stairs and out of the theater, I was trying as hard as I could to pull a smile out of my face. My friends tensely asked if I liked it, I said ""Yes, of course!!"" They nodded weakly in response. On the way home, I kept thinking to myself. ""You liked it! C'mon! It's Spiderman!"" Now, it's two days later, the euphoria of waiting for Spidey to come out has subsided, and I've begun to look at this flick a bit more (shall I say it?) critically.<br/><br/>It's plain to see that Sam Raimi is a fantastic director. He knows when to do what and realizes that he is making a superhero movie, which is why the Spider-man movies have done so well. It's not like the recent Batman and Superman who try to hide the fact that they're just fun superhero films. Raimi knows his material and embraces it. The effects were astounding as usual. Spiderman's one-on-one fight with the Sandman and the crane scene being the major highlights. I thought these features would outbalance the weaker spots of the film, but unfortunately they did not.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, I'm surprised to say that Topher Grace stole the show. I remember how outraged everyone was when he was chosen, but obviously someone knew what they were doing when they let him on as Venom. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst played their usual selves (I can't help but think of Dunst dreaming of getting back to work with Sofia Coppola while doing these films). However, Tobey Maguire REALLY disappointed me. I've always thought he was so great at Spidey, which is undeniable in the first two films and even in this one...when he has his red suit on. Maguire is a one note actor, at least as far as Spidey goes. He just could not pull off the black suit; he wasn't good at being bad. Then came the horrific bridge scene with MJ. Along with most other people I've talked to, my entire theater erupted in laughter when he started crying. It was just...sad...and not in the way the writers intended it.<br/><br/>Speaking of the writing, I hate to be beating a dead horse, but c'mon: 3 villains, Sandman's background, trouble with MJ, Harry's changing attitudes, 2 different Spidermans, competition at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy, etc. It was just WAY TOO MUCH! Even if you had four hours, it's just too much to cram into the audience in one sitting. The great thing about Spiderman 2 (the best of the trilogy) is how focused it was. You had the inner struggle, the villain and his relationship with MJ. There it was! Beautifully filmed and written. From the first 15 minutes of Spiderman 3, I knew that all these parallel story lines were going to crash within the next two hours. The sequence that shows how far they've fallen from part two is the whole emo/hair in the eyes/eyeliner/oh so cool ""bad"" Spiderman scenes. The first few minutes of this was funny in the same way that the ""Raindrops are Falling on my Head"" scene in part two was great, but this time they stretched a good thing way too far. This whole sequence is what sticks in my mind and refuses to let me think that the film was just as great as the rest.<br/><br/>I tried to like it! I really did! I just can't fool myself any longer. Some critics like Peter Travers for Rolling Stone are saying that we can let this one slide because it's Spiderman, but I couldn't disagree more. Spiderman 3 missed the mark and, deep down inside, we all know it."
"Norway1","6","526","768","7 May 2007"," BEST effects, yet WORST movie
","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.<br/><br/>Let me get to the pros vs the cons:<br/><br/>THE GOOD<br/><br/>The Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. <br/><br/>The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! <br/><br/>The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.<br/><br/>The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.<br/><br/>I guess that is a good intro for...<br/><br/>THE BAD<br/><br/>Venom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. <br/><br/>The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. <br/><br/>The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. <br/><br/>American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. <br/><br/>The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.<br/><br/>I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.<br/><br/>Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! :)"
"LennyRenquist","9","578","882","4 May 2007"," The worst Spidey yet. I LOVED IT!
","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.<br/><br/>Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.<br/><br/>Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).<br/><br/>The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.<br/><br/>And then there's Gwen.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard.<br/><br/>(*Sighs*)<br/><br/>Nothing much to say, really.<br/><br/>I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.<br/><br/>But that might be a little cynical of me.<br/><br/>Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.<br/><br/>Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.<br/><br/>Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. <br/><br/>Possibly.<br/><br/>I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.<br/><br/>But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>Fun."
"thecowardlylorin","6","328","494","5 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 is adequate, but adequate just isn't enough.
","My feelings after watching the third film are somewhere in the neighborhood of satisfied, but that feeling is fairly disappointing. Satisfied more or less means adequate and to follow a sequel that I consider excellent with a film that's only adequate is a certainly a step down. Positively, Spider-Man 3 does reasonably well at maintaining a feeling similar to that of the first two films. I never felt like I wasn't seeing the same world or characters and that's important to me. Continuity in tone really helps hold a series together. The Matrix Reloaded never felt to me like I was witnessing the continuation of the story and world presented in the first installment. The scenery and characters felt like weak and dull recreations and that really bugged me. The New-York of Spider-Man 3 is about the same as before, as is Peter's apartment, The Daily Bugle offices, etc. Peter, Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May, etc. also carry over well and it's easy to jump back into their lives. Where it doesn't feel like its predecessors is in its pacing and scope. The film tries to tell a lot of story for one film, much more than either the previous installments. This makes it messy. If you took Spider-Man 1 and 2's stories, wove them together and compressed them into one 2 hour film, you'd have a mess pretty similar to Spider-Man 3. A lot of this has to do with poor exposition and the decision to include three villains. In good exposition, events lead to other events and it all seems to flow naturally. Some films end up feeling like a story wasn't really even written, but instead a series of well-crafted scenes that don't necessarily fit well together. A bunch of smaller scenes are then written to connect those scenes. These scenes can feel very forced because they often rely heavily on coincidence. The Matrix Reloaded is full of these contrived scenes and so is Spider-Man 3. They're frustrating because they act like speed bumps where the plot suddenly feels awkward and my enjoyment of the film drops. One scene sticks out particularly in Spider-Man 3 as too awkward. Venom, one of the super-villains, is swinging through alleyways when he is ambushed by the Sandman, another villain. Venom proposes they team to get Spider-Man together, Sandman agrees, end scene. This scene is needed to set up the final, huge battle of the film but just seems poorly worked in. For one it's very short, and two the characters don't know each other and have completely different motives for being villains. That the two would decide that quickly to become partners after coincidentally running into each other is just sloppy to watch.<br/><br/>Despite how it seems, I didn't hate the film. I was just disappointed in its flow as a narrative and thought it aimed much higher than it should have in terms of what to include plot wise. Regardless though, many scenes were very enjoyable to watch and I don't just mean action scenes. The Daily Bugle scenes, as always, were great and funny. The addition of Topher Grace as Peter's photographer rival, Eddie Brock, was great casting. His line delivery works perfectly with his character's sleazy personality and his scenes with Peter are some of the best. The character Harry Osborne returns and becomes one of the film's three villains: a new Green Goblin that takes over where the Goblin of the first film left off. Harry and Peter's relationship is probably the most interesting part of the story. Their struggle between being friends and enemies makes for some tense moments. One of my favorite scenes in the film is a verbal confrontation in a diner between Peter and Harry. Playing off Peter's presumption that he and Harry are back on good terms, Harry orchestrates a bit of nasty drama that sticks a knife in Pete's love life. He has Peter meet him in a diner just to drive the knife in a little further. As Pete storms out, Harry is awash in sadistic joy with himself before making a fast and creepy exit. Harry is really the best handled villain of the film. Not only as the Green Goblin Jr. fighting Spider-Man in the sky much the way his father did, but as Harry, Peter's estranged friend, using their friendship as a pretty sharp weapon against him. The villain I could have done without was the Sandman. His character was interesting but his place in the film as a main character seemed unnecessary and forced. He's an escaped convict running from the police who accidentally falls into a big science experiment and becomes the Sandman. He is also apparently the actual killer of Peter's uncle Ben thus giving Peter motivation to go after him. This reworking of the first film's story seems very far fetched and unnecessary. The computer effects used to create Sandman are terrific as is the performance by Thomas Hayden-Church, but I think the film would have improved without him. More time could then have been given to the conflicts with Harry and Eddie and likewise Goblin and Venom. Venom is particularly nice because he's the only villain not the product of some crazy experiment gone wrong. His creation is almost entirely Peter's fault. Venom acts as a slimy toothy grinning anti-Spider-Man, who hates Spider-Man on a personal level after Eddie Brock loses his job and girlfriend and holds Peter responsible. Two villains definitely would've been enough for one film, especially two villains that feel wronged by Peter personally, not just Peter as Spider-Man. I don't really want them to continue this series, but since it seems like they may anyway, I hope some lesson is learned with number three that less really can be more. If the time that was spent awkwardly packing too many stories into one film was instead spent working on one good story so that it flowed naturally, Spider-Man 3 could have excelled the way number two did."
"ivo-cobra8","10","123","181","6 December 2012"," Awesome End to an Epic Trilogy
","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!<br/><br/>The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10"
"darthheimdall","10","101","152","5 May 2007"," The darkest, most complex, and best of the three
","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.<br/><br/>How the movie stands on its own:<br/><br/>Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.<br/><br/>Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. <br/><br/>Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!<br/><br/>Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.<br/><br/>Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!"

"dbborroughs","6","197","311","6 May 2007"," Some great action sequences are lost in a film who's script tries to do too much and be all things to all people
","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. <br/><br/>There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.<br/><br/>As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been"
"Special-K88","Null","229","368","8 May 2007"," some good things but it never comes together
","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½"

","I saw this movie at the 12 O'Clock showing and was pinned in my seat from 12:01 to the credits. I went to school ranting and raving about how excellent this film was and was so excited to see it again with the rest of my family. Monday, to my dismay, i was greeted with very negative thoughts on this movie. some even said that it was the worst movie that they have seen in a long time. this angered me because frankly, these people were judging the movie completely wrong.<br/><br/>Most people walked in and expected a beat em up movie with back to back spidey fighting and action galore but instead were greeted with a realistic drama between Peter Parker and MJ and lessons in morals and friendship and forgiveness. to me, this is what made this movie so excellent. Here you have a man with so much power he could be rich and famous but instead, he gives a vast majority of his time protecting people who in many cases don't even appreciate his efforts.<br/><br/>when things finally start going good for him he is hit with relationship troubles, friends turning their backs on him, and super villains to boot. when i saw how he handled things i couldn't help but feel that it was a totally realistic response to what he was given. it made me relate to the character so much more.<br/><br/>this movie made me hurt when he hurt, cry when he cried, and cheer when he triumphed. i can honestly say that i loved this film and would recommend it to everyone. keep in mind though that spider-man is nothing without the man behind the mask and he fights with his heart. without a heart, superheroes are nothing."
"skywalker_ep3","8","272","445","4 May 2007"," Quick review of Spider-Man 3
","Well, your friendly neighbourhood superhero is back! <br/><br/>Its a different time now for Peter Parker as Spider-Man now becoming an icon,hero and idol for the people of New York. Consequently, it makes Parker become egoistic and arrogant and thus lead to many conflicts that he need to overcome as a human and a hero.<br/><br/>The good aspects about this film are : 1-The action sequences are stylish, brilliantly done and intense as hell. You need to see to believe it! The used of CGI here deserve an applause.<br/><br/>2- For a superhero flick, it balance its heart-pumping action scenes and well written drama with flair.<br/><br/>3- The creation of Sandman and Venom are very memorable and astounding.<br/><br/>4- J. Jonah Jameson and the Maître d' (brilliantly played by Bruce Campbell) really steal every scenes their in! Pure classic comedy moment.<br/><br/>5- The ending. A bit cliché but still sum up the trilogy quite nicely. It also provide hints that the future of this franchise is still bright.<br/><br/>The negative aspects of this flick: 1- The pacing. It felt rush ( not as smooth as Spider-Man 2) and there is little character development, especially from the villains. I felt for Dr.Ock from spider-man 2 far more than Sandman and Venom combine. The beautiful Gwen Stacy doesn't contribute much to the film. A waste of time for her actually. They should save this girl for the next film to produce more tension for Parker and Mary Jane.<br/><br/>2-Lots of crying and disco dancing. The scene in the club, where Parker (his dark side) expose his talent in dancing ( Fez from That 70's Show comes to my mind immediately when i watched this scene)is overlong. They should just cut it a bit and add more character development.<br/><br/>3-The climax. It so predictable and the dialogues from the female reporter are cringe-inducing . "" Oh, the brutality."" Enough said.<br/><br/>Overall, its still an enjoyable movie. I enjoyed it better than Spider-Man 1 but I think it cannot top the brilliant of Spider-Man 2. I hope if there is a Spider-Man 4, there should stick to one villain in that movie. It really makes all the different."
"paulbutterworth1978","2","271","445","1 May 2007"," Perfect example of trying to fit TOO much into a movie
","OK, I'm a HUGE fan of Spiderman...Liked the first movie, LOVED the second flick and was dying to see the third one. And since I live in Korea, I was able to see the movie tonight (SM3 opened in Asia 3 days before it opens in North America). I'm sad to say, I was let down by the third film.<br/><br/>The biggest issue by far is the fact that there are FAR too many story lines going on at once. The movie feels very bogged down and not nearly enough time is given for proper character development.<br/><br/>In this movie, there is Spiderman, Mary Jane, Gwen Stacey, ""New"" Goblin Venom and Sandman. Each character is given the bare amount of time for development.<br/><br/>I'm assuming that since most of the cast is non-committal to returning for a fourth movie, the filmmakers decided to throw as many stories into this movie in case it was the end. It really takes away from the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The other big issue I have is the very forced sense of humor the movie tries to take. From a very lame riff on John Travolta's walk from ""Saturday night fever"" to watching Peter Parker dance to jazz music, a lot of the humor feels like it's was written for a SNL sketch.<br/><br/>There is a very poor ending involving Spiderman and Sandman that defies logic.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope this is NOT the last Spiderman film, because if it is, it's certainly not the best way for the series to end. None of the magic and originality of the second film are here. I hope that a decision is made to do a fourth film and I hope if a fourth film is made, the filmmakers decide to go back to what made the second film so special.<br/><br/>** out of *****"
"rainbowsheeps","8","62","94","5 May 2007"," Thought it was great
","Let me start by saying I see some reasons why fan boys are upset, and some of the issues people had problems with. Yes, it packed a ton of things into it, but it made it feel more like an event. I have read comics in my life, mainly Spider-Man and Batman comics... I'm familiar with the original comics origin story of Venom and all of these characters before they hit movie screens, but I still can't understand some of the hatred and criticism that the film got. There are issues, which I'll list below, but the film has a strong emotional core with its characters that shines through here.<br/><br/>The dramatic elements, according to many reviewers and critics are done poorly here, but that's not the case. It's easy to feel the hurt Peter feels when MJ has to break some horrible news to him, you see his anger when he realizes Marko's connection to his murdered uncle, Ben, and the roller coaster that is Harry throughout the film even lets you sympathize with his position because you see, for the first time since the first film and done even better here, a more ""innocent"" side to Harry, though it doesn't last long.<br/><br/>Also, I did read plenty of online reviews prior to viewing and many of them gave me the feeling that the only way Peter's anger and 'dark side' is shown is through a dance number in a jazz club, which is not the case at all. You see Peter going overboard and saying and doing hurtful things all throughout the mid-section of the film, causing problems for himself and other characters and fully descending deeper and deeper into his own vengeance and anger. A lot of this part of the film is lightened with comedic elements, which is true. There is indeed a dance number, but there's a point to it and plays into a more emotionally charged scene later on. If you've read anything about tonal shifts or the film being called a ""mess"", I'd say don't believe it. It's done with class and maturity to make it a bit more fun, yet it doesn't take away from the more emotional and mature scenes that come prior and afterward.<br/><br/>Of the fight scenes, all were done well. Sandman's scenes throughout are usually the most beautiful and interesting, while Venom is done quite well too. One thing I did sorely miss was the use of the plural speech from Venom. A ""We're not Brock... we are Venom!"" line might have been nice. Its a minor grievance though, and all of the action scenes are done quite well, specifically the first and last.<br/><br/>The film is flawed, yes, but it's also quite fun. This is a small list of issues that are present throughout the film that are result of mostly lazy scriptwriting/storytelling, but didn't ruin the movie, at least for me.<br/><br/>Issues: - Harry's Amnesia: Amnesia always feels like lazy writing, in almost every case (except maybe Memento). In this case, it's fairly weak but its forgivable as it allows you to see a side of Harry that hasn't been seen in a long while. It opens him up to more feelings and truly allows for sympathy when things go bad for him, and particularly the end. So, to me, it was quite forgivable as I saw why they used it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Suit's Introduction: Yeah, the odds of the meteor crashing right next to Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man are quite slim. The comic origin is out, of course, but perhaps tying Jameson's astronaut son from the second film by having his ship be attacked by the suit and need rescue from Spidey would have been a better way to incorporate the suit... it would have allowed for another action sequence, tie in MJ's ex-boyfriend and tied the symbiote in a little more neatly. However, perhaps such a sequence would put the budget or time limit too high.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Butler: He mostly kept his mouth shut through the first two films, but in this one he delivers an important message to one of the characters that changes the course of the film. It's slightly forgivable because he's given a more humanized part in this film, but it's still a display of some lazy writing.</li></ul><br/><br/>Aside from those issues, I disagreed with many of the other critiques that I've read. I don't find the comic aspects disheartening, they were done well, but from the reviews I thought it would be light on the serious and dramatic content of the films, ie, I wouldn't be emotionally invested in the characters this time around. That turned out to be false though, at least it was for me. The special effects were great, the action was great, the acting was great... but what really holds this film and makes it all feel worth it is the emotional attachment to its characters and the way it builds your feelings for them. All of these characters are flawed, some very seriously, but you care about what happens to them all and brings the first two films full-circle in terms of pretty much everything. It wraps up what's been done in the previous two and does some of those things even better."
"kevin-1147","1","117","186","7 May 2007"," You have got to be kidding me
","How anyone can say this was a good movie is beyond me. This quite possibly is the stupidest movie I've seen in a long long long time. And it takes a lot for me to be that negative. You actually have to try to right something so non-sensical and idiotic. I left thinking that this wasn't just the end of the Spiderman franchise but it was done via cinematic suicide. It had to be. Nothing in this movie made any sense. For instance, 1) Sandman - OK so a guy escapes from jail, goes home to see his daughter and isn't caught but then later on he's running through some marshland (in NYC no less) being chased by cops and falls into a giant wide open hole in the ground which is actually a science experiment and the scientist think he's a bird so they don't stop the experiment and the experiment makes no logical sense but turns him into the sandman and the cops that were chasing him run up on this hole as the experiment is going on (again in the middle of the NYC marshland) and are like whoa a big hole wonder if this convict fell in or something, yeah he probably did let's turn around and walk away and let this giant science experiment hole go unaddressed. WHAT!!!!! This really happened in the movie I kid you not. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>2)Harry tries to kill Peter because of his dad but low and behold after a wild chase through the city Peter knocks him out and of course Harry gets amnesia so he conveniently forgets for the next act of the movie that he really wants to kill Peter 3) Kirsten Dunst sings 3 songs in the movie. What is this a Broadway play? 4) Yup. It is a Broadway play. Or a bad version of Saturday Night fever as Peter does a totally ridiculous piano playing/dance number himself. Basically a retarded version of John Travolta in every move he did in the 70s.<br/><br/>5) OK. This was the lamest part. Harry wants to kill Peter because Peter killed his dad. But right before the final battle Harry's butler comes on screen and tells Harry that Peter didn't kill Harry's dad because he saw the wound and the wound was from his own glider so Harry's dad killed himself and Peter isn't at fault. Uh. Huh? And who are you anyway? 6) Final battle. Why exactly does Sandman want to kill Spiderman??? Wait, he doesn't. He actually says he's not a bad guy and didn't want to hurt anyone? So why did he? No reason. Only because it made for a cool 4 way battle at the end. Jeez how about we TRY to come up with some motivation for him? Sandman could have been the coolest character but he's basically a puppet.<br/><br/>7) Venom. Yah. OK.<br/><br/>There were so many other dumb plot points and ridiculous assumptions and what not that we spent the whole movie laughing."

","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline."

","OK, I'm Gonna start off by saying that this is my first review on the site, because after seeing ""Spider Man 3"" I felt the urge to fully Analise it:<br/><br/>Story- 10/10 The Story picks up from where it ended, leading the characters from the first two films onward to realizing their Comic- Book Potential (Especially Spidey Himself- Notice the ""Key-to-the city"" gig when he poses... That's Definitely the Spidey we all know) and placing the new characters in a very fitting way... it all goes as it should considering the story.<br/><br/>Characters- 10/10 This is one of the things I liked most about this film- the FANTASTIC characters and how they develop. every character has a story of it's own and all of them are interesting, compelling and exciting in such a way that I have never seen in a Comic- Flick Since ""Batman Begins"". The best were Definitely Flint Marko/Sandman and Eddie Brock Jr./Venom. The first with his sad and Tragic persona and the other with his frustration and thirst for vengeance... both were very vital for this film and came through all the way.<br/><br/>Acting- 7/10 This is NOT ""Gone with the Wind"", folks! It's an action/ comics flick so obviously we won't see any Oscar- worthy performances... when Peter started crying on Harry's dead body, THE ENTIRE THEATER BURSTED WITH LAUGHTER!!! However, here once again ""the rescue"" came from the villains: Topher Grace was absolutely Awesome as both Eddie Brock and Venom; he gave a powerful and very believable performance, and Thomas Haden Church did a TERRIFIC job portraying the Sandman (And the funny part is: I don't even like ""Sandman"" OR Thomas Haden Church! how crazy is THAT?)<br/><br/>Action sequences- 10/10 Not A LOT of it but when there is some... its just beautiful... every action sequence is better then the previous one, and altogether you get some of the most unforgettable action- sequences both in Spidey history and comic- flicks history..<br/><br/>Humor- 7/10 I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard in an Action- flick... as a matter of fact... I NEVER *EVER* LAUGHD SO HARD IN AN ACTION FLICK BEFORE! this film has parts that are absolutely hilarious, and most of them belongs to J.K Simmons's as J.J Jameson! (also I would like to add: the rumors are true: Bruce Campbell's cameo= PURE GOLD) but one of the main problems is that it didn't know when to stop and I found myself nearly crying when Peter started dance- walking in the streets, hitting on chicks... I just wanted it to stop! and don't even get me started on that Emo- crap!)<br/><br/>Visual/ Special Effects- *11*/10 Yeah, you heard me! 11 out of 10!! 11!! 250,000,000 $!!! you can CLEARLY see where all the money went. Visually speaking, this is the best Film of 2007! NO JOKE!<br/><br/>and finally... the most important:<br/><br/>Staying true to the Comic- book's Spirit- 10/10 I can't even describe it with words... you will understand when you see it, trust me.<br/><br/>If you are a true ""Spider Man"" Fan, go see it NOW! I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed."

","Even though there is more romance in Spider man 3 it's equaled out with the action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. MaryJane is a little betrayed by Peter Parker, feeling alone and probably envying the new publcity that spidey was getting falls into the arms of Spider Man's rival the New Green Goblin. Peter now finally comes to terms with being spider-man and knowing that he has a dark side too. Peter find himself asking the New Green Goblin for help fighting the Sandman and Venom. It comes to a startling end when the new green goblin comes to the rescue of both of his friends.<br/><br/>Overall Topher Grace and James Franco are the two hottest guys in the movie. If you don't like the action these two guys are diffently worth watching on screen."
"HalRagland","5","250","417","6 May 2007"," Big-Budget Special-Effects Extravaganza, Out Of Focus
","""Spider-Man 3"" comes really close to being as difficult to follow as an ""X-Men"" movie. Well, maybe not that close since an ""X-Men"" movie requires the viewer to try to follow the lives of at least a dozen different characters. But I think it was a mistake for the makers to have Spidey contend with three different villains in one film. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with ""Spider-Man 3"".<br/><br/>I was most disappointed with the use, or misuse, of the Harry Osborne/Green Goblin character. We know that Harry must become the Green Goblin if he is going to have the ability to take on his super hero nemesis Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The makers of ""Spider-Man 3"" waste no time in picking up where ""Spider-Man 2"" left off. Not only does the movie not allow the viewer to observe Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin, but Harry doesn't even dress appropriately for his role. He wears a black uniform and never becomes the public menace his father did. I was looking forward to the Daily Bugle covers about the return of the menace of the Green Goblin. Instead Harry's campaign of revenge against Peter is quickly side tracked by a bout with amnesia after suffering a blow to the head in a fall during his first fight with Peter. After all, the film needs to introduce two more villains, Sandman and Venom, before it ends.<br/><br/>Whereas, in the first two films the viewer really gets to know the Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius characters, in ""Spider-Man 3"" the length of time devoted to the villains amounts to a movie short. Along the way Peter Parker must also contend with his dark side and his troubles in his relationship with his love Mary Jane Watson. Meanwhile, the landlord's daughter, Ursula, is back to amuse viewers once again with her adolescent crush on Pete. Add to all this the time needed to develop the Sandman and Venom villains, plus Gwen Stacy, and I was left wondering exactly what the movie is about.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" is big budget extravaganza that is out of focus in the areas of character and plot development. While it has its laugh inducing comic moments and the best special effects sequences money can buy, it has little else to offer. While I really wanted to see the first two movies again, because I enjoyed the transformation of the main characters into super heroes and villains, it feels like the only reason to see ""Spider-Man 3"" is to check out the special effects again. If there are more Spider-Man films made, and there is no reason to believe there won't be given the money involved in releasing another film, then I would hope that the makers would simplify the story once again and do what made the first two films so enjoyable to watch."
"Skip_4591","8","57","87","6 May 2007"," A Great, Amazing Movie!!!
","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.<br/><br/>This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.<br/><br/>I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.<br/><br/>Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.<br/><br/>Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.<br/><br/>The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10."

","Life for Peter Parker in the city of New York has never been better. His web-slinging alter-ego, Spider-Man, is the hero of millions; his ""day job"" at the Daily Bugle is going strong. His college grades are in top form, and to top it all off, he and the lovely Mary-Jane Watson are madly in love with each other. For once in his life, Peter has very little to worry about...until a strange, small object crashes into Central Park, unleashing a living black ooze that eventually...well, more on that later.<br/><br/>On the other side of town, Flint Marko sneaks into his sleeping daughter's bedroom through an open window. Before leaving, he has a few words with his estranged wife about their child, and then leaves, lamenting, ""I'm not a bad person. I've just had bad luck."" The same night, Peter stops by Aunt May's apartment to tell her of his plans to marry MJ. May shares a heartfelt story about her late husband Ben, and how he proposed to her 50 years prior. Peter is on his trusty moped, when out of nowhere Harry Osborn swoops him into the sky for a battle-royale that ends with Peter sliced a few times, and Harry in a severe coma. A few days later, he awakes with very little of his recent memories, prompting some heartfelt scenes that touch on what Harry's life might have been, had his father not been so neglectful.<br/><br/>As for Mary-Jane...well, her job at a Broadway show is cut off, and due to his crime patrols, Peter hasn't exactly been the most attentive guy on the planet. Neglected, confused, and borderline hopeless, MJ's mood only gets worse when, at a special ceremony, Spidey is given the key to the city, and gets an upside-down kiss from blonde bombshell Gwen Stacy! Jealous and frustrated, she is shattered when Peter takes her for a romantic dinner, and Gwen shows up to say ""hi"". MJ walks out, blind to Peter's plan of a (now-botched) wedding proposal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Harry is recovering at home from his stay in the hospital, when his memories return in a flood of imagery, restoring his desire for vengeance against Peter. He blackmails MJ into dumping Peter, telling her she'll die if she refuses. And, the police inform Peter and Aunt May that Uncle Ben was not killed by a random carjacker. Instead, their new suspect is none other than Flint Marko, who falls into a crater after escaping a chase, only to become trapped in a nuclear experiment that transforms him into a being made entirely of living sand.<br/><br/>And as for that black ooze, it bonds itself with Peter's costume while he sleeps. Peter's mind slowly crumbles under this symbiotic influence, going so far that he retaliates against everyone. A fight with Marko leaves Peter believing him dead after opening a floodgate. Harry and Peter have a fistfight inside the Osborn mansion, leaving Harry disfigured by his own pumpkin bomb. News rival Eddie Brock's work is revealed to be a fraud, causing J. Jonah Jameson to publicly fire him. And Peter even woos Gwen Stacy, right in front of Mary-Jane! All these events come to a devastating head when, during a barfight, Peter forcefully knocks Mary-Jane to the floor. Faced with all the consequences of his actions, Peter flees to a cathedral, where the sound of the tolling bells causes the symbiote to weaken, and Peter rips it away from his body...<br/><br/>...where it drips down through the rafters, and lands on a grieving, bitter, and angry Eddie Brock. Consumed by the evil entity's power, Brock is transformed into the psychotic creature known only as Venom. Tracking down the Sandman, Venom arranges a team-up to take down the heroic wall-crawler, and kidnaps Mary-Jane to use as bait. Soon, Peter swings to the rescue, once again clad in his familiar red-and-blues. But the fight is too much for even him, and as the ""Sandman"" prepares for a death-blow, Harry appears, having been told the truth behind his evil father's demise. Thus, its two against two across the skies and down the streets of New York. In the end...well, let's just say many lessons are learned, about love, duty, and yes, even responsibility. When all is said and done, Peter somberly approaches MJ, with one sentiment on his mind..."
"Jack_Acid","7","14","18","5 May 2007"," When will Hollywood LEARN?!
","*** SPOILERS *** As a die-hard Spider-Man fan, I enjoyed this film. As a film critic, there's a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The action and effects are easily the best in the series. Some of the most stunning effects I have seen. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue is probably the worst.<br/><br/>The Good: I appreciate what elements Sam Raimi brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiote. It's a gutsy move to include it, because it's a stretch for the casual Spider-Man fan to digest an alien coming down and taking over Peter Parker (& Brock), but hey, it's true to the comic.<br/><br/>I also loved the Sandman action sequences, good use of his powers. But making him the gunman of Peter's uncle Ben was a little over the top for me, especially given the ending. To Raimi's defense, at least they give you SOME reason to understand the Sandman's motivations. I was really hoping Venom would be better utilized but he was more of a one-hit wonder character than anything substantial. He's more used as a device to demonstrate the alien's power over people.<br/><br/>In the end, the action sequences are wonderful and thrilling and found myself wanting to rewind and watch is slow motion more than once.<br/><br/>The Bad: Much of the dialogue is forced, failing to flow nearly as easily or believably as 1 or 2. Tobey Maguire seems far less comfortable with the character in this film, which is surprising and unfortunate. Too many homage scenes too, where the writers felt they should give EVERY character that's been in any of the first films at least 5-10 minutes of screen time (like the landlord and his daughter.) This was a huge complaint I had about Pirates II...give us substance instead of what you THINK we want to see more of.<br/><br/>Also, there's times where scenes are so unbelievable from a HUMAN standpoint, you almost can't believe the scene was ever approved. Case in point - in one scene, Gwen Stacy barely clings to a damaged building, dangling 30 stories up. Below are her father and boyfriend watching from the street. One would think they would be panic stricken, especially the father. Instead, both as docile as two strangers watching the evening news. They are so blase in fact, that Brock (Stacey's BF) takes the opportunity to tell the her father that he's been dating her. Meanwhile, she's seconds from death. I felt more panic from the extra in Spider-Man 1 where she's waiting to see if her baby is rescued from a burning building.<br/><br/>And my biggest issue should not be news to Hollywood - GOOD MOVIES DO NOT NEED TO BE 2.5 HOURS LONG! This movie could have EASILY dropped 30-40 minutes and been a great film. They spend WAY too long on needless scene after needless scene (the part where Parker shows up with Stacy at the Jazz club could have been a 5 minute scene; instead, it's dragged on for 15 minutes and it's not even a good scene.) What's worse, many of these unnecessary scenes are redundant - how many dramatic scenes do we need to illustrate the tension between Parker and MJ? I didn't count, but it seemed like 20 when there only needed to be maybe 3.<br/><br/>In the end, despite my complaints, I did enjoy the film. It's a must-see on the big screen given its effects and cinematography. If there is a SM4, let's hope for a less contrived and convoluted script."

","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.<br/><br/>Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.<br/><br/>Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.<br/><br/>Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans."
"space_base","7","140","231","22 April 2007"," Strong third outing, but doesn't quite match the brilliance of Spider-Man 2
","While it does at times tiptoe on the line of being an epic and brilliant work of cinema, SPIDER-MAN 3 is also a big case of overkill. There's way too much going on, and it just seems to keep on coming.<br/><br/>After a somewhat shaky series of opening scenes (with that voice-over narration by Maguire still being as lame as always), the movie quickly finds its balance. It isn't until the symbiote subplot (involving the black Spidey suit) gets into full swing that things become a little too hectic. Director Sam Raimi pulls off an incredible feat by making the never-ending onslaught of subplots balance as well as they do, but the pieces still don't fit to the extent that you'd hope. There's enough plot here for two or three different movies, with plenty of obstacles for Peter to overcome and an ample amount of baddies for him to fight. But in putting the four main plot lines together (i.e., revenge against Sandman, Peter's relationship with Harry, the symbiote suit/Venom, and problems with MJ), the whole experience becomes overwhelming. There's not nearly enough time to absorb all the intertwining threads, no matter how hard the filmmakers obviously try to make it work.<br/><br/>That's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from it. In fact, despite its shortcomings, this picture still marks one of the most fun times I've had at the movies. It wasn't even until after I left the screening that I started to realize how many problems it had. I bet a large percentage of moviegoers will feel the same, being so taken aback by the constant action sequences and stream of story lines that they never even get a chance to notice the film's problems. That's the good news. Bad news is, there's no way these issues will go unnoticed upon repeat viewings. While SPIDER-MAN 2 seems to just keep getting better with each consecutive viewing, I see this one coming up short. It's still less problematic than the first film (which already feels a bit dated), but it just can't compete with the damn near flawless second.<br/><br/>One of the few complaints I had with SPIDEY 2 was the ""raindrops are falling on my head"" sequence. It was silly and awkward, not fitting well with the rest of the film's style... Well, this sequel tops it. After the symbiote takes over Parker, there's a lengthy montage sequence of him (now turned emo) strutting down the street, dancing around and pelvic thrusting at women. It's basically him hopping about to music while looking like a jackass. And it gets worse. He goes with Gwen Stacy (a hot but disappointingly extraneous character) to a club, where MJ is currently working, and basically reenacts the scene from ANCHORMAN where Will Ferrell starts randomly playing the trumpet and hopping across tables. There are slight differences, of course; this one involves a piano and groovy dance moves. But the outcome is the same, leaving audience member's mouths agape at the uncomfortable hilarity. They really should've saved that scene for the DVD outtakes. Then it'd at least be fitting.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the whole movie isn't plagued by scenes like these. It's only rarely that things start getting ridiculous or cheesy to the point where you can't help but roll your eyes. The other problem comes in the way of bits of awkward dialog and rushed character development. There's about an 80% hit rate where everything in the script is as smooth as can be, but that last 20% block does hurt the a few vital aspects of the storytelling. Particularly when it comes to fleshing out character motives and emotional conflicts (something that was given almost complete focus in the first two movies).<br/><br/>At least the action sequences stand strong as some of the most spectacular since... well, SPIDER-MAN 2. They take full advantage of the characters' abilities and surroundings, and then fuse the two together to create a number of downright breathtaking moments. The CGI isn't quite flawless yet, but it's still a visual feast for the eyes. The only disappointment is the use of Venom. He does get some time to shine in the movie's third act (or possibly ninth, taking into account how many different stories overlap), but Topher Grace removes all of the character's menace. It really hurts me to write that, considering how wonderfully handled everything was concerning Brock's character before that point. But alas, despite Grace's strong and amiable efforts, his voice is just too awkward coming out of Venom's mouth. And all they needed was some slight voice alteration to fix the problem. Drats.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN 3 may not be a flawless endeavor, but it's certainly epic. Raimi and company reach for the stars, and instead end up making it halfway across the universe. It's one bumpy and crazy ride getting there, but when things go well, they go really damn well. And while some movie trilogies end on a note that make you yearn for one last installment to redeem the series (I'm looking at you, X3!), we should be so lucky to get a conclusive finish to the SPIDER-MAN series. Almost brings a tear to my eye."
"imajestr","3","793","1397","4 May 2007"," A Let Down.
","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.<br/><br/>Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.<br/><br/>The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.<br/><br/>As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.<br/><br/>There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.<br/><br/>I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it."
"slayer_of_the_jugga_phuk","8","25","36","5 May 2007"," I must admit...
","Let me put this on the table. No matter what it is, you will have lovers and haters, I hope you all knew that. That having been said... I loved this movie. I think it was the best of the three without a doubt.<br/><br/>I think that it had its flaws, as everything does, but the good was plenty to overwhelm the bad.<br/><br/>It had THREE villains. Yes, THREE. And despite what some people think, NONE of them were just kept for a brief moment. They were all big conflicts throughout the whole story, along with a fourth life issue with Mary-Jane and a fifth with Peter Parker against himself. Somehow... they made it work.<br/><br/>I was scared with so many issues and conflicts that the plot would seem rushed and become harmed in the process, but it all worked together perfectly.<br/><br/>Sandman worked perfectly in this, which I didn't expect because the concept of Sandman use to be a little silly to me. Hob-Goblin was one of the best parts of the film, mostly due to the fight-scenes. He was just... better than Green Goblin. And as for Venom (Yes, Venom, he IS in this and for a good length of time)... they could have done better, mostly with the image, but the personality was down well. He didn't have the long, dangling tongue, he wasn't bulky (Black Spider-man on Steroids like in the comic), and Eddie Brock's voice kinda downgraded him... but I think they intended on that. Had they given him as much as they could have... he'd of simply overwhelmed Sandman and Harry... you'd have forgotten them and been solely focused on him, when in this he's NOT THE MAIN VILLAIN! He's, if anything, the last conflict. It's Black Spidey who caused an issue. Eddie Brock was a side-conflict. The main plot was... Harry's revenge... and Mary-Jane's jealousy. All of Peter's personal issues that clashed inside him to allow the Symbiote to possess him and unleash his inner hatred. Sandman was the secondary due to being the trigger that sets Peter's evil off. Once Peter finds out the secret about his Uncle and Flint... that's when he snapped.<br/><br/>The Venom suit and Eddie... were just added trouble. He couldn't be left out, though. Don't fear that they threw him in for Fan-Appeal. He had to be in it. Eddie Brock kept Spiderman steadily on edge and there'd have been no way of releasing Spidey from the black suit without him. He was the finale to the story.<br/><br/>The movie was full of action, very emotional, and all-around good.<br/><br/>BEST MOVIE OF 2007!!!"
"shrek311","4","408","721","4 May 2007"," Shocking!
","What is there to say about this movie? After the light-hearted yet great action-packed first two movies, what were we to expect for the third movie? Apparently the movie was marketed as the ""darkest"" of the three, seemed to promise more action, especially when combining three villains from the comic books.<br/><br/>But as a loyal fan, I went to the theater to see the movie. Bought the tickets multiple days in advance and waited to see what has been hyped up for so long. And the reviews and critics were right. The movie tries to do too much and in the end disappoints.<br/><br/>First, the movie fails to fully introduce any of the new characters, and for most of the first half is quite scatter brained and moves from sequence to sequence, failing to bring any of these stories really together.<br/><br/>Despite the poor development, the worst part of the movie was the cheesiness. Yes, we all know this is a comic adaptation. Yes, we all know comic books are cheesy. But not to this extent. For moments, I had actually believed we were sitting in the wrong theater, watching some horrible chick flick. There were moments in the movie that seemed out of ordinary, random, like chosen scenes from SNL making parodies of itself. As funny as this may sound, it made it difficult to continue watching the movie. We were constantly reminded of Tobey Maguire and James Franco's inexperience as actors. Neither of whom could pull of the cheesiness or light-hearted fun.<br/><br/>The movie writers completely moved away from what the first two movies set up. And even worse, they deceived the movie-goer with the trailers. You enter the theater expecting more action, some darker events, but perhaps the same light-hearted comic book fun. Yet, you get less action, less plot development, ""dark"" events that are impossible to take seriously and will just laugh at instead, and over-sapped cheesiness that puts ""Scary Movie,"" ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" to shame. For a movie that was portrayed in the trailers as ""the darkest of the three,"" it earned the most laughters, mockeries, disappointments and walk-outs I've seen in a Spiderman screening.<br/><br/>It was honestly difficult to sit through this movie. I am a comic book junky, and even for me, it was nearly unbearable. Very disappointed in the way they chose to finish the series."
"emperor_tom","10","44","68","5 May 2007"," Quite simply, the best comic book movie ever made.....
","One of the best things about Marvel comics, at least the golden age of Marvel Comics, is their ability to blend action, comedy, romance and drama into one beautifully enjoyable piece of artwork. The first two Spiderman films managed to being this beauty to life on the big screen, making us laugh, making us cry, making us scream, but most of all, thrilling us with a perfect display of cinematic goodness. So how does Spiderman 3, advertised as the darkest of the films, measure up ti its predecessors. Well bud, if you thought you'd seen it all, you ain't seen nothing' yet.<br/><br/>For Spiderman 3 is glorious in every sense of the word. From its flashback opening credits sequence to its beautifully underplayed conclusion, the whole film is so full of life and colour that you cant take your eyes off the screen. It is, to date, the only film I've seen where the audience applauded at the end. It should be noted that this was a cinema in a notoriously hard to please part of town, giving an indication of just how well its being received.<br/><br/>In this film we see how Spidey deals with more villains than ever before, and how Peter Parker deals with personal problems beyond anything he ever thought he'd face. Spiderman has become a celebrity in New York, elevating Parkers ego to an unprecedented scale. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is seeing her career take a downturn, being dropped from a promising stage role in favour of an actress who can sing better. Que an hilarious scene where an oblivious Peter tries to build up MJ's confidence by advising her on the perils of celebrity ('kids love me, Halloweens a busy time...'). This film has more heart than the previous 2 spideys, and really makes us feel for the characters.<br/><br/>But its the action scenes that most people will flock to this film to see, and they do not disappoint. Thomas Haden Church convinces as the Sandman, whilst Topher Grace is the slimy Eddie Brock, whose humiliation at the hands of the newly slick Peter Parker, leads to his transformation into the terrifying Venom. The final confrontation on a building site is amazing, the camera skillfully following Spidey as he combats the two foes, with a surprise partner in tow.<br/><br/>So, Spiderman 3 is everything you could ask for from a film. Thrills, chills and spills. And watch out for Bruce Campbells cameo as a french waiter. Hands down the funniest scene of the year so far. Go and see it, you will not be disappointed."

","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.<br/><br/>With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.<br/><br/>The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!"""

After the first two films literally set the character scenes and the hopeful return of the goblin this film could have been fantastic!<br/><br/>Sadly however by slipping in some terrible and cheesy dialogue, an over-abundance of new characters and then trying to take on one of the greatest characters from the comics and cartoons the film comes out with an average marking!<br/><br/>Firstly I have to say I enjoyed this film, it was fun, the special effects were fantastic and the fight scenes therefore played out very well.<br/><br/>This film did however destroyed any character building made by the previous two and results in a serious lack of cohesion to the other two and because of this cannot be placed within the same league.<br/><br/>Sandmand and the new goblin both admirable foes and both shown well, however venom could have been so much more and came across far too weak as far as I am concerned and seemed to be slipped on the back of an average film to try and boost ratings. I am not one for cliffhangers in large franchises, I mean the only reason I didn't see the 3rd matrix film was because the cliffhanger was pointless and the second film killed off any point of a third, however a full venom film would have made sense due to its sheer fantastic reasoning and design, even introducing the character carnage would have been fantastic, but he seems rushed in this film, and thats not the way to win over die hard fans and new fans the like!<br/><br/>Anyway, I appear to be ranting, I would recommend you watch this film, its fun, its got great action and the Bruce Campbell cameo was fantastic, however do not watch this thinking you are going to get the same quality and attention to detail as the first two films, watch it like X-Men 3, as this is just what it is, a good trilogy spoilt by the lack of development and the need to force as many characters in at once.

","I really do feel sorry for those that enjoyed the first two Spiderman films, but hated this one. I really enjoyed it, and for those of us who did, it keeps going or completes the story of Spiderman. Was it as good as the first? Yes, maybe better. Was it as good as the second? Nope, and I truly believe that may be why some do not care for it as much.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong it has its problems. It did have a feeling of having too much crammed into one film, and the scene with Osborn's butler telling him that his father killed himself was the low point. Overall though the film was fun, had awesome effects, great bad guys, cool fight scenes, and most importantly it kept the focus of the film on Peter Parker/Spiderman. Not on Venom, which some of those that absolutely think the film sucks actually wanted.<br/><br/>Yes I know Venom has a huge following, but it is not a film about him. All Spiderman films have kept the villains as antagonists that keep the film going, nothing more, and that is how it should have been. Through out all three films the main story is about PP and MJ like it or not.<br/><br/>Overall I think that Spiderman 3 is a great addition to the Spiderman films. The movie explores the ""dark"" things that people do to each other, and the ability to forgive those that do. I also liked the low key ending, which was different then the first two. It was subtle and suited the overall theme of the film. It also showed the finality of the series, while at the same time leaving room for a possible sequel. Once again sorry to those who hated it, because for those that loved it we now have the best comic book trilogy ever put on film."

","Well, let me start by saying that, as many true Spider-Man films fans, I waited for this movie since the very moment I stood up from my seat after watching Spider-man 2. And I'm saying this literally, I am not lying at all, that's exactly the time I've been anxious for this movie to come out, and exactly as I thought, it was extremely amazing, even if I already knew the end of the movie and had unfortunately watched TOOOONSSSSS of spoilers on internet before, but wtf!!! I loved the special effects and to everyone out there who is reading this review let me tell you guys YOU WILL REGRET NOT HAVING WATCHED THIS ON THE THEATERS IF YOU BUY THE DVD WITHOUT HAVING GONE TO THE THEATERS FIRST!!It is extremely cool to see and listen to the movie in the theaters: since the astounding sound of Harry's new glider, to the screaming of Venom and the Sandman which are absolutely amazing sounds!!! I loved so much Church's acting in this movie, he really made me put myself on his position, I could really understand the reasons he had to do what he did, he was simply the best actor in this movie, after Tobey Maguire, OF COURSE!!!! In spite of what most of bad reviews say, I absolutely think he's evolved into an amazing actor, and even if the crying scene wasn't really good, I think it needs a GREAT actor to play to EXTREMELY different roles in one single movie, and that is what Maguire did, and he really shocked when he became aggressive, he just didn't look like him, that was completely cool.<br/><br/>And, finally I have to talk about the long-waited character and favorite, I'd dare to say: VENOM! I strongly believe Topher Grace did a great acting, though he was kind of delicate at times in the way he talks but whatever, that made his role even darker because he seemed sutile with his kind voice even as Venom, but he rocked! I loved so much the scene of the destruction of Venom in which Grace puts an expression in his face that really rocks!! I loved that so much, he deserves a 10 out of 10 for his acting in this movie.<br/><br/>I hope you all enjoy and cry as I did with the end, though I strongly believe that, if this is the end of the trilogy, it had a bad ending, because there aren't dialogs between Pete and MJ, they only look at each other and the movie ends, I think that is really stupid, but if they are ending the movie this way in order to make other movies, then i think the ending was OK...<br/><br/>ANYWAYS, YOU SHOULD GO SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T, AND IF YOU HAVE, SEE IT AGAIN, JUST LIKE I DID (3 TIMES ON Friday AND 1 ON Saturday)!!!!!!!!!"
"SteakSalad_101","7","189","334","5 May 2007"," Well...er...I liked it!
","This is going to be a difficult review to write, but I shall try my best. I waited for Spidey 3 for a hell of a long time. Long, long time. I bought my tickets to see it in IMAX two and a half weeks before it opened. Slowly and even more slowly, the weeks went by alongside tons of schoolwork that only led me closer to the anticipated night.<br/><br/>Well, it's half past midnight and I just got home from seeing it. First of all, let's look at the good side of the movie. The special effects were ASTOUNDING. They were incredibly realistic (even if it IS a comic book movie!) and experiencing the amazingly choreographed fight scenes in IMAX was well worth the extra five bucks per ticket. Sam Raimi's directing has also greatly improved, as he was able to balance somewhat of a minor interlocking storyline between three villains and still manage to keep the movie on its feet. I felt the length of the movie (roughly 2 1/2 hours) was perfect--long enough to keep you entertained, and short enough to keep you from not going bored out of your mind. Raimi and the writers even pack some HYSTERICAL humour into the film, with a classic cameo from Bruce Campbell as the Maitre'd of a French restaurant, plus many other laugh-out-loud hilarious scenes. Plus, my favorite part of the good points, is that Spider-Man 3 is a fun, fun, FUN popcorn movie. Lots of fun. Sometimes you look up at the screen and wonder ""what in the hell was that?"" But it's all good, cause overall, it's lots of fun and you end up not caring if the story makes sense or not. (It does, don't worry) The storyline is much more darker, complex, and mature than the first two movies, and it doesn't seem ""Spider-Man"" ish, which a lot of people were definitely NOT expecting. I think this is why a lot of people didn't like it. Now the iffy parts. The acting was OK. Yes, just OK. Not good, DEFINITELY not great--just OK. Tobey Maguire had me believing that he had improved from Spider-Man 2 but when we got to the scene with him and MJ on the bridge--oh my, the entire audience was gasping for air because we were all laughing so hard at his terrible fake-crying. Kirstin Dunst's acting skills never really annoy me; I think she's a great actress and while she's certainly not as good as many other actresses in Hollywood, she does a fine ""B"" job in Spider-Man 3 that works for the movie. I felt James Franco needed some variety, though, as throughout all three Spider-Man films he seems to be acting the same. And, surprisingly, Topher Grace was a lot of fun to watch! It'll be hard to watch That 70s Show again without thinking of Venom! Yet, out of all the performances, Thomas Haden Church comes out on top with a very serious portrayal of Sandman. He blew me away! (pun intended!) I didn't have a huge problem with the corniness of the movie. Yes, I know, the scene with Peter going emo and then gyrating his hips in front of a suit store had me raising my eyebrows, but it was a funny element to the storyline. Sure, we could've done without it, but they got some laughs and that's what counts. There were one or two scenes (particularly MJ and Peter on the bridge) that made me want to get up and leave, but they're over quickly.<br/><br/>The part that bothered me the most, though, is that the ""strange black entity"" that bonds with Peter--the symbiote--had no real significance in the story whatsoever. It kinda just...happened. There was no backbone to the symbiote story, nothing about it was explained at all, and it just kinda attached itself to Peter's motorbike and then possessed him. It felt very random and, even though it was the whole movie storyline, very out-of-place. This bothered me a LOT.<br/><br/>Overall: worth the trip, and if you get a chance, see it in IMAX. It's FAR from great, but it's a good film, and I liked it better than the first Spider-Man. A very nice kick-off to the summer movie season. Well done, Mr. Raimi!"

","I remember seeing this film when it first came out and to this day I still remember everything about this film like it was yesterday. The movie functioned like a TV series in that it had a bunch of story arcs to keep the audience engaged and just built on the others very easily at each moment. Unlike the first two movies, with the way the film is done we don't know exactly who's the good guys & who's the bad guys in this film. You think you do but you don't because the characters have to go through some developing stages in the course of the story. By doing so, some things get a little twisted and until they're untwisted, we begin to ask ourselves as an audience where is this story going. it's not confusing, just a little unusual given how we saw the characters in the two, but keep an open mind because we soon recognize who's good and who's evil and how they are stopped. With all its subplot arcs, this movie takes on a completely different turn than its predecessors. Once it's resolved, the ending justifies where the story to this one started at the beginning and completes this story."

","Although the critics and some fans ripped this entry into the Spider-Man franchise as the worst of the Sam Raimi directed pictures, it's still an action packed entry as a superhero flick. Peter Parker thinks his life is good as his girl Mary Jane has gotten a part in a Broadway musical. However, his best friend, Harry Osborne is still hellbent on vengeance for the death of his father, the Green Goblin. A two-bit criminal, who has been discovered to be the REAL killer of Ben Parker gets exposed to a scientific experiment while trying to escape from the police, and his molecular structure has been changed to that of sand. In the meantime, while the city celebrates Spider-man, an alien symbiote crashes to earth and invades Peter's costume, creating an entity that brings out Spider-Man's dark side. When Peter rids himself of the costume, an ambitious photographer takes over the costume and becomes the entity Venom. It takes teaming with harry to defeat the Sandman and Venom. Although some of the action is far fetched, the action makes up for it."

","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.<br/><br/>The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.<br/><br/>The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.<br/><br/>This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.<br/><br/>Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie."

","After Spiderman 2 I had my doubts about a third one, heck I'm sure most of us did.<br/><br/>But I have to take my non-existent hat off to the director and writers of the third movie. It was fantastic. It had everything we all wanted. Not one... Not two.. But THREE, yes THREE bad guys.<br/><br/>Not only that, but they brought in Venom. I remember hearing his 'roar' sat on the middle row, Peter looking tense and scared, in the background you hear Venom crawling around the darkness watching his prey. It sends a shiver down my spine.<br/><br/>I'm not a comic geek, though you may have thought that by reading this article. But I love how they have brought Marvel heroes into movie theatres.<br/><br/>I would strongly consider this movie for all the family to watch.<br/><br/>I also love how the movie has added Peter finally getting an ego-boost from his superhero stardom. How it shows the troubles of Mary and Peters relationship, similar to the comics. The mystery of Uncle Bens killer is finally revealed. Oh how could I forget Harry Osborn avenging his fathers death.<br/><br/>The ending is predictable, it has a nice little surprise of course, and how they finished the end battle, with such fantastic CGI effects, perfect camera work and one intense battle to leave you standing on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Sorry if this review seems a little hard to read, but it has everything you need.<br/><br/>Go out, see this movie. Rent it when it's on DVD, purchase it. It's a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>P.S - Yes another scene featuring STAN LEE is in this movie. (Though he has a bigger role this time... Few more lines as well.)"
"Tyson14","7","6","7","2 August 2014"," The worst of a great trilogy but that's not all bad
","I didn't care much for this movie after the first viewing. I thought it was hammed up and bloated with special effects that are hallmarks for most summer releases. However, after watching it a few more times the movie has grown on me to the point that I think this was, while not a great masterpiece, a very good film.<br/><br/>Sure, there are plot holes and characters that aren't truly developed or fleshed out. Some scenes are down right ridiculous (the night time experiment that spawns Sandman). Yes, some of the CGI borders on cartoonish - the fight between Sandman and Spiderman in the subway comes to mind. And there are clichés, like the old damsel-in-distress scenarios that Mary Jane continually finds herself in. But this is a superhero flick and it's not supposed to be completely realistic. So like Steve Winwood says, just roll with it.<br/><br/>What makes this movie rewatchable is the acting and the overall theme of forgiveness as it pertains to Peter Parker and Spiderman. Tobey Maguire, Thomas Haden Church, and of course J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson rise above the hokiness and give great performances. Even James Franco delivers - he just plays a great jerk. And Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited role as Aunt May and gives a high quality performance. Kirsten Dunst is the weak link again I don't know I just don't like her in these films.<br/><br/>The final scene between Spiderman and Sandman was very touching and done so well. In the end, Peter learns how to truly forgive, an act that releases his heart from all of the pain he's been carrying around since his Uncle was murdered. Although I despised this final scene on the first viewing, thinking it was a little too tidy and contrived, I now realize that this was the culmination of the trilogy that finally rounds out who Spiderman truly is. The dark, vengeful corner of Peter's heart which the Symbiote latched onto was exposed and destroyed by the love he demonstrated after Sandman's confession. Peter saw what he would have become - Venom - if he did not confront his hatred and then let it go. This final installment in the series is a fine capstone. In all, one of the better superhero and summer blockbuster movies I've ever seen."

","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.<br/><br/>Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.<br/><br/>Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame."

"Green_Saturn","7","6","7","4 September 2010"," Different than the first two... not necessarily in a bad way
","First of all I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had more action than the first two, more suspense (considering they most likely won't make a fourth movie I was honestly fearful for Peter's life through out the duration of the movie) and it was much darker than the first two. The villains were tougher, all the relationships were more complex... MAN was this a good movie!<br/><br/>Yes, this could've been better. Any movie has room to improve. Some of the injuries Peter manages to survive seem a little too far-fetched, even for a super-hero. He walks away from some of these fights with a few scratches on his arms maybe and that's it! It might have been better if the film-makers had hurt him a little more considering how many women simply LOVE Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>As with the previous Spidey movie, the CGI improved. It needs to if you're going to have a guy made of sand and a creepy poisonous alien thing trying to kill Peter all while the Green Goblin's floating around. Sandman was VERY cool. Venom... not so much but seeing that he's a popular villain he was in his proper place.<br/><br/>Most of the relationships really twist. I mean, they never really explain what happens with Peter and MJ, you're only assuming it works out. Spider-Man 4 could certainly help with this. The Peter/Ursala (the anorexic girl) relationship still leaves me puzzled. Hmm. I'll save that for another review.<br/><br/>It doesn't really seem like the place to leave Spider-Man hanging (Haha get it? :P). A fourth installment would most certainly not be out of line. Spider-Man seems to collapse within himself and then rebuild in each installment. It would be nice to finally see him get a break. I love love LOVE every second of the movie. Just like any good comic book movie sequel, even if you haven't seen the first two you won't be completely lost watching this. Highly recommended. If you love action then you'll LOVE this!!!!!!"
"Ryan_McLelland","1","91","162","6 May 2007"," Bad. Batman and Robin bad. Two and a half hours I'll never get back.
","SPOILERS ARE PROBABLY ABUNDANT Maybe it is because I went into this with a non-fanboy perspective, but pretty much the best part of this movie was the prequel comic written by Todd Dezago (GO TODD!) that I got before the movie. The film was, for me, on par with Batman and Robin. While it started off great in the first hour, suddenly the movie deteriorated right before my very eyes. The last hour of the movie was spent by my girlfriend and I MOCKING the film in a packed theater. By the time we rolled around to Mary Jane singing ANOTHER song at the end, we just got up and left the theater.<br/><br/>The first big fault is the under use of Thomas Haden Church. Here is a man who is an amazing actor, perhaps at the level of both Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina. I was quite happy with his casting and was happy to see him in this flick. However Church never gets to spread his wings as Sandman. While the other flicks allowed the baddies to grow this film allowed Sandman to get his powers, have a bit of growth, and then disappear for most of the film. The final result was even worse? Even though Sandman had killed his uncle, escaped from prison, robbed banks, caused massive collateral damage on the city streets, and who knows how many other crimes, Spidey decides he can 'forgive' Flint Marko for killing his uncle and then Sandman just LEAVES. And Spidey, crying, allows him too. All because he's forgiven? Bad scripting was truly in abundance here and one can really think that Sam Raimi may have finally lost it on this film. I've enjoyed all of Sam's work from the Evil Dead flicks, to Darkman, to Love of the Game, Quick and the Dead, and the first two Spidey flicks. However he absolutely tried to cram way too much into this movie. It might have even worked, might have, if not for the cringe worthy parts that had no sense being in the film. Evil Peter dancing on the streets a la Saturday Night Fever? The bad one man dance off in the dance club? Mary Jane singing her heart out when she had EVERY right to be fired...for Kirsten Dunst cannot sing. I had heard there was singing and dancing but these moments, ESPECIALLY the Peter moments, were just horrible. It reminded of those cringe-worthy Batman and Robin moments where the Batmobile went up the building and Mr. Freeze having a dial that turns HOT in his lair when the man can only have it COLD. Kids yelling out ""OH WICKED COOL"". The HORRIBLE 'reporters' at the end? The part where Spidey lands right next to the flag. The theater burst out laughing! Last time I heard that was with Vader's ""NOOOOO"" at the end of Episode 3. It's a shame because the first hour had great scripting, great action, and great lines. It was almost like a different writer and different director took over for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Topher Grace. Oh Topher. He was someone else I was very excited about in casting. Sure fanboys might be like, ""But Eddie Brock is this big guy"" but I liked seeing him as this slimy, young antithesis to Peter. Yet Topher wasn't great in this film at all. You are talking to someone who sat threw Win A Date With Tad Hamilton and actually liked it. Topher was great in That 70's Show, shined in Traffic, and has had several great roles since. His early appearances in this movie are great but when he is actually Venom, he falls into the horrible acting motif.<br/><br/>AND THE UNMASKINGS. Why wear a mask if you don't want a secret identity??? Every twenty seconds Spidey is taking his mask off. He arrives at the parade with his mask off. In a city like New York everyone is ALWAYS looking around with a camera. While Peter stands there, mask off, smiling at the crowd, someone is sure to snap a shot of him without a mask. And as the movie goes on you start to wonder why does he wear a mask at all if he just has it off all the time. Goblin Jr. seemed to have a mask on only to have the cool Stargate effect to show his face and of course Venom, when he wants to talk, has to go back to Eddie's face to lay whatever horribly scripted diatribe on us.<br/><br/>Evil Peter. God. How horrible this was. Tobey Maguire is a decent actor and has been good in these films, but why God why? He gets the symbiote and suddenly he's evil and we KNOW it because he wears his BANGS FORWARD. Bangs forward = EVIL PETER! This was so laughably bad especially when Peter starts dancing in the Manhattan streets.<br/><br/>The characters certainly weren't sleepwalking through their performances but Sam Raimi's script and directing certainly brought this movie down to a whole new level. It WAS Batman and Robin bad. Superman Returns bad. Catwoman bad. Dare I say...Tank Girl bad. Barb Wire bad. I love a great deal of comic book movies and I can usually take EH movies. I liked all the FF movies (Corman included). Liked Daredevil. Thought Elektra was eh-okay. Hulk grew on me. As did Punisher. But this film was like an atrocity. Even the first hour which was good was fully diminished by the end. I'm fairly certain that I could never watch this movie again. I'd watch Ghost Rider a million times in a row before I could ever bring myself to watch this movie again."

","All these people who rated this movie bad should really lighten up. I'm sure all the people who hated Spider-Man 3, loved the Pirates of the Caribbean movies...<br/><br/>As for Spider-Man 3, I actually think it was one of the best (second only to Spider-Man). Everyone keeps complaining that there wasn't enough character development, but i believe it was perfect. They showed exactly how Sandman was formed, and exactly how Venom was formed...What more do you need? I went to the May 3rd Midnight showing with 3 of my other friends. Everyone in that movie theater was cheering and applauding just about everything (especially the Stan Lee cameo). And the movie received a standing ovation at the end.<br/><br/>I loved the tag teaming that Peter and Harry had at the end, when they teamed up and fought off Venom and Sandman. It was pure awesomeness (excuse the lame choice of words).<br/><br/>I can't wait to buy the Score, yes I said the score, as the soundtrack was terrible. All Spider-Man soundtracks are terrible (aside from 2 songs from the first soundtrack, ""Hero"" ""What we're all about""). I loved the song that played when Peter takes out the old Red and Blue suit before the final battle, and the song that plays when Harry offers his hand to Peter during the final battle. Amazing<br/><br/>There's not one part of this movie that I didn't like, aside from the small screen time of Venom, but aside from that, I thought it was AMAZING! Don't listen to critics. I've learned that every time a critic gives a bad review, the movie is usually amazing! And when a critic gives a good review, it's usually a horrible movie (Moulin Rouge). Everyone gave ""Hulk"" a terrible review, but I thought it was great. Critics don't know what they're talking about. Spider-Man 3 was AMAZING! GO SPIDEY!!!!!"

","This movie was all that I had looked forward too- and more.<br/><br/>First of all, let's just say that the only superheroes I do like are Spiderman, Spidergirl, and the PowerPuff Girls. I know lots of the villains of Spiderman, mainly because of my Spiderman obsessed little brother.<br/><br/>Now, let's get on to this comment here.<br/><br/>At first, I knew one thing that was going to happen- Harry was going to die. I read a short story before going to see the movie that someone had written after reading the novel, and it ruined the Harry dying for me. I didn't care- it was a Spiderman story, and this guy is my friend.<br/><br/>It still shocked me though- and I'm not a girl with a lot of emotion, normally only smiling a few times a day- but I almost cried when Harry died. That's saying something for a girl like me.<br/><br/>There were a few surprises in there- like Sandman trying to get the money only because of his daughter, and Eddie Brock so suddenly hating Peter Parker. The scene where Peter hit MJ was a little surprising too- even more so when people in the audience started clapping! I was surprised about how far our society has fallen to start clapping for something like that.<br/><br/>But, this movie was awesome- I only hope that POTC 3 is as good as this, or else it'll ruin my summer.<br/><br/>Next stop- awesomeness!"

"three-20","1","46","79","6 May 2007"," This outing was horrific, I wanted to leave
","Ill keep it brief, what an awful film.<br/><br/>It ruined the whole series in my opinion and although I will purchase it on DVD to complete my spider-man collection, I don't think it will ever make it out of its cellophane wrapper.<br/><br/>Spider-man turning into some emo kid, was the beginning of a swift descent into oblivion for this movie. MJ trying to get with every man she could, the whole ""this is about me"" speech was dreadful to watch and just made Parker look like some mug.<br/><br/>Then we see the weird 70's moment where Parker is strutting down the street winking and pointing at all the women, Im surprised he didn't get maced in the face and beat up on his little jaunt. This literally gob smacked myself and my wife, I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.<br/><br/>Then to end it with Venom (my favourite spider-man villain) lasting all of 5 minutes was disappointing, Venom was one of my main reasons for watching the movie. It got to around 2h15m into the movie and still no Venom. He dies in a completely deflated fashion, but the best is yet to come! The Sandman turns out to be a real softy and a good guy at heart, awwwww. He takes time to explain to Spiderman how hes really sorry for robbing the banks and killing folk, but he was only doing it for his daughter. Spiderman takes this explanation pats him on the back and sends him on his way.<br/><br/>They also turn Harry Osborn into a good guy, coming to Spideys rescue. Never mind that he should be completely demented after becoming the Green Goblin. He conveniently dies, like Venom. So that Spidey no long has and adversaries left and he can get on with life.<br/><br/>I was also sick with the amount of times spider-mans mask falls to pieces so everyone can see its really Peter Parker. Everyone in New York knows its Peter Parker by now, he has no need for a costume. Though not as ridiculous as when it happened in front of a train full of people in Spiderman 2. Its America after all, every single one of them would be selling Spidermans identity on Ebay for millions.<br/><br/>I was also shocked by the American flag incident, it felt like some propaganda movie.<br/><br/>What a load of tripe, it made me sick to my stomach to watch.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the action sequences were on par with previous spider-man movies. And Bruce Campbell stole the show with his performance."

","Okay honestly here, let's look at what Spiderman is. for all of you that were put off by the silliness of certain scenes, what's the big deal? To be honest I found those scenes to be unexpected and refreshing. But all wonderful air humping aside. This movie is a true Achievement for Sam Raimi. Not only did it tie up the trilogy it was good ol' fun. Harry's new board is very cool, Venom looked amazing and Sandman was well sandy. I do have to say the particle effects used in this movie are nothing short of amazing the first time you see Sand forming into a man it's quite stunning. The action was very fast paced and fun and well split up just when things were getting a bit drab a fight scene would boost your adrenaline to keep ya going. I love how Sam Raimi completely destroys what we commonly refer to as ""Emo"" he presents it in a common way and completely flips it on us. This movie makes me want to get some bangs above my right eye. All in all this is definitely a fitting end to the franchise. This movie is without a doubt the best of the three even with it's so called ""faults"". P.S. *Spoiler* Spiderman says ""Shazam"" how amazing is that."
"azjazz","1","23","37","6 July 2007"," A shame ... (may contain spoilers)
","My opinions: Spider-man 1 was flawed, but still decent. It had a number of rough spots where the acting was shallow, the script was weak, and the special effects were too cartoonish. However, the plot-line held together, and the movie was a fun ride.<br/><br/>Spider-man 2 surpassed the original in many ways - The characters were better defined, the humor flowed well, the pacing was good, and the acting was better overall. In addition, the special effects were more believable without being overdone. Marvel & Raimi learned from the first movie, and came up with an excellent sequel.<br/><br/>Now, on to Spider-man 3 ...<br/><br/>An odd thought crept into my mind about 20 minutes into the movie. Usually, I'm so engrossed in a movie, I just enjoy the ride and don't try too think hard about the quality of the production until after the movie is over.<br/><br/>During the first of many slow points, the thought that hit me was: ""Don't worry ... It will get better."" Sadly, I was mistaken.<br/><br/>Where the second Spider-man movie built upon the first, the third in the series was unfocused and added nothing to the other two.<br/><br/>The acting was arguably the worst of the three. This time, I can't even blame it on the actors being fed a bad script. The scenes that were supposed to be dramatic or romantic turned out to contain some of the funniest parts of the movie. The scenes that were intended to be humorous ended up being stupid or embarrassing, and not a single person laughed in the theater.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was poor - though not as bad as some other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>Again (as usual), Marvel attempted to bring too many characters & plot lines into a single movie. Let's see ... what plot lines did we get in this movie? Harry Osborn. The Green Goblin. The Sandman. Gwen Stacy. Uncle Ben. Eddie Brock. The symbiote. And, of course, personal issues with Mary Jane.<br/><br/>One thing that I thought that Marvel finally learned in the second Spider-man movie was to keep the plot lines simple and characters to a minimum. In that movie, it was basically just Doc Ock and some token appearances by Harry Osborn. (And, of course, personal issues with Mary Jane.) One major plot line with the rest of the subplots neatly weaving in.<br/><br/>Whatever Marvel learned in the second movie in this regard was forgotten by Spider-Man 3. Almost all of the plots mentioned were struggling to be the main plot line. Instead of weaving together, they tended to stand alone.<br/><br/>Regarding the special effects, they were obviously where the money went in this production. Spider-man 3 reportedly cost a quarter of a billion dollars to produce. That money brought forth a lot of flashy special effects that were way too congested during the fight scenes to be able to really appreciate what was going on. I can't imagine what they would look like on a small TV screen when they were so hard to follow on the big screen. The fight scenes had so much high-speed dodging of chunks of concrete/building parts/glass/etc, that the scenes lost credibility due to the special effects. I've always felt that special effects should add believability to a scene, and not draw attention to the fact that special effects are even being used. Spider-man 3 failed in this regard.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best special effects were when the Sandman was the sole character on the screen. Those scenes were very believable.<br/><br/>Probably the most telling feature about the final quality of Spider-Man 3 was not what occurred on the screen, however. It was what occurred in the theater: People were walking out in the middle of the movie, and not returning. I would estimate that about 20% of the audience had left prior to the end of the show. There were many points during the movie that I was tempted to leave as well.<br/><br/>But, I kept thinking: ""Don't worry ... It will get better."" <br/><br/>'Nuff said."
"My_Name_Is_Dan","9","24","39","5 May 2007"," Best one yet (Mild mild spoilers, wont ruin movie for you)
","Spiderman 3 was definitely the best one in the trilogy. The special effects were awesome, the fight scenes were unbelievable, and the story line was well written. I think people are forgetting that Spiderman was originally a comic book, intended for Teenagers/Yougn 20's to read. Now it takes a lot of skill to change that from a series of comics to a family movie, with suspense, comedy, action and baddies that everyone loves to hate. I personally gave Spiderman a 9/10, but, the guy in the cinema next to me said he was never a Spiderman fan and he thought this was one of the best movies he'd ever seen. MILD SPOILERS AHEAD: I think one of the only flaws in the movie was the ending. Now, Sam Raimi (director) has said that he is going to make a 4th, 5th and 6th sequel, and in my opinion, that is a BIG mistake. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Spiderman series and would DIE to see another film, but the ending of Spiderman 3 wraps things up nicely, and basically finishes the story of Spiderman. If they knew they would make a 4th, 5th and 6th, they should have ended the 3rd with a twist, so we would know there would be a Spiderman 4. But other than that, GREAT movie, 10/10, not just 1 Villain but THREE!!, and nice story, with a few laughs and cries in between."

","As I was in line to buy tickets to this movie, at least a dozen people that walked by out of the Spiderman that had just ended were warning the people in line ""Don't go see Spiderman"". I should have listened. It's like they tried to fit 3 different movies with 3 different story lines into this one. I mainly went to this movie because of Venom, and was incredibly let down/disappointed/depressed to see A) Venom was played by Eric Foreman, an incredibly sad miscast, and B) Venom wasn't introduced until the last 25-30 minutes of the movie. The ""evil"" Peter Parker was a joke. Apparently, hitting on girls, playing the piano, and looking like a member of Good Charlotte is really evil these days. And the Sandman? Let's see, he killed Peter's uncle, tries to kill Peter throughout the whole movie, and in the end, after all their battles, I almost expected them to embrace in the sunrise as Sandman begged for forgiveness and Spiderman said ""I forgive you"", each with tears in their eyes. And Harry? He's been mad at Spiderman for killing his father for 3 movies now. Enough. He should have been killed off from that grenade (which was probably the coolest, and only evil thing the ""evil"" Spiderman did) so we can finally move on to new rivalries. Not to mention the fact that a grenade was strong enough to completely destroy the Venom monster and Eddie Brock, yet the one that blew up practically in Harry's eye socket only caused a few scratches.<br/><br/>This movie was too long, too dull, and incredibly weak. They should have picked one rival out of Sandman or Venom, and made a nice well developed 90-120 minute movie. This movie did not deserve to have made half the money that it did."
"dee.reid","10","26","43","4 May 2007"," ""Spider-Man 3"" - You wanna talk about a ""tangled web""?
","Director Sam Raimi returns for a third time to direct another ""Spider-Man"" movie, ""Spider-Man 3,"" which promises to not only be an excellent summer movie, but a spectacular closer to a marvelous superhero saga. Darker than its predecessors, it asks the question that has plagued us for three years now: How will ""Spider-Man 3"" condense so many Marvel Comics' story lines and sub-plots into a 140-minute feature-length running time?<br/><br/>I had my own reservations about such notions when it was first announced that Spider-Man would be facing not one, not two, but THREE super-villains, each with long, drawn-out back-stories (and many comic book issues) of their own. As a lifelong fan of Spidey, the creation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics, I was glad to hear that my favorite character (aside from Spider-Man himself) would be making a big-screen appearance now. After viewing the movie, another character becomes a favorite (more on this later).<br/><br/>The ""Spider-Man"" title is well-known in the comics industry for being one of the best examples of a superhero whose problems outside of saving the world were given times and places in print to be properly fleshed out. Peter Parker (played superbly in the movies by Tobey Maguire, who's unsure if he'll return for part IV, if one ever manifests itself) was a geek, a loner, in grade and financial trouble, and had romantic woes; a bite from a genetically altered spider only compounded his problems. So this is why so many average Joes, like me, could relate to Spider-Man so easily. Although DC Comics had Batman and Superman, who both had great story lines, adventures and romantic entanglements of their own, it was Spidey's persistent personal problems that won over readers. The first two movies have addressed these perfectly.<br/><br/>In ""Spider-Man 3,"" things seem to be looking up for our hero, both as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, though they won't be that way for long. It seems he's finally gotten his life together and everything is going his way: Spider-Man has saved New York City from certain danger so many times he's finally getting the respect he so richly deserves (including the Key to the City). At school, he's at the top of his class, and he's about to pop the question to girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>However, he is still haunted by his inability to patch up his friendship with best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spider-Man and Peter for his father Norman Osborn's/Green Goblin's (played in the first film by Willem Dafoe, who also shows up here posthumously) death, although much is still unknown to the son, who eventually transforms himself into the notorious Green Goblin II, the first villain. And even though Mary Jane is a great Broadway actress and Peter tries to reassure her of that fact, she earns terrible reviews for her performance and is painfully distressed by the news. But because Peter is letting his newfound fame go to his head, it's difficult for her to express her real feelings to him.<br/><br/>The meat of the story gets underway when a mysterious black ooze bonds with Peter, and the alien symbiote brings about a darker side of his personality that threatens to destroy him. Once in the new ""black suit,"" he comes to add revenge to his list of to-do items when he discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was involved in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, in flashback). Marko, on the other hand, while fleeing the cops, falls into an experimental vat and has his molecules zapped away, later reconstituting himself with the sand to become the Sandman. The Sandman becomes villain #2.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), wants Peter's job of peddling photographs of Spider-Man to editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). Brock is also dating Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who may or may not be flirting with Peter. Needless to say, when the two share a kiss and Mary Jane sees it, she doesn't take it lightly. The Black Suit continues an assault on Peter, who becomes increasingly hostile and once realizing what it's done to him, separates from it, the symbiote later bonding with a vengeful Eddie Brock to become Venom, villain #3. Can Peter Parker/Spider-Man overcome Green Goblin II, The Sandman and Venom (favorite), his inner demons, and get back Mary Jane and save the world within the allotted 140 minutes?<br/><br/>Co-screenwriter Raimi returns to his love-labor project triumphant. While some things could have been better fleshed out, the 140-minute running time was really pushing it in terms of story. Still, he and brother Ivan's screenplay manages to play itself out reasonably, although I still believe much was left on the cutting room floor. It's also obvious Raimi's taken cues from the ""Superman"" movies on how to craft an epic story. It is true that ""Spider-Man 3"" seems to do a lot, but you have to give Raimi credit for doing what he was able to do, combing the pages of Marvel Comics and combining basically 40 years worth of storyline into 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>While I doubt Tobey Maguire will probably return for another sequel, this is undoubtedly the actor's finest performance. It's amazing how well he was able to balance the tangled emotions of his tormented character. Although he has to be the least expressive good actor out there, I really liked him here, especially in his ""darker"" scenes. The other actors were good, including the great Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and especially Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman, who, like Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) from ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), earns our hearts as a sympathetic villain.<br/><br/>For this fan, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a bit of a mixed triumph, but it's a valiant effort from actors and filmmakers that know the heart of their material well.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dj_wang","10","19","30","5 May 2007"," I Forgive You
","I am a Spider-Man fan.<br/><br/>I remember as a kid while at the grocery store, reading the comic where Spider-Man, wearing his black suit, was buried alive by Kraven. I've been following Spidey since then.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 completely satisfied me. The movie surpassed my expectations. Surpassed and then exceeded and then went above and beyond.<br/><br/>-----------------------<br/><br/>Who is Spider-Man?<br/><br/>He is a hero, but he is not just any hero. He's special.<br/><br/>He's not the strongest. He's not the fastest.<br/><br/>What he is, is the most deeply feeling of all heroes. Spider-Man's feelings run deep. They run throughout his whole self. Spider-Man draws his greatest power from his feelings.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 did Spider-Man justice. He was the deeply feeling hero I have always known him to be.<br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/>I cried. I went to eat out after the movie and people looked at me, at my red stained eyes. I wore my sunglasses because it was a beautiful afternoon and I was glad for the excuse to keep the shades on. I didn't want to show my pain. I didn't want people to see my weakness.<br/><br/>But I know Peter would have understood. Peter, and Harry, and Mary Jane, and Aunt May, and Flint Marko (aka Sandman), and Uncle Ben<br/><br/>and I know Tobey Maguire would have understood, Tobey, and James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church, and Cliff Robertson <br/><br/>and I know Sam Raimi would have understood, and his brother Ted, and Bruce Campbell, and Lucy Lawless (Xena), and lots of the people who were involved in this movie.<br/><br/>I know they would understand why I was weeping. I know they would understand why I tried to choke back the tears. I know they would understand why I don't want to show my feelings and I know they would understand how much I need to.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>Emo. It's short for ""Emotional"".<br/><br/>Peter goes Emo in the movie. It's a look. Dark circles under the eyes. Hair slicked and combed over the forehead. Dark clothing. It's also called 'goth'.<br/><br/>It was really delightful to see. Peter looked so cool. He's a really good dancer. I was happy for him.<br/><br/>I have darkness inside of me too. ""Without contrast you cannot see. Without darkness there is no light."" It's OK to have it.<br/><br/>I was happy to see Peter 'strut'. Strutting looks like a nice feeling. You're confident. You can look at pretty girls without feeling ashamed of your appearance. You can dance in the street without feeling embarrassed, you dance just because you feel good. You can sway your hips and not feel like you're gay, because you're not, you're just : feeling good.<br/><br/>Feeling powerful : feels good.<br/><br/>What's wrong with that? Nothing, but Peter feels deeply, and he finds that when your only feeling is power you hurt those who aren't as powerful as you.<br/><br/>And that's something that Peter, that Spider-Man, can't do, won't do.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>Harry is a handsome guy.<br/><br/>Peter destroys his handsomeness. Peter directly disfigures Harry.<br/><br/>I know what it's like to feel ugly. If Harry wanted to kill Peter before, it's only natural he would want to tenfold after Peter ruins him.<br/><br/>Harry loves Mary Jane. What hope does he have of her loving him back when half his face is one twisted piece of flesh? She would be repulsed.<br/><br/>and yet, Harry forgives Peter. Harry finds feelings other than anger and hatred inside of him.<br/><br/>How? In the feelings of someone else. Just a few words from his faithful butler Bernard the most important ones being, ""I loved your father just as I love you.""<br/><br/>As Harry said near the beginning of the film about Peter and Mary Jane, ""My best friends - I'd give my life for them.""<br/><br/>I can't think of a better reason to die. For people who you give your life for. For people who weep when you die. I wish for my death to be like that.<br/><br/>""All we really want from life is to be remembered with love when we're dead.""<br/><br/>-----------------------<br/><br/>MOVIES ARE MODERN DAY BIBLES. <br/><br/>This movie says to the audience, ""Thou shalt not condemn thyself to eternal guilt and self-loathing. Thou shalt forgive thyself and in forgiving thyself forgive others.""<br/><br/>Spider-Man never takes life. He defends life. Innocent lives. Loved ones lives. even the lives of his enemies, all at the omnipresent potential loss of his own. He loves life and the life he sees in others and protects it with his own.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>As Emo Peter says to Eddie after Eddie publicly humiliates Spider-Man with his faked black costumed Spider-Man photo, ""You want forgiveness? Get religion.""<br/><br/>Peter mocks then, but later on he understands forgiveness. He understands something teaching him how to forgive, or more appropriately : someone.<br/><br/>I have always wanted forgiveness too. I have always got Spider-Man.<br/><br/>-----------------------------<br/><br/>P.S : The $250 million extra for special effects was worth every penny. The SFX were jaw dropping.<br/><br/>P.P.S : The incorporation of Venom was excellent. The Goblins and Doc Ock are classic villains from the 60's comics, while Venom is 90's. Venom adds that climatic punch to the movie at its peak, while the classic baddies gave the first two films and the majority of the third its staying power.<br/><br/>P.P.P.S : Sam Raimi did what Spidey does. He searched his feelings and found a manifestation of the Spider-Man legend that resonated and echoed with me and my own vision of Spider-Man : the everyday hero; the marvel universe's most powerful ""feeling-hero""; your, the people's, everyone's, friendly neighberhood Spider-Man! thanks Sam."

"areebkhan619","10","14","21","15 December 2014"," All I can see is people choking their opinions down the throats of people who loved it
","First things first, about the emo Parker. I thought that was good. The movie needed some laughs, and he was there to give it. You wanna talk about bad Peter portrayal? Go watch the Amazing Spider-Man series, and enjoy as the so-called ""Peter"" does a flip on his skateboard and write ""I love you"" with his webs on bridge (Ha-ha-ha!). Sam Raimi didn't want to include Venom in this movie, but was forced to. All the fans complain about is that he didn't get enough screen time. Touche to that, truly. BUT, even the little screen time given to him was enough for us to see what he did in a very little time, and we wanted him dead. Now, for the best parts, tell me, didn't you guys like the Sandman part? The bad-ass villain was everything I wanted in this movie, and more. AGAIN, WANT TO SEE A BAD EXAMPLE OF TOO MANY VILLAINS IN ONE MOVIE? WATCH THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2! This movie didn't leave anything half-assed at least. The movie has grossed much more than any of the later Spider-Man movies (or should I even call them that) earned, and the only thing I was disappointed in was that they couldn't get the original series to finish off properly. Long story short, despite what you guys might say, I really loved this movie, and you should really look into the fact that Tobey pulled off the emo part well too."
"dav00zak","1","28","47","7 May 2007"," What the f...
","To start off i have to say that i did love the first two movies of the trilogy. This is partly why i am feeling forced to write a comment here (my first one). As many others have already pointed out this movie stinks.<br/><br/>But WHY? some of you may wonder, well there are many many MANY reasons why. I will now name a few.<br/><br/>1. This movie completely undo the first one by destroying the moment that made spider-man what he is (read WAS).<br/><br/>2. I have seen many very bad movies with ever worse dialog, but this one takes the price, lines like ""I guess ONE man can make..."" and ""Oh the brutality.."" could be better delivered by a stoned Schwarzenegger BEFORE he knew any English at all.<br/><br/>3. I felt embarrassed when watching the Jazz club scene, nuff said about that.<br/><br/>4. My summary of the review is to enlight my feelings when spider-man lands in front of a smeggin big American flag, i mean come on, WHAT THE F... IS THIS.<br/><br/>5. Who did say OK to put Topher Grace on the role of Eddie Brock/Venom? I'm going to pray to god on his behalf.<br/><br/>6. As many before me has stated Mary-Jane not only looks like one but is a anorectic whiny ho in this movie. She was a bit irritating in the previous ones, but not nearly as much as in this.<br/><br/>The only reason i did not give this movie a 1 star rating is the scene when sandman is born."
"kcfan1-2","10","31","53","5 May 2007"," Thrill Ride
","Spiderman 3 was a triumph of the cinema. I thought the movie was a thrill ride from start to finish. Something was always going on Green Goblin, Sandman, and Venom all figuring into the mix. The relationship between Peter and Harry was torturous to watch kind of like a car wreck. The ending was a testament to friendship and the trials of life. The casting was exceptional. Adding Bryce Dallas Howard, Thomas Church, and Topher Grace created an all star atmosphere. Every scene was a delight to see truly talented professional actors/actresses at their best. I would implore anyone who likes action movies to not miss this one.."
"matt_rattenbury","2","110","213","2 May 2007"," A Shocking sequel
","This film was set to be the best spider-man film of the lot, it had a budget of almost $250 million and i really would like to know where all that money went to!! I don't know if they even bothered to write a script or just play it by ear, and what the hell was the two minute dance scene in the film all about? This is the worst type of sequel it takes the success of two brilliant films in my opinion and throws in over the top special effects, some of which do look amazing, to create a film which fails to live up to the hype which it has been receiving. I sat with 10 other members of staff in the local cinema i work in and not one of us left the screen thinking what a great way to spend almost three hours of our lives. In my opinion the only redeeming quality of the film is Harry Osbourne he is the only believable character and when he joins Peter to fight at the end! Overall being a huge film fan, and loving the previous two spidy films i just cant believe that this was made to be the best yet! I hope others will agree with me and not follow, like sheep along with all the hype that it has received!"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","4","92","176","5 May 2007"," Action packed and entertaining...but still has problems
","Spider-Man 3 has been the most anticipated film of the last 3 years without a doubt. Unfortunately, it is one of those 'hate it or love it' movies. The story is very complex, but the incredible visuals (including all the actors being very good looking) make up for it...a little bit. All in all, Spider-Man 3 might disappoint some, but there are those who will have a great time. Don't go in with high expectations...just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) appears to have finally found balance in his life. He is in love with the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and all of New York loves his alter ego, Spider-Man. Despite this beautiful scenario, trouble lurks ahead. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the man actually responsible for Uncle Ben's death, has escaped from prison and genetically combined with sand particles, and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is plotting his revenge against Peter/Spidey for the murder of his father. To make matters worse, Peter and MJ's relationship is threatened by other people (including Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy), and there is a competing photographer at the Daily Bugle named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a young man with a venomous future ahead of him because of an alien symbiote that has landed on Earth, eventually taking over Peter's suit and changing him as a person...confusing, ain't it?<br/><br/>As always, Spider-Man 3 is very well casted. I'll start off with our returning 3 stars, Maguire, Dunst, and Franco. Maguire needed to show even more acting muscle this time around, as Peter changes drastically throughout the movie. He pulls it off well, and some scenes are so different from the Peter we know to the point of extreme laughter. Aside from that, Maguire captures the often changing personality of Peter with ease, and gives a great performance. Kirsten Dunst gives her best performance as MJ, but she still isn't really that likable, which is a shame because MJ is supposed to be a character the audience loves just like Spider-Man. She has her moments, however. James Franco is extremely likable in the film, even though he is a villainous character. You'll identify more with Harry than you will with Peter, and I'm not the only one who liked him more than Peter. Franco's performance is layered and unpredictable (except the end), very similar to Willem Dafoe in Spider-Man 1. Thomas Haden Church is also likable, and he hopes people like him because he must've worked out for a century to transform from a scrawny middle aged man to a very cut and muscular man. He transforms into the Sandman, a villain that isn't really popular, but his inclusion really allows for some phenomenal effects that will blow you away. I'm sure filming that part was a pain. My favorite performance of the film was Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, and eventually Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, Venom. Grace is sickeningly sarcastic in the character, and when he does become Venom, will be scary. He gets some of the best lines in the whole film. Grace nailed the role when so many people doubted him, and I'm really happy with the way he played Venom. Definitely one of the most unforgettable bad guys of recent memory. Bryce Dallas Howard is also likable in limited screen time (maybe it's because she's absolutely beautiful). Dylan Baker has a slightly increased role as Dr. Connors, and his involvement in this film (you'll get this next statement when you see the movie) leaves a small window of chance for another Spider-Man movie, because of the material that he keeps.<br/><br/>The visuals are breathtaking, especially the climactic fight sequence, which incorporates almost all the main characters. The two main villains of the film are computer generated, and that is incredible because they really don't look like it. Venom especially. The detail added to each scene is remarkable. It's amazing what a flip or web shoot every now and then will do to improve your action sequences. The action is by far the strongest point of the film. The weakest is the writing. The brothers Raimi crammed way too much into this film. 3 villains plus all the inner turmoil Peter suffers is too much to keep track of in one 2 and a half hour film. That is another fault. The movie is way too long. It focuses too much on Peter and not Spider-Man, making it have moments where it'll seem like a chick flick because of all the relationship drama. Sam Raimi forgot to make a movie about a superhero. Instead we've got a movie about a guy who happens to be a superhero. I enjoyed all the acting and action, but the story was way too rushed and should have been spread over two movies. While Thomas Haden Church was good, the movie could have been made without the entire Sandman storyline. They could have left the Uncle Ben subplot alone, and given all that time (Sandman has by far the most screen time of any of the baddies) to the wonderful Topher Grace and Venom. It was really disappointing to see Venom go to waste like that. Because this route was taken, the stories behind Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brock are chopped and sadly nonexistent. Brock was turned from one of the most developed, dark, and three dimensional characters into a two dimensional sadistic crazy man with little motive, and the writers should be ashamed. That's Carnage, not Venom. Venom has very little screen time, and in my mind should have had his own movie to fight Spider-Man...after all, he is Spider-Man's worst enemy.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is a good film. It's definitely up there with the better comic movies, but it didn't reach my expectations. Due to some strong violence and the scary Venom, Spider-Man 3 probably isn't appropriate for kids 11 and under.<br/><br/>7/10 --spy"
"Spider567","10","38","67","5 May 2007"," A Great Movie
","This was, by far, the best Spider-Man movie of the three. It had the greatest story of all three, which is very complex so some people might confuse it with being 'all over the place'. The acting was great, and Tobey's change in character, from good to evil, was interesting. The one thing I was disappointed in was the change in music conductors. It had a StarWars feel to it at some points. Other than that, the many characters had a real reason for their actions that made sense, the acting was great, some dialogue was very close to the comic's, and it had great action scenes with romance and touching moments. It is a must for any fan of Spider-man or someone looking for a great movie."
"gbryan91","10","16","25","15 May 2007"," Spider-man 3 is better than what people expect!
","I would first like to say that almost all the reviews I read were saying that Spidey 3 was a waste and not anywhere as close to the first two movies. I went and saw the movie and realized one thing. I can't trust anything anyone says until I go see the movie for myself. Spidey 3 does not only satisfy with breathtaking effects. The storyline goes along quite well although more Venom would of been nice. There is something to be said about a trilogy that makes you laugh, cry, and entertain with the best special effects. This is no X-men 3 or Matrix Revolutions. This is better than anything I have ever seen before in my life. I would encourage you to see this movie regardless of the Critics."

Bad acting, bad story, bad characterisation, bad baddies, bad goodies, bad singing, bad dancing. Only redeeming quality was killing off Harry and his incredibly bad character so that in the event of number 4 he won't have any screen time to decide what kind of character he should be.<br/><br/>A real shame as this movie had such potential. They could have focused more on venom, or they could have focused on the sand dude, unfortunately they did neither which resulted in a film that didn't know where it was going except down the plug.<br/><br/>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM"

Now I know why all of the cast and crew are bailing out like rats on a sinking ship. It was quite possibly the worst movie since ""New World"". Bruce Campbell's part is great, I'll give them that and some of the unintended comedy is worth a giggle here or there but that's in.<br/><br/>Special Effects?? wow, those were horrible, I saw objects moving through people, not just random background people but ones right in the foreground. There was no attention to detail.<br/><br/>Fight Scenes?? I've seen other's comments on this and would have to agree. They're uncoordinated and too short to be likable. Where did Venom go for like 5 (movie) minutes during the major fight scene? Was it just me or was the final battle a massive anti-climax? Was anyone else half expecting by that point for Parker to propose to MJ right there over Harry's dead body? Venom?? This is a major reason many people were all amped for this movie. Hey, I wanted to see it too. Unfortunately, they redefined Vemon as a pansy. Fortunatly, he only gets about a minute or two of screen time so. . . yea, way to hype that one Sony.<br/><br/>At the showing I was at, remember this is the first available public show one could POSSIBLY see in San Francisco so it was filled with only those who REALLY wanted to go, and people were booing and heckling.

"madpad","1","28","48","5 May 2007"," Awful, disgusting. Personally I felt violated
","Without a shadow of a doubt the worst film made from a comic book, EVER and I'm including Supergirl.<br/><br/>If they had said at the beginning: Not so much based on characters created by, but more so loosely based you might imagine we spelt Parker with a Z, then they might have got away with calling this film Spiderman.<br/><br/>It was gut wrenchingly painful to watch, the story didn't so much arc as fall over and die, cough a little, stand up and then fall again. Massive plot gaps, massive story gaps, so much left unexplained and not easy to resolve with imagination even if you were a fan of the comic books.<br/><br/>Like how did Parker explain Harry's injuries and if not state of the art body armour complete lack of clothing? Why did he carry him from the alleged car accident rather than call the emergency services, you cant exactly perform CPR on the hoof? What tests did Dr Connors perform on the symbiote sample that was left behind, oh and by the way why didn't it die? But that aside why didn't he tell Peter it was sensitive to sonic waves, that would surely be somewhere in the tests for a biological organism, ultra-sounds are not exactly uncommon.<br/><br/>On purely plot related things if Spiderman was so loved by the city (which by the way he isn't in the comic books, criminal, vigilante all sorts of other nice names) why didn't he just admit who he was, at least then he could move out of his rat trap apartment.<br/><br/>Why in a film costing in excess of $100million dollars couldn't they let Kirsten Dunst sing her own songs, or if she did at least dub them into the film in something resembling a professional way.<br/><br/>I could go on, but Why Sam Raimi allowed his name to be near this I don't know, how Stan Lee could appear in it I don't know (although that scene was even more wooden than usual). All I can say is to allow the studios to do this sort of damage to an icon like spiderman, both of them must have seriously fleshed out their wallets which really makes them worse"
"Carlos_the_Mackerel","1","17","27","9 May 2007"," Egad, could a film truly be this terrible?
","To put it in context- it's easily the worst film I've seen this year, and I'm usually happy to watch dross.<br/><br/>I struggle to pick out a single positive aspect of the movie. In almost every aspect it was overstated, leaving the audience no room/need/desire (delete as appropriate) to interpret/appreciate situations for themselves. When a director has to cut to a (bad) English accent yelling ""I don't know how much more of this he can take"" to tell you that the protagonist's taking a spanking you really have to question the quality of a production.<br/><br/>Sure, a lot of money has been spent on special effects, but they fail to serve as more than eye candy... I didn't feel drawn into the action scenes at any point. The only genuine reaction the film pushed out of me was a slight jump when the goblin grabbed MJ.<br/><br/>There was plenty of plot I suppose, but none of it convincing or engaging- the characters were entirely selfish and unlikeable (not necessarily a bad thing in a movie, but hardly appropriate for a light superhero film) and deviated so wildly from their templates that I simply didn't see the link to their comic book namesakes by the end. Venom's potential as a foe was utterly wasted, not because of a villain overload- 3 bad chaps is perfectly doable- but because it was barely addressed as a character or an idea. The only information we received as the Symbiote were a couple of statements Parker's teacher plucks from thin air.<br/><br/>Instead of exploring the themes of Spiderman and his opponents, or even just giving fun action, we were given two and a half hours of Peter Parker acting like a turd. Even that was over-baked. I cringed, I despaired, I regretted the fact that I've already signed down to see it on a staff social tomorrow as well.<br/><br/>Truly lamentable."

","By now you've all probably heard the rumors about the quality of Sam Raimi's latest addition to the pantheon of big-screen adaptations for comic book classics (aka Spider-Man 3). If not, let me give it to you straight and simple: they are all true.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is the best film of the Spider-Man trilogy to date. In fact, it's bigger and better than its predecessors on so many levels; I don't even know where to begin. It's in this third installment of the series that the director allows the now matured and established characters to fully realize themselves. By doing so, Spider-Man 3 becomes a plot-driven piece of film, alongside being your lovable big-budget summer uber-buster as well. It is this cinematic achievement that'll make future audiences admire this film long after its initial box-office impact will worn off. And trust me; this will be an enormous hit from a mile if I've ever seen one (note that this review is typed on Thursday, April 26th, 8 days before Spider-Man 3's US premier, after I had the pleasure of attending a special press screening in Ramat-Gan, Israel).<br/><br/>The thing is, I've never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man. The second one was much better, in my opinion, but only after seeing it I realized how much the original was required in order to establish the three main characters - Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), Mare Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco). This time around, this impossible love triangle finally dukes it out, as other character building devices, such as Osborn's oath to avenge his father's death, Parker's long yearning for MJ and his deterrence in finding anyone linked to his Uncle's death in part 1 - all reach a staggering crescendo, with some extremely dramatic consequences. On top of this all, Parker also has two brand new enemies to fight off - one of them being the alien form commonly referred to as Venom (Topher Grace in a nice change of style from his usual shenanigans) and the other being a small time escape con who by chance enters a scientific facility and is transformed into the Sandman (the always wonderful Thomas Hayden Church).<br/><br/>At the end, it all comes down to a battle between good and evil, with messages of redemption and remorse playing a crucial role in the way the plot unfolds. The digital effects are at the top of their game as well, and entertain at the purest level of awesomeness (sorry, couldn't find a more subtle word). At some point, I remember telling my girlfriend what a great time I'm having - something I don't remember saying at the theater for some time now. Also, I am very glad the writers tried to close as much arcs as they could, making the trilogy as a whole smarter and more satisfying.<br/><br/>As expected, Spidey 3 is not without its flaws, with many dialogs being somewhat cheesy and mostly clichéd (although it is a comic book adaptation, so don't expect Shakespeare), and a lot of the religious/patriotic themes were a little too much to bear. However, this all doesn't really matter that much when you're watching a film like Spider-Man 3. The main idea here is to sit back and enjoy, and hope Summer 2007 can maintain this level of quality throughout its upcoming blockbusters."

","i just watched this film in its London premier and I don't know where to start! spiderman 3 is just a absolutely brilliant film, and Sam Raimi did an excellent job with both the film, and the actors.the fight scenes are just too good, the CGI is super, and the story is very well done. Venom is a must see and his fight against spidey is awesome. sandman is excellent as well, anharry is excellent as the vengeful new goblin.<br/><br/>This film, for me, with out watching pirates of the caribbean 3 and shrek 3, is the best out of all he others!!<br/><br/>watch it when it comes out folks!"

","This was very, very disappointing. I am a Marvel zombie and unashamed nerd, so whilst in some ways I am the hardest to please when it comes to comic book adaptations, at the same time I am always eager to enjoy, and am also enough of a cinephile to accept that changes need to be made when adapting material for a different medium. What I am trying to say is that I was disappointed in a balanced way, and I'm not about to start whining about Sandman shooting Ben Parker.<br/><br/>OK, so, what was wrong? Things that could have been shown quickly were endlessly belaboured (did Kirsten Dunst get contractual screen-time?), things that deserved screen-time were rushed over (Topher Grace and Bryce Howard should get Dunst's agent!) and things that were utterly pointless (Sandman) were shoved into an already unwieldy plot. Whilst no one person was always guilty, much of the acting was very hammy, and the whole film was uneven. The biggest disappointment was that the dark Spidey storyline was interesting and the love triangle had potential, but it was all too much stuffed into too little.<br/><br/>However, yes, Bruce Campbell's performance was amazing!"
"moviemanMA","4","123","246","4 May 2007"," Recipe for Disaster
","A recipe is a step-by-step process that if followed correctly will produce a satisfying outcome. When all the elements are added properly and put together and made in the right order, you cannot go wrong. However, sometimes, measurements can be misread, ingredients forgotten, and foreign substances making their way in. This produces an unwanted product. The third installment to the Spider-Man saga is a perfect example for a misread recipe.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is one of the biggest let downs that cinema has seen. The first two films had everything done correctly. The script, the characters, the storyline, the director, and all of the little odds and ends that came together somehow did not appear in the third film. Everything that could have gone wrong did.<br/><br/>To place this film in the comic book genre would only fit for the characters and the creators. The film isn't action or suspense, but romance. The wonder and awe of watching Spidey fly through the air was non-existent and for the scenes that did have action, it was all repetition. Punch, kick, web, thrown person into a steel girder or metal pole over and over again. There was nothing that stood out in this film like the previous films had.<br/><br/>The story goes that Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) wants to marry Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but Spider-Man's popularity is getting in the way of his relationship with MJ. His best friend from high school turned mortal enemy Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still trying to find a way to kill Spidey, but a certain turn of events will make things difficult.<br/><br/>New photographer Eddie Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) wants to beat out Peter for a new job at the Daily Bugle while Brock's girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) becomes entangled in Spidey's web and also with her schoolmate Peter. To top off the list of new editions is Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who escapes from prison after being charged with the murder of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle who was killed in the first film. While on the lamb, Marko stumbles into a scientific testing facility where he is accidentally mutated into a superhuman comprised of sand.<br/><br/>Making matters worse, an alien sludge attaches itself to Peter and transforms him into a meaner, more aggressive Spidey and Peter as well. Whatever the substance comes in contact with, it is hard to remove it.<br/><br/>All of the ingredients are ready to mix and transform. One thing is in the way; the script. Director Sam Raimi has done a magnificent job directing the first two installments, but decides to take a stab at writing the screenplay. This is where our creation starts to deteriorate. Poorly assembled dialogue and awkward scenes make it hard to watch the film without laughing or just shaking your head in embarrassment.<br/><br/>The story is another malfunction of the film. There is too much cheesy and cliché romance and not enough Spider-Man. I never thought it was possible to turn a comic book movie into a ""chick flick"". Every characters cries at one point or another and I mean every character. There is also a segment that is wildly hilarious but horribly out of place involving the ""new"" Peter Parker that is charged with energy, dance moves, and one-liners. It is something out of a disco movie!<br/><br/>Why did this happen? When you make chocolate chip cookies you don't replace the vanilla with teriyaki sauce. Follow the recipe, and add things that make sense. <br/><br/>Spider-Man will most likely be one of the highest grossing films of the year. It attracts a wide variety of moviegoers and countless die hard fans. But with the quality of the film and all of the disappointing elements, will this be the end of Spider-Man on the big screen?"
"leopoldfrank","10","37","67","4 May 2007"," Made Me Feel Like A Kid Again
","Just saw it. Was awesome man. Not walked out of movie since I was kid with my mate just grinning and swapping our ""favourite bits"". It was a wicked film. I don't think anyone should take it seriously. It's essentially the best b-movie ever. I think the people making it have a really good sense of fun for the none too serious viewers and those with a sense of irony to bask in. Best action sequences ever, absolutely unbelievable. Never seen anything like it.<br/><br/>I think the films work so much better than a lot of other superhero films because Sam Raimi has made the films appear as though the true story behind the myths of the comic books and has packed the films full of themes which hold it altogether. Also the direction is spot on and all the shots just seem like images from the comic books. The CGI team must be the best in the world too because it really is visual entertainment of the highest degree. See it, switch off your mind and enjoy it."

This film is worth the wait and it completes a nice trilogy should they decide to not make anymore.<br/><br/>For me everyone who is in and involved with this film are the true team of Spiderman and should they decide to go with a new director or spidey then so be it but no one can beat what Sam Raimi and his team have achieved with these three films."

","I've just seen it, and I have to say that it's very entertaining, and it seems to me that although it's very good, it could have been better, but then again so could a lot of other good films. As soon as it came out the comic book nerds started whining about how Sam Raimi did something wrong and whatnot. The truth is that someone will always find something wrong or different from the comics, and it could have been... but it isn't!! So stop whining and enjoy it.<br/><br/>It's very good (gave it 8/10), filled with cgi and fast-paced action, along with a decent script and dialogue. Maybe not as good as the first two, it has weak spots like several plot holes and insufficient character development. Casting was great, with Thomas Haden Church as Sandman and Topher Grace as Venom, along with the original cast. The acting was great, sometimes awkward, a great cameo from Bruce Campbell, and a great job from Raimi. It's what someone should expect from a summer blockbuster, and even more, something to expect from a Spider-Man like movie."
"leave the gun take the cannoli","5","79","156","1 May 2007"," Worst among the 3
","SPOILER ALERT! <br/><br/>I liked the first two, this was bad. It felt like the Fantastic Four movie, a TV movie with cool special effects. There was so much cheese in it. There were some funny moments but so many corny lines in corny scenes. Examples: audience was giggling when Peter and MJ were crying over Harry's death (I felt bad for the actors, I know they could have done better). Another was the scene on stoic kids saying something like ""That was cool...That was awesome."" Seemed like they were acting in an infomercial. Oh come on! What was Raimi thinking? He's turned into Joel Schumacher! Halfway through the movie, I was hoping there would be lots more time left for it to get better. Nope, didn't happen. Story-wise, it didn't really have much depth. The venom storyline was wasted. For a long time, Spidey was the only decent comic-to-movie franchise from Marvel, but the 3rd installment definitely joins FF, Daredevil, Punisher, Elektra. OK, maybe not as bad as Elektra. Didn't see Hulk, people say that was bad too. If it goes on like this, Marvel better slow down with the movies.<br/><br/>My vote, 6/10."

","Ill be honest I'm not the biggest spidey fan in the world, never read the comics and the first two movies didn't blow me away but this...well this is something different entirely. <br/><br/>I was fortunate enough (as I'm management in a big cinema) to see this at its Irish premiere on the 18th and i must say i was finally blown away by a spiderman movie. Firstly it looks spectacular the previous movie looked brilliant as well but no 3 is so so superior. Secondly the acting for the most part was top notch, especially from the ensemble cast not so much Tobey(hes good just not an amazing performance). thirdly and most importantly this movie is Original, it seemed to drop a lot of clichés that re-emerged in the sequel which is brilliant.<br/><br/>So when may 4 rolls around everyone should go see this movie, it is by far the best spidey movie, you'll laugh a lot(This movie was absolutely hilarious in parts, ie Bruce Campbell. i was almost crying with laughter at times), you'll cry(if you're that way inclined) there's just everything in this movie, i was shocked at how much better this sequel was, you will be too."
"Althandir","2","16","26","8 May 2007"," Absolutely dire (some minor spoilers in this review)
","I'm sure my opinion on this film will create minor disturbance among the Spiderman hardcore, however, never before have I felt so compelled to write a review on a film.<br/><br/>I accept that it is very possible my opinion is attracted more towards the negative due to the fairly high standard set by the previous instalments of the Spiderman trilogy but it must be stated that this film is terrible.<br/><br/>I will begin this review with the one positive (though it in turn brings round a negative). As mentioned by other writers, the visual effects are brilliant. They are so good in fact that it pains me to mention them; I think truly brilliant visual effects are achieved when they need not be mentioned because they should blend so brilliantly with the live action that it enables the viewer/reviewer to concentrate on more important aspects (plot, characterisation etc). However, given that the effects are the only positive to draw from an otherwise dire motion picture, I feel it necessary to mention that full credit should be given to the CGI team.<br/><br/>And now, onto the bad. Truly I am stumped as to where to begin so please forgive the lack of logical order in my critique. Firstly, the script and plot are absolutely awful. Lack lustre attempts at making the dialogue seem believable and natural fail miserably and add to an experience that ranges from the cringe worthy to the unwatchable. Seconding this, I beg the question, what on earth has happened to Tobey Maguire's understanding of the role of Peter Parker? Evidentally it has disappeared along with his acting ability because this performance is painful to watch. The same can be said for James Franco; please understand that a wooden plank would probably have achieved a similar result as this almost unwatchable portrayal of Harry Osbourne. This is a cynics debate, but why on earth are these people getting paid so much for being so terrifyingly miserable at their profession??? It seems that too much has been taken on in this film - we have three villains (one of which eventually becomes a good guy) and the stories for each of these protagonists could easily have made enough subject matter for one film each. The decision to blend all these into the same story was ill advised, badly planned, not thought through and executed humiliatingly badly. The greatest character in the Spiderman story save the hero himself is Venom - why then is 15 minutes of this film given to him???? In fact it is for this reason alone that I did not walk out of the auditorium after 45 mins, constantly finding myself under the misguided impression that the addition of Venom would make what was in front of me watchable. It did not.<br/><br/>There are some truly terrible scenes of 'comedy' in this film. I cannot begin to fathom why it seemed a sensible idea to have so many funny scenes in a film dominated by three major bad guys!! True, even in the bleakest films, comic relief is required and that is all well and good...if the comic relief is actually FUNNY and not a pain to watch.<br/><br/>Much of my time in the cinema during this film was spent with my head in my hands. I really cannot stress enough what a terrible disappointment this film is. I almost wish to recommend it just so that people can see and believe how utterly shambolic this is. There are moments watchable material; J K Simmons continues his fantastic understanding of his character and the restaurant scene with Bruce Campbell is brilliant. But otherwise, this is a film that should be avoided at all costs. I have heard rumours of Raimi potentially being responsible for a 'The Hobbit' film - if these turn out to be true I will cry.<br/><br/>Without doubt the worst film I have seen since 'Be Cool'."
"xomegax-1","1","17","28","7 May 2007"," After the greatness of Spiderman , and the even more spectacular Spiderman 2, Spiderman 3 did not meet expectations.
","Spiderman 2 was one of the greatest superhero movies ever. Sam Raimi did an incredible job with it. Everything, from the story to the action, was balanced perfectly. I remember getting up from my seat and giving it a standing ovation along with probably 50 other people. I was happy for Spiderman 2, but even more excited for Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Being excited for Spiderman 3 was a big mistake. I wish I could've gone back in time and smacked myself in the face for ever thinking it was a great movie. Spiderman 3 killed the franchise, and was by far the worst movie in the trilogy. Sam Raimi had so much going for him, he had a villain already set up from the previous Spiderman movie. He had 58 million dollars more to make Spiderman 3 from, compared to the 200 million dollar budget he had in spiderman 2. He had endless material to work from, and he had great actors lined up.<br/><br/>However, even with $258 million dollar budject, Raimi managed to figure out a, no, several ways to mess up this movie. First off, the worst thing in this movie is the writing. The original writers from Spiderman 2 are gone. The writing was horrible, they didn't have much originality in it. There was little character devolopement, all three villains combined didn't have the same emotional depth and personality Doc Ock did. The entire movie felt rushed, and the bad writing just killed it even more.<br/><br/>The movie started off with the usual voice-over. The writing in the beginning was great. After a few good scenes, the first fight began with Spiderman against Green Goblin. After just a few minutes of fighting, it ended. Then it suddenly went to another scene with a guy we don't know. Thats another problem with Spiderman 3. THEY HAVE TOO MUCH GOING ON. In case you don't know, Spiderman 3 has 3 villains. The film shows how their created, but it lacks any character devolopement. Raimi could've executed scenes perfectly, but he sped things up.<br/><br/>By the middle of the movie, it just doesn't feel right. After all the love talk, and the love they built up between Mary Jane and Peter. It all just seems to end for the dumbest reasons. One scene in a restaurant, which has a nice cameo from Bruce Campbell, made this movie look like a bad Romantic Comedy.<br/><br/>After the first hour is over, I felt relieved to see Spiderman in his black suit. I knew this was when the action was really going to kick in. After a minutes of spiderman jumping around in the suit, he goes and fights Sandman. The entire second fight with Sandman is amazing. I loved every second of it. The CGI is great, but then right after Sandman gets beaten bad writing kicks in again, and Spiderman says a very bad, cring-inducing one liner.<br/><br/>So, any Spiderman fan is probably thinking Peter Parker becomes a total badass with the costume on. Maybe, but in depends on how you define badass. Sam Raimi's version of badass is emo. Yep, friendly neighborhood Spiderman becomes emo. His hair becomes darker, he starts wearing black, and every single scene is extremely cheesy.<br/><br/>So after more terrible scenes, he finally gets the black suit off. Topher Grace who becomes Venom, is in a church. Grace did an exceptional job in this movie. He was one of the great parts about Spiderman 3. I absolutely loved his acting. So, Spiderman loses the black suit in a memorable scene. And you see one of the greatest villains, and my personal favorite villain, Venom be born.<br/><br/>After several other cheesy scenes. The final battle occurs, and at this point every line thats said is terrible. My main problem with the final battle is that they kept intrupting it. Raimi's job is to show us the final battle, not have some fake news reporter explain to us what we already know. Both villains are beaten really easily, and what happens after the fight, in my opinion, ruins Spiderman 4. After the events from Spiderman 3, if a Spiderman 4 is ever to come out, it will take a lot to make it work.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 was a disappointing film. The action was hectic, the CGI wasn't that great, and it was like a decent script was an afterthought for Raimi. Unless you like mindless action, don't see this film especially if your a spiderman fan."
"jeff_bennion","5","26","46","6 May 2007"," Haven't Felt So Betrayed by a Sequel Since Star Wars
","I don't usually talk to myself, so when I'm sitting in the movie theater and saying out loud, ""This is freaking lame!"" or ""What?! Move on already,"" it's a pretty good indicator that something is wrong. I really enjoyed the first two and could not wait for the third (and hopefully last) installment. The whole movie had a different feel to it, as if a key member of the production crew had been replaced. Comic book movies are by nature allowed some lee way in the plot, but that is no excuse for bad acting or a poor script. And, I'm sorry, but Tobey Macguire is now officially a bad actor. But, my comment is getting as garbled as the movie, so I'll straighten it out: 1. Acting - Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are both really good actors. They can display multiple emotions convincingly. Tobey Maguire has one look and one emotion - retard. Was anyone really frightened in Spiderman 1 when he was fighting that robber in the beginning and the robber fell out the window? Did Tobey Maguire have the look of fear? No, he looked like a frustrated retard. In this movie, he tries to expand his one look of retard to sad (he cries - horribly) and mean (the black Spiderman/Peter Parker), but they all looked the same. It was like Zoolander. I wanted to just cry out: ""They are all the same look!"" I could deal with the mean Spiderman, but the mean Peter Parker was horrible. I felt like I was watching The Mask with Jim Carrey, right down to the jazz dancing. 2. Crowded plot/too many villains - Spiderman 1 did a really good job of building up the stories behind both Spiderman and Goblin. Spiderman 2 did a really good job of showing the struggle that Peter Parker is going through in his life to be Spiderman and developing Doc Oc. Spiderman 3 tried to fit a sub plot about Peter Parker's life, Mary Jane's life, New Goblin, Sandman's origin and sad story, Bad Spiderman/Peter Parker, and Eddie Brock (who becomes Venom). And on top of that, they add so much unnecessary stuff. And they threw in Gwen Stacy, who was not attractive and just took up too much plot time. It just didn't work out. 3. Bad villains - By bad, I mean horrible. 1) New Goblin - He modified the glider and the mask (the mask is also now mechanically retractable) to make him look like a snowboarder. This is the guy that was almost failing out of high school that did this. 2) Sandman - he goes from about 200 pounds of sand to a 15 FLOOR BUILDING OF SAND at will and he can fly. And the CGI did not look real. I felt it would have looked cooler if they used real sand more instead of cartoon sand. I mean, you already made the most expensive movie in the galaxy (literally), fire some cgi guys and buy some real sand. 3) Venom - I did not buy the cgi on Venom. Why was it that when Spiderman had the suit, he did not get the Venom mouth or the big muscles or the black web? And Venom is afraid of loud noise, yet there are explosions all around him and they don't phase him. It's only when the loud noises are made by Spiderman that they phase him, I guess. Just none of it worked out. 4. Cheese - There was so much potential for a bad Spiderman/Peter Parker. Look at when Superman turned bad in Superman 3(?). That was cool. He went from nerdy do-gooder to bad guy and there was no cheesiness involved. Here, Tobey Maguire/the writers were just not up to the task. You have someone who for two movies has the weight of the world on his shoulders and when he finally blows up and gets mad, what does he do? He goes disco dancing? There was also a scene in the end where Spiderman is standing in front of a huge CGI American flag. It just looked so cheesy. And when Peter takes the venom substance to his professor and the professor looks at it under a microscope and tells him that the material bonds to ""aggression,"" I thought, ""How can you look at aggression under a microscope?"" And they discover an new alien life form and the two of them just study it in the lab and don't tell any one? 5. Camera work - there were some scenes where I couldn't tell what was going on because the cameras were moving too fast - most of the first Goblin/Spiderman chase scene, some scenes with Sandman. It just looked like there was one camera and it kept moving back and forth between characters as if to capture both at the same time. But, that was only the 5th most distracting thing in this film. <br/><br/>Overall, there was just too much going on and too much stuff didn't make sense and just bad all around. I give it a low score because I expected so much more."

","I probably started on the wrong foot because from the title of this comment, you would be led to believe that i liked this movie, just i was led to believe that this was gonna be a good movie. Boy was i wrong. I HATED this movie. Everything was so far from expected it really did blow me away. For starters, the bad acting. Emotion is this movie is scarcer than food in Ethiopia. They could have shown a slideshow of the comics and gotten more emotion, than any of these actors could dish out. The lines were horrible as well. I've seen better lines at an opening to a Steven Segal movie. The montage, which is usually the most redeeming part of any movie, was more out of place than a third nipple. The CGI, which, from a $250 million, should have been great turned out to be worse than any of the last two. I have seen more STD's that are more eye pleasing. The worst part is that it killed the series in front of my eyes. On IMDb, under this movies genres, there are about 60 genres listed. Sad part is, things like drama, crying, singing, dancing, and some more crying, were not listed in this part even though these things took up more time during the movie than all the action sequences put together. Im thankful the movie ended before i got to see anymore of Tobey Maguire trying to cry for the tenth time in a movie. Honestly, i thought i was supposed to have action. Spiderman only get into one or two real fights. ALl of the other scenes of action is him getting his ass kicked over and over. Im sad to say i paid to see this. Hopefully you wont make the same mistake."

","I'm not sure what movie these other reviewers saw, but this was without a doubt the single worst pile of crap I've ever seen. I'm not even sure where to start, how about with the straight theft of Spidey's whole motivation for being Spider-Man. For some reason someone thought that making Sandman Uncle Ben's murderer instead of the guy Parker let go was a good idea, and they didn't even make Sandman a badguy, he's a guy with really bad luck. Aww, poor supervillain :'(. At least the symbiote story was good, a rock randomly falling out of the sky in right next to Spidey while he's not paying attention, real in depth. Now I know a lot of you are thinking ""Well I don't care about the story, I just want action"", I couldn't agree with you more, but the action scenes in this movie are so oversped you can't tell what's going on except for the strategically slowed moment's Spidey's trying to catch a ring out of the air. Nothing about this movie was done right, WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!! P.S. What the hell happened to his Spider-Sense?"
"Mickno","8","87","177","6 May 2007"," Extremely Entertaining
","Spider - Man 3 has many strong points, which include: Good acting, Interesting plot, Incredible CGI, and a hilarious cameo by Bruce Campbell (Or Ash, from the Evil Dead Series)<br/><br/>The plot is about Peter Parker (Spider - Man) who is living the good life. He's happy with all his Spider - Man fans, he's back to getting the highest grades in his class and he's planning to propose to Mary Jane. But then a strange black entity from another world crashes on earth in the form of a meteor. It bonds with Peter Parker and causes him to become arrogant and unpleasant, as he battles new villains (Including the Sandman, the best villain of the series in my opinion) and begins to seek revenge.<br/><br/>As I stated before the acting is very good when compared to the prequels, every cast member gives a credible performance. The CGI is amazing, all though there are a few times when it becomes just a little too obvious. A few problems with the film is that it begins to drag towards the end, as it is 140 minutes long and 15 minutes longer than its prequels. The love story between Mary Jane and Peter went a little too deep in my opinion, and some of it seemed unnecessary. There are some incredibly corny lines, but what would you expect from this kind of film? Also, the strange black goo-like substance that attach's itself to Peter and makes him ""evil"" seemed a little forced. He wouldn't notice or even hear a meteor crashing down thirty meters away from him? And the fact it went after him out of all the millions of people living in New York seemed just a little too coincidental.<br/><br/>Although in the end these problems are only small, as the positives heavily out weigh the negatives, as Spider - Man 3 is a great popcorn movie to lose yourself in for a few hours on a Friday/Saturday night. I feel that it does not deserve all the negative reviews. 8/10 - A must see for all Spidey fans, this film does not disappoint."

","As the titles start and that theme begins, we know we are possibly on the final Spidey ride of our lives - and what a ride! This is a comic book superhero, Juggernaut of a movie and its not difficult to see where the money went. I have little doubt that we will ever see such a huge scale of nearly faultless CGI, fast-paced action, angles, details, colors and scenarios in any superhero movie ever again.<br/><br/>It is an emotional roller-coaster and obviously made with such spirit and care. The characters we know, love and trust and even the new characters such as Venom and Sandman who really are not given much time to make an impact, do! Its a testament to fantastic writing, direction, scoring and acting that this movie delivers as the ultimate comic-book loving, popcorn scoffing, cola gulping entertainment that make going to the movies so much fun.<br/><br/>In terms of a 4th - what would really be the point? It doesn't get any better then this. An immensely satisfying trilogy that will remain a favorite of this spider-fan for life."

","Just saw a sneak preview. This film is without a doubt the best film of the trilogy, as well as the best film of the year. Many fans will complain about the climax, and its deviation from the comics, but I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I could care less about any deviation from the comics. Raimi has fun with this film and treats it as his masterpiece of the three. That being said, I'm not sure they're going to do a fourth one. The great thing is, there are loose ends that are subtly left untied, unlike X3. There could very well be a fourth one, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if Lizard was one of the villains, since Dr. Connors has been in the last two films. There were two things that impressed me most about this film. One was that they could tie all the plot lines together cohesively, as well as have enough room for sufficient character development. The second was the acting. James Franco, as well as Topher Grace embrace their villainy. Thomas Hayden Church is great as the tragic Sandman. Kirsten Dunst is beautiful from the opening scene. Tobey Maguire proves he can act. He's absolutely off the wall. I enjoyed this so much that I wanna go again tomorrow night! This is w/o doubt a must-see and will leave you wanting more!"
"handmemywallet","1","33","61","4 May 2007"," Spiderman 3: Self-deprecating comedy or cinematic tire-fire?
","I can't speak to having any serious complaints about Spiderman 1 or 2. What I can do is warn some hopefuls of the largest disappointment in my 12:01 AM showing experiences.<br/><br/>The first two movies were, at the least, hope for comic book fans everywhere that some justice could be done to their heroes on the silver screen. When I personally found out about the plot line and cast of characters slated for S-3 I couldn't have been more excited. My confidence in the entire Spiderman team fueled the anticipation of seeing an almost-real Venom leaping across and giant screen.<br/><br/>Problem #1: Venom is not highlighted. Peter Parker's feud with Brock is barely given anytime to develop since the majority of the movie is left to overly-sentimental schlock featuring the ever-emotional Mary Jane frowning a whole lot and getting dwarfed in Spiderman's limelight. There's no shortage of Aunt Mae either, who seems to provide the most relevant of advice at the most random points in the movie. Not to mention the schoolboy wuss-puss dialog traded in scenes with Harry and Peter. Thus Venom is tossed aside with Sandman, which leads us on to the next problem.<br/><br/>Problem #2: Thomas Haden Church as Sandman. I can't discredit the man entirely, the script offered nothing for him to use as an actor and left the character about as chokingly-dry as the sand he's made out of.<br/><br/>Problem #3: The script. It's Star Wars Episode III awful. What both movies have in common is a series of a events that have such epic potential, loyal fans cannot stay away from opening night. There is more time devoted to superficial relationships than the action-packed fun the other movies commanded. Sure, they featured a predictable romance and corny family sentiments, but did I really have to see flashbacks of Ben Parker's death eight times in black and white? I'll be honest here. I'm really upset about the seven dollars I wasted. I write this because I just got back and couldn't be more angry, but there are some parts of the movie that give critical fans like me some hope.<br/><br/>A memorable cameo in Times Square, a brief flash of patriotism, and the comments of a reporter standing by during the final scene give fans some hope that the Spiderman team knew they were making a heaping pile of junk. After all the bad comments I can make, somewhere deep inside, I hope that this was a sick joke that I'll enjoy more on DVD.<br/><br/>Good luck Spidey fans."

","Viewers have their own ideas about how the plot should twist and a story end. I didn't expect this ending but, in retrospect, it was the most satisfying ending and befitting spiderman's character.<br/><br/>Are there clichés in the movie? Yes, there are and in spite of them, this is a wonderfully entertaining production.<br/><br/>The magic of the previous movies is still there in the third feature. No matter what whining reviews you may have read, characters are well developed - in fact, any more development and we could have watched Hamlet instead.<br/><br/>The two new villains are completely different in terms of personality and motive. Sandman succeeds in moving the audience on more than one occasion whereas Venom inspires mostly contempt. Watch the scene when sandman quietly emerges for the first time. The gentle movements, the music and the pathos are brilliant and it is a scene I would want to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>This is also a story of revenge and the liberation of forgiveness. Without it, it wouldn't be a great movie - it would be an ordinary one about evil and retribution. Spiderman 3 continues to rise and to deliver its messages about the paradox of being both good and bad, about being small and magnanimous, cruel and merciful - and human."
"botngot21","1","42","80","4 May 2007"," They destroyed Spider Man completely
","While I really enjoyed Spider Man 2, I have never been so angry after watching Spider Man 3. They have completely destroyed it. The script is extremely weak. The actions are nowhere near expectations - in fact, I found myself growing impatient wondering when the next action scene would be. 90% of the time in this movie focused on the characters' emotions which failed to deliver anyway. I felt no sympathy, no emotion, just itchiness of wanting to leave the cinema. I walked into the cinema expecting actions and good fun, or at least a good strong script. I did not want to go in there to listen to tasteless words, to watch stretchy scenes (that were supposed to be meaningful but were oh so disappointing), or to witness a directing disaster such as of the scene where Spider Man danced in the Jazz Bar. It was HORRIBLY directed, just terrible! I could not bare the last 5 minutes of the movie. I just wanted it to end right away because I didn't want walk out on something I paid for. I guess everyone else felt the same because the minute the credits started to roll, EVERYBODY stood up at the same time like there was fire under everyone's bottom.<br/><br/>We left the cinema feeling frustrated, cheated, misled by the trailer, and, we couldn't leave the cinema fast enough."
"editor-299","4","56","110","2 May 2007"," A tangled web ...
","In the first of a trio of popular film part threes being released soon, Marvel Studios brings its long-awaited ""Spiderman"" franchise third installment to fruition. And while it is safe to say this was a bit better than part two (in my opinion, of course)  where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire ) constantly agonized over his lot as a super hero and struggled with his inner doubts and turmoils  it still does not approach the original in sheer fun and excitement.<br/><br/>The filmmakers also learned about what audiences (specifically the 14-18-year-old males Hollywood seems to be in love with lately) want  action, action and more action. Here it is provided with not one, but three main villains for Spidey to take on, including a battle with himself that takes the movie on a decidedly ""Superman III"" tack for a while.<br/><br/>It's now five years from the time Peter is first bitten by that pesky radioactive arachnid in the science lab. He's still in school (is he trying to become a doctor?!), dates Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and is comfortable enough in the role of hero that he puts all self-doubts to rest. In fact, he loves the adoration given to him, so much so, he's become obsessed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Harry Osborn (James Franco, given a few lead roles since ""Spiderman 2,"" including ""The Great Raid"" and ""Tristan & Isolde""), is still ticked off at the web-slinger for supposedly killing his old man (Willem DeFoe), Cracks develop in Peter and Mary Jane's fantasy world, as well when she is fired from a Broadway show because she cannot sing (she really can't, but wouldn't the producers and director have notice that minor flaw before the production played before an audience?).<br/><br/>Then, while sitting together in a tree one night, a meteorite lands near them (they, of course do not see this) and a black squidlike creature emerges and attaches itself to Peter's scooter. Where this thing came from and why it goes after Parker is never explained, by the way. I guess we're just supposed to take the movie's word that it is a very important event.<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, an escaped convict, (Thomas Haden Church, ""Sideways""), is caught is a fusion reactor thing in the middle of the desert and is turned into a sandman by the experiment. Once again, massive does of radiation does not cause tumors and painful death, it only mutates the victim into a creature more powerful and frightening than any seen before. The message from movies like this is never ever engage in any type of scientific experiment, as it only leads to mutilation and destruction, never anything good.<br/><br/>In this case, the sand guy has the power to grow huge and rob armored cars and banks. He does it, we find out, to save his little daughter, who has an unnamed disease. Of course, Spiderman has to deal with this large angry sand dune, but Harry has also morphed into a Green Goblin-like clone on a deadly glider and is now looking for some payback, as well.<br/><br/>Our friendly neighborhood super hero seems to have his hands full, but that's not the end of the fun. As Peter, he is also vying for a full-time job on the ""Daily Planet"" (is that a subplot anyone cares about?!), and the black thing has taken over his body causing him to don a cool black costume and pull off the bad bug routine. This creature also causes him to turn into a 1970s a-hole who abuses Mary Jane and gets his newspaper rival, Eddie Brock (a blonded Topher Grace, ""In Good Company,"" ""That 70s Show"") fired.<br/><br/>If those aren't enough plot confusions, Brock is soon infected by the squid and becomes  at last  Venom, a villain with roughly to same powers as the Spider dude himself. Unfortunately, we don't get to meet this intriguing character until about 15 minutes remaining in the movie.<br/><br/>Valuable plot time is consumed dealing with the duality of Peter Parker, his love life problems and the big sand monster (which, by the way, is one of the most uninteresting bad guys since Catwoman in ""Batman Returns"").<br/><br/>One would assume that with three major villains, plus a battle with himself, ""Spiderman 3"" would be three times as interesting as its predecessors. Well, one would make an ""ass"" of himself assuming such things, though. With all of the loose ends flying about and the movie clocking in at just under two-and-a-half hours, this installment might rate high on the ""oooh"" and ""ahhh"" scale, but ""interesting"" wouldn't be my choice description.<br/><br/>Still, look for part trey to make a mint at the box office, only because we want to love these kinds of films. Plus, as the first major summer blockbuster, we are hoping against hope for that this one ushers in many more enjoyable pictures to come over the next three months - just like last year. Oops, forget I wrote that."
"carpediem18","6","62","123","4 May 2007"," Definitely a Surprise Disappointment
","Alright, I will admit that seeing it in IMAX at midnight was definitely worth the $16 I paid for it because the CGI and fight scenes were just amazing. So I guess this movie is worth seeing once on the big screen. But I am not going to buy it.<br/><br/>Why? Because Spider-Man 2 was an amazing film and although it had those random cheesy scenes of slow-motion and stuff, it still was amazing and had wonderful plot and Alfred Molina really brought some depth to his character. But in the end, Spider-Man 3 lacks those qualities. It lacks strong plot that really brings this movie together cohesively. Instead, the film is really just a mess of stuff happening. It was overkill in every region of the film: too many characters, too many villains, too many dramatic shifts, too many unexplained scenes that didn't fit into what was going on, and by far, too much weird creepy stuff.<br/><br/>What I mean is that Tobey Maguire's character is supposed to be influenced by the symbiote like it influences Brock to become Venom, but in the end, Tobey Maguire can't play evil or bad so much as just creepy. And although the film really seemed to be going for realistic unlike the first two (less campy comic stuff and more dramatic feeling), it still ended up with the one sequence in the middle of the film which was just UNNECESSARY!!!! You will know what it is when you see it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as far as the acting goes, Tobey Maguire didn't do much for me. He seemed to finally show the fact that he really just wasn't right for the role in the end. Surely he fills the costume out right, but when he's walking around as Peter Parker, he really doesn't fit the role. In this film, James Franco is truly the scene-stealer and best actor of the film! They finally gave him screen time as he is in it quite a bit. I loved him and he definitely made the movie worthwhile in the end. Kirsten Dunst also surprised by playing MJ as a much more mature MJ and less like a damsel in distress all the time. She really did a good job. And she sings, and she actually sings well!!! It was a shock, I thought it was someone else but you can tell that it's her voice! It's a total shock! And also, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman was a very good choice, but unfortunately he just totally was not given enough screen time. Again, too many villains to focus on so Sandman and Eddie Brock as Venom become little more than appearances for the ending battle. Venom was done well and Topher Grace really did a good job, but again, lack of screen time. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard appears for about ten minutes and does a decent job with what little she was given. Unfortunately, although I think she's going to be an amazing actress in the future, her role in this film made me angry because all it did was make Spider-Man/Peter Parker very unlikable.<br/><br/>All in all, this film lacks direction and story and is just a webbing of random connected scenes and events and ideas that were thrown together. Extreme deviation from the comics is present in this film and I think the deviation is definitely bad because it makes the film too predictable and too sentimental and gooey. Oh, and this is perhaps the most pro-United States propaganda film I have seen in recent years! Beware the scene when Spider-Man is seen in front of a giant American flag: you will laugh your butt off it is so obnoxious."

","The good news is that this blockbuster is exceptional. It's easily the best of the trilogy and, for my money, the most enjoyable film of the decade.<br/><br/>The comic-book-inspired franchise has always been about the search for balance; ironically, balance is was exactly what the first two movies lacked, with the seriously good cast continually upstaged by the special effects.<br/><br/>This time round, thanks to an inventive script, all the elements are in sync. The plot gives New York photographer Peter Parker aka Spider-Man three foes to contend with - four, if you count his battle with himself, which is brought on by an alien landing and subsequently turns his suit jet-black.<br/><br/>His love life is also a mess. He keeps trying, and failing, to propose to Mary Jane, who is suffering a career setback and does not appreciate the arrival of sweet blonde, Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>The villains are well-rounded, with Flint Marko a joy to behold. Actor Thomas Haden Church has a great, Depression era face and his transformation into The Sandman is spectacularly beautiful - the creature is like a Henry Moore sculpture.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter, Mary Jane and their rich friend Harry Osborn convince as fragile, ambitious twenty-somethings trying to make it in the big city. All the encounters are emotionally intense. They're also full of humor. ""Where do they get these guys?"" says Spidey, tipping out sand from his boots.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is worth taking seriously, because it's so hell-bent on having fun and it won't be beat in the movie of the year race.<br/><br/>-C. O'Sullivan"
"Skint111","8","129","272","23 April 2007"," Little short of a masterpiece
","Spider-Man 3 is the Lawrence Of Arabia of the superhero movies world. It is epic, sprawling, magnificent, meaningful, beautiful. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie must be a pretty spoilt brat or a cynical old misery. For near on three hours it envelops you in its world and makes you CARE about the characters. How's that for a special effects laden blockbuster, a movie with characters that matter? The comedy works, the emotion works, the action works. Everything Raimi tries comes off. The set pieces are particularly astounding, ranging from an out of control crane to Spidey's numerous battles with the meaty villains on show. Like others, I think this is by far the best of the three (though I loved the first two as well). It's a modern-day classic, an enrapturing fantasy that exhibits all that's best in modern movie making. An experience not to be missed."

","Lets be honest, this movie had awful big shoes to fill after the outstanding Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>The script: 10/10. So good! Sam Raimi balances all of the story lines, characters and subplots perfectly.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10. Tobey Maguire is once again amazing in his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.

"Aaron1375","10","49","96","14 May 2007"," Spidey still amazing...albeit a bit somber this go around.
","I really enjoyed this movie a lot and rank it right there with part two in how much I enjoyed this movie. Granted, a lot of people do not share this opinion, but then we all have differing tastes do we not. For me I was extremely surprised at how well the movie was made and how the story progressed...from all the reviews I was expecting a bit of a jumbled mess instead of a story that may had a lot of plot points, but for me they all came together quite nicely in the end. There is quite a lot of drama in this one, I will not deny that either as this was the complaint of a couple of people I know. I say a movie needs heart to keep your emotions going, and it was not like there was no action in this one, this one had more action than the previous two installments. When I read about this movie from critics and such I was not expecting what I got, I had a rather negative review ready to go on how this movie should have only been the black suit without Venom and how he should be introduced in the next movie, in the end Venom was not quite in the movie as much as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed the scenes he was in as Topher Grace was surprisingly effective as the character. And speaking of effective Thomas Haden Church was also excellent as the hulking yet sad Sandman. The plot, everything is going alright with Spidey at the beginning, the city of New York has embraced Peter Parker's alter ego, this however kind of blinds Peter from the fact MJ's career is not going quite so good and he does a few things that he should not. If this were not enough Harry attacks him as the New Goblin and another super villain appears as the Sandman, a powerful foe seemingly unstoppable. Add to this the fact that Flint Marko, aka the Sandman, may have actually been the one to kill his uncle and the pressure is really on Parker as now the old stirrings of revenge have surfaced. Fortunately, thanks to an accident Harry seems to be his old self again, not so fortunate some sort of alien material has now attached itself to Spider man and now Spidey and Peter are exhibiting a darker edge. So that is how it plays out, throw in an annoying new photographer named Eddie Brock causing Peter and Spidey headaches and you have a wild ride as there are fights in the skies of New York, on the streets, in the subways, and finally the biggest fight in any of the Spidey movies at a building under construction, an all out battle with two villains and even two heroes. However, this movie will not be for everyone as there are stretches where the movie is really dramatic between the action scenes, and even though I loved it, it still left me depressed too. Still if it ends on this it will be okay, however I do believe there is an opening for a sequel and if there is one I do believe the focus will be on that one particular character that some complain was not in this one enough. Though one thing was kind of lame, was Peter walking through the streets doing his little shuffle, I do think they could have come up with a better way to portray his dark side than that as I would have at least included a scene of him in the black suit taking out some criminals with a bit more force than necessary."

","Your friendly neighborhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director Sam Raimi's Spiderman saga in this movie entitled,Spiderman 3. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two installments, with Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard making their first appearances in the series as Flint Marko,Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy respectively.James Cromwell,Rosemary Harris and J. K. Simmons co-star to play supporting roles.<br/><br/>Peter Parker has finally leaned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs and the man that Mary Jane loves. All is well in New York City until one night, as Peter and M.J. sit gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by. But this isn't any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape- shifting symbiotic with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. Later, as Harry Osborn acquires his late father's flying board, engineers a powerful new Goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad's death, the mysterious space sludge infects both Peter's Spider-Man suit and ambitious street photographer Eddie Brock. Peter's strange new suit gives him a new found sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, and he discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben.Unfortunately for Peter, Marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded Sandman. As the Sandman gives in to his darkest criminal instincts and the slithering space symbiotic transforms Eddie Brock into the nightmarish fanged villain known as Venom, the citizens of New York City must once again call on Spider-Man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man.<br/><br/>How does Spider-Man 3 follow on the heels of its predecessor, which was widely considered the best superhero movie ever? For starters, you pick up the loose threads from that movie, then add some key elements of the Spidey comic-book myths, the black costume, and the characters of Gwen Stacy and her police-captain father. In the beginning, things have never looked better for Peter Parker: He's doing well in school; his alter ego, Spiderman, is loved and respected around New York City. And his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson, has just taken a starring role in a Broadway musical. But nothing good can last for Spidey. Mary Jane's career quickly goes downhill; she's bothered by Peter's attractive new classmate, Gwen Stacy; and the new Daily Bugle photographer, Eddie Brock, is trying to steal his thunder. Enter a new villain, the Sandman, who can transform his body into various forms and shapes of sand and who may be connected to Peter's past in an unexpected way. There's also the son of an old villain, Harry Osborne,who unmasked Spidey in the previous movie and still has revenge on his mind. And a new black costume seems to boost Spidey's powers, but transforms mild-mannered Peter into a mean and obnoxious boor.<br/><br/>If that sounds like a lot to pack into one 140-minute movie, it is.This is seriously overextended, with four distinct subplots and way too much hand-wringing over things like the heroine's singing career. While director Sam Raimi keeps things flowing, assisted on the screenplay by his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent, there's a little too much going on, and it's inevitable that one of the four villains gets significantly short-changed. Still, the cast is excellent.Also,the effects are fantastic. And the action is fast and furious. Even if Spiderman 3 isn't the match from its predecessors as isn't quite as refined as the first two, it's a worthy addition to the mega-million dollar Spiderman franchise."

This was a great addition to the growing line of Spiderman movies which get better every time one is released. I am looking forward to the next one, all except for one thing. The studio is thinking of having spider man go African American. This is by no way a racist comment, but for those who have watched and read the comics for all these years, know that spider man is Caucasian and nothing else. I do not think it would be a good idea to change the genre since it does not need to be changed at all. It would be a mistake, especially for those who are avid readers.

With the exception of Harry and ""evil"" Peter battling, the rest of the movie consisted of spiderman getting bullied. I almost felt sorry for him. Where was HIS spiderman?<br/><br/>2.) Logic: If some A are B, then some B are definitely ۞. This is about how much sense this movie made. Let's talk about Harry's butler. First off, recall Spiderman 1. There's that whole ending battle with spiderman and the first green goblin. Let's recall who was there. There was Spiderman, the first Green Goblin, and...THAT'S IT! How the HELL did the butler know that the original Green Goblin's aircraft killed the green goblin? Was he dusting the tables while the fight took place? Next, Mary Jane. ""Peter's not paying attention to me. He doesn't understand how I feel...blah, blah, blah."" Peter WAS being selfish for not comforting her when she was booted from the play. Oh, wait, SHE NEVER TOLD HIM! As far as him not paying attention, I'm sure Spiderman has other things on his mind besides MARY JANE. She was so stupid in this movie, I was crying tears of joy when Peter smacked the crap out of her. Maybe she wasn't cut from the play, because she was a bad performer. Maybe she was cut, because she's STUPID. Afterall, acting means singing right?<br/><br/>3.) Realism: Harry is god. Let me tell you all the truth. When an explosion happens so close that it melts half of your face, chances are, you won't COMPLETELY HEAL in 1 DAY or even continue your days as scheduled.<br/><br/>4.) Special Effects: You could touch the giant sand monster! No, not really, because he looked about as real as Bugs Bunny. The only thing that looked real was the symbiote, but not even that was impressive. It looked like someone put jelly on ceram wrap and moved the jelly by pulling on the wrap.<br/><br/>5.) Ending: After smashing Peter nearly to death, robbing bank trucks, injuring countless people, and finally, killing Peter's uncle, Peter decides to not only ""forgive"" Sandman, but also LET HIM GO! There's justice for you. Venom, now you see him, BAM! Now you don't. He's in the movie for about 10 minutes anyway so it's not like he's an important character.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"
"cflcd","1","17","29","7 May 2007"," Sam Raimi, you've destroyed a franchise.
","Let me just say that I am a HUGE fan of comics and of the first two Spiderman films, most especially, Spiderman 2. My brother works in the comic book industry and I simply could not wait to see this with him and the rest of my family. (Insert enormous sigh here). I've read many of the negative comments and feedback, and I can unreservedly say that I agree with them ALL. My family and I were HUGELY DISAPPOINTED with this movie, and that simply SUCKS since we were expecting SO MUCH more. Our theatre was packed, and when the movie *finally* ended, the reaction was definitely mixed, with most of the feeling being in the ""What the?!"" category. Many people sat shaking their heads in utter disbelief and shock. I just cannot believe that Sam Raimi is now on the same shameless loser level as George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers. I won't go on with any more tedious remarks about WHY the film sucked, since many of you have already eloquently expressed the same views. But I will say, that I left the theatre feeling pretty much the same way I did after seeing ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Matrix: Revolutions"". This will go down as the most hyped and most surprisingly disappointing movie, EVER. I won't even buy the DVD. <br/><br/>When I asked my brother afterward what he thought of the movie, he simply responded: ""What movie?"" It's our inside joke for when a movie's SUCK FACTOR is off the charts. We simply deny it's existence. Spiderman 2, however, will always be my favorite superhero/comic book movie. It was sheer genius, and I guess, lightning in a bottle for the filmmakers, since they've now become creatively anemic. So as far as I'm concerned, there are only TWO Spiderman films. And maan, that hurts."

","Just got back from one of the first mass release screenings in the UK (I actually booked the day off of work - how sad is that?).<br/><br/>First, I have to agree with a lot of what people are saying which is that there is a lot packed into this film, but in my opinion, it is all the better for it. I can't remember the last time I was so enthralled by a film and for nearly 3 hours and 45 Mons, that isn't bad going.<br/><br/>I thought the first two were great but this Spider-man 3 has it all; action, character, drama, romance, humour and a lot of violence. Just the way I like my comic book movies.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi did a great job but I really do hope that this is the last so that the team and the franchise can finish on a high. I don't think they have anywhere else to go in terms of quality, other than down. (definitely if Sam will no longer be directing and the cast is different - Tobey Maguire will be in his late 30's, and still at high school?!) I'm going to go and see it again as soon as I get a chance. I recommend you go see it. Especially if they do a fourth, and even more especially if they give the directors job to that idiot Mark Steven Johnson."
"Ostrumation","Null","43","84","5 May 2007"," The Weakest of the Trilogy, But Still a Solid Film
","""Spider-Man 3"" is another sequel that once again falls into the mold where the third film is the worst. But ""Spider- Man 3"" wasn't a terrible film. Not at all. ""Spider-Man 3"" at its best is just a solid superhero film. Coming off of the brilliant ""Spider-Man 2"", what could they do this time? How could they top it? Who knows why ""Spider-Man 3"" turned out the way it did.<br/><br/>The flaws are there. A story that's a muddle. Peter Parker of course acts out of character and becomes a bit of a moron. One gripe many have with this film is the amount of villains. It's not because there are too many villains, it's just that the villains were underdeveloped. Venom did not get enough screen time. The Sandman just comes in out of nowhere. I heard that the original cut was closer to three hours before the film was released, so maybe there was some strengths (or flaws) in that version.<br/><br/>There were a lot of strengths. The acting was alright throughout, and there was some bits of humor here and there. The drama was either good or dull, some of it came off as campy. Peter acting out of character on his dark side was awkward. Many people to this day still pick at the scene of him dancing. ""Spider-Man 3"" could've been dark, but I think some of these aspects brought it down. The biggest strength is the action. The action sequences were pulse-pounding and incredible. The special effects were excellent (particularly the Sandman sequences).<br/><br/>When I first saw it in 2007, of course, I was younger and I ate up those big blockbuster films. I loved it. Nowadays, it's still a fun ride, but it's nothing great. It's hard to top a critically acclaimed sequel. ""Spider-Man 2"" was one of those sequels that was on par with its predecessor. ""Spider-Man 3"" is not a terrible film, but it's not a great film. It's a solid superhero film with great action and great effects to be a worthwhile watch. A 7.7 out of 10."

","I just got home from seeing this movie and for the first time I find it worthy to write a comment about Spider Man 3.<br/><br/>Let me just start by answering the big question that's on a lot of the fans's mind: Is Spder-Man 3 better than its predecessors? Yes, Hell Yess!! Not only the visual effects are better but also the story, characters, villains,...<br/><br/>It has been a long time since I've laughed during an action movie. The villains were outstanding, I mostly enjoyed Topher Grace as Venom (though it would have been better if he would've had more screen time). James France did a great job too, certainly at the end. Kirsten Dunst, still looking great, even when being sad. She did a great job as M.J.. But the big surprise of all is Tobey Maguire. The way he changed from the ""Nerd"" guy into ""Mr. Badass"" just cracked me up. He did such a great job that I'll watch this movie again in theaters as soon I get a chance.<br/><br/>This movie really has it all, you'll laugh, you'll enjoy the action, special effects, story and for the faint of hearts: you'll cry as well...<br/><br/>I highly recommend to go and watch this movie, don't miss it<br/><br/>10/10"
"dobbs888","10","29","54","15 May 2007"," What is wrong with these people who voted 1?
","No movie is worthy of a 1 and makes me wonder what these people are up to.. don't let them fool you. Spiderman3 wil go down as one of the all time best movies. If ou can see it at the IMAX then so much the better. <br/><br/>The Plot: Peter Parker (Maguire), a.k.a. Spider-Man, faces a series of new challenges and threats as he embraces public adulation for the first time. His new-found self confidence causes him to take his relationships for granted -- namely his union with M.J. (Dunst), which is tested by the presence of the doting Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Self-assuredness also comes into play as he faces not one, but two powerful villains: Sandman (Church), an escaped convict made powerful by a nuclear explosion, and Venom (Grace), a parasitic life form from our hero's past. User Rating: THE BUZZ: Production on S-M 3 started quietly (and much less dramatically than its predecessor) in November, 2005. There were no chubby Tobey stories in the trades, no rumors of Jake Gyl replacing him ... just reports that our hero will face down not one, but two of his fiercest opponents. The formula rebooted the Batman franchise, and it's all but a guarantee to help make the third film in the series the most successful yet. Poor Topher Grace is facing the same fanboy scrutiny that Maguire himself weathered back when he was originally cast. In our minds, the actors are wonderfully paired. Though what's with the emphasis on the blondish boys and the minimal appearances of Mary Jane and new rival Gwen?"
"Bosco-HK","9","28","52","4 May 2007"," Educational information is always good
","I'm glad I actually went to watch the movie today. Most of the comments will regard all factors of the movie, but I will take only three to five parts of it as my subject.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the artistic effect in the beginning of the movie, shattered glass of mirrors and the venom gene effect as the first Spiderman and its sequel were re-enacted. These two symbols help viewers know who the villains may come into play and not forgetting the relationships between the three main characters or even more about six in total in fact. ""One must come to know that we always have a choice"" by Wynn Cameron Thompson or by many more other people who have mentioned this before. ""I forgive you."" or 'a mere reaching hand' or even 'a hug of friendship and trust'. I really enjoyed the different ways of forgiveness in this movie.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the two scenes where I was actually shown science like doing my science labs. First, the heating of sand into glass that shattered at the fight between New Goblin/Harry Osborn (James Franco) and the Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). And the second, the demonstration of possible ways to create musical tunes with metal bars to be used like the musical tongs, the fight between Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Venom/Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). These two scenes were extremely entertaining, I really felt I finally got the 'bigger picture'.<br/><br/>Besides, that I'd also like to say that the 'binding' and 'unbinding' is also very educational. 'The urge of vengeance is far greater and beyond than it meets the eye'. I wonder if Eddie's (Topher Grace) realization of ""What are you doing?"" is actually saying that he is giving up because there's nothing more to live on for, his reputation and name is ruined. Of course, how can anyone forget the suit and fancy dancing of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Nothing more can be said about Peter Parker's other side is very well played by Tobey Maguire, the arrogance and jealousy behind his heartbreaking relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). The very emotionally understanding of Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) at her date was 'beyond the movie', it was really really real.<br/><br/>To add more about Mary Jane, I thought that Kirsten Dunst sang very well, no matter what has been said about ""her voice or not"". I was entertained by the two songs, no matter.<br/><br/>All these scenes above and this movie in general are very inspirational to others who want to become a scientist, who want to learn the so-called ""put your loved one before oneself"" , or a singer.<br/><br/>Hmm, the ending though seem like there was something missing. What about Gwen Stacy? And the forgiven Sandman? Anyways...<br/><br/>I really recommend this sequel to people who like to be entertained by real life occurrences."
"MrsTobeyMaguire","10","35","67","22 May 2007"," Entertaining, action-packed movie with few flaws
","Spider-Man 3 director Sam Raimi had a pretty high bar set for him after directing his masterpiece comic book movie, Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man 2 is said to be the best superhero movie ever made, and topping it is nearly impossible. For the third film, Raimi tried to make a bigger movie instead of a better one. He succeeded. Spider-Man 3 has more of everything. More villains, more love story, more fight scenes. It's bigger, but it's not necessarily better.<br/><br/>One of Spiderman's biggest flaws is too much in too little of time. Too many villains and too many characters seemed to drag the film down a bit. But no matter, Raimi seems to catch your attention, right before you drown into all the nonsense, with his breathtaking action sequences. Unfortunately, there was simply not enough time to make a flawless movie with all the characters, villains and plots they throw at you in spider-man 3. However, you will be entertained. I guarantee you that; with the genius action sequences and the comedy, it seems to me that spider-man 3 just has a double dose of everything, some good, and some bad. <br/><br/>Luckily unlike those other failed third superhero movies, Spider-Man 3 is the first of its kind to keep the same cast and crew together through three films. That's enough to keep it swinging. Still there's no denying that trying to squeeze so many different villains into a single movie hurts it. <br/><br/>Yes, there were some cheesy parts of the movie, but what is a superhero movie without them! It's a comic book movie for goodness sakes! Howevever, if you go into the movie, leaving behind your realistic thinking; hence black goo coming from outer space with no explanation on how, you'll be able to sit back and enjoy one of the most entertaining superhero movies around."
"Buddy-51","4","48","96","6 May 2007"," rampant overkill
","Clocking in at an interminable two hours and twenty minutes, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a movie desperately in need of some serious streamlining. There is such a plethora of characters, plot lines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.<br/><br/>The ostensible selling point of ""Spider-Man 3"" is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy. The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time. No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel-fatigue). The others foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father's death; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker's uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero's hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well). One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn't have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment. In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion. While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles. Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn't all that convincing when he's trying to play the bad-boy villain either).<br/><br/>I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why ""Spider-Man 2"" worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him. In ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, Parker essentially has his ""evil"" thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking. Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.<br/><br/>That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spiderman's ""flying"" very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed). The fight scenes are impressively hectic and noisy (which may explain the headache I developed halfway through the film), but it is rather difficult to develop much of a personal rooting interest in the outcome when a group of what are essentially invincible figures are battling it out for supremacy. And talk about villain overkill! <br/><br/>With ""Spider-Man 3,"" the superhero's movie batting-average drops from an impressive .500 to a middling .333. Let's hope he can raise it back up the next time he steps up to the plate."

"GreatShash","9","32","61","18 May 2007"," Not Super...Superb!
","Spider-Man 3 was better than expected, and I'm saying that because the trailers didn't impress me. The beauty of the film lies in its action, with its superb visual effects. Although I didn't feel he was required, Flint Marko's transformation into Sandman is truly mind-blowing. Tobey Maguire is really awesome as the new ""changed"" Peter Parker and does some really good acting. James Franco's role as Harry Osborne is lovable, and, at the end of the movie, I felt he was the real hero, not Spider-Man. And story-wise, maybe Spider-Man 2 had a better storyline.<br/><br/>Venom was given way too less screen time (4 minutes). Venom deserves an entire movie to himself, he's Spider-Man's toughest enemy! The music is very good, the music that is played in the opening credits are really good. But sometimes the film loses it's pace. J.K. Simmon's role as J.J. Jameson is very comical, specially his first seen, where he is seen ""trying"" to control his anger. Topher Grace fitted very well in Eddie Brock's role, plus he got some of the best dialogues as well! The film is just superb! <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie... I'm looking forward to Spidey 4... and I can't wait for the DVD!"
"rcbbo","1","32","61","4 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 Surprises...It's Awful
","OK, well, let me start by saying that I enjoy the Spider-Man series. I thought 1 was good and 2 was excellent. Yes, a lot of the dialogue is cheesy, but it's a comic book series. It's based on action and stories.<br/><br/>Now that we got this out of the way, let me say that if this wasn't a part of the Spider-Man series then this would be on every critics bottom 10 list for the year.<br/><br/>I was so excited to see it, but they really took the cheesy dialogue, really lame scenes and horrible attempts to elicit emotional responses to an all time high.<br/><br/>By now, we all know the story. Peter Parker is a photographer with an alter-ego...he is Spider-Man. He's in love with the emotionally hard to figure out Mary Jane Watson.<br/><br/>Very early in the movie we get one of the 'anticipated' matchups when Harry and Peter fight. Not Spider-Man, but Peter. Harry is all done out in his father's goblin suit.<br/><br/>Of course this first battle ends out in a victory for Spidey. Harry takes a huge hit to the head on a bar and is knocked out and is dying. Peter gets him to a hospital where the doctors are able to save him, but he now has what could be permanent short-term memory loss. He can't remember his anger for Peter, he can't remember if he has a girlfriend or not...he pretty much only remembers up until high school.<br/><br/>The other 'Bad guys' are played by Thomas Haden Church, who is a character called ""The Sandman"" who can do amazing things after being involved in a freak accident while on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, and the other is Topher Grace who plays Venom. We'll get to him later.<br/><br/>Peter finds out that his grandfather's murderer was not found originally and that the convict escaped from prison is the one who did it.<br/><br/>With his anger growing, a black, sticky, ooze creeps on to Peter and takes over. He is now Venom. He has nothing but anger and revenge in his heart.<br/><br/>After a series of unfortunate events, he feels the need to get rid of the suit. He fights himself to get it off and finally does so only to have the black ooze transfer on to Peter's arch enemy from The Bugle, Edward Brock.<br/><br/>I can't say much more without giving away the plot, but good gosh this was bad. There are many scenes that make you cringe because of how bad the dialogue is and there are plenty of scenes that tested my gag reflex (Harry and MJ doing the twist, Peter walking down the street with a new attitude and pointing and winking at girls as he goes along, Peter doing pelvic thrusts in a men's store, Peter dancing and playing piano in a jazz bar, etc.) Peter's Venom side is actually quite intriguing though. When he is Peter, he has an attitude. He will willingly fight people on the street without his suit. Not bad guys, he'll fight people who just plain tick him off. His edge is nice, but not really useful except for in a couple of scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is probably the worst comic book movie ever. Not kidding.<br/><br/>I'd avoid at all cost, but knowing that it's Spider-Man, I know most can't resist. They're curious and they have to know.<br/><br/>Well, don't say I didn't warn you..."
"HobbyIllustrator","10","47","94","5 May 2007"," It is what it is, the story of Spider-Man AND Peter Parker
","Unfortunately the internet makes it far too easy to voice an opinion, but in regards to Spider-Man 3, it seems the only opinions being voiced are those that did not like this film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I think I have figured out who these people are. Simply put, the negative reviews for this film are from people who know very little, or nothing, about Spider-Man.<br/><br/>This film follows quite closely to a couple of story lines in the Spider-Man Universe and certainly helps develop the character of Peter Parker. Essentially, the first two films were not the end of Peter's growth as a hero and as a man, and this can easily turn some people off. The turnoff is honestly for those who want instant gratification, they don't want dialog, they want a fight. Spider-Man 3, in my opinion, does a fantastic job bringing BOTH to the table.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to teach the entire backdrop of the Spider-Man stories to those who are not familiar with the comics because it took 40+ years to produce them (and would take a very long time to summarize for those who have not read them). Is this movie perfect? No, but no movies are, every movie is with flaws and we are not long to point them out.<br/><br/>If everyone knew, however, the complete history of Spider-Man, they would be quite happy with this film. Without giving spoilers, I can honestly tell you that this movie is very much worth your time and money. The acting was very good, the dialog was emotional when it needed to be, serious when it needed to be and sometimes, just funny. Bring your family and enjoy, this movie is ANYTHING but a let down. Like I pointed out before, I suspect the negativity is coming from people who know absolutely nothing about Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Period."

He's a bad guy, oh no wait a good guy, ah no hes is bad awwww how sweet he is a good guy after all.

Hayden Church was at his wooden worst but in fairness to him he was given nothing to work with.<br/><br/>Black Spidey Suit = Peter the Musical Emo/Goth - What in gods name was this about I wore a black suit which brings out my bad traits? sure I can deal with the cockiness and the anger but black eye shadow and his fringe hanging down oh yeah he also dances everywhere now. Completely random just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the film it was Bizare i just can't get my head around it I was actually embarrassed to be in the cinema in case I was seen I actually felt uncomfortable watching it. It was just so odd and out of place. Black Suit looked quite cool though even if Peter looked like an even bigger muppet than usual.<br/><br/>Running Time - 2 and a half hours for what.

"cj_685","6","7","10","9 June 2007"," Very little to say which makes me wonder...
","Firstly, i was really wondering whether to give Spider-Man 3 a 6 or a 7 out of 10, and then i realised that i couldn't really remember much about it so came to the conclusion it couldn't have been that worthy of the 7! I went to see this and was looking forward to it mainly because it was the first BIG movie of the year, excluding the few reasonably big earners that emerged! Unfortunately, this film really is a let down, especially if you were to be a huge fan or really enjoyed the first two films! The major problems were the storyline, the feeble attempt at trying to include comedy in it, and to be honest, the acting isn't that great! I also think they tried to put too much into it instead of making it more of a classic superhero film! I don't really think there was enough action in the film and therefore it didn't use the characters to their full potential, especially Sandman! Wasted in my opinion because they could have done so much more! The big budget obviously still allowed them to make the film look good with the special effects, but unfortunately the visual was actually the best bit about the black suit and the whole 'good Spidey vs. evil Spidey'! Now, this does sound like a bad review but all it is really is meaning to say that they had so much they could have done, and they just didn't hit the mark! But hey, it's made a shed-load in the box-office already so... !! I would buy Spider-Man 3 on DVD but i certainly wouldn't rush out to get it, and would probably wait for it to come down in the sale!"

","NO SPOILERS HERE!!! Spider-Man 3... More villains, plots and action than any super hero movie EVER made! It plunges into one plot, and with the blink of an eye... shifts to another. But here's the thing... if Spidey-3 stuck to one main plot... and less action... it would be an out cry about not enough action! In my view... Spidey-3 delivers all that you could dream in 2 hours and 20 mins. You want action, than you got it!!! Spidey-3 without a doubt has the best special effects to date... some of the most intense fight scenes your going to ever see... the fight scenes alone are worth the price of admission. The scenes with the crane going out of control... I dare someone say that was not the best action scene EVER created!!! And the most realistic looking one...<br/><br/>I understand people being mad at all of the plots... but you got to realize while in production... they thought it was the last one... so they wanted to wrap everything up! And when Peters Parker is ""BAD"" I mean, come on... he's already a geek... so you should expect him to be a geeky bad guy... I love the way he is betrayed, fits his character.<br/><br/>I agree certain things should of ended differently... but o well... at least it didn't screw everything up like Superman Returns did... Spidey-3 is very loyal to the comic...<br/><br/>And last thing... Spider-Man without Tobey will suck major balls... He might not be the idea Spider-Man... but he's the BEST fit for Peter Parker... and that's what separates Spider-Man from the rest of the Super Hero movies... cause Spider-Man, despite the name... is about Peter Parker... Superman is about super-man, Batman about Batman... and so fourth. You connect with Peter Parker... not Spider-Man. Other movie you connect with the Super Hero. This is why Spider-Man trilogy is the best. Look at it as a whole... VERY GOOD indeed...<br/><br/>Spider-Man 2 is still the greatest super hero movie ever made... but Spidey-3 is not far behind."
"cbhughes42","10","43","87","6 May 2007"," The Best ""Evil Dead"" Movie Yet!
","This movie differs very much from the previous two films. In Spider-man 3, Sam Raimi is given complete control of the film, and he produces one of the greatest works of art in the entirety of human history. The horrid dialogue and sub-par acting only help to enhance the best comedy of the year. The 2 and a half hour long epic was mostly worthless and boring, but the stretch of comedy where Peter Parker becomes a failed emo womanizer is worth every second of it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has the slightest bit of a humor hidden somewhere in their body. Any Evil Dead fan will feel right at home with the jovial jokes spread throughout. If you are a real fan of Spider-man, stay clear. If you're drunk and want to enjoy an evening laughing at bad actors, go see this movie this very instant. That is all."

I watched the first one cause I thought ""it's Spiderman, it Tobey Miguiere, how bad can it be."" I watch it and I think ""could be worse, he's a bit of a bland actor"" but I still watch the second. I really only watched this one to complete the series but then I spend the whole time groaning at Peter 1) failing to be a decent human being for MJ, 2) being incredibly edgy, and 3) wondering when Venom's going to show up because I came to this movie for Venom vs Spidey, not because I wanted to see Peter go through an emo phase while Harry and MJ both have the worst time ever. I'd suggest that if you want a good movie, watch Homecoming with Tom Holland."

The fact that this sequel is by far the worst of the Spider-Man trilogy is stated as an actual FACT. Just when I thought that there couldn't be more drama in the Spider-Man trilogy Sam Raimi proves me wrong! Sam forget the drama lessons you've learned at directors school, and focus on telling the story of Spider-Man properly. Watch the 90s animated series, and read comic book or two. You had a great Marvel francise, which would have been a great movie trilogy. But you've messed it up with all this drama junk! As a Spidey fan! I've got to say quit while your down!!

I was laughing or on the edge of my seat wide eyed during the majority of the film. This installment of Spider-man is plenty comical and action-packed.<br/><br/>There were a few things about it that I didn't like. But overall I enjoyed watching the movie so much I still gave it a 10/10 on IMDb.<br/><br/>***The rest of this bulletin may contain spoilers*** The two things I didn't like: The cheesiness that is Mary Jane and Peter Parker in love. But, this is the Spider-man movies after all, so I was expecting it. Luckily the film redeemed itself with lots of great action sequences.<br/><br/>They do not explain how Sandman comes into existence. They show this scene and you just have to accept it. ""Okay, some scientists were experimenting with the molecular decomposition of sand and this guy just happen to fall in and get turned into a super-villain."" And then they never go back and even attempt to offer anything.<br/><br/>If you can accept this and a couple other minor logistical problems (like the exact same kind of goblin bombs causing drastically different results) , then you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Things that I really liked: The comical scenes were Peter Parker brushes his hair forward into an ""emo"" style and tries to act bad-ass. Hilarious.<br/><br/>The action, as I mentioned several times before. The only thing is sometimes it gets too fast to follow.<br/><br/>I liked that he didn't get down on two knees at the end of the film. That would have been so cheesy!!!"

Recently I had my ex girlfriend cheat on me and I was trying to lure her back just so I could destroy her new relationship for revenge and then kick her to the curb like a piece of trash.<br/><br/>I woke up every day feeling the blackness that they portray in this movie, and even though it did help me seriously boost my career and get into the best shape of my life it was wearing away my soul. Peter goes through something similar and it really spoke to me.

And I see from reading other reviews, that I am not alone here. I won't repeat what others have already said, but I'll add that if the budget for this movie was what I've been hearing - 250-300 million - its hard to believe that its producers couldn't come up with a better product. No, a **much** better product.<br/><br/>Sure some of the CGI was good, although too quick to keep up with in some cases, but without a good story and character development to back it up..... you know the rest.<br/><br/>SM1 - 7, SM2 - 9, SM3 - 5 (and that might be a bit generous)<br/><br/>Worth seeing?

"dead_doll00","1","14","24","7 May 2007"," Thanks for BUTCHERING Spiderman!!!
","Wow...just...wow. If I had to talk about all the things wrong with this movie in-depth, I could probably go on for hours. Hours that would be better spent than the hours I wasted sitting at this cornball cry-fest. First thing's first: Where exactly has Spiderman's ""Spider-sense"" gone?<br/><br/>How does someone who can sense even the least amount of danger to himself (ie. getting hit by a car, etc.) not sense or see the spiraling meteor of fiery, gooey-black death falling 10 feet away from him? Oh yeah...he's too wrapped up in making googly weepy-eyes at Mary-Jane. That's another thing. This is in NO way a superhero movie. If you go into this expecting to be as blown away as you were during Spiderman I and II, allow me to pop that bubble. At most, amidst the random singing, dancing, weeping, angsting, and general ""WAH"" from Peter Parker, this comes off as a musical romance. A dramatic, musical romance. And here I thought I was sitting down to watch...oh, I don't know...Spiderman? All the awesome CG and special effects and acting of the last two movies seemed to have vanished into the night, as it seems the makers behind this little suck-fest hit bottom of the barrel and vomited out the worst possible script in superhero history. This was even more painful to sit through than The Hulk. <br/><br/>The villains are non-existent. Want to know why? Because there are NO villains in this movie. Only...*sniffle*...misunderstood victims :'( Aw...waaaaaah. Sandman and Hobgoblin both are but beaten-down shadows of themselves, and the only semi-saving grace in that particular department has to be Brock in his Carnage-suit, and even that was a far stretch.<br/><br/>As for Mary-Jane and Peter...never have I hated both characters more. Peter Parker is reduced to a whiny, emo-spouting gothchilde (seriously, he wears eye-liner at one point...EYELINER!) and Mary-Jane is sufficiently slutified, becoming a jealous, entitlement-obsessed ninth-grader, just enough to send Parker over the edge.<br/><br/>All in all, avoid at all costs unless you want this particular franchise ruined for you."
"crayon89","1","9","14","10 May 2007"," Utter s***e
","Director Sam Raimi has made some great classics in his years of directing. This film is far from being a classic. The ending of Spider-Man 2 sets a great opening scene for the film. We see the hero (Toby Maguire) swinging from building to building with helicopters floating behind him. He then lands in his apartment and the next scene we seen him and his girlfriend Mary Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst) lying in one of his webs in a park. When he drops her off he gets attacked by Harry (James Franco) his old best friend from high school. With this scene within the first five minutes you expect the movie to be one of the most exciting things ever brought to the big screen. But Raimi fails to keep the suspense going.<br/><br/>A pointless dance scene in the kitchen between MJ and Harry makes you want to walk out of the cinema but it is then repeated buy Peter Parker as he is possessed by Venom. Trying to introduce one villain was hard enough for Raimi to do in previous films so why did he take on the challenge of introducing three? Venom, who is probably the most famous villain in the Spider-Man comics, has a total of ten minutes on-screen time. Where the Sand Man, who nobody has ever heard of, has at least thirty minutes. While Raimi is trying to give us a background to each villain we begin to get bored of the film and lose all concentration and get entangled in its own web.<br/><br/>The only things holding this film together are a great performance by James Franco's he portrays the mentally disturbed son of the Green Goblin as he takes on his own demons as well as Spider-Man, and astonishing special effects.<br/><br/>With a terrible performance from Toby Maguire and an average one from Kirsten Dunst the film is brought down all by itself. And finally with the cheesiest script and terrible dialogue the film fails to deliver the goods."
"nic_the_shrew","4","9","14","7 May 2007"," i am SO disappointed...
","my main question after seeing this film is, ""why?""<br/><br/>why, of all people, was Sam Raimi chosen to tackle the Spiderman juggernaut? he made this movie suck. venom isn't scary, and he acts like an episode 2 Anakin Akywalker by saying, ""you know, you ruined my career. i think i'll kill you now."" the whole snapping of the fingers and jazz club and peter parker's emo-awareness moment made me sick. he lacks the darkness that Christian Bale's Batman had. Tobey Maguire is just not good at being an angry man. in a word, only one thing saved this film: Sandman. Marko didn't mean to kill Uncle Ben; he accidentally shot him when his partner (the guy Peter threw out a window in the first film) bumps into him. All Marko wants is to get enough money to save his daughter, and he tries to tell Spiderman that, but unfortunately the symbiote won't let Peter sympathize. He throws Sandman into a sewer drain and washes him away, and the apathetic Spiderman thinks him dead. Sandman doesn't go down that easy, and actually takes his anger out on Venom later on in the film. Sandman's humanitarian effort to save his daughter and the sudden ability to do so gives him a reason to rob banks and stores, though I'm not promoting becoming a part of a strange physics experiment that makes you a walking sand castle to save your loved ones. all he wants to do is to save his daughter, and in the process accidentally becomes a monster. so sad, so human, so un-Sam Raimi-like.<br/><br/>why was Kirsten Dunst chosen to play Mary Jane? she is so plasticine and her role in the film is basically ""i can't make up my mind about the whole Peter/Harry thing."" why didn't harry have a cool suit like his daddy? he looked like a snowboard punk with bombs. why didn't (SPOILER!!!! LOOK AWAY!!!!) the butler tell Harry sooner that his father killed himself? where was he in 1 and 2? and what in the world (ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT!!!!) gave Sam Raimi the idea to kill Venom off in the end? Venom can't die! he's a recurring villain and is supposed to be Spidey's arch-nemesis and alter-ego? you don't even get a snippet of the evil he truly is, and Topher Grace is a pathetic villain.<br/><br/>all in all, i am so saddened. the 4th one better be good."

Horrible dialogue along with acting (surprisingly James Franco actually did a good job) 3. Appears like Tobey Maguire just honestly did not care about this role or he is an over-rated actor.

","I just can't believe that Spider-Man 3 would turn out to be a disaster. It was so boring with cheesy SFX, the camera shook a lot during the action scenes which really made me dizzy especially when Peter & Harry were fighting for the first time. Do not mistake that the third is the best because it's not, that is what I thought as well but the best is the second. The film looked really amazing in the trailer with 3 villains but I was more interested in Venom not Harry or the Sandman because Harry is just the same as his dad in the first one and the Sandman is a similarity to the T-1000 in Terminator 2, but unfortunately Venom hardly appeared for about 10 minutes. The first appearance of all 3 villains was awful; the whole film is far too slow with a lot of useless scenes and lacks a decent story. It is supposed to be the most expensive film ever with a budget of $250 million but there is hardly anything I can see that looks expensive. The only thing I enjoyed in the cinema hall was my popcorn & juice and when it all ran out I went to get some more although I never do that but I wanted to save myself from boredom."

Yet, no matter how much it made me laugh, it couldn't cure the anger that I had for buying the movie ticket.<br/><br/>Peter Parker dances - twice (and badly). those scenes belong in stupid comedies, not in kick-ass superhero stories. He also, for some stupid reason, goes EMO. Mary Jane lip syncs to music a bunch of times too. Tobey Maguire doesn't know how to cry in movies (he looks hilarious by the way) and that is just the beginning of how silly this movie is. The acting gets worse and worse.

It just doesn't make sense. I mean, he'd already made inroads, he would've been much better to just stick his tongue down her throat again and actually cause a breakup for real. Plus, MJ knows that Peter is Spiderman, why would she care. Sure, he could've threatened to kill her, but that would've kinda ruined the plan.<br/><br/>The sandman character, played by a stupidly buff Thomas Haden Church, was cool, but underdeveloped. We saw a brief scene in which we sort of see why he's doing what he's doing, but he never actually gives any money to his ex wife and daughter. Plus, Peter already knows his weakness is water, and yet they fight him with fire, duh, idiots.<br/><br/>The flag scene made me angry. As if these movies aren't already symbolized enough, they actually put Spiderman in front of a waving American flag and virtually spell out the fact that the US is good and right and that everyone else is evil and bad. Not cool.<br/><br/>If I had my way, Harry would've killed Peter somehow, got with MJ, and then Gwen. The sandman would've got his cash, then given it to his ex, and then just remain in his normal form and change when he needs to, (it's not like the cops will ever be able to stop him)."

I don't want to be one of those reviewers that is clouded by emotion, so despite my feelings going into the movie, I'll try to set them aside.<br/><br/>This film was poorly constructed, and felt rushed. The pacing was erratic at best, which led to strangely arranged scenes, many of which feel out of place, or even useless.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi obviously wanted to retain every character that hasn't yet died in the series, making some scenes just all about throwing in characters that we no longer care about.<br/><br/>A large problem this movie faced was Tobey Maguire, and any scene he was in. For the first half of the movie, Peter Parker is essentially the villain, as he mistreats Mary Jane and stumbles through life, despite doing a stellar job as Spiderman. Unfortunately, this version of Peter is goofy as ****, and is less likable as a result. Impromptu dance session? Yes. Creepy flirting? Yes. Air-humping? In there. Spousal abuse? Yeah, believe it or not. Peter Parker does it all.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it isn't all bad. The villains shine, and constantly steal the show, making you almost root for them. The Sandman stole every scene he was in, and Venom was visually stunning. The new version of the Green Goblin is epically cool.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the amount of time Peter fights these guys is few and far between.

That's all of what Spiderman 3 is about... and that can be nice.<br/><br/>For those who want blood, and guts and hate and action, action, action - you might be disappointed in this film a bit. While there is blood and guts and action, action, action...this film isn't heavily laden with it. Instead it leans more on hate and revenge and what it can do to you if you let it overtake you. Even if you deem yourself ...""popular"".<br/><br/>This may not fly with 'die-hard' Spidey fans, or fans of popcorn-summer excitement, but is a great message for the kids. And where I saw this there were TONS of kids aged 5 on up watching. They came in their Spiderman suits, Spiderman masks (I kid you not!) and Spiderman undies, etc. Should they have been there? Well, maybe the right question is: Could you have stopped them from wanting to go? That could be the point and why this installment turned out the way it did.<br/><br/>Venom and the Sandman were not as terrifying as they should have been and if it were made with the 'fans' of Spiderman in mind, they would have been. The last 20 minutes or so proves that. Their stories were not too developed but in the theme of this film, this was actually just fine. Sure they could have been better, and sure there could have been fight scene after fight scene with all the glorious blood and action but...this is NOT what this Spidey film was about.<br/><br/>You can't please everyone, but this installment seemed directed towards the younger audience while the first two was a bit more for the older teens on up.

This what this film, more so than the first 2 capture. Examples of this would be in comic books, we are taken from scene to scene, a picture board if you will (which is what a comic action hero is)that are segments, fragments of plot.<br/><br/>At first they seem like bits and pieces, but then those bits and pieces come together and form the particular comic book series number of that month.

There was absolutely no cohesiveness with the plots, and really the only worthwhile aspect of the entire film was Bruce Campbell's cameo as the Frenchman. The first two films were better than most (Elektra, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Hulk), but certainly didn't compare to Batman Begins. This film, however, was in a league of its own IF ONLY because it had absolutely no reason to be so bad.

The bad Peter Parker is laughable, as is the slow mo landing besides a giant waving American flag. You can invariably predict what's going to happen next.

Not much to recommend here. While i can't say i'm especially fond of the first two, they are well reviewed, this however....isn't.....correctly i might add.
Tobey Maguire is limited and can't stretch to show different side of an ""affected"" Spiderman. James Franco continues to garner my ire. Kirstin Dunst is passable but better than this. Willem Dafoe is underused again though perhaps mercifully as I was always unconvinced by this character. Bryce Dallas Howard is wasted, as is Elizabeth Banks. J.K. Simmons is the only relief in this dull affair but given what he showed himself capable of elsewhere they would have been better making the film about him.
The characters are one dimensional. The plot is hopeless and full of holes. There's no shock or suspense. However, I watched this in UHD and the CGI holds together reasonably well, particularly Venom and Sandman. Neither are well acted in their normal form, but these villains are the best of this trilogy so it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't raise it's level.
At this point Spider Tobey was a spent force and in the hands of Sam Raimi, deflated the goodwill built up in what was for many, an acceptable franchise. FOUR"

","my son and I had concerns if to watch this one after reading the reviews here. We don't get what all those bad reviews are all about as this is a great Spiderman movie and maybe the best from the first three and not only in terms of special effects but also acting and awesome character development. The movie is also touching unique subjects in a very interesting way. We enjoyed not only the best action that was ever done for the series but from the whole movie."
"ironhorse_iv","6","4","5","20 May 2013"," My spider senses are tingling... yes this movie truly not the most amazing Spiderman movie ever.
","To each its own, for me, I have mixed feelings about Spiderman 3. Yup, that film was quite bad, but it's watchable. If you haven't watch Spiderman or Spiderman 2 (2004), watch those first. After that, try this mediocre film. I felt that it try to cram too much into one film. First off, the movie has three villains. OK, the new Green Goblin (James Franco) makes sense, they set it up at the end of the last movie that Harry Osborn saw his father's weapons and he was out for revenge for what happen in 2002's Spiderman. Harry tries to make Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst)'s life a living hell. Harry Osborn go through some many mood swings in the movie, it's annoying. First, he wants revenge on Peter, then get Amnesia, then happy go lucky with Peter, then back to revenge, and finally back with speaking terms with Peter. Plus, all this could be solve if only Harry's stupid butler told him what happen to his father that night, in the beginning of the movie. It's too much for a character, as there is yet another love triangle between them. Not only that love triangle, but another love triangle between Peter, Mary Jane, and Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). In my opinion, I would take Gwen Stacy over Mary Jane anyways. At least she was not a boring plainest damsel in distress, in contrast to the already annoying helpless Mary Jane. Bryce Dallas Howard is one sexy lady. The next villain is the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) who is pretty good for his Flint Marko role. In my opinion, he should have more screen time, then he got. The fights were damn good between him and Spiderman. The part about the movie that gets me most is where Peter forgives Sandman for accidentally shooting Uncle Ben. Because even if he's doing it for his daughter, the guy is still a violent criminal. He punches people out of cars and into busy traffic and generally acts very destructive. Sure, he doesn't intend to hurt anyone while he runs around with a loaded gun or smashes everything around him with several tons of force, but that's kind of an inevitability. Sandman does nothing but prove he'll endanger anybody he feels like using a sappy excuse. And Peter's reaction is, ""You're right, you're a great guy and you should keep on doing that'. Come on, movie. Last is Venom AKA Eddie Brock play by Topher Grace who looks nothing like Venom from the comic book. I just don't see him playing Venom with his wimp comedian style. Venom was an extraterrestrial symbiote badass and he was only in the film for the last ten minutes. Director Raimi was actually going to have Vulture and Sandman in Spiderman 3, but Sony wanted Venom and it hurt the film. In no way, does the particle accelerator, Green Goblin serum or the extraterrestrial symbiote scenes explain beyond making the villains. It would been really cool to have the technology be part of the plot. What mainly annoys me about Spider-Man 3 is that it goes way overboard trying to clarify who's good and who's evil so it loses its effect, like a comedian explaining a joke to the audience beforehand. The movie has some unnecessary comedy scenes such as Emo-Dancing Peter. I admit this is a stupid thing that was added into the movie. I don't fully understand the whole reasoning behind it as to why it was written in. The symbiote wasn't supposed to make Peter emo, it was supposed to make him aggressive. This movie was heavily marketed as a drama, where Peter becomes evil. There are a few scenes where he is, like his fight with Sandman, his fight with Harry, and his confrontation with Eddie at the Bugle. But for the most part, it was more stupid than evil, but not enough to ruin the movie. But the dance scene that occurred from it, I seriously could not see this as a part of something Spiderman related. Am I the only one to notice that everyone in the movie bawled like an emo infant. Should have called it Crying-Man 3. The movie has this lack of coherent writing, structure, and half-way decent effort for the movie. Going back and forth between at least 3 different stories all at the same time, without giving enough weight or attention to any of them in order to make them the least bit involving, or interesting. It's not Stan Lee's writing. I did not like Stan Lee's cameo in this one. He might as well have looked right at the camera. Who the hell just walks up to someone and talks like that? Although at this point he is probably about as old as those old men who strike up random conversations in the grocery store. There is also the cameo of Bruce Campbell as an French maître d'. His scenes were pretty funny, but not needed. Overall: The movie visuals are great, the story was pretty bad, but altogether it's alright for what it was market for. A comic book popcorn flick. At less, it's not the The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series) from the 1970s."

","i'm sorry but i may say, this movie is not as bad as everyone says. yes it does have it's problems with the story and the main argument is about how little venom had on screen. even though venom was only in it for maybe 10 minutes he was still awesome!!!! the fight scenes were the best in my opinion. more action. i think toby McGuire did a good job acting. i always will prefer him as a better peter parker than andrew garfield. this movie could have been so much better if they dropped the sandman and just had venom and harry as the two bad guys. all in all this movie should not have been the last. i was waiting for carnage for the 4th one but they just had to remake it..... so good movie. not the best in the trilogy but not as bad as people say"

","Hey....I was a hardcore spidey fan since my childhood when i used to watch the animated series on star plus.The 1st part of this trilogy was what which kept me mind boggling for a long time after viewed the movie.But the graph goes down as per my opinion in this set of trilogy.2 was not that great as the 1st part and 3 was an incomplete meal....Yeah that is what i call it.When i saw the characters of sandman,Eddie Brock, New Goblin,Venom i thought that the movie would completely satisfy my senses but, sorry to say its a let down.... a half left race.I never liked the explanation given by sandman or the way it ended for harry's part.Even there is no justification for Eddie Brock to become venom for a silly thing.<br/><br/>Acting-wise i always liked Toby as Spidey......He was my hero since 2002 when i saw Spiderman for the first time.He suits the role very well....James Franco was OK.So was Kirsten Dunsten....But that guy(i donn even know his name) who played as Eddie Brock was a misfit.The Sandman could have been better handled if his past was given enough screen time and a proper strong motive when he says that he had no choice. Overall i liked Sam Raimi's trilogy.He is a good director.I could easily understand all the duologue's as they were clear and audible not like Batman where the main protagonists swallows lot of those.....It was really hard to follow(Sorry I am an Indian and English is not my mother tongue Yet i love the language and its movies) Its a a fun-filled movie well received by the kids below 13 and to some adolescents. But if u really wanna catch some action of the ULTIMATE SPIN you better watch this one as its not a complete let-down as per my analysis.Love u spider man."

","Spider-Man 3 wasn't a work of art or anything, just an enjoyable couple of hours of eye candy.<br/><br/>There were too many coincidences in this muddled and over-stuffed film - why did it matter that Eddie Brock had been going out with Gwen Stacy, for instance? He had enough to be p*ssed off at Peter about with just the photography: the Eddie/Gwen relationship was a complete irrelevance as far as I could see, and therefore an unnecessary coincidence. Coincidences help stories lose credibility, and this had more than its fair share.<br/><br/>The soapiness irritated me, and I wanted to smack both Peter and Mary Jane for their emotional obtuseness (Peter has been failing to communicate with Mary Jane for 3 films now - is he ever going to learn? And clearly it's rubbing off on her).<br/><br/>The song and dance sequences were truly awful. Really, really badly misconceived.<br/><br/>There was no payoff to the Sandman arc.<br/><br/>Still enjoyed it, though!"
"bpscalin","9","4","5","12 May 2010"," Spider-man 3 support review
","I want to make a positive review for this movie. I have reading some of the reviews here and , for Christ sake, they are bad reviews!!! They seem to highly underrate this movie. <br/><br/>By most of the people (responsible for a 6 rating!!!) these are the flaws of the film:<br/><br/>-too many villains -crossing plots and subplots -cheesy humour(peter dancing) -too much Mary Jane and Peter Parker screen time -too less of Venom screen time/not the Venom we know from the comic books -worse music than the precedent installment -bad acting of Tobey and Kirsten<br/><br/>and bla bla bla.<br/><br/>Now, folks, let's all calm down for a moment.<br/><br/>I will take the points you have criticized one by one:<br/><br/>-too many villains: excuse me, have you seen X-men movies? The Magneto gang is always composed of at least 3 villains. The movie should have been 3 hours long to please everyone. You can't expect Sam Raimi to direct an all pleasing movie like The Golden Compass did and was weak because of that. He had chosen to develop interesting villains such as Green Goblin Jr. and Sandman. As for Venom, which I am a big fan, it's because of the fans that it was introduced and because Avi Arad sad so... Maybe a movie on Venom only deserves to be made, not a pointless reboot... <br/><br/>-crossing plots and subplots: for me it was a delight to see how Sam Raimi, which like playing with the audience and the actors, made a theatrical take on the conflicts. It is very refreshing and very rare these days to have a rich non linear script. Thanks to that, it was not predictable which is a good thing. All the actors were respected with a certain amount of screen time.<br/><br/>-cheesy humor(ex: peter dancing): give him a break! It was funnier than grotesque and many movies(comedies) can't even compare with the humorous tone of Spider-man 3! It was good comedy, perfect for Spider-man saga.<br/><br/>-too much Mary Jane and Peter Parker screen time: sorry, again but they are the most important characters in the movie!<br/><br/>-too less of Venom screen time/not the Venom we know from the comic books: Venom was forced as a character in this movie, so don't blame Raimi for giving him little screen time. <br/><br/>On the other side, indeed Venom should have been bigger in scale; saying that, Topher Grace did a perfect job in a movie that is made for a large audience: so, no gore or no ""traumatizing"" presence as in Comic books.<br/><br/>-worse music than the precedent installment: only with the black suit theme( Danny Elfman should never have left Spider-man 3...)<br/><br/>-bad acting of Tobey and Kirsten: it's like saying bad acting for Leonardo and Cate on Titanic: characters played by the perfectly matched actors.<br/><br/>Now, the good things:<br/><br/>I think the movie is marvelous, as a real Marvel film should be ;). It is the biggest and the most underrated super hero movie I know (but again, here Chronicles of Riddick gets only 6, where as it's one of the best sci-fi opera movies).<br/><br/>This movie stands on its own and is a darker, more complex, funnier and more action packed than the previous ones. Also, complex story means ""not pleasing everyone"". Let's not forget it's a comic book movie, so the 100 % logic approach don't do justice to it nor to it's magic.<br/><br/>Not have been nominated nor awarded with the Special effects Oscar is a real slap in the face to the SFX crew which worked on this movie.<br/><br/>The Sandman birth scene: the best and ""poetical"" special effects I have seen on a CGI character to date. I watched Avatar this year and it is still true. <br/><br/>The action and the mix with drama and humor make this movie an outstanding movie. the casting, the sets and the pacing were very good. The fights in the air were well choreographed, though I would have preferred a smoother take in the first Peter Parker fight (the same stunt coordinator from Jason Born Ultimatum, so...) <br/><br/>All the underrating is caused by the fact that some people take movies too seriously and seek a master piece in everything. It is a movie to enjoy, not to analyze. Go and see Elektra, Daredevil and Punisher if you think it's better! <br/><br/>The ""citezenkane review attitude"" (CRA ;) is a very common thing here.<br/><br/>You still believe Iron-Man is better? Well: not the second, because it lacked action, and let's face it, it is one of the main attraction in the Super-hero movies."
"KdNZ","Null","4","5","9 May 2007"," To Much in to little time...
","Worst Spiderman movie to date. To much in to little time. Acting was horrid, the whole Harry getting a bump on the head after all that crap he went thru now hes normal for o say 40 mins, then comes back towards end to help spidey, give me a freaking break. Rami really screwed up on this one. What should have happened...<br/><br/>After Spiderman 2 informs us that MJs fiancé, JJs son, has returned from space the symbiote should have been introduced this way, simple easy to understand and just like the comic. This landing out of nowhere next to Peter Parker then jumping on his bike is just horrible.<br/><br/>2nd- How Sandman was introduced was horrible, absolutely horrible, I don't even need to elaborate. Which was sad because I loved who they choose to play Sandman, and the possibilities with his daughter and everything could have been great. I think they should of introduced the concept of Venom towards the end and left it Spidey vs Sandman. Develop the story around Sandman more and use that waisted time with Harry having amnesia and develop that story as well.<br/><br/>3rd - Eddie Brock Jr.....horrible acting and character. If thats how your going to introduce Venom then develop the character so that its not some annoying babbling retard. Hes just not believable even by COMIC BOOK standards. Have him follow Spidey trying to get the shots of Spidey for who he is, have spidey start to begin to suffer the effects of the suit and become more brutal with villains and with civilians because of the suit. This in turns starts the rivalry with Brock Jr. and Parker. Say Spidey ends up killing or seriously hurting someone while trying to stop sandman, this is when Spidey realizes he needs to remove the suit. He gets the info from his Professor (this then sets up Spidey 4 so simple and beautiful i cant believe Rami didn't see it) who informs him thru tests sound waves seem to cause harm to the suit. Here is when Spidey goes to the church tower followed by Brock Jr. who now has been developed, given a personality and hopefully the acting has improved, and while removing it it falls onto Eddie Brock Jr. where he escapes not to be seen until final scene of movie...<br/><br/>4rd - have it be spidey vs Sandman vs Green Goblin, Sandman helps spidey at the end because in all hes really not a bad guy, Peter finds out he didn't mean to kill his father and helps him stop Harry who eventually dies just as his father does, by his own hands. Peter forgives Sandman and the Sandman helps Peter get MJ back. At Harrys funeral we see the distance between MJ and Peter as they leave we see Eddie Brock Jr with a villainous look in his eye as the symbiote suit shifts on his skin....end movie This could have then set up Spidey 4 to be Spidey vs Venom which needed much more development than what was given in spidey 3 and this would also allow The Lizard who is actually the professor in the comics to come into the fray. Its Venom and the symbiote that turn the one armed professor into the Lizard but he blames Spiderman for this and there we have Spidey 4.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 was on the same level as Daredevil for me. Was not even good, nor OK, but just plain horrible."
"FranklinTV","3","4","5","9 May 2007"," Wait till its out on video, and then only when its a weekly.
","I think its best in any review to try and be balanced, to weight up the pros and cons, to be constructive with any criticism, and to praise where appropriate. So, in that context, I would just like to say that Spiderman 3 was a total dog's breakfast, and advise you to see something else.<br/><br/>Its a rare cinema experience to see so many keen and eager people at the beginning of a film, with their chatting, fidgeting, laughing and excited expectations; and then to have these same people at the end of a film realising that, despite their best intentions, they have been completely let down, and so they simply quietly disperse.<br/><br/>It fails because one senses the producers are more concerned about the survival of the franchise and the drive-thru burger license than the credibility of the story. You realise early on its all going to be so safely, completely and nicely resolved that any plot development is really only a distraction, and you start to wish the audience could have a show of hands to fast-forward thru the dull convoluted middle bits for the obvious showdown at the end.<br/><br/>Its such a bland soulless CGI affair that you serious start thinking that even a cameo appearance by Jar Jar Binks would improve it (""Me's a tinking me Jar Jar senses are tinkling""). At least Jar Jar would be able to hand over the award for most stupid CGI creation, with ""The Monster from the Bag of Liquorice"" now being clearly the most ludicrous creation of all time.<br/><br/>Forgetting all the logical inconsistencies and incredibly remote coincidences in the story (and thankfully, 15 minutes after you leave the cinema, you find that you do), the biggest sadness with this film is that the three characters, who you invested some emotional commitment to in the first two films, fail to develop or grow in any meaningful way. They just have a series of set pieces seemingly designed by a committee that is only missing someone in the background holding up a sign saying ""They are Now Sad"", ""They are Now Happy"", ""They are Now Angry"", or ""They are Now Trying to Be Funny"". <br/><br/>It you do intend to watch this film, watch the first two first; because after seeing Spiderman 3, you will find the first two forever tainted, as you know now where its all going to head. Oh; and the praise. The Morwell Cinema in Victoria has assigned seating. Fantastic idea guys, I wish everyone would do this."
"georgeglz2002","10","21","40","6 May 2007"," People what's wrong with you.
","Wait a minute I thought this was a comic book movie. How come you people don't understand. This movie is supposed to be enjoyable. It's supposed to be fun. There's a lot of you that are not hardcore fans like myself but went to go see it anyways. The general public wants everything perfect. It is hard to deliver a good comic book movie because it derives from fiction and on to a movie. Haven't you realized that movies that come out of comics or video games have a greater challenge of pleasing the average person because of their fictional storyline. There are far worse movies that don't even come out of video games or comics that I would agree to criticize deeply. But this movie is entertaining although not the best of the trilogy but it is still good."

","Its not going to be another comment about how large complex projects have to be unimaginative for the simple reason of coordinating all the geographically dispersed teams working on bits that need to integrate. I've studied this in some detail in the film business. Its a mundane insight and I won't bore you with it.<br/><br/>Let's just say that of all the superhero movies, this one has the most possibilities for giving us exciting dimensional vision. ""King Kong"" did it, and I saw some titillating motions in another WETA project, ""Van Helsing."" And there was some promise in the last Spiderman's fight with Ock. And its not as if dull studios can't do dimensional: just watch that first chase in ""Casino Royale.""<br/><br/>But this is as pure a cinematic waste as I've experienced, so let's talk about why it fails and why it appears not to.<br/><br/>Film is a matter of assembly across different worlds. There's the central world of the embodiment anchored by the actors of course, and there's the world of the cinematic cosmos, how the world works and the eye we borrow behaves in it. On these two armatures are assembled all sorts of bits that each are placed individually but that we seldom see as bits. What we are meant to see is the overall organism, the being of the thing.<br/><br/>There are only two ways for this to emerge. Either you use convention or you rely on some coherent orchestration, usually from one mind. Here it is mere convention and why this is ordinary, even ordinarily ordinary. I've given up on Raimi, and so apparently have all his talented collaborators: Dykstra, Elfman the most obvious. He's the new Verhoeven.<br/><br/>He's interested in events and not circumstance. Snapshots (as is Jonah Jameson) instead of story; parts instead of assemblies. Its film-making 101, this, that real film is not about independent panels like a comic book. There's motion involved. That motion has to behave in accordance with and at the same time define and illustrate the world we see and the dynamics of how we see it. <br/><br/>Those rules of motion are negotiated over time between us and the filmmakers, and constitute an evolving vocabulary. What he have here is the cinematic equivalent of two hours or ""you know"" and other such automatic, meaningless utterances. Part of what we pay for is this game, and under normal circumstances the question we decide is whether we want sugar or meat. Here we get cardboard.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"headfulofghosts126","3","15","27","6 May 2007"," Third time's the harm
","It's really painful for me to write this review. I think the first half of Spider-Man is nearly perfect. I consider Spider-Man 2 one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. I could not have been more excited for part three. After reading all the early reviews I prepared myself for the fact that this might not be as good as the first sequel. But I had no idea I'd be this disappointed.<br/><br/>But let's start with what works. There are some genuine and amazing moments in this film. The first half is loaded with them. Peter's backstage visit with M.J. after her show, sharing ""their"" kiss with Gwen Stacy, his thwarted proposal attempt, J. Jonah's first scene, and the first battle with Harry... these sequences are as strong as the best moments from the earlier films.<br/><br/>But even when it's working it's clear very early on that all is not right this time out. There's too much being crammed into too small a running time. All three villains are handled fairly well... but each one deserved their own film. We get one scene of exposition with our soon to be Sandman and his daughter and then she's never heard from again. Venom (who's never even referred to by name) is essentially just a cameo. And the New Goblin, who has the best character arc in the film, is simply building off the momentum the first two started. The story is ludicrous. It's filled with too many contrivances, coincidences, and plot holes. It's a mish-mash of half baked ideas never allowed to reach their full potential.<br/><br/>The whole marketing campaign is built around Peter's descent into darkness and the whole black suit affair. This literally encompasses two or three scenes in the film. That's it. It would have been a solid subplot had Harry been the only villain. Lots of parallels could have been drawn. Instead, we hear Peter talk about having all this power and never see him use it. In fact, the culmination of this descent is a ridiculous dance sequence that belongs in another film. Not a Spider-Man movie. And Tobey Maguire just does not pull off the bad@$$ type at all. I don't know whose idea it was to make an emo Spider-Man but wow... emo is probably the least intimidating look on the planet. The audience actually laughed every time he showed up on screen with his silly new hairstyle and (*shudder*) eyeliner. There was no fear on the audience's part for what Peter was becoming. It was the worst kind of hilarious... the unintentional kind.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe the leaps in logic the film asked the viewer to make. A meteorite from space carrying a deadly symbiote happens to land right next to the only super-hero in New York City? Sandman just happens to be chased into a molecular testing ground? Eddie Brock actually goes to church to beg God to kill someone? Harry gets amnesia just so they don't have to deal with his revenge subplot for half the movie? And how on earth would the butler have ANY idea that Norman Osborn died at his own hand? And WHY WHY WHY did he not tell Harry the second he became obsessed with killing Spider-Man???? And so much is left unresolved by the film's end. What exactly was Harry's plan before he redeemed himself? What happens to Sandman? Or Gwen Stacy? Characters and entire subplots are just dropped without conclusion right before the climax.<br/><br/>Venom is clearly not Sam Raimi's villain. And it's obvious he was forced upon him and not included at the director's will. There's no slithering tongue, no referring to himself as ""we"", and no reason it should have been just Topher's voice coming out of this alien looking creature.<br/><br/>Aside from the script, my biggest complaints are with the cinematography and score. Not once does this film ever achieve the scope the second film had. That one was beautiful, vivid, and looked like a comic come to life. This one looks dreary, claustrophobic, and very drab. And while no one can one up Danny Elfman, Christopher Young could have at least tried a little harder. He plays the ""hero theme"" every time Spider-Man swings into the screen, whether it's appropriate or not. The cue that plays during Peter and Harry's second fight is laughably inappropriate, and why at the end when Peter & M.J. are mourning Harry does the soundtrack blare some heroic and oddly happy piece of music? It does the worst thing a score can do... it contrasts to what's actually happening on screen and calls attention to itself.<br/><br/>How did three years and $300 million translate to something that feels so rushed and cheap? Again, it's not all bad. But there aren't enough great moments to make up for all the terrible ones. When it faded out and the credits started to roll I honestly felt like this was Sam Raimi's way of saying ""I dare you to let me make another Spider-Man movie"".<br/><br/>I love Raimi. But it's clear it's time for this series to let some new blood step in. It feels like he's all tapped out and a little bored by all of this. The passion that infused every scene of the last film is sorely missing.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie. And it's actually painful for me to admit that."

","I've always been a Spider-man fan.. I got the comics when I was a kid (sold then later (bangs head against the wall)) and I've seen and bought the previous two movies. But after seeing this for the first time, my first impression is that I am not going to buy this one.<br/><br/>There is the obvious criticism about the black suit, of course, and how Peter gets it (don't worry, won't spoil it for you), but that's a detail, really, as the way he got it in the comics would take not just an entire movie, but a whole range of characters we haven't seen on screen before, so there is no way they could make that work. The solution they chose is fine, albeit somewhat unimaginative.<br/><br/>I've wondered why I felt disappointed when I left the theater. Part of my disappointment lies in the fact that apparently for Spider-man 3, better had to mean: more. More action, more enemies, more Bang. And I disagree with that. So much is dealt with in this episode, that nothing gets much depth. Or rather: it doesn't come together as a movie. There's no glue, and when the dust settles in the end, we're not left with much.<br/><br/>Another issue was credibility. At several points during the movie I shook my head in disbelief and asked myself: why does this happen? What's the motivation, the reasoning behind it? That question applied to the actions of at least 4 characters. Getting from A to B in a movie can be necessary, but do take some care as to how you pull it off! I'll go see it again, see if perhaps I'm just having a bad day. I mean: there's some good stuff in there as well, and the scene in the jazz club is awesome. There's enough for me to tell you you should probably go see this if you're a Spidey fan, but I didn't feel the spark.<br/><br/>For now: 6 out of 10 - I'm disappointed."
"pressdarlings","9","27","54","5 May 2007"," From a fan of the movies
","The Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>Oh, man...<br/><br/>I haven't had that much fun with a movie since I was a kid. Sam Raimi did an excellent job. Yes, it's flawed and rushed towards the end but this movie made me gain total belief in what was happening on screen; it made em laugh (dude, it's Sam Raimi - - it's gonna be campy as hell), it made me care, it held me in suspense and I almost cried (no kidding). I loved it. Never have I felt the need as this to go rush back in and watch a movie again after a first viewing. If you can just forget about the comic book template, lower your expectations, and just lose yourself to the great drama unfolding before you I think you can have a great time.<br/><br/>Plus Bruce Campbell's cameo was gold.<br/><br/>This was originally going to be shot back to back with a forth movie but no one could decide on the best possible cliffhanger. Were they nuts?! There's a perfect part to stop it at - - and afterwards that's where things get kinda shaky for a bit and then it redeems itself beautifully at the end.<br/><br/>This is what I would call a Grade-A popcorn movie to me. Not those soulless blockbusters Hollywood churns out every summer.<br/><br/>Then, again, this is just me. But I was really impressed. I mean, the audience and critics are severely mixed - - with the vast majority of folks hating it (you should have heard the comic geeks grumbling during the closing credits).<br/><br/>Will it reclaim its 300 million budget? One can only hope. But I highly doubt it unless people are willing to give a toss about the cinematic-version of these characters.<br/><br/>And I'll say this again...<br/><br/>I could not stop talking about the movie for hours after on end. Blew me away."

","Forget what you heard everyone say about it, forget the hype, forget Spiderman 1 and 2 ever existed, and just sit down and watch the show.<br/><br/>The hype is your own fault, anyway. Who the hell even care how much Venom YOU want to see in this movie? This is Sam Raimi's movie and he does NOT like Venom.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 had an excellent script, an excellent ensemble of characters that delivers an excellent, integrated central theme with a multitude of side plots to drill into. At the same time, it defies newton laws and laws of relativity as per usual and provides us with some of the greatest action sequences without seeing heads fall or limbs severed. OK, maybe sand limbs, but they're not real...<br/><br/>But apparently a lot of the viewers got perplexed. Things apparently have grown out of their scope of understanding and they don't like it. Funny, because an equally if not more confusing and complicated movie won best picture last year. What was that, oh, that was The Departed. Perhaps it's the lack of swearing in Spiderman that spelled its doom.<br/><br/>Or perhaps it's because people don't find REAL LIFE relationship issues, REAL LIFE quagmire of hatred and vengeance, all that interesting, or at all important to be shown on big screen. I beg to differ. I think Spiderman 3 has not only achieved to illustrate, in graphic colors, how severed a relationship can be with the slightest miscommunication, how quickly can a simple vengeance spiral out of proportion before the world is at stake, it has also delivered some of the best antidotes and cures, in the most simple, common words.<br/><br/>Unlike some other films that expose ugly social issues and walk away without cleaning up the mess. Spiderman is up close and personal and soldiers on. Unfortunately... it is too much ahead of its time, or perhaps any time."
"rugrad2005-1","10","14","25","5 May 2007"," Spider-man truly is ""Amazing""
","I saw this on opening day with a huge crowd of fellow Spidey fans. Some were adults were spider-man shirts, some women wearing Spider-man hats, a pre-movie contest from the theater staff, and of course, the little adorable munchkins with their die-hard Spider-man dolls and toys. The crowd was ecstatic and the feeling was that of a football game! I had chills! But on to the movie.... Folks it was nothing less than AMAZING! To me, it was worlds of a difference from Spider-man 2 and yet, it was still the same. If that doesn't make sense, then it will when you see the film. But what I mean by that is that you can still sense the same amount of passion and conflict between the characters. But it's different in that, Spider-man 2 (to me) seemed like such a bright, lighthearted, and glorious film especially at the end. Yet, this one seems to make the audience think ""well, the glory days of Spidey 2 are over, this is the real gritty part of life. It's not all sunshine and rainbows."" I'll give one non-spoiler example.... when tensions are high between Parker and MJ, Parker hears a police call from his scanner in his apartment. Parker turns to a depressed and upset MJ and says ""uh, go get em tiger?... OK just kidding..."" Kind of throws the whole glorious ending of Spidey 2 out the window. I felt there was a real sense of evil inside the ""black-suited Spidey"". I will admit there were some cheesy parts in it, but it only enhanced the story and really displayed Tobey Maguire's ability to pull some of these things off. I won't reveal any spoilers or give anything away for anyone but I will just tell you that the final fight scene had every single person, man, woman, and child in the theater standing up, clapping, and cheering. I haven't seen anything like that since I was at a football game! It was unbelievable! However, in the end, I guarantee there won't be a single dry eye. I'm not much of a crier but wow... what an ending. Now I have read countless reviews both professional and amateur. Most are very positive however I have to say that it does get a little bit old when people say that it was ""too much"", ""too cheesy"", or ""lacked character development."" Maybe there were too many villains, who knows, but in the end it will all fall into place. And yes it can get somewhat campy in certain scenes, but it never got too ridiculous to th point where it was in every minute of the movie. I think people can get obsessed with ""dark"" and ""gritty"" films and although this film is MUCH darker than it's predecessors, it's still somewhat uplifting in the very end. I would like to think that in such dark times that we live in, people would want to see movies that inspires them even if it's from a fictional superhero. Rather than something that makes you depressed and vengeful... All in all, a GREAT movie and the Best Spidey yet!"
"christool20","3","33","68","4 May 2007"," Seriously?
","That's how they're ending the Spider-Man series? The acting is poor. The writing is predictable and cheesy. The action, which the Spider-Man series has been so good at portraying, was jumpy and short-lived. I couldn't believe that the plot had to go in so many directions. It was a bit hard to follow at times and did not lend itself to character development. Although the same writers and directors were employed for this installment, it seemed like they were grasping at air. Take everything that you liked from the previous movies and make it completely over-done. They should have stuck to a single villain because there is not a lot of development of the Sandman character. It also suffers from the success and critical acclaim of the first two movies in that the movie tries to include every good thing but fails miserably in the amalgamation. The previews make it look great and totally appealing but you can really show an extremely lacking plot in a 30 second TV spot. Yes it will make a boatload of money but that can't overrule how utterly disappointing this first summer blockbuster is."
"steve-bailey-1","3","26","52","24 April 2007"," I cried, too -- at how badly the movie's makers botched it
","(SPOILER ALERT: If you really want the movie to surprise you -- and good luck there -- read only the first paragraph and the final three paragraphs of this review.) <br/><br/>After the glorious heights of ""Spider-Man 2"" -- probably the best comic-book movie ever -- the franchise succumbs to sequel-itis with the decidedly earthbound ""Spider-Man 3."" It's rare that a movie's opening credits make you dread what is to come, but this might be No. 3's only triumph. Behind the credits is a montage of highlights from the first two, far superior movies. Sappy ""Star Trek 3"" did the same thing. It's as if co-writer/director Sam Raimi was saying, ""My other movies were great, so cut me some slack for this new one, would you?"" Write it again, Sam.<br/><br/>Then we get some aw-shucks narration from Spidey/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), telling us how he's still in love with M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) and is still thriving in college. Then we're shown what a nerd Parker still is, as some idiotic classmates sit behind him using -- I can't believe I'm writing this -- pea-shooters on Peter. Do today's college students even have time for this kind of stuff? Most telling is what we might call the de-characterization of M.J. I suppose she was always just ""the girlfriend in peril"" (a la Superman's Lois Lane), but at least it wasn't so drearily obvious in the other movies. The same woman who ended ""S2"" declaring eternal love for Peter is now a self-centered drip, whining about Peter ""not considering her feelings"" and other psycho-babble.<br/><br/>The villains are flimsy, too. Peter's buddy-turned-foe Harry (James Franco) is so sketchily written, half the time he can't even remember whether he's Peter's enemy or not. The origins of the Sand Man (Thomas Haden Church) are sloughed off with a movie cliché: He became a crook only to raise money for his sickly daughter's operation (Awww!). And don't even get me started on Peter's job rival Eddie Brock (Topher Graceless, excuse me, Grace).<br/><br/>After that, Raimi tosses other sequels in the air and picks their worst elements off the floor. The villains are so weak on their own, they have to bond to fight Spider-Man (same as in ""Batman Forever""). Some alien goo lands on Spidey/Peter and makes him show his darker side (""Superman 3,"" been there, done that).<br/><br/>The special effects are snazzy, as always, even though Raimi has publicly claimed that he didn't have enough time to get them right. So that means he had time to hone the script and let that slide instead? And finally, a sop to fans of cult actor Bruce Campbell: As in the first two movies, his short but funny role here is probably the movie's comic highlight.<br/><br/>The message that this movie labors to shove down our throats is that each person has a choice and should make it properly. Here's my recommended choice for ""Spider-Man 3"": Wait for it on HBO."
"Travixius","8","32","66","23 April 2007"," Just saw it and........
","I just saw Spiderman 3 at a press screening in Adelaide and here's the deal... It is better than the first movie but not quite as good as the second. The major thing the movie suffers from (and many audience members agreed) is that for most of the 140 min running time Spidey is MIA!! I mean even when he is swinging around NY he has his mask ripped off or isn't even wearing his costume at all. It's a wonder the entire eastern seaboard doesn't know who Spidey really is. Sam Raimi has otherwise done a pretty good job of melding late 60's story elements from Amazing Spiderman comics to the Todd McFarlane era of the 80's. Venom was impressive and it didn't matter that small details such as costume design deviated from the what fans remember from the pages of Marvel. The saga of the black costume was threaded into the movie well, even if the only explanation we get for the symbiotes presence is that it simply came down in a meteor. A Spiderman acolyte I saw the movie with also mentioned that Sandman's part in the film was largely superfluous and his argument is valid, but when you see the digital work that accompanies his screen time you will be glad he's there, because it's pretty revolutionary. All in all a nice roundoff to the trilogy and let's hope if there ever is another movie that at least Toby Maguire and Kristin Dunst return because at this point they are cemented into their respective roles."
"Thrashman88","10","13","23","5 May 2007"," More dramatic but still a great third chapter
","I can't believe some of the comments I'm reading here. Surely they must come from pimple-ridden teenagers who were expecting a non-stop assault of special effects and fighting sequences. True, there's plenty of that in SPIDER MAN 3, but for once in my life I couldn't care less about the amazing special effects (top notch work here)because the story truly grabbed me. The conflict inside Peter Parker, the way he transforms into an egotistical maniac, was marvelous. I must confess, it was nice to see spidey taking on his enemies with a vengeful glee, though ultimately this was his undoing. What I really liked about SPIDER MAN 3 was the depth of character of the villains. Unlilke, say, Lex Luthor or The Joker (who are apparently evil since birth for no apparent or explained motive), the villains here end up who they are under very adverse circumstances, like Flint Marko (Sandman). You can't help but to feel sorry for him and this type of villain development is sorely missing in other so called ""action hero"" movies. Like Dr.Doom of the FANTASTIC 4: he appears to be evil over some really meaningless reason that doesn't hold any water!<br/><br/>If there's one complaint I have about the whole movie, it doesn't deal with the story nor the acting nor the superb special FX: it's about the music. Danny Elfman, who's made countless of memorable scores (BATMAN, SIMPSONS), he just can't seem to make a truly memorable score for the SPIDER MAN franchise. Forget the grandiose score of a SUPERMAN, or STAR WARS, or even his fabulous BATMAN score. The music, while still great, is far from memorable.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has treated the SPIDER MAN movies with respect and you can see there's a work of love involved. If some of you out there prefer the ""other"" mindless action hero movies out there, be my guest. For my money, I truly enjoyed the the 2 hours plus ride of SPIDER MAN 3! 10* out of 10*!"

","I had high expectations and was utterly, utterly disappointed. The 2 hours or so that this movie took to play out in front of me felt like an unbearable 3 or 4! Yes the effects were amazing, but that's pretty much where it ends. Every plot point was too convenient, from explaining the back-story of the Sandman to Harry's emotional turn-around. Most of the audience I saw it with was laughing at the supposed 'dramatic' scenes. Too much time and money were spent on effects, when what it needed most was another year or so of script development. I rate it 3 out of 10! The 3 points given only because of the high point of the film - a random cameo that felt like it was tacked on at the last minute! Come on Sony, Spiderman deserves better."

","I really don't understand why people are calling this movie a huge disappointment. Sure it has lots of drama in i but thats what makes it good, and what shows the battle within. Another thing I don't get is why people are complaining about there being to many villains, there were multiple villains in the comics but nobody cared. Just remember that this is AN AWESOME MOVIE, but Venom did get robbed of his screen time. They definitely picked the right guy to play Eddie Brock, and as soon as the sandman put on his green shirt, it was like taking a stroll down memory lane. The ending was one of the few endings that I was actually close to tears, it just portrayed it soooooo well."

","As an actor I feel it hard when I hear about people downloading movies. Yet for this flick I would say it is worth saving your money, hopefully it will keep movie makers accountable from making awful movies. Professors around the globe will normally tell you in theater to not go for the joke. This movie does this to many times to count. Taking things that worked in the previous 2 movies and tried it again just to milk it. Sadly when you are paying someone a million dollars to come up with a script you should expect some originality. Like does Harry really have to die the same way as his father, and MJ fall for Harry much like she fell Peter, do New Yorkers really run away most of the time but in final fight scenes they stay around to watch and kinda help (Yeah I got they had pride after the first one...now make them real, Ibsen would be ashamed). <br/><br/>And it is great the way it didn't explain peters fall to the dark side, I have been dumped, it sucks, get over it without killing your best friend, unless maybe he tries to kill you first. <br/><br/>Yes Harry was the most interesting part of this story. Creating Parkers fall to the dark side and his turn to the right side in the end, which is actually obvious during the first of 4 lacking action scenes of the entire movie. It is heart warming though.<br/><br/>Sadly though the other 2 villains are awful. Venom is a whinny young man who lost a job which he cheated to get, then lost his girlfriend to a superhero. Sandman actually has a heart and no backbone when he is convinced to kill hundreds of cops by Venom simply asking him to. (side note: where did Venom get the info about sand man anyway...did he google it). Especially from a man who felt so bad about killing Ben Parker, ridicules. Speaking of Ben, I am pretty sure he died in the first movie, so why not give him a cameo in this one, we will just dye his hair gray and think no one will notice when he quotes a line from Spiderman 1.<br/><br/>All in all these writers have come up with a brutal trilogy. If I were to rank bad trilogies this wold be really close if not at the bottom. If you are wondering what else is down there I can tell you: Sniper 3, TMNT 3, Land Before Time 3, Three ninjas kick back, Karate Kid 3, Batman & Robin, D3. <br/><br/>Sorry but I cannot call rapid dying spidy hair a good special effect..."

I have seen better writing in Power Ranger episodes. This User Comment is not to spoil, but to warn. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE! Do not go see it in the theater, do not rent it later, and surely don't buy it.

Nothing makes sense, everything is so absurd, I guess they tried to put everything in the movie, and it ended up with no logic at all, everything is forced. The sandman transformation is so poorly shown. Why did Peter kiss Gwen Stacy out of the blue in front of everybody while thinking about proposing? Just to force a love drama that shouldn't be there in the first place. Why did the butler finally explain to Harry that his father killed himself, and not spider-man, at the end of the movie. Why didn't he do it before? And the way he said it, my god, ""ohh yeah, by the way, your father killed himself (sorry I didn't tell you while you were planning to kill Spder-Man throughout two movies)"". And I just couldn't stop laughing when Peter tells the sandman ""I forgive you"". That was just an absurd melodramatic scene. And I just won't talk about Peter's transformation, dancing in the streets with his new revel teenage look? Ajhhhhh, yak!!

""Spider-Man 3"" is the best in the film trilogy right now! It's the most emotionally gripping.

Putting aside all the cheezy graphics that this film brings and what could be the worst performance of Tobey Maguire's career one major thing is missing from this movie...a good director. Sam Raimi has massacred the whole venom plot line of Spiderman. Venom in the comic book makes Peter Parker evil, but in the film he just seems, for lack of a better word, goofy. The whole sequence where Spiderman is taken over by venom, where he apparently turns emo, is absurd. He turns pure evil, even going so far as to dance with another woman in from of Mary Jane.

I pray to God they don't make a 4th installment. I loved 1 and 2, but 3 was a major disappointment.

This sequel was even worse than the first movie, which is more of a shame if you have heard about some 250 Million spent on it. Spent on WHAT?! Is the bridge in Central Park, or the shabby room of Parker that dear? Because most of the time the characters are set in such locations, doing nothing really but saying clichés. Venom barely scratches the ballet-dancing outfit on Spidey, and mind you, by that time you have a good chance of missing that, as you might be looking around to see other folks' embarrassment. The Sand Giant is laughable too, after King Kong anyway. Well, back to the ballet-outfit for a sec: it actually fits Parker as interpreted by Tobey Maguire, who looks like someone with no hundred percent certainty about his sexual preferences. Just take that walking on the street, Disco Stu-style, than the lashing hair as means of express aggression or whatever...With all respect; that's nothing like the character we know from the books.

Between a complete lack of character development and plot that jump between too many stories the movie was just all over the place. It is unbelievable that with material already written that has lasted the test of time for almost fifty years that something so bad could be turned out. But between too many not so good lookin fight scenes that looked fake and were not well choreographed and awful performances from Maguire, Franco, Dunst, and especially Thomas Hayden Church, who proved to the world why after Wings he was out of a work so long, this movie was a complete disaster.

","(My Synopsis) Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is transformed when an alien substance from outer-space bonds to his Spiderman suit and turns it jet-black. This new suit enhances Spiderman's powers and gives him the feeling of confidence and a new attitude. The only problem is that the new suit feeds on evil thoughts and brings out the dark side of Spiderman and makes him aggressive and feel conceited about how great he is as a superhero. Spiderman begins to neglect Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and other friends, and he must choose between the enticing evil power of the suit or the good old Spiderman. Peter must overcome this internal conflict while fighting the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) with super powers that match Spiderman's unique powers.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The storyline brings out different emotions of each character and takes us down the road of more than just fighting villains, but gives us the feeling of caring about the characters. The established characters have matured, and we can feel for them. The film has comedy, emotions, and of course action between good and evil. What else do you need in a movie? We get to see the darker side of Spiderman and the fun side as well. Spiderman has two brand new enemies to fight and the special effects are spectacular. For a long movie, time does fly and the movie is over before you know it. Church's performance as the Sandman was excellent. The movie has funny moments and sad moments where you may even shed a tear. Please, don't over analyze the story or compare it to the first two as some people are doing, because the film was meant to entertain the audience, and it does. Sit back and enjoy the thrilling action packed sequences of Spiderman 3. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 2:20, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"

"Lionheart490","7","5","7","21 November 2010"," Just because it's the worst of the series, doesn't mean it's a bad film
","Episode #2 of Lionheart490's IMDb Movie Reviews<br/><br/>I rarely go into theaters to actually see a movie, and when I do I want the movie to be great, I remember watching X2 while I was at infant age and I will always remember the day I went into theaters to see the end to the Spiderman trilogy, Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie on the big screen, I though it was a great summer blockbuster, yet if you compared it to Spiderman and Spiderman 2, it is considered the worst. But It isn't a bad film.<br/><br/>So people complained that the movie had too many plots going at once, but I relieved that all of these plots have something in common (excluding Peter-go-emo) they all involve revenge. Peter wants revenge on Sandman for killing Uncle Ben, Harry wanting revenge on Peter for killing his father, and Eddy wanting revenge of Peter for getting him fired, it is all escalates to an amazing finale. Also, the special effects were amazing for the symbiote and the Sandman, they were really realistic, you seriously believed a man was made of sand. Also, J. Jonah Jameson supplies some of the comic relief scenes that made be crack up.<br/><br/>Now, this movie isn't perfect either because I didn't think that Topher Grace make a good Eddie Brock and didn't to me make a good Venom, maybe its just the physical appearance. I also really hated the Spidey-go-emo scene, they could have shown that the symbiote was controlling him in a less stupid way. Also, I hate how Peter and Mary Jane don't get together in the end and don't get married, the whole subplot of marriage was a giant waste. Speaking of Venom, many fans were saying that Venom didn't get enough screen time, but I thought that he had enough to get what he was there for. Overall, this is the worst of the series, but it is an amazing blockbuster. For what it is, I give it a 7/10."
"wvanderheiden","4","5","7","10 June 2007"," Could have been way better
","Why why why aren't they making movies like Batman Begins anymore...<br/><br/>In Spider-Man 3 almost everything happens without a reason and explanation. The black fluid that drops out of the sky in the park ? Where did it came from ? What is it ? Why did it drop on earth ? The criminal escapes to some facility where they are working with strange machines on the sand so that this guy becomes the sandman. What are they doing at that facility ? What do they want to get as a result ? Venom. A pretty cool character but in the movie they never call it Venom. It just has no name in the movie.<br/><br/>Alter-ego: When Peter Parker feels good he dances on the street and doing macho-things. If he's doing this in real life, it's his choice, but why put this stupid scene in the movie, it has no use at all.<br/><br/>So, after all this said, I really think they made 2 movies of Spiderman 3 where they add more depth to the story so that it just won't feel as a cheap entertainment movie.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is a lovely girl. But when she visits Harry and they go dancing on the song 'Twist' or whatever it's called I am wondering what the producer wants to say with this scene. It's not what I want to see when I go to the cinema for Spider-Man 3. I want to see him fighting tugs with a story. Not just 2 enemies with no story (not in the movie) It's just too bad. It could have been so much more."
"gonzooo","4","5","7","6 June 2007"," Not nearly as good as it could have been!
","I'm a huge fan of the first two Spiderman movies, unfortunately this one did absolutely nothing for me. The story was confusing and had many holes, and there was an outrageous number of useless scenes that gave me the feeling that a good chunk of the movie was just filler scenes, and the acting, especially Toby Mcquires was brutal. There were, of course, some very entertaining action sequences, that most people will enjoy regardless of the otherwise lame storyline. But for the most part it left me sracthing my head in disbelief that a movie with such potential turned out to be such a flop (much like Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End)"
"spark-trap","4","5","7","6 June 2007"," Are you kidding me?!
","I wanted to like this film, but I didn't. It is extremely shallow and disjointed. Here are just a few examples without spoiling anything:<br/><br/>1. Peter and MJ's non-reaction to the thing that happens near them close to the beginning of the film. 2. Eddie Brock's attitude and line to Captain Stacy after the ""incident."" 3. The Butler. THE BUTLER!!!!!<br/><br/>The dialog is atrocious. The action sequences are pretty good. I wish someone had given me the time codes for when the action sequences occur and I would have sat in the hallway until the times came up. I felt embarrassed for Topher Grace. I think he succeeded in making the best out of an extremely poorly written role. James Cromwell. Tobey did fine, but the director needs to remember that less (weeping) is more. (Future directors of Claire Danes, I'm talking to you.) Some of the emotion that Tobey was forced to create from thin air (due to the lousy script) also made me feel embarrassed for him. I fear that some of the odd choices he appeared to make were actually the fault of the editor or director, because several times I found myself asking, ""Why did his eyes just widen like crazy? Why is he making that face?"" James Franco did fine with poorly written dialog. Kirsten Dunst obviously knows where a body is buried. She emits zero honest emotion in her performance. I defy you to watch a scene from the first movie with your hand over her eyes and then distinguish any difference in the emotional output of her face. I WANT to like her. It's as if she's never gotten out of the line delivery from ""Interview with a Vampire."" Also, I'm sick of movies preaching to me. Desiring justice and being filled with revenge are NOT the same thing. Reacting to a violent attack with violence does not ALWAYS make the attacker and victim equally guilty of wrongdoing. Did you notice ""James Cromwell"" earlier in this paragraph? ""Why was he stuck in there?"" you might ask yourself. That's the same question you'll ask if you see this movie; such is the case with many poorly executed character arcs. Thank God for J.K. Simmons. The audience I saw this film with seemed relieved and appreciative to finally be hearing some good line delivery. Thanks J.K! Bruce Campbell also did a good job. Other comedy in Spider-man 3 feels so contrived that it cheapens the entire film. I'm not saying it's not funny, but...well, you'll see. You'll see when you no doubt pay to go see this film and you, like me, will probably have to look at your shoes during the scenes with some of the worst dialog since Jar Jar Binks."

","This is what happens when a terrible director gets unlimited control on a big budget film. It becomes bloated, with a plot that's only a tiny bit more interesting than watching grass grow. After watching this movie, I have to wonder...why was it even made? Have we gotten to the point where a movie can be created with the same mentality as a TV show created to round out a season? Did they create this one just so they could release some sort of Spiderman title for '07? Yes. This movie was recycled from the previous 2 movies with worse acting, musical composition, editing...everything. All in a longer package. Great. Save your money, buy the DVD if you must, and fast forward through the boring filler. In fact, just skip to the end, and don't watch how the Sandman story resolves itself. Simply terrible. On the plus side, I suppose the air conditioning didn't die during the agonizing 140 minutes. Great."
"Rathko","6","5","7","7 May 2007"," Very Disappointing
","'Spiderman' was clearly conceived from the beginning as a story about Peter, Mary Jane and Harry. Whether you want to see it as a love triangle, or a retelling of ancient mythologies concerning revenge, betrayal and the ghosts of father figures, these three characters were introduced in the first movie's opening scenes, and it their dynamic that has driven the narrative ever sinceuntil now.<br/><br/>While 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad movie, it is nowhere near as good as it should have been and fails to satisfy for the simple reason that Sam Raimi forgot what these movies were about. For the first movie, Raimi had the writing talents of David Koepp, one of the most successful screenwriters around. For the sequel, Pulitzer Prize winning Michael Chabon contributed to a screenplay written by the Oscar-winning Alvin Sargent. For the third installment, Raimi makes the all too common mistake of developing delusions of grandeur and feeling that he can take over the writing duties himself. Though Sargent is credited as a co-writer, it's clear from the mess of a screenplay that his input was limited. Raimi's screenplay forgets everything that the two previous movies stood for and were clearly moving towards, and abandon all dramatic consistency and cohesive storytelling in favor of redundant characters supplying equally redundant CGI set-pieces.<br/><br/>'Spiderman 3' feels as though it was made by different people with a different vision. The emotional drama between Peter and Mary Jane, so carefully built over the last few years, becomes illogical soap opera theatrics. Harry becomes a leering painter of Impressionist masterpieces. Peter starts crying all the time and develops a 'Saturday Night Fever' obsession. Sandman is completely redundant, receiving no character development and vanishing as inexplicably as he arrived. Similarly, Eddie Brock serves absolutely no purpose in the movie other than to become Venom in the final scenes. Very little of New York or its citizens are involved in the story, which is claustrophobically self contained  there are barely two scenes in the newsroom and the citizens of New York rarely seem to be in real peril.<br/><br/>Again, it needs saying that 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad film, but it does nothing to close out the trilogy or provide anything close to satisfying emotional or dramatic closure, the fault for which can only be laid, unfortunately, on Sam Raimi."

","I must recognize something, I had no expectations at all when I went to the theater. I knew it was gonna be crap... but that much? The second movie is Citizen Kane compared to this, and the second was crappy too.<br/><br/>My definition of this movie: Johnny Bravo puts the Jim Carrey's mask, gets into Peter Parker body and pretends to be John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, with the script of the worst soap opera. I don't even know where to start.<br/><br/>The excessive emotive scenes, I haven't seen such a wuss superhero, the crying, for god's sake. The dancing, 45 minutes of Peter Parker dancing disco, maybe justified by the fact that the symbiote was similar to another found in the 70's (WTF???). The jazz club. The microscopic view of the symbiote cell ""bullying"" the other cells. The pedantic Peter Parker. The acting of ""rude"" Peter Parker was awful. The characters of Gwen and his father (what have James Cromwell done to deserve this?).<br/><br/>How many things am I forgetting? The horror, the horror. What does Hollywood need to make a barely good adaptation of a superhero saga? Batman Begins is the last one, and the only one since... the first Blade? Burton's Batman?

It may be enough for all of you fans to see your hero on the screen to overlook what a complete idiot this guy is. I have not liked a single movie these people have made and I really liked the character/ story lines prior to seeing the movies. Spidey is supposed to be a wise-crackin' guy that, granted, has girl problems, but isn't a doofus.<br/><br/>On to the movie...so now they take the best story lines from the comic books and ruin them. The Venom/Carnage stories are great but they don't develop them and now Venom is dead?!! Great job, idiots. My only hope is that they are killing the series and that was a way to put this whole thing to bed.<br/><br/>Finally, how farcical do they need to be with this movie. So, now the symbiote gives Parker piano-playing abilities?! This movie is overly laughable and should only appeal to little kids, chicks that somehow like Toby, or people that have too much time on their hands. Great job!"
"sef_payne","10","9","15","9 May 2007"," This movie is incredible, why the criticism??!!??
","First of all, this movie lived up to, and possibly exceeded all the expectations I had of it. It had amazing special effects, a very nice story, and very effective, true to source material villains. Now when i looked on IMDb, i found a barrage of criticism's from the viewers. why oh why do you hate this movie so?<br/><br/>Lets begin with the story. Although not as centralized, or as concentrated as the first two movies, it still is every bit as engrossing and real. I can understand one criticism most people had, which was the lack of character development, especially on the villains. Spiderman 2, you see Doctor Octavius fleshed out to the very core until he becomes the inevitable 'Dok Ock'. Not only that, it brought in a great deal of psychology from peter parkers perspective. Spiderman 3 however, does not attempt to meet any of these. The characters are briefly introduced, and peter parker is already fully established. Don't be fooled though. This does not make it a bad story, its simply a flawed story.<br/><br/>The symbiote which just so happened to be from a comet that dropped in from outer pace was really disappointing. In the comic books, J Jonah Jamerson's son rockets into space with a team of astronauts in which they find this symbiote. Now did you see that in the film? no you didn't!! Hence another reason for its criticism. Once again I shall say, this small error in screenplay does not make the entire feature film a disgrace to the spider-man universe. It is only flawed.<br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing wrong with the special effects. They were probably the highlight of the film. well spending around 250-300 million solely on this would undoubtedly be eye popping. The sound would also be on par with the effects. Not once during the entire film was the sound out of place. Each character has there own individual music, and so does each mood. Then again, you cannot make a good film without good music. :)<br/><br/>Casting was really good. Tobey Maguire has really put himself up there with this one. When the symbiote takes over him, he turns into this bad ass, womanizing jerk. But it is awesome. You have to see it to enjoy it. James Franco who plays harry Osborn really shows his evil colors in this one. One particular moment was in the café. Just then were peter parker turns his head in shame over Harrys disappointment to him for taking Mary Jane, you see Harry smile in this smirk, yet dark and sinister way that makes you feel intrigued on the events to come. The fight soon after pits the two evils of Peter parker and Harry Osborn against each other. Very memorable. J Jonah Jamerson is really funny in this movie. You would expect so, seeing as he was a joy in the first and second films. You will not be disappointed there.<br/><br/>All in all this is an ideal spider-man sequel, and those of you who disagree with me because of your picky little minds, just remember, a small pitfall DOES NOT damage the entire film. It plain and simply becomes a minor flaw to look past and forget.<br/><br/>Story - 8 Special effects - 10 Sound - 10 Casting - 9 Fun factor - 10<br/><br/>Overall - 9/10"
"lshastings","1","9","15","8 May 2007"," Following Batman's decline apparently
","I have to tell you I am a sci-fi geek and a comic book geek. Its pretty hard to ruin one of these movies, and yet this one was ridiculously gluttonous and completely left the Spiderman formula, that was working, behind.<br/><br/>Let me start with the positive. The special effects were top rate. When you compare the special effects from Spidey 3 to Spidey 1 there is quite a leap. Sandman was just incredible to watch when he was on screen, though note to directors, lets chill on the Thomas Haden Church close ups, I wanted to hand him some lip balm and face moisturizer! Venom was a little more cartoony, where Sandman was just visually cool. So the special effects team, top marks.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, look its 140 minutes I will never have back. Peter Parker sings and dances in a jazz club for crying out loud. We have to endure Kirsten Dunst singing. We have to endure the introduction and set up of Flint Marko (Sandman, Eddie Brock (Venom), and Gwen Stacy. The only one I felt was handled appropriately was Gwen Stacy, and thats only because she was a lesser character therefore she didn't really require as much. And and the vengeful Harry Osborne (New Green Goblin?)into the mix and you have a movie that is very reminiscent of the god awful ""Batman and Robin"" with all those cast of characters they seemed to try to ram down your throat. ENOUGH.<br/><br/>As a result of this decision to inundate us with new characters, and still try to intertwine the troubled love story between Peter and MJ (I just don't care about by the way), the movie over reached. It couldn't pull it all together. What is needed is to go back to the one villain format with the angst of life on this. We attach ourselves to the problems of Peter's personal life. But you can't properly take care of that aspect with an interesting angle on his personal life AND properly take care of the real thing everyone came to see. Spiderman fighting the bad guy."

","I really don't know what to say. I waited for a long time to see this movie and what the movie brought back to me was a forever big huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I couldn't see anything surprise in the movie. Everything seems to be a messy mixture of cheap action and drama films. Firstly, every scene was badly made, they meant nothing together. It was impossible for me to find even a small reasonable connection between them. In other words, this movie meant about nothing but a bunch of ... What a poor script! Second, every character seems to be normalized horribly. No one of them even have a individual personality and they act like they're all out of mind. Yeah, this is really supportive and suitable for a amazing bad script.<br/><br/>Every good movie must has something something to differentiate itself from others and to make audiences remember about. However, Spider-man 3 completely and absolutely failed about that."

I would recommend that anybody who wants to see this should wait for DVD. Aside from CG effects (some of which look fake anyway), the film is quite empty. There are too many villains, first of all. B/c of the number, they end up being half-developed and lacking character. There's inconsistency as to why there's even a meltdown in MJ's and Peter's relationship.

","When I first got in the cinema I was expecting something truly amazing and to be honest at first i was a little disappointed because I felt that everything was happening too quickly, but then by the middle of the film everything seemed to fall into place and i began to really enjoy it.<br/><br/>The bit when we see Peter as a different person when he has the new suit was absolutely hilarious in my opinion and made the film worth watching for that bit alone.<br/><br/>For anyone who had any queries about having another goblin in the films, then let me reassure you, Harry was like a whole new character when he was in the suit and when he wasn't. He also surpassed the first Green Goblin in my opinion. James Franco really stepped up his game again for this film and to me he was the best actor involved.<br/><br/>Venom was brilliant to watch although he did only have a short time on screen, however i'm not sure we've seen the last of him (and I was one of the people saying he wouldn't be back). Sandman was just as good as I was hoping and overall it was a fun film to watch.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the first two then I doubt that you'll like this one but if you did then you'll love it because it holds all of the same characteristics that we have come to expect from a Spider-Man film.<br/><br/>Most of the plots were closed by the end of the film and I will say this last thing.

I felt like a movie that costs around 215 million dollars to make, would be a f*ing good movie. This was definitely not the case.

"MinorityReporter","6","18","35","5 May 2007"," Spider-Man takes a Venomous turn!
","First of all, this was a very entertaining movie. Not without its problems but surely this is quite definitely the popcorn entertainment movie of the year. Upon immediate completion of the movie I was torn because I was aware that what I had just watched was indeed a great entertainment movie but I was ever so slightly disappointed because of the inevitable comparison to the second movie of the series which remains the best of the bunch by far. <br/><br/>First lets start with the acting. Tobey Maguire is quite clearly having fun with the character this time around. He gets to delve a little more with Peter Parker's negative sides. We see a more confident (bordering on complacent) Peter Parker and Maguire suits this change in the character. Maguire gives great credibility to the character despite some very foul overacting when Peter turns 'bad'. However, Maguire still looks and sounds incredibly like Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst does a rehash of the character from the first two movies. J.K. Simmons is as always hilarious and all the scenes with him are loaded with charm and humor and he truly steals every scene he is in. James Franco returns as Harry Osborn and this movie is truly his swan-song. He produces the greatest acting I have seen from him yet and he makes his character truly interesting to watch and his personal enigmas are at the very least as interesting as Parker's. Thomas Haden Church is one of the new additions to the cast. He is Sandman a lowly thug who by mere chance gets powers that make him almost unbeatable. Unfortunately he doesn't get that much character to work with and Sandman becomes just a reason to show off some admittedly awesome special effects. He only shows his talent by the very end of the movie (you'll know when you see it). Topher Grace gets the honor of playing the arguably most beloved villain in the entire Marvel universe, Venom and surprisingly he's very good. I was a little worried when I heard he had been hired to play Venom because of his history of comedic parts but he turns out to have dramatic flair as well. I have to admire Sam Raimi's guts for hiring such a new name for the part. Grace works hard and it shows. Eddie Brock Jr. becomes a very likable character and that is almost to his credit alone. <br/><br/>Story wise the film is solid if a bit uneven. The pace is like in the previous movies well structured and there are very few slow points. The films primary strength is the central conflict with Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn because this part is very well told and filled with tension and emotion. The dialog is like in the previous movies not always completely believable but that hardly matters taking the source material into consideration. The new characters are introduced well enough if a bit hastily and this is the films primary flaw. There are simply too many characters to keep track of and unfortunately this means we do not get nearly as much of Venom and Sandman as we should have. And since we are on the subject of villains I should say that Venom is every bit as menacing as he should be. He proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man and that is the way it was in the comics so kudos to Mr. Raimi for that. However, my primary grudge with the entire movie is that Venom simply isn't enough in it. Had it been up to me I would have split the movie in two. By that we would have gotten more screen time for Sandman who would then have become a much better villain. Also it would have given us the opportunity to get Venom as a primary villain in a possible fourth movie. <br/><br/>Effects wise the movie is of course breath taking. We see some of the most spectacular action sequences ever committed to celluloid and taking the film's budget into account that is hardly surprising. The action and effects in the previous movies were spectacular but in this one they go completely over the top and I for one enjoy this development. It somehow brings the movie closer to the source material and I have always claimed that this is what the series needed to do to attract the hard core fans. The end sequence is simply stunning and indeed a very worthy finale. Comparing the effects to the other big summer movie event, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, I would say that Spider-Man comes out on top as the effects are nothing short of groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Christopher Young was chosen to compose a score instead of Danny Elfman after Elfman and Sam Raimi had a falling out at some point while making the score for the second film and while he did produce a decent score it is by no means memorable like the scores from the previous movies. However, credit must be given where credit is due for Danny Elfman casts quite a shadow and the score is adequately bombastic and grand for a super hero movie of this kind of scale.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is a great summer movie but try not to judge it by the standards set by the second movie because it does not add up. All in all, however, Spider-Man 3 is a fantastic movie loaded with special effects and a good story. I know that the Spider-Man movies have generated a lot of money and there will in all probability be a fourth Spider-Man movie and I for one welcome the prospect because I believe that there are a lot more stories from the Spider-Man universe that deserves a chance to be seen on the big screen. I do hope, however, that in the fourth movie they try to simplify the story somewhat.<br/><br/>8/10"

"europsycho","1","8","13","7 May 2007"," Long-time fans of Spidey or fans of competent storytelling should avoid this one!
","It appears painfully obvious that Sam Raimi is not as good a writer as he is a director. The writing for this film is beyond mediocre and insults my intelligence as a film and comic book aficionado. All of the characters in Spider-man 3 do not interact as normal human beings would in real life. This hurts the emotional connection you're supposed to make with Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. This stems from someone who does not understand how to write real characters into a script. These are not the same characters who I loved watching in the first two films, these are imposters. It seems even the actors know they are in a bad film because they give a boring and dishonest performance. One of the reasons people go to see a Spider-man film is because of the creative villains. In Spider-man 3 both the Sandman and Venom get cheated out of screen time to serve the purpose of continuing the badly written love triangle between the main characters. The only time I smiled and was mildly interested was when Aunt May gave Peter advice or when J.J. was doing his comedic part. Sadly they get very little screen time as well.<br/><br/>I think Spider-man 3 was ironically the end of Spider-man for all the die-hard fans that turned up for the superior Spider-man 1 and 2."
"senglish_01","1","8","13","7 May 2007"," Painful
","I never expected this movie to be Oscar worthy but i did expect it to be watchable but i was so wrong, it was actually painful to watch! I have always been a fan of Dunst but her acting in this was simply shocking she had the emotion of a dead dog and her and Maguire had absolutely no chemistry whats so ever although Maguire's acting was stand able the movie itself was weak had no really plot it could not keep to a single storyline and the ending was predictable, if i could change time and not watch this movie i would do it in a second it was not worth the cinema fee, i would never recommend this film it isn't worth getting out of the chair for."
"digter_lars","3","38","83","4 May 2007"," What... Where.. And why did that just happen???
","I'm a great spider-fan, and both of the first 2 movies made my must-see-list, but the 3. just lacks a natural flow.<br/><br/>It could appear like Sam Raimi did every thing right. More villains than the first two combined, SF that are breath taking and the spider get a new cool suit. Sadly it seems that despite the much larger budget than the first two, that the money came right out of the fund for the script. This is apparent in the ending or should I say endings. The script is so weak that it takes three fade-outs to tie up the most of the storyline and still you feel like something is missing, but luckily at this point in the movie, you have already stopped paying attention to the storyline. <br/><br/>What ( I believe) is the problem with the storyline, is not, that it is all that bad but someone got something wrong, and wrote a movie that was supposed to be an hour longer. Then higher up someone said ""hmm we've already spent too much money on SF let just cut out all the cool parts and epic scenes, and make a movie out of those."" The end product became a movie that never builds any suspense and the web that holds the plot together is so weak, that the motives of both the heroes and the villains feels unreal, You never feel any empathy with any of them, with the two first movies really had going for them.<br/><br/>The only thing left to comment is the characters. Mary Jane has suddenly completely changed from being a sweet, fresh, smiling girl, that is vibrant and always in touch with life, to something quit the opposite. In this movie she is weak, repressed and just depressing to watch. Peter Parker on the other hand changes his personality several times i the movie, signified by a different hairstyle and a bit of eyeliner (real subtle). This could have been cool but it just looks like a bad The Mask impersonation and make Parkers meeting with the dark side look like a joke."
"aeo","1","14","26","7 May 2007"," A big disappointment.
","I am a fan of Spiderman comic book. I have been collecting them since I was a young child. I know the origins of Peter Parker, how he became Spiderman, the origins of Sandman and his interaction with Spidey, and etc.<br/><br/>That being said, I know you have to change the story when you adapt a book/comic book for movie purpose. I get that but I don't think they did it well. On top of that, the movie had just too many things going on. Due to this, the movie could not sufficiently delve deeper into a particular story line, even though the movie was over 2 hours. The movie just glossed over major characters or conflicts leaving the viewer, or at least me, less than satisfied.<br/><br/>First of all, I cannot stand seeing Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. This just annoys greatly. If you are a Spiderman comic book collector like myself, you know that Mary Jane Watson was gorgeous. She was a supermodel and therefore, very beautiful. Dunst is cute but she is no supermodel. I don't know who picked her for this role, but as I said before in Spiderman 1 and 2, she should have been replaced. Hopefully she will be gone for Spiderman 4.<br/><br/>Tobey Macguire is OK. He would not have been my first choice for Peter Parker role but he grew on me.<br/><br/>In this movie, these are the things that were covered (the movie did not cover these things in this order): Petey's (Peter Parker) problems include finding out Sandman is the real killer of his uncle, he wants to propose to MJ (MaryJane Watson) but ultimately does not due to other reasons discussed below, Harry Osborne (his best friend) wants to kill him, MJ's career is in ruins and is now a waitress, Steve Brock is trying take Petey's job at the Daily Bugle so Petey's career is going nowhere, Petey has a new costume that is a living symbiotic-life form from out of space which makes him stronger and gives him self-confidence but is also trying to overtake his body, the origin of Sandman is shown and he is battling Spidey, and on and on.<br/><br/>Let's start off with Harry Osborne. In the comic book, he becomes the Hobgoblin. Here, he has no name and his costume should be a variant of the Green Goblin but it is not. Fine, I could overlook this.<br/><br/>Next, you have Sandman, a major villain and character within Spiderman stories. He becomes just ONE of the villains in this story. I mean you have 3 MAJOR villains in this story! I could understand 2 but 3! If they had done it well it would be OK but they did not.<br/><br/>Next is the symbiotic life form. This life form's name escapes me now but he bonds with this life form when he was on another planet. Here, the life form comes to Earth as a meteorite in a fashion very much like the Blob. The story of this life form and its interaction with Petey should have been sufficient to constitute as being the sole villain in this movie but they brought in 2 more! I know I am belaboring the point but they just gloss over these great villains and it really annoys me.<br/><br/>This movie had great special effects. That I will not deny but all of you know that that alone will not make a good movie. You have to have a good and smart script as well as good performance from your actors and actresses. Here, the story/script which is a major component of this movie was weak. There was too many superficial topics and characters covered but not in depth.<br/><br/>I understand why Sony wanted to create a movie to override your senses because if I was a studio executive and I had OK'ed nearly 400 million dollars budget for this movie, I would want to make sure that I put in as many action scenes as possible to override the audience senses but at a certain point, enough is enough. You have to start developing the characters so that the audience can feel for these characters.<br/><br/>I went to the movies with my friend and her 10 year old child. My friend and I did not like it while the child did. My friend does not know anything about Spiderman except what she saw in the movies.<br/><br/>In my assessment of the Spiderman trilogy so far, I would have to say that Spiderman 1 was the best for me. Spiderman 1 was better than Spiderman 2 and 3 because Tom Osborne, the Green Goblin's character was really developed enough that you could really understand the villain; meaning, how he thinks and why he does such evil things. By the way, Willem Dafoe played this character really great.<br/><br/>In the end, I recommend waiting for it to be released on DVD. If you cannot wait, then at least see it at matinée price."
"ViewandReview","1","14","26","5 May 2007"," Yes it is a trilogy Mr Maguire
","Why is everyone raving over the special effects? At times some of the explosions from the green goblin no.2's grenades were hilariously bad. Also, the girder smashing through the building, again, hilariously bad. Blatant greenscreen at times also and some terrible backgrounds. Then there was the film. Overlong, stupid and forced performance by Maguire, the moneys gone to that ones head....Didn't the plot just plod and plod and plod?! It felt like a better movie on pause, seriously. I was just sitting in the theatre and the good side of my movie viewing brain was rotting, ever so slightly. Who wrote the script for this?! It was very funny, that it was so pathetically written 80% of the way. 'You gotta get back on the horse MJ.' 'oh don't gimme the horse thing again.' Classy. I mean haha, I've heard better dialogue in porn. Then like all the dialogue was about the woes of MaryJane. Reiterated about 20 times. Yawwwwwwwwn. We don't care. WE DON'T CARE. Story was superbly boring. Simply one of the dullest action movies I have ever seen. Not even saved by the action sequences. Which were generally weak, to short and very repetitive choreography wise. The action sequences came out of nowhere quelling my interest in them whatsoever and the score for the film did little to get the blood pumping. The action just felt sub par the whole way through. venom was a little pussy with no personality. Definitely a poor, poor screen treatment. What was Raimi thinking? Before seeing this I felt a little disappointed at hearing rumours that Maguire wouldn't want to be in anymore spiderman films. Now I think his explanation that it felt like a trilogy is more a nice way of saying I don't want to be in this film. Hell, maybe he performaed so annoyingly badly on purpose so as to give a more competent actor a chance in the role of spidey. If this ends as a trilogy its been a weak finish.<br/><br/>Summed up in less lines: Weak baddies, weak fights, a slow, slithering pace. poor performances all round save for maybe James Franco. Script could have gone through many more drafts. So much unnecessary bits in there. Scores a couple points for the bit where parker has the venom power.<br/><br/>4/10 Sorry about the convoluted way in which I sum things up here. The special effects were my first gripe upon hearing some reviewer had raved about how spectacular they were."

","Well let's just say that I went into this movie expecting it to be great but I didn't get that I got to watch an excellent movie surprisingly the best. A lot of people are nailing this movie for trying to put to much in one movie which I can understand BUT...I believe that is was executed well. The only lecture I have for this movie is the lacked storyline of Venom but you can get that if you read the comics. This movie in my opinion topped the other two because of better character performances by actor's Kirsten Dunst and especially James Franco who delivered an award winning performance for supporting actor in my opinion. He nailed the ""you don't deserve my help"" line.Tobey Maguire does a great job once again Thomas Haden-Church bulks up with good acting and the unexpected great performance by that ""blonde pretty boy"" who was better than expected and he's also great in Predators. Also this movie was the first to feature a villain that wasn't just dressed in armor actually it featured two unhuman like villains. This movie makes you cheer,laugh and also makes you a little sad at the end. Top 10 movie for me. The reboot to me sounds like a dumb move to close to the other three. There should have been a fourth I thought but i've been wrong before...let's hope for the best Garfield!!!"
"josephtheowl","1","6","9","20 May 2007"," Emo-Man: An Action Figure Movie
","This was easily the very worst of the trilogy. Thank the lord on high I didn't pay money to see this movie. Because it's bad. Like Joel Schumacher's ""Batman and Robin"" bad. Like rubber bat-nipples and gratuitous homo-erotic butt shots bad.<br/><br/>I can see why the cast didn't want to be in the movie (as seen in the post-production interviews on practically every entertainment channel). Did the writers really think they could replace story with special effects? Sure, they made a gazillion bucks, but this crap movie will never win a real award, and it actually hurts the comic book genre deeply and will never gain any real seriousness.<br/><br/>Much of the dialog was labored and just plain bad, like the pie scene with Harry Osborn, or actually all of James Franco's dialog in all 3 movies. The ""New Goblin""'s costume was nothing more than an extreme sports enthusiast's wet dream (a flying snowboard and a glorified paint ball mask).<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst really didn't seem into the role. Why? Compare the number of times she screams in the first and second movies to this film. It's like she didn't want to waste her voice or make the effort.<br/><br/>Emo-Man was really, really terrible, like the part where he's disco dancing in public and carries an air of sexual harassment around him. I thought the symbiote was supposed to make him more aggressive, not turn him into a complete sleaze ball. Hitting Mary Jane, even accidentally, was incredibly out of character. When the pivotal moment of a story has to rely on abusing women, the movie automatically starts heading south.<br/><br/>Topher Grace as Venom was a terrible choice. I won't even start on how bad his dialog was and how completely they wasted Venom's potential.<br/><br/>Sandman was completely unnecessary. For a major antagonist, he's barely in the movie. All we get to see is how big a jerk Emo-Man is, then an underdeveloped love triangle, followed by ridiculously nonsensical fight scenes and finished off by poorly executed and mistimed comedic relief. I thought Peter Parker's character was supposed to be smart, but by the film's rushed ending, he doesn't vindicate himself and neither does Sandman.<br/><br/>The only redeemable parts in the film are the cameos by Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell. That is it. Please, save your $8 dollars."

"Chimera-5","4","6","9","8 May 2007"," Long-winded, convoluted, overly self-indulgent, yet still entertaining.
","I'm going to start by saying that the main gripe I have with all three films is how EVERY SINGLE female in the films is extremely attractive, and how the camera loves showing close ups of them screaming in the most random and pointless ways. What, so if we don't live in New York, we don't have any prayer of knowing what hot women really are? Wow, guess our lives suck! Why are the female scientists conducting the experiment Sandman-to-be ""stumbles"" upon so hot? Give us a break already, you are trying way too hard Sam and it just makes you looks idiotic! Anyway, the film is way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes for the ADD-laden and exhausted from being overworked and having too many children American audiences of nowadays, so they should have trimmed it by, oh, 45 minutes and saved themselves $100 million in budget anyway. The action sequences are way, way over the top and blindingly fast at times, thank the maker they just don't have the annoying ""oontz-oontz-oontz"" techno music of The Matrix films. Three villains in one films? Three words, Sam; BATMAN & ROBIN.<br/><br/>Sam just loves showing how ""diverse"" New York really is, I think these films have more Asians in them than any film made in an Asian country! Oh Sam, you're so cute for a Democrat! Please go sing in a Southern Baptist church with a faux accent like Hillary! Why did you make Peter emo, Sam, when he turned ""dark""? Would you have done the same two years from now when emo inevitably crashes and burns like all other great American trends and nobody admits to adhering to it anymore? I doubt it! Boy, Harry Osborne sure can take a lot of beatings over and over again and not end up dead for a guy with no powers, just fancy equipment! Villains should be evil, Sam. Not guilt-ridden (you are a Democrat, aren't you!), not having any hidden agendas, not just ""needing a chance"". Make them detestable and ruthless instead of neo-hippies with muscles.<br/><br/>Speaking of, Topher Grace was a horrible choice. Sure, he's recognizable and I suppose attractive to females, but he's skinny. And too boyish. You needed someone with a bodybuilder physique and a bit more dynamic. You might have to look beyond Hollywood for this, but it's not impossible. They got more than enough massive Caucasian dudes to star in 300, for crying out loud! It's entertaining. It's long, has some absolutely deplorable dialogue (gee, here's Aunt May in another scene, what liberal parables will she dish out this time?), and is WAAAAAAAY too MTV-poppy like its predecessors, but hey, it's another film with a classic superhero. It's not Superman Reuturns bad, and it's not Batman Begins great. I'll put it smack-dab in the middle. 7 out of 10. I'm feeling charitable today."
"alenbedford","1","6","9","6 May 2007"," Let it Die
","Borrowing Lucas' ability to develop a character, cues from The Blair Witch Project for camera work, and a daring refusal to fully develop the plot, Sam Raimi's work with Spiderman 3 hearkens to a 12-year old child, who, asked to do the dishes, does such a poor job he aims never to be asked again. Overall, Spiderman 3 is an amazingly disappointing end to a previously entertaining series. Remarkably, Raimi chose to dispense with adequate character and plot development and chose instead to focus on poorly performed character interactions that, aside from open, mocking laughter, failed to move the audience. The most devastating choice made by Raimi was casting Topher Grace as Venom. While Grace's obvious enthusiasm is laudable, his knowledge of comic lore should have included that Eddie Brock is on Olympian level, a huge man in both size and persona. Grace's whining voice escaping from the pencil-thin glob that only adequately resembled the symbiote wrecked an image that even animated children's shows managed to maintain. Aside from that, Grace's performance stands as a rare example of decent acting in the movie. Tobey Maguire proved that actors have no need of self-respect or dignity. His attempts to cry brought the house to tears of laughtereach and every time the feeble script overused the weak Peter Parker image. The drawn out Pimp Parker montage wasted time that could have been used to illustrate the abilities granted by bonding or show how Venom was immune to spidey-sense. An omission that left our hero open to attacks Daredevil would see coming and failed to highlight a major advantage Venom has always had over Spidey. Thomas Hayden Church, good actor, bad role, next time try for continuity. Bryce Dallas Howard, very pretty and good acting, but like much of this movie she was simply not needed and served as little more than a glorified extra. Kirsten Dunst held no dire urge to know or fill the role of her character, but developed a character that was distinctly dissimilar to Mary Jane Watson. And finally, you have James Franco. Filling a role more suited to daytime television, he was more useless to the story than the mysterious forensic pathologist working as Harry Osborn's butler or the single appearance of the Sandman's daughter suffering from some nameless tragic disease. At least at the end of the movie, it's arguable that you could take out Sandman or Venom and possibly have a decent movie, but the Goblin's role so lacked importance that the audience sustained their own form of amnesia and forgot him before they left the theater. Moreover, the Goblin's fight scenes were some of the worst shot scenes in the film, inspiring more squint-eyed nausea than suspense. This movie ranked with The Nice Guy and Queen of the Damned as titles to actively avoid. This level of shameless self-destruction should be followed by seppuku, or at least by a public apology. Save your money, time, and any warm feelings you may have had for the Spiderman series: Stay home."

Spider-Man 3 wants to tie up all the loose ends by the closing credits.<br/><br/>And so it might have done, if it hadn't opened two or three additional cans of worms as well, before stuffing them unceremoniously back in.<br/><br/>I love Raimi's films, and I enjoyed this one. But 2 was so much better than I ever thought a comic book movie could be. This one...well, it's just another comic book movie. And the reason is, it violates too many rules form the school of it's subject. Comics never just end, and tie everything up. There's always a sinister shadow on the wall, ready for next time. This film spends so much time trying to get everything up together that it leaves holes in the quilt.<br/><br/>If I were any more specific, I might give something away, but suffice it to say, 3 was fair, and still better than 1, but I suspect this one was killed by movie execs who said ""we gotta have 3 villains in this one!""<br/><br/>Nothing kills good storytelling like money-driven ambition."

It could have been a little better though, but the acting was decent. This movie shows the true meaning of friendship and that nothing can stand in the way of a true friend. With all that has happened between Mary Jane & Peter/Spiderman in this movie it surprisingly shows that true love concurs all, along side their good friend Harry. As Harry failed to fill the shoes of his father Norman, he rose above all and ultimately overcame everything that his hatred had led to in the past."

They juggled around multiple plots quite smoothly in my opinion.<br/><br/>And while everyone in my theater laughed at Peter's new brushed down haircut (supposedly reminiscent of that of an ""emo"") it was an excellent addition in that it represented how the symbiote had really begun to affect him. Other laughter could be heard during scenes with crying and whatnot, but to me they were quite tasteful and made for a more human feel for the characters.<br/><br/>One thing that totally got to me was the effectiveness of Harry and Peter's fight. I won't go into the details but just be sure you watch closely and really consider that they were once the best of friends.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. 10/10"

They would introduce one, then through terribly written plot, they would place them on the back burner while they introduced another superfluous character. I could not believe that this was the same director as the first two. <br/><br/>Aside from the horrendous character selection they also managed to make the movie as corny as they possibly could.

","Spider-Man 3 is said (and is) to be the worst of the Spider-Man films. Though I heard 1977 theatrical pilot was bad, but you know what I mean. But saying this is the worst Spider-Man film is not saying a whole lot. Because, it still manages to be a good film. Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite superhero films and it is obvious that no sequel could top it. The film follows Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man) as his suit turns black which brings out the dark side of Spider-Man and essentially Peter. Peter tries to combat the evil at the same time as Sandman and Venom are wanting to destroy Spider-Man. For me, I like the idea of seeing a character that is all about being good, suddenly go dark. It is different and a creative idea. Even if certain scenes (like Peter becoming emo) is a little bit cringy. The fact that there are two villains can be a bit much to take in but nonetheless the fight scenes are pretty fun. With that being said, Spider-Man 3 is an overall harmless film that people just seem to hate. Understandable, but there is more good to be said than bad."

","I don't care what anyone says I thoughts this was a great movie not the best out the trilogy but enjoyable what I found really enjoyable about this movie is how there are more characters such as venom sandman and new goblin make the movie more interesting and even more intense the action scenes are just as amazing as the first two especially the fights when Peter fights Harry spider man fights sandman and the ending scene was very incredible where venom and sandman team up at the end to stop spider man also another great part in the movie where peter thought the guy with the gun killed his uncle but it was flint Marko because his daughter was dying so Peter tried to hunt him down to kill him in the subway because he had the symbiote in his body which cause him to be evil it was very scary and epic especially the part where Peter hits mj and mj saw the black suit and the part where peter was in his black suit web swinging around the city another great scene in the movie is when Eddie Brock became venom when Peter was struggling trying to get the symbiote overall I thought this was a solid third installment in the trilogy rating:8.2/10."
"jebyvyson","7","2","2","21 September 2019"," 11 years and I still enjoy this movie.
","As a kid, this would be my personal favorite Spider-Man movie. A decade has pass and now I'm start to see some people hating on this movie and it left me shock to see many people dislike it. I started to research to see why the movie was bad and I'll admit...it made some valid points. Too many villains in one movie, Eddie Brock and Venom, emo Peter, the writing, and probably more. I had to watch the trilogy again to understand it and I get the hate...and I still like the movie.<br/><br/>To be honest, I think the memes from this movie just makes the movie more entertaining. What I like about the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is that each character has their own story. Most people don't like Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom, but to me, he seems more accurate to what Eddie Brock suppose to be and he represents the dark side of Peter. Some of these flaws, to me, actually help this movie."
"funtasticfour","7","2","2","14 November 2018"," Not as bad as I remembered
","I know this movie gets a lot of grief, and truly it is the worst of the three. But it's not all bad. They tried to do too much, but they still did it fairly well. Sandman looked pretty good, and Venom wasn't the best, but it was still not that bad. I would have liked more monster Venom, but the way it affected Peter was true to the comics, even though emo Peter was kind of funny. I still prefer this to either of the Andrew Garfield movies. I would have liked this cast to stick around longer."

","I don't really care what anyone says about this movie I loved it. It's actually my favorite Spiderman movie. It was 10 times better than that god awful amazing spider man 2 the only thing I didn't like was that there were too many villains and that venom and the new green goblin didn't get enough screen time they were sorta just... shoehorned in. But overall I liked this movie over every other Spiderman movie the second being spider man 2. Also not surprising Mary Jane is a jerk of a character in all 3 movies. Gwen Stacey in the remakes was better. But then again at least Mary Jane is alive I think most people dislike this movie because of the dance scene but I found it awesome. It sorta showed a nerd who never stood up for himself and never got what he wanted in life finally on top and he's having a grand old time."
"KineticSeoul","7","2","2","13 June 2016"," It was very disappointing third installment, but it isn't that bad.
","Yeah, after one of the best superhero movie ever. This third installment was a big disappointment, mainly because of how good the second one is. So when I first got a chance to sit in a jam packed theater when this movie first came out, I was thrilled. That is until the story started to progress. Now I know it isn't all Sam Raimi's fault since he didn't want that many villains in his movie. But he just didn't have that much control because Sony decided to but in and oversee the production of this film. Now this isn't a bad film, but it just lacked the uplifting, emotional power mixed in with entertainment value the first two has. That isn't to say this is a bad film, it does have it's moments and I thought for there being 3 villains, the flow wasn't terrible. I mean it could have been way worse, but Sam Raimi managed to pull it off with what he was forced to do. This is why Spider-Man 4 didn't happen because Sony tried to take away a lot of control from Sam Raimi which ticked him off. The problem is that although there is a lot going on, it just couldn't delve into everything it was trying to do. And some stuff like Venom just seems to be shoehorned in there to please the fans. However watching this movie again leisurely in the comfort in my own home, I thought it wasn't that bad. After trying to absorb everything this film had to offer, the flow wasn't terrible and I thought it was a watchable movie. And even the emo Peter Parker dancing scenes despite it being super cheesy wasn't cringe worthy. Overall, this is actually a watchable finale to this Same Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and ties up most of the loose ends. Lastly, Aunt May is a warm and wise woman. It was always a pleasure to see her give Peter advice when he was dealing with his demons throughout this trilogy. I really appreciated this movie more as an adult than I was as a kid. I also think that it's cool that Spider- Man wear his mask to protect his loved ones, but also to not show His fear to his enemies.<br/><br/>7.3/10"
"amoscow74","8","2","2","23 September 2015"," Much Better Than I Remember
","I recently watched Spidey 3 and you know what, I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Sure it has its problems. The Sandman story is a complete waste of time, Maguire doesn't quite pull off Emo Parker and Franco never looks particularly comfortable in his skin.<br/><br/>Having said that, there is a great deal to like.<br/><br/>Peter and Mary Jane's relationship continues to evolve, never reaching a fairy tale ending that ensures it remains firmly grounded in reality.<br/><br/>Harry and Peter's relationship also takes some fantastic twists and turns ending in a satisfying climax.<br/><br/>Venom, although underdeveloped, shows real potential and his bust up with Spidey is some of the most thrilling of all three films.<br/><br/>Raimi is also on stellar form. Although clearly uncomfortable trying to juggle so many elements, the direction is always top notch blending seamlessly with the gorgeous CGI driven set pieces.<br/><br/>There's also the trademark black humour that continues to work well with the dark themes that are explored - jealousy, guilt, betrayal and revenge.<br/><br/>While it certainly isn't Spidey 2, I like it as much as the original. For pure enjoyment, I might even suggest that I like it more. It is just tarnished by thoughts of the film that it might have been had Raimi been given free reign.<br/><br/>And no matter how disappointed I was at the time of its original release, it is worlds better than the guff that followed. No offence Andrew Garfield. I like you as an actor but those Amazing Spider-Man films are real dogs."

","Following the critical and commercial success of SPIDER-MAN 2, both Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that they would be releasing a third film, SPIDER-MAN 3, aimed for a release in 2007.<br/><br/>Now, SPIDER-MAN 3 takes place six months after the events of SPIDER-MAN 2, Peter Parker has become a cultural phenomenon as Spider-Man, while Mary Jane Watson continues her Broadway career.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn still seeks vengeance for his father's death, and an escaped Flint Marko falls into a particle accelerator and is transformed into a shape-shifting sand manipulator. An extraterrestrial symbiote crashing to Earth and bonds with Peter, influencing his behavior for the worse. When Peter abandons the symbiote, it finds refuge in Eddie Brock, a rival photographer, Eddie Brick, causing Peter to face his greatest challenge.<br/><br/>This movie had me feeling some cool amazing emotions. The main criticism to me is Venom, because he was the biggest character promoted in the trailers and posters to the film and he only got ten minutes of screen time, now, if they would have made this three hours long, this film would have been fine.<br/><br/>The music by Christopher Young is amazing and Danny Elfman's themes from the first two SPIDER-MAN films and it is amazing. The story of Sandman is just emotionally powerful and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman is emotionally powerful in his performance. The story of the symbiote was confusing as heck, but when Eddie turned into Venom, that confusion all went away.<br/><br/>The visual effects and action sequences are just amazing in this film, but I hate the fight between Harry and Peter because they are supposed to be friends, but they are not, until at the end of the damn movie. What the freak happened man? The acting survives. Tobey Maguire and the returning cast all do really great jobs this time around. Topher Grace as Venom / Eddie Brock, I don't hate him, I just wish his character was developed a little bit more. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, she is okay, but Emma Stone's version of the character is just amazing and it is really cool.<br/><br/>Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 does a few things right, but with some major issues and like I said, if the film was three to four hours long, it would have been fine. I'm giving a 7/10."

","Spider-Man 3 (2007): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Hayden Church, Topher Grace, James Franco: Could this be the best of the franchise? It certainly ties everything off nicely. Spider-Man faces two villains in Venom and Sandman as well as attacks from a previous nemesis. Directed by Sam Raimi who completes his second trilogy with the other being the Evil Dead films. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker who wrestles with issues of revenge once a black substance attaches itself. This allows Maguire an opportunity to present a darker side to Parker. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane questions her future with Parker especially when her Broadway career is questionable. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman is connected with the death of Parker's uncle. His back story involves surviving and struggling to feed his family and a mistake he makes in the process. His transformation as well as the fallen Venom substance needed more explanation. Topher Grace plays a rival photographer who becomes the menacing Venom. His purpose is to present the downfall of pride and how it destroys him. James Franco spirals into the new Goblin with Mary-Jane on the brain and Parker attempting an alliance if possible. These films are strictly entertainment and at that they succeed. Awesome special effects backed with those freeing words, ""I forgive you."" Score: 8 / 10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","2","2 July 2012"," It's not bad. There's too much going on, but it's still entertaining
","After two wildly success movies, Sony's ""Spider-Man"" franchise led by director Sam Raimi seemed as if it could do no wrong. My, how spoiled we were by ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider- Man 2"" that we could be so naive.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" isn't bad, just ambitious and convoluted. Like its predecessors, the story and screenplay's primary focus remains on Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), the man trying to balance being a student, a boyfriend and New York's No. 1 crime-fighter, and how his new journey will change his perspective on playing all those parts. It's the smallest juggling act of all, however, compared to the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" features three villains and four romances between five people. The numbers pretty much say it all there as far as the notion of ""too much going on"" is concerned. There's no reason a similar core story couldn't be told with half as many subplots, and as such the resulting story reeks of studio interference.<br/><br/>The first big-screen appearance of Venom is certainly the big selling point, but if the core of the story is the sun, the story of Venom and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Saturn. The symbiote arrives via meteor shower early on, but doesn't latch on to Peter until an hour into the film (nearly halfway). Venom doesn't rear his sinister head until the 100-minute mark (that's all the time most films get). So ... did anyone really want to include Venom in this film?<br/><br/>You don't get the sense that Raimi did. Sure, he and fellow writers Ivan Raimi (his brother) and Alvin Sargent find a way to genuinely connect the symbiote subplot to Peter's journey in the film and make it seem as if Venom's appearance is essential to this story, but it has no weight or power — just a lot of great visual effects work.<br/><br/>The character of Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) comes off more like a Raimi kind of character. Like Dr. Octopus, and even in a sense Green Goblin before him, Sandman is a sympathetic villain as his motivation is to find the money to make his ill young daughter well again. But as with the film's many parts that show promise, the juggling act stunts it almost completely. Church's character and performance comes across as one- dimensional, especially after he disappears for the entire middle act.<br/><br/>The other reason he would've been a fine choice as a solo villain is the way he's linked into the murder of Uncle Ben. To Raimi, Peter has never been able to get over the guilt of incidentally bringing about his uncle's death, and Marko's role in it complicates things for Peter emotionally. This story line provides the one true sense of continuity between the three films and could have potentially put a rounded punctuation mark and emotional note on Raimi's trilogy, but rather than have two characters who badly misunderstand each other duking it out, Venom has to join the party.<br/><br/>Oh, have I not mentioned the third villain yet? As suggested in the second film's conclusion, Harry Osborn (James Franco) takes on the mantle of the New Goblin to avenge his father's death and kill Spider-Man, who he knows is Peter. Rather than talk it out with his best friend, he finds him on the street and tries to kill him. This whole subplot — despite being a thrilling action sequence — feels like unfinished business from the second film rather than an integral part of the third. In fact, it results in Harry suffering amnesia, at least as long as it takes to focus on developing the other subplots in the film before vengeful Harry becomes necessary again.<br/><br/>Pause from the criticism to praise how high the action and visual effects bar is raised between ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Spider-Man 3."" The CGI looks excellent and the early action scenes showcase Spider-Man doing aerial stunts like we'd never imagined.<br/><br/>The other crowning achievement of the franchise has been the romance. We knew the fact that Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) finally came together at the second film's end wouldn't be so happily ever after, but now suddenly they are out of touch with each other's feelings and afraid to tell each other the truth despite MJ knowing Peter's biggest secret. <br/><br/>After getting fired from her new show, MJ devolves into a needy and jealous character and Peter has let the fame of being Spider-Man get to his head. These qualities didn't exist before in these characters, but suddenly they do. To complicate matters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes between them as well. The story of the symbiote is meant to exacerbate their relationship problems, just as it does all the other subplots of the film. Actually, that is about as connected as it all ever gets. The symbiote suit is Peter's choice, and it has consequences throughout each element of the movie.<br/><br/>This is Emo Peter's cue. The symbiote naturally has a negative influence on Peter, but rather than simply amplifying aggression or other emotions, it makes him cocky. Raimi gives Maguire this emo look and films him walking down the street handing out catcalls land doing a dance routine in the jazz club where MJ works to make her jealous. Raimi has never shied away from humor, but these scenes are tonally light years away from the rest of the film not to mention the franchise, and they sour nearly the whole movie experience.<br/><br/>It's easy to deconstruct the problems of ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, and harder to admit that it's an engaging film with good intentions. Minus the emo sequences, it's just a disappointment, though it didn't have to be. If only there weren't an impossible amount going on, or at least someone told any of the film's creative minds that obvious fact beforehand.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I am a huge fan of the spider-man series, I saw the cartoon show, and I saw the movies, SPIDER-MAN 1 was amazing, SPIDER-MAN 2 was incredibly awesome, but then finally when I saw the teaser and the theatrical trailer for SPIDER-MAN 3 I was so excited to see the grand finale of the SPIDER-MAN trilogy, I waited for the time when it came to the theaters until it was released, then On May 7 I was with my dad and my brother to see it, I got to my seat and had some popcorn and soda for snacks, then when the lights went down, the movie played, when it was over I got out of the theater and I said to myself ""I totally love SPIDER-MAN 3."" I was astounded by the black suit, the action scenes, the special effects are really incredible, the story line is good, and VENOM is perfect. It ended the series perfectly well, then when it came to DVD, I got the 2-disc DVD release and I love the behind the scenes of the movie. Although the movie had good and bad reviews but it still became a blockbuster, It also became the highest grossing movie of 2007 beating every movie in 2007 including:Pirates 3, Transformers, and Rob Zombie's Halloween, It was a smash hit placing is #21 in the U.S Box Office over 336 million dollars. To be quite honest I really wanted to see SPIDER- MAN swinging at the end of the 3rd film but what the heck, I never really wanted to see more of spider-man I wanted to see peter out of his costume and fight but I got my wish and I give it 2 thumbs up and 5 stars and mostly SPIDER-MAN 3 is my personal favorite spider-man movie of all time."
"dawasu-796-211414","8","2","2","28 February 2011"," A lot better than people say
","I don't understand why this film is so underrated. For the most part this film is great. Nice effects, good acting and the story was good too. What I think made this film bad was Gwen Stacy. Without Gwen there would be room for more character development from others. I think Gwen was brought in only to jeopardize Peter and MJ's relationship.I think they should be honest with each other by now. Anyway, if they took out Gwen Stacy and maybe also took out Sandman, this would be much better. If they did that I think there would have been more time to establish Eddie Brock's character and spend more time with Venom, which I think is what everybody wanted. People also complain about the dancing scenes. Come on! Those scenes are funny! Especially the one where Peter dances down the street. I laughed so hard. These scenes help add more humour to this already hilarious movie. Bottom line, Spiderman 3 is great. It ties up all the lose ends and finishes a great trilogy. Let's hope the reboot do sen't mess this up for us. I give it an 8/10. Almost perfect."
"dkncd","5","2","2","5 October 2007"," The greatest battle is for story development
","""Spider-Man 3"" is the latest installment of the ""Spider-Man"" superhero series. For me, this film represents the worst of the trilogy.<br/><br/>The main problem in this film is its script. It has many threads, but never develops any of them strongly, so that the film becomes muddled and tedious. Rather than focusing on a jumbled array of side plots and three villains, this film should have focused on developing some side plots and one or maybe two of its villains instead. As it was, the plot developments that were put forth were mostly lax. The development of the ""dark Peter Parker"" subplot was actually laughable as Peter suddenly decided on a more conspicuous and blackened hair style and makeup. Even the film's final conflict wasn't particularly exciting.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's roles in this film aren't on par with what they had to work with in previous films. James Franco is proficient as Harry and did have some notable scenes. Thomas Haden Church is effective as Flint Marko, but the character was very underdeveloped by the script. Invariably the best performance of the film was from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. Topher Grace's character was developed as a trite ""office rival"" and was unnecessary. However, Bruce Campbell's cameo as the Maître d' was amusing. Overall, though, ""Spider-Man 3"" was a disappointing entry into the superhero genre."

","spoilers maybe<br/><br/>This movie was probably the most highly anticipated movie I have ever seen. Maybe this is why it was such a disappointment when the movie was terrible. The plot of the movie is that Spiderman is know liked by most of the city because of his triumph over Doc Ock in the last film. In this new film, there are 3, basically four new villains. They are the sandman, the new goblin, venom, and the black-suited Spiderman himself. The sandman escapes from jail and is now lose in the city trying to steal money to help his sick daughter or something like that. Peter learns that the true murderer of his uncle Ben was the sandman. The new goblin (Harry Osbourne) now knows the true identity of Spiderman and seeks revenge on him for his fathers death. A meteor or something falls from the sky and in it is a black goo that takes over Peter Parkers' body while he is wearing the suit, which turns his suit black and turns his personality evil i guess. During all of this going on, Peter also struggles to maintain his relationship with Mary Jane and deal with a new photographer (Topher Grace) at work. Eventually the black goo leaves Spiderman and goes onto Eddie Brock (Grace)turn him into venom. I know it sounds like a lot to handle and that is the major reason why this movie turned out so bad.<br/><br/>Bad because:<br/><br/>There were too many things going on throughout the movie that it was like trying to followed 5 or 6 different stories all at one time. The movie focused too much of the relationship between Mary Jane and Peter that the was not much of Spiderman The ending was just plain retarded. Harry should not have died. Venom was only in the movie at the end for like 15 minutes when the whole movie should have just focused on his character and not the other villains. The main villain in my opinion was the sandman which i thought was the most boring character. Bryce Dallas Howards' role as Gwen Stacy was definitely not needed in the movie -the voice of venom sounded like a little girl. Spiderman jumping in front of an American flag. Characters that were in the movie at the beginning were not there again until the end. The sandman being able to fly through the air as a bunch of sand was corny. It was way too easy for Spiderman to defeat venom, all he had to do was make a loud noise. Tobey Mcquire dancing<br/><br/>Good Because- The acting of James Franco, Topher Grace, Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, and Bruce Campbell The alley scence of Spiderman and the new goblin. Venom looked cool. Funny. Its a movie about Spiderman.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this movie once just so you can see really how bad it is compared to the first 2."
"gff1701","1","2","2","1 September 2007"," Its really awful!!
","I am a soo excited when It came out in South Korea for this movie, but after seeing the first 15 minutes, it became confusing to me. The relationship between MJ and Peter portrayed in the movie is like the writers never left the first two movies, they are still battling out their feelings and how to cope with them. They are already a couple but it seems that the writers want it to become complicated with Gwen coming to the picture. The ""evil"" spidey with the black costume is lame, Venom is not Venom, as he asked for help with Sandman to fight spiderman, wherein Venom can kick Spidey's ass anytime!! The last battle is useless, MJ is in trouble(again!!!) and as if it never left the first two previous films making this movie redundant to what we have seen before. I rate this as one star out of 10,the CGI is already ordinary to me,they should have made something more since it has a budget of $300 million. Stick with transformers, it is more fun and will keep you entertained till the end."

","""Spiderman 3"" is by far the worst of the Spiderman trilogy. <br/><br/>Whereas the first two films are well done, mature, intelligent, and fun, the last is simply a sad imitation of it's much superior predecessors. <br/><br/>Many negative reviews have cited the crowded cast of characters as the reason for this film being subpar, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. I think the wide array of characters is a good thing, especially since I found just about all the supporting cast much more enjoyable and compelling than The Big Three: Peter Parker/Spiderman (Toby Maguire), Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and Harry Osbourne (James Franco). In fact, my three favorites were:<br/><br/><ul><li>Thopher Grace as Eddie Brock jr., who always makes a point of slipping in the ""jr."" when introducing himself. He brings everything that made him funny and likable on ""That 70's Show"" to his maddeningly small part here. Watching him, during the half-dozen five minute scenes he has scattered throughout the film, I began to realize that it was he, not Toby Maguire, who should have been cast as Spiderman to begin with. </li></ul><br/><br/>-Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko, who deserves better than to be in a bloated special effects orgy. He brings a very real honesty to his role as the main villain, who becomes a monstrosity known as Sandman due to falling into a large, um... well, I don't know quite what it is, but it apparently scrambles molecules, and is kept in the middle of a park for some reason with it's top open, I guess so escaped convicts can fall in and become super-villains. <br/><br/>-Bruce Cambell as the Maître d' of a restaurant in one scene, where Kirsten Dunst sits around looking depressed and Toby Maguire looks dumb. Bruce Cambell is flat out hilarious in this small glorified cameo. But all through this short scene, all I could think about was how awesome he was in ""Buba Ho Tep"". <br/><br/>LIke I said, it's not the large cast that hurts the film, it's how all the characters are handled. The movie is almost 3 hours long, yet, with all that time, we still don't get to know any of the characters. If you want to see how a large cast of characters can be balanced well, just watch ""Nashville"", or ""Gosford Park"", or just about any Robert Altman film for that matter. <br/><br/>For about the first 2/3rds of the film, it plods along as a tired comic book adaption, but at a certain point, it goes completely off the rails. In fact, after 20 minutes, you can't even see the rails. What rails? <br/><br/>The catalyst for the extreme rail-jumping is when Peter Parker is covered in Black Oozy Stuff From Outer Space, which forms itself into a black version of his familiar red and blue spandex. It also makes him Evil, or to be more precise, Emo. Seriously, not to long after getting the black suit, he looks at himself in the mirror completely seriously and GIVES HIMSELF SWOOPY BANGS!!!! I'm serious! He takes his newfound emo-ness and kills all the bad guys who just don't understand him. <br/><br/>Eventually, he morphs into this weird, emo-meets-Hitler-meets-Willard lady's man, who walks around town dancing and and buying expensive clothes. There is one scene that is truly bizarre, wherein Peter Parker goes to the coffee house that Mary Jane works at, with (gasp) another woman, and proceeds to dance, push people around, and ultimately knock Mary Jane on the floor. This prompts her to ask Peter ""Who are you?"" to which he answers, ""I don't know"", and runs out of the place all emo and stuff. Right around this time, I started to wonder if the person at concessions had spiked the popcorn with acid. <br/><br/>""Spiderman 3"" is essentially a big budget B-movie, which goes wacky around the 4th reel. Do not pay money to see this, unless you are hopelessly in love with Toby Magiure and his big, stupid smile."

","I expected something silly, with a quality even lower then Spiderman 2, but it was worse. Tobey has nothing to do with Spiderman and the only thing that made this watchable was the comics and cartoons on the subject that made Spiderman more of an icon than a character. Thus armed I could ignore Tobey altogether and just focus on the story...<br/><br/>The story is not completely stupid, but compared even with the plots in the cartoons, it just lacks. The moralizing aunt and the nice Russian landlord don't help either. A nice landlord... in New York. Now alien lifeforms that clone spidermen and people demoleculized that can control sand I can believe!<br/><br/>Bottom line: the effects are cool, but the suspension of disbelief does not happen. It's all bigger and dumber. At least the red head looked less stoned this time."

","I feel you can tell a movie is good by the fact that it's never long enough. If you watch a 3 hour movie and at the end still want more, it was phenomenal. Spiderman 3.....15 minutes in I decided it couldn't be over fast enough. Too much going on about this and that and not enough dealing with what was actually going on. It was basically watching 135 minutes worth of character and plot development then 5 minutes of ""oh yea, here's some of the actual movie."" Almost everyone in the theater was talking amongst themselves and ignoring the movie. Movies should make you forget about real life. They should sweep you into the world of the movie, make you feel that you are a part of what is happening, like you have a say in what goes on. Spiderman 3 did not do that."

","The third installment of the Spiderman franchise has left me praying that someone holds out to thwart the production of a 4th. It's becoming as ridiculous as the chicken fights on Family Guy. The effects are spectacular as usual, revolutionary, six years ago. But there is less of the sweeping shots of Spidey swinging nimbly from building to building and more prolonged, mid-air, action sequences that remind me more of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than a comic book film. <br/><br/>Painstakingly dragged out to two and a half hours, the film consists of alternating scenes of Peter Parker trying to make things right in his relationship with Mary Jane in overly emotional discussions filled with trailer-worthy one-liners. The other half of the film, where they skip the plot and fall back on lots of flying through the air, is constant action. From the battle at the beginning with Green Goblin, through the introduction of Sandman and Venom, there are enough villains to create a new combination of fighters for each lengthy sequence. In the films defense the effects for Sandman and Venom are awe-inspiring. (See clip below of the Sandman's first appearance, it's great, but it's two minutes long.)<br/><br/>The main issue? The Peter Parker/Mary Jane relationship is unconvincing and forced. I never believed their interaction once during the film. Their separation and Parker's intentions of marrying Mary Jane never feel real. Which is saying something in a film where mutant black goo takes over two men's' bodies, a man trips into a nuclear experiment and has his cells fused with sand and where Topher Grace isn't a stoner. Despite all of these things, the relationship between Kristen Dunst and Tobey Maguire was the least believable thing here. <br/><br/>The final battle between the Green Goblin/Spiderman team and Sandman and Venom is pretty amazing, but the film has just gotten out of hand by that point. The scene is more laborious than the ending of Return of the King. And with four superheroes battling it out I'm left to wonder what we have done to deserve Raimi's consideration of a fourth Spiderman film."
"elijah-h-s","10","2","2","16 July 2007"," Not as bad as people are saying, give the film some credit!!!
","I went to see Spiderman 3 a few days ago with my friends. I walked into the theater with really high expectations for the movie because the last Spiderman movie was amazing and I was expecting this one to be just as good. Some people are saying that there were to many things going on in just one film. There were many story lines going on in the film and they probably could have had less stuff going on, but all the things going on in the film all still come together. they had Mary Jane and Peter's relationship continuing, they had the sandman, venom, and Harry going after peter as the green goblin, and don't forget the whole black suite thing. It's a lot of stuff to have in a film but it all fits together and makes sense. When there's a movie with so much action in it like this one there's always going to be mixed reviews, either people will like the movie or they won't. I liked the move and I think it's great, it's basically like seeing the comic right on a big screen. The best thing about Spiderman 3 is the special effects. In every battle scene the special effects were amazing and it almost seemed as if it was real. Out of the 3 films the special effects were the best in this one. Spiderman 3 may have some things that need improvement, but almost every film has room for improvement. There's going to be good and bad comments about this film, but I loved it and I thought it was amazing!!"

","The title pretty much sums the feeling I had when watching this 140min never-ending flop. The plot is ridicules, Maguire is laughable, Dunst is annoying and whiny, exactly as she was on the first two movies, which were bad just as well.<br/><br/>The computer effects are flashy and expensive yet ridicules as hell. Spiderman was never a realistic character, but this movie is so unrealistic that one cannot even believe that imagination can create such things.<br/><br/>Just like the two movies that preceded this catastrophe, romantic drama seems to be more dominant than action in this movie. Both protagonists (Maguire and Dunst) are whiny crybabies, and you can't help but get the feeling you wanna jump into the TV and punch them in the face. Heck, if someone was crazy enough to turn such imagination into reality, maybe I can do so too.<br/><br/>Spare yourself, do not waste time on this movie!"

","And lo! On the third movie, the creators looked down and said....let there be CGI! And there was CGI. And the audience looked upon the CGI and saw that it was....meh....overdone.<br/><br/>Yes, sad but true. Once again CGI has been taken to extremes and in places it looks real hokey. USed to be that fire and water were the two big non-no's for CGI. Well....you can add sand to that list now. Sandman, whilst making a valiant attempt, just looked like an effect every time he was on screen. As always, I maintain my belief that, if you can tell it's an effect without trying, it shouldn't be in the movie.<br/><br/>That said, I was impressed with the Venom symbiote/suit. That was a well-done effect. Pat on the back for that one.<br/><br/>But Sandman was woeful, just woeful.<br/><br/>If it seems that I'm focusing mostly on the effects in this review it's for a good reason. There really isn't much substance to the film other than that. Sure, you get the inevitable internal turmoil with Parker/Spiderman and the inevitable relationship issues with Mary Jane. Add in a couple new villains and a dig up some old plot-line about Ben Parker's death and you'd think there'd be plenty to entertain. But in fact, on more than a few occasions you're left shuffling uncomfortably in your seat and wondering when things will get a move on.<br/><br/>There are some good scenes in the film. The crane/destruction of an office thing was quite entertaining. And the fight at the end (minus the Sandman part) was reasonable. But on the whole the movie failed to entertain consistently.<br/><br/>In fact, when the highlight of a movie is a cameo by Bruce Campbell (Love ya Brucey!) you know its a bad sign for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In summary then....some bad effects, too long, an occasional good scene and the feeling that you could have done something more productive with those two hours of your life."

And major bells should go ringing if you never feel sorry for Mary Jane, and the villains will remain as flat as a piece of paper.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a lesson on How to waste money big time.

The quote of the show was:""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. My friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself.

","I have had it with these ultra cheesy comic movies. I just saw F4 silver surfer and I about fell asleep and then almost laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. Toby and Kirsten are by far the worst actors in a long time to get such a huge series of rolls. I truly don't understand how this is considered good? Doesn't anyone remember the Crow? How great that movie was? How great some comic book movies can be? These studios continue to release senseless drivel and people keep paying to see it. These movies just get worse and worse every time. Luckily the 300 came out this year and sort of redeemed the comic/graphic novel world of films. But it's not enough. The viewer has to demand more at some point or its just all a waste of time. The reality is, there are some studio execs out there making decisions about creativity and style of which, they have none. Junk in is junk out. Every time."
"lagriff05","1","2","2","16 June 2007"," One dimensional, childish, and flowery crap
","This was a complete and total surprise compared to the past two Spiderman films, and the surprise is that this one makes me want to claw my eyes out with a spork. This is complete and total nonsense. The previous two films were acceptable and enjoyable, so how did this turn out the way it did? I didn't really go into this film expecting anything, and my expectations were still smashed to smithereens by a gigantic bulldozer. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I do want to apologize for all the spoilers in this review, but I guess that's the best way to get my points across.<br/><br/>The biggest issue here is how Sam Raimi makes a fool out of himself and defecates on the Spiderman legacy, completely destroying the story by setting it up so that Sandman killed Uncle Ben instead of the real killer, thus ruining the point of everything. He then further ruins it by having Spiderman and Sandman get all soft and emotional and forgive each other...seriously, what the hell? He also has Harry forgiving Peter and nullifying any notion anyone had of the two finally facing off and settling things in this one. They wasted the symbiote suit and wasted Gwen Stacy, as well as Green Goblin. Sandman is given a lame backstory that just wussifies the movie even further, and Venom is totally wasted. How will they patch this up in future movies? And Stan Lee has a cameo in this, too, how can he support this crap? I guess it's not AS bad if the creator doesn't care, but eh. Time to go back to Evil Dead, Raimi.<br/><br/>Then we have Peter Parker going all lame after the symbiote infected him, and it's about where the movie really dips down below sea level and becomes bad. It's all mind-boggling and very idiotic, and we're given the impression that this isn't really Spiderman, but some sort of horrible modern romantic comedy instead. An embarrassment to a whole 50 years of Spiderman. Nobody ever thought it'd sink this low. I really don't think it'd be as bad if this wasn't Spiderman, but it is. Eddie Brock is played by Topher Grace, who asks Jesus to kill Peter Parker in one particularly awful scene, and generally brings the intelligence of the movie down further. Pretty funny though, but from what I understand, he went there in the comics to kill himself. Another example of Hollywood making light of what was once a dramatic scene, ruining art.<br/><br/>I have a feeling this review will draw comments like ""you have to watch it as a MOVIE, don't think about the comics"" or some other crap, but those people are setting their standards far too low. Sure, you can pretend the comics don't exist, and maybe that will make this abortion more enjoyable for you, but why take the easy way out? That's just flawed logic; like pretending a bad food dish is good by acting like you never tasted anything better. This fails on every level; as a comedy, as a super hero film, and as a Spiderman film. There's no need to compensate for what is clearly a terrible film. Directing? Nondescript. Scriptwriting? Bland and embarrassing. Raimi has failed. This is by far the worst movie of 2007, and it's not even over yet. Sad, because I really wanted to kick back and enjoy this.<br/><br/>Oh, and people seem to like to complain about how there were too many villains, but that doesn't matter at all. That wasn't a problem in this movie for me in the least.<br/><br/>The only enjoyable parts were Jameson's scenes and how Venom looked pretty cool. Too bad they didn't give him enough screen time and just made him into another 'kidnap Mary Jane to lure Spiderman out' villain. Blah. Action scenes were good, but there weren't many of them, as this is just a romantic comedy movie! It's entertaining, no doubt, but it's really not that good and was very annoying and infuriating at some parts. There were some good jokes and funny parts, but this is supposed to be Spiderman, not a sitcom.<br/><br/>One dimensional, childish, and flowery nonsense that nobody should ever be subjected to. Not recommended to anyone."
"alut005","Null","2","2","11 June 2007"," it's full of special effects but lack of development of the characters
","I have to say, the first 2 Spider-man movies are not bad, but I personally don't really like the third one. First of all, there are too many new characters in the new movie and it can't really bring the stories together. For example, there are less real descriptions of the three characters: Sandman, the new Goblin and Venom. The director tried to put lots of new characters in the movie, but it ended up not able to give each of the characters for development, which I think is too bad. Second, Tobey Maguire plays the good spider-man really well, but when it comes to the evil Spider-man, I think he just goes a bit too far. It's just not suitable for him to play the bad guy as he looks so innocent and he can't really show the evil side of the character. Tobey Maguire is just not the ""bad guy"" material. Forget about those negative points, there are still something good for the film. The special effects of the spider-man 3 are pretty good, especially the birth of Sandman. I think it's one of the best special effects in the movie. Besides, the fighting scenes are still amazing and excellent, especially the fighting scene for Spider-man and the new Goblin. It really makes you hold your breath while you are watching them fight. Not mention about the last fighting scene of Spider-man, new Goblin, Sandman and Venom. It's just incredible. So over all, it's a movie that carries full special effects, but its so shame that there are not enough development for those new characters."

Harry was only in the movie for about six minutes at the most.Second of all. Venom looks like only a little bit like the real venom in the spider man comics. He is first of all very small and scrawny. Second he is supposed to be big not tiny. And third, since when did he shoot spider webs.Very messed up. And of course third of all is what is with all of this comedy in spider man.I mean it is good to have like one or two parts that where funny, but not the whole movie. What I really thought was stupid was when he did that retarded dance. It's like he actually felt a lot better with the suite on because that is where pretty much all of his troubles would end, exact when he hit marry Jane. You would think things would get worser but they did-en't. And Venom just happened to be at the church and so did spider man.

"Dingo76","5","2","2","28 May 2007"," Not with a bang but a whimper
","I have noticed over the years that the death of a superhero movie series usually starts with the introduction of multiple villains. The Batman series, until Batman Begins, threw multiple villains at us for fun without any discernible link or reason for the villains to cooperate. Spiderman 3 has taken multiple heroes and run with it by including three instead of the usual two. This caused the movie to have far too many stories going on at the same time with not enough attention given to either one in particular. Sandman could have been developed far better as a sympathetic character, but instead is pushed to the background as a guy who shows up every once in a while and gets sand in everyone's eyes. Harry's Goblin is a natural extension from the last movie but (spoiler) the story becomes mushy with his subsequent concussion and then return as a bad guy, no wait and good guy. I can't keep track. Venom was poorly done. The only reason I can think of his mask coming and going is so we can see that Topher Grace is behind it. Those vain actors. The fake sharp teeth Topher Grace was wearing seemed to make his lip twitch from the pain and gave him a speech impediment. Poor Topher. <br/><br/>Sam Raimi has gone back to his roots with this move, putting over the top ""comedy"" in with a serious story. Go see Evil Dead 2 (which pulled it off better). Peter Parker's transformation with the venom suit is just stupid. (Spoiler) Peter struts around acting like a cowboy and tries to make Mary Jane jealous. This part had absolutely no reason to be in the movie and ultimately just looks ridiculous and takes up valuable movie time. There were many more examples of this type of filler which had no rhyme or reason to be in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I was bored and sad to see what started as a great series go down with a whimper. The acting was bad, the action was passable but mediocre, and the dialog needed someone besides a 5th grader to write it. I doubt I will see the next one unless it goes through great changes to put it back on track."

They (producers, filmmakers, writers, etc) were too far trying to play with #2 formula and they got a Very Unbelievable film..""Tacky"", ""Corny"" and ""A Real Latino Soap-opera"":<br/><br/>* Spider Black, a new character that is so clever and acting like a ""bad guy"".

Before he could remember his revenge, and at the end, he is coming to help and die for his hated pal. Please.<br/><br/>* A SandMan, that is not so bad, the man is always in the wrong place in the wrong time, even Peter/Spidey believed that he is his uncle killer...Come on !!!

The movie also had a good job with the special affects. The fight scenes were really good and well played out. Overall it was a good action movie."
"akoti","1","2","2","22 May 2007"," It didn't live up to my expectations.
","After seeing the immensely large number of trailers for this film, I was pretty excited to see it. On May 4, I sat in the theater waiting for the movie of the year. About two and a half hours later, I was still waiting.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 opens slowly. Mary-Jane is in her first Broadway performance, and the love-struck Peter is in the front row. Later, he takes her out for a romantic evening watching a meteor shower...in a giant spiderweb. While here, an alien symbiote from a meteorite attaches to Peter's bike and hitches a ride back to his apartment.<br/><br/>Nothing exciting yet.<br/><br/>Peter decides to propose to MJ and talks to Aunt May about it. On the way home, Harry, who shall be known as ""New Goblin"", comes out of nowhere and attacks Peter while wearing the most ""Power-Ranger""-esque mask in the world. What follows is a relatively exciting action sequence which ends in Harry losing his memory. So Harry's nice to Peter (for now), and Pete's doing pretty well. Then everything falls apart.<br/><br/>His relationship with MJ is estranged, he finds out that the Sandman, who is somewhat difficult to beat, killed his uncle, and a black alien symbiote takes over his suit and makes him evil/emo.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this movie? First of all, the script was severely lacking. In the second one, we were treated to a perfect combination of action and emotional depth. In this third one, there is so much else going on, that there's not enough time for character development and story development. Second, the John Travolta sequence felt really...awkward. For a good 10 minutes, emo-Peter is dressed in black clothing, hitting on passing women, and imitating John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever. I understand the point of the sequence, but I think it could have been better. Third, Venom!! Venom is a major character, and a fascinating one to say the least. I think he deserved more than five minutes of screen time. Actually, I think he deserved his own movie! Some other problems I have are: 1) The Score - It didn't fit the scenes all that well (i.e. scene where Pete beats the crap out of Harry and blows half his face off); 2) Cheesiness - Yes, I know the comics were cheesy, but the first two movies weren't! Why should the third one be? Cheesiness includes Spidey posing in front of the US flag, and dialogue like Eddie Brock's: ""What the hell?!"" and emo-Peter's: ""I'd love to shoot you sometime.""; 3) Thomas Haden Church - He is a great actor, but his acting skills weren't used as much as they could have been.<br/><br/>It has some good things though, like good visual effects and good acting. The major problem is simply attempting to cram tons and tons of conflicts into one movie.<br/><br/>The movie is an OK movie overall, but a bad Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>Ajax the Great...out!"
"alex-lakin","8","2","2","21 May 2007"," Good, but not spider-man good
","Spiderman was a good film. Spider-man 2 was an excellent one. It was its mix of action, romance and subtle character development that made it, in my opinion, one of the all time greatest movies. So you can understand how much I was looking forwards to Spider-man 3. And as good as it is, I was still disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is too disjointed. For example there are far too many identical scenes where M.J. walks into Peter's apartment, tries to open up to him, he pushes her away and she leaves. This happens about three times in the film, when twice or even once would have sufficed.<br/><br/>There are also some silly plot points, such as Harry loosing his memory in the first half of the film. This is obviously Sam Raimi realising that he jumped the gun, revealing peters identity to Harry in the second film.<br/><br/>There are three villains this time. Harry Osborne and The Sandman are both excellent, easily better than the first film's Green Goblin, and almost rivalling the second film's Doc Oc. Unfortunately Venom is not so well done. Topher Grace plays him competently enough, and the character works well as the dorky, pathetic, slightly perverted Eddie Brock. However when he gets hold of Peter's symbiote suit, his character doesn't develop at all. He's still the same old Eddie just in a black suit. ""My spidey sense is tingling, if you know what I mean!"" he giggles at one point. He seems more like the typical sex obsessed teen from one of those naff high school movies, than a superhero's arch nemesis.<br/><br/>The action scenes are all very enjoyable, even if a few of the ones with The Sandman are a little too short. However the massive 4-way battle at the end more than makes up for this.<br/><br/>But as enjoyable as Spider-man 3 is, it's too messy to be considered a classic like the first two. Keeping in mind that the third part of a superhero movie franchise is traditionally disappointing- Superman 3, X-men the last stand, Batman Forever, Blade Trinity- compared to these films, Spider-man 3 is a masterpiece."

Another thing that i didn't like was the cast. i thought that from the start, Kirsten dunst wasn't fit to be Mary Jane. i also thought that Gwen Stacy was just annoying. truly. the cast of venom was okay. the cast of sandman was very nice. the development of the characters is a bit lacking. there wasn't too much of venom which was a cool character. sandman wasn't too bad. poor harry had such a little part in this movie. he was such a sweet guy when he had amnesia. i hated it when he had to die. i definitely hated it. even if he did have to die, they should have left it for a few movies later! poor harry. when i the movie ended, my thought was ""this is the ending?! COME ON give me more!"" overall, this movie was not bad. i really enjoyed watching it. sweet harry doesn't have to die. i wish there would be a spider-man 4 and that writers would find a way to bring harry back as a person not ghost like thing (i haven't read the comics so i don't know what happens). but i wish there would be a spider-man 4 because spider-man 1,2 AND 3 were all quite good."
"Rufus-T","7","2","2","16 May 2007"," Disappointed and deceived by the trailer. Still worth seeing for the action
","Overall I did enjoy it, but quite a big let down after the fantastic Spider-man 2. From the trailer, I thought spidey fighting his dark self was the main theme of the sequel, which would have been terrific. It turned out that self-conflict portion wasn't that a big part of the story afterall. The goo falling out of the sky was very interesting. I would have like to know more about it, where it comes from, and the way that it bring the darkside of someone. Well, maybe in SM4. I felt that actor was not a good choice to play Venom. I can't find hatred in that face, or just bad acting. Another problem I find is that this one has more lame dialogues than the previous 2 movies, some of the lamest. Nevertheless, it does have some of the best action sequences that I'd seen, awesome actions."

","WARNING: This review contains plot disclosures likely to SPOIL the experience of the film for those who have not yet seen it. Feel free to skip this review if you've not yet seen the film. ********************************<br/><br/>I'm a Spider-Man fan, and I love this movie. It was a guilty pleasure to finally see him in his black suit, not holding back, and letting loose on the enemy. What a wonderful and hilarious surprise to see black suit Peter strutting his stuff through the streets of N.Y.! The final forgiveness of a villain was refreshing. No one but Tobey Maguire could have accomplished all this so well; he is head and shoulders above your average superhero movie actor, after all.<br/><br/>Many complaints seem to center on the lack of screen time for Venom, and not having him available for a fourth installment. I see this as a strength rather than a weakness. I know Venom was an important comic book character, but in these films, Spider-Man is the feature. The black suit is, first and foremost, *Spider-Man's* costume. Venom just inherits it for a little while. The story is and should be about Spider-Man and supporting cast, not the reverse. Venom's role here is perfect: he reflects what Spider-Man could have become had he not rejected his darker side. Ultimately, the black suit should highlight Parker's inner struggle, not focus on a villain only tangential to Peter's development. While perhaps not as exciting as the comics version of the story, this is a more mature theme.<br/><br/>I hope there is no fourth film. This was a perfect ending. We don't need endless sequels that pile more and more villains and big 'splosions from the comics. While a Venom movie as a fourth might have been fun, that is not what Spider-Man is about. Leave that sort of thing to the X-Men, Superman, Batman, and Fantastic Four films of the world. Spider-Man is about character arcs and moral choices, and with the advent and final rejection of the black suit, Spider-Man's film story is thematically complete."

","From the trailers i thought spider-man 3 would be more action filled, and a lot darker than previous two. It turned out to be mostly a chic flick with lots of singing and dancing, but most of all crying. To many characters who had there feelings hurt.. There was occasional action scenes which were impressive, especially the finally but still looked a bit like a cartoon. The strutting down street and dancing in jazz bar was hard two watch and embarrassing. Turns out spider-man is just a loser with only his aunt as a friend, a girlfriend who would cheat on him in an instant and get herself put in danger or held hostage when she is feeling neglected. His so called best friend hates him but he is so much of a loser he knows he wont be able to make any others so he has to try make up with him. As in spider man 2 bruce campbell steals the show. this movie could have been much better. 4/10."
"moimoichan6","5","2","2","10 May 2007"," Peter, it's time to grow up !
","The promises made by Sam Raimi and the producers of Spider-Man 3 were huge : beside a gigantic spectacle with unseen special effects that everyone expect from this king of epic blockbuster, they seems to assure the audience and the readers of the comic-book that this part will be more mature (Peter Parker, after his adolescence in the first part and his student life in the second, has now to face some adults decisions) and darker (the enemy, Venom, is for the first time a villain from the 80's, a darker period for our friendly neighbor)than the prequels. Helas, the movie fails to archive its pretensions on one level, that's certainly the most important : if the special effects are beautiful (the birth of Sandman is indeed a wonderful humanistic use of informatics), the lack of coherence of the movie is so obvious, that it ruins the pleasure you take to the pyrothechique spectacle.<br/><br/>The first two adaptations of the comics were frozen in a bi-polar structure, that divides the movie in a first enjoyable part that shows Peter Parker's daily life and problems, and a more conventional second part, were Spider-Man fights a villain (Green Goblin or Octopus). The first good surprise of this third part is that this boring structure explodes right away, villains comes out of nowhere every five minutes, sentimental and heroically life are stuck together, the situations always change : you really have the impression read a gigantic trade paperback of the Spider-Man adventures. But the bad news is that, after a few time, it really gives a incoherence feeling, and the impression that the plot goes in every direction at the same time becomes more and more important. The situations look illogical, as well as the character's choices. And the density and the variety of the plot rapidly becomes complication and exaggeration. You soon loose the feeling to read a TPB, but a digest of all the Spider-Man stories in years.<br/><br/>And the incoherences doesn't only concern the narrative structure of the movie, its tone, as well as Sam Raimi's adaptation choices suffer from this lack of coherence. If the naive and lighten atmosphere particularly fits to the teenage tone of the first movies, the naivety of the characters and of the situations, when it comes to an adult life, to marriage and to work questions, is rather ridiculous ! And the same critic goes for the narrative and visual style of the movie. Since the beginning of the saga, Sam Raimi chooses to adapt the comic-books of the 70's, with its ridiculous villains and its lighten tone. But when it comes to the symbiot arc, and particularly to Venom, the style has to become darker and graver. And the least we can say is that the all thing unfortunately stays as unreal, incredible and immature as in the rest, even if it's now impossible to hide the incoherences of the movie behind the argument of a 70's style adaptation.<br/><br/>When the first movie made me dreamed of a dramatic crescendo, the third only offers a well done pop corn movie, and is in the end as disappointing as the last stand of the X-men."
"Cinema_Fan","4","2","2","7 May 2007"," A long web that finally breaks its ties: Children will love it.
","With Sam Raimi's third and final Spider-Man instalment now going strong and selling out Cinema seats quicker than bug repellent at a cockroach convention, this is one off those Summer Block Busters' that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>While in every story there is always a beginning, middle and an end, Spider-Man 3 is most definitely the conclusion of this 3-piece saga. A saga that has its roots set in the first two movies, given the opening credits as a gentle reminder.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is a two-act adventure, the first being a reintroduction to our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man and the loves of his life, and also the introduction to his newly acquired enemies such as the New Goblin, Sandman and the toothy Venom.<br/><br/>This first stage of the movie is a somewhat drawn-out affair that more or less tells us what we have already gathered during the first two previous instalments, while it neither progresses the relationships further but it only baits it with false promise and empty smiles.<br/><br/>This, is where Spider-Man 3 can become rather tied up in itself, a story that only centres around, and mostly around its three protagonists, this is a movie that has little distraction over the main three-way love tangle. Everything else is a diversion of the up and coming conclusion toward the ends reality bite and heartbreak.<br/><br/>The bad guys and their relative space here in this movie are more or less not as important as the three main lovebirds and their entwining and volatile relationship. With the help of Messrs New Goblin, Sandman, Venom and a little black substance from the far-flung reaches of space, we are very much aware of the on going love-hate scenario that in its own pace delivers the build up to it second act; the action.<br/><br/>After the initial prologue, the second act then kicks in and the action is then thrown upon us, albeit in its usual mêlée. An action movie that young children will be left in awe and delight. With more bad guys than a spider has legs, this is Spider-Man fighting to the end with all he has. With better cgi this time as compared to the poorer Spider-Man movie of 2002 the lessons have been learnt. With an exciting finale that befits this masked crusader and has the young audience rooting for the spidery superhero and cheering all the right swings and punches.<br/><br/>A great movie for the kid's and a cinema experience that they will cherish for years to come, this is Superhero extreme, a marvel that will carry them onto new adventures and new land's. Spider-Man 3 is a fond farewell and at the same time the grand opening to fresh Heroes and exotic wonderment."
"caleb73","5","2","2","7 May 2007"," Too much in one movie
","There was too much in one movie. For the amount of material they had to write with it seemed long, dragged out, and rushed at the same time. They had the Sandman, Green Goblin Jr, and Venom all packed into one movie. They dragged out the not so important parts and hardly gave enough time for the important ones. For example Venoms entrance was weak. I won't say how it happened but it lasted all of 2 seconds. I think the movie was decent but could/SHOULD have been a lot better. I won't be watching this movie in the theater again, I don't even know if i'll watch it when it comes out on DVD. Basically there was more action in the previous Spiderman's than this one. It reminded me of the Superman movie's hype/expectations and the disappointment after wards"
"greg-1058","4","2","2","6 May 2007"," Erm... right.
","There are a few spoilers in this, but nothing that gives away the plot.<br/><br/>When going into this movie I honestly expected something amazing, having thoroughly enjoyed the first two Spidermans. The build up for this movie described it as being very dark (""the Darkest of the Three""), action packed and promised to pull together the first two movies. It was, however, nothing like the trailers or the build-up made it look.<br/><br/>I felt as if this movie was aimed at a much younger audience than the first two. There were some horribly done cheesy scenes that were painful to watch because it was obvious that the producers were trying to be funny. It just came off as, to put it simply, incredibly stupid. There's a scene were Peter Parker looks into a window while wearing the ""evil suit"" under his street clothes and flips his hair down as if to make him look cooler. To be honest, it just made him look ""emo"". It was rather like a ""gettin' a makeover"" montage from a chick flick when he did this and popped into a shop to buy some new, darker clothing. The cheesy part of the movie basically ruined it for me.<br/><br/>That aside, the action of the movie didn't appeal to me as it was so similar to the action of the first two films, just done a hell of a lot more poorly. Mary Jane is up high above the city, about to fall, oh no, almost falls but doesn't because Spidey sweeps her up. It wouldn't be a problem if that was a simple part of the action sequences but it was essentially the entire battle between the Sandman guy, Venom and Spiderman.<br/><br/>I thought that the relationship between Peter and MJ was a bit overplayed. That's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>In all, I personally didn't like the movie but I would recommend it for families who want to see a cute movie together. It's definitely good for kids 13 and under to watch.<br/><br/>As a Spidey movie, 4 out of 10. As a kid's movie, 8 out of 10."
"eckhouse24","8","2","2","5 May 2007"," Spider Man 3: Good film, but way too complicated for one movie.
","Spider-Man 3 (Contains Spoilers) *** out of ****<br/><br/>As I write this, please keep in mind that I never read the comics...<br/><br/>The Spider-Man films have always been focused on story while putting together great action. Both films have a nice flow and they were both really enjoyable. With that, I was looking forward to the 3rd installment but I must admit, I was a little worried, and with good reason.<br/><br/>To me, this film was way to complicated for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie. I felt this film should have just had two villains instead of 3. Instead, with three villains, there was not enough focus on all three.<br/><br/>The first two films built this great story between Peter Parker and Harry. This film continues that story but it seemed to rushed. I left the theatre wishing there was more from this story. Instead, their conflict was interrupted by two other villains. Sandman and Venom.<br/><br/>Sandman was a pretty good villain but it seemed like he got the Two Face syndrome like in Batman Forever. He seemed to take a back seat to the rest of the story. It seemed as though he could have played a much larger role. And his departure was unsatisfying to me.<br/><br/>Venom...possibly the most anticipated villain in the series and he seemed like he was just there. I felt they should have introduced him...possibly end the storyline where Peter rips off the black suit. Then have him face Sandman at the end. When all is said and done, show Brock in the church praying for the demise of Parker...and than the black suit falls onto Brock and the movie ends making the audience look forward to Spider Man 4, which has been green lighted...and with a piece of Symbiote still around, it's possible Venom will make a comeback in the 4th film...The College Professor still has a piece.<br/><br/>This film did have some story to it. It's theme was about the choices we make in our lives.It Dealt with feelings of revenge and remorse. Forgiveness and redemption. Every character has a choice to make and it's the choices they make that will effect their path.<br/><br/>Overall, this film had potential. It wasn't as good as the first two but it wasn't all that bad. The action scenes/fight scenes were incredible and everyone was great in their parts.<br/><br/>One thing I can say is that all three films have reminded me of the first three Superman movies. With Superman 2, Superman chooses to be human for the woman he is in love with, losing his powers as three villains wreck havoc. Near end, he regains his powers and saves the day. In Superman 3, Superman is affected by a weird piece of Meterorite which turns Superman into a more evil version and eventually, Superman fights his inner-self. I know the Spiderman movies are more close to the comics than the Superman movies were, it just seems very close to me.<br/><br/>__________________________________________________ Spider Man-**** Spider Man 2 **** Spider Man 3 ***"

","So i did it! i saw the long expected Spiderman 3 movie, i was in the theater shocking!, expecting maybe one of the best Superheroes pictures ever made, i remembered Batman Begins and taught that this would be a this level, but o surprise!, The movie is good, but simply as that, only good, no more!, i felt totally depressed when the plot holes of the film started to appear and to the end of the movie i was totally disappointed!. 250 million dollar and you still didn't could pay a better script?. Sam Raimi is a good director, i saw the 2 other films (Spidey 1 & 2), but sorry to say, is a terrible bad writer!, a movie with a budget that could have made this film the top one in the all times superhero movies!, simply terrible. I rated 7 for this film because of action scenes, the characters of heroes and villains where excellent and looked just great! and entertainment as a whole! I agree with some people, that bringing in one movie three different great villains, looked somewhat forced, the movie and Spidey needed time to show them, to fully develop as villains and needed also time to show Spiderman facing his own dark personality (another villain)!, i think that with just Venom the movie would have been better. <br/><br/>Some of the terrible plot holes of the film where:<br/><br/>(1). Why Spiderman, kissed Gwen Stacy in the event?, he wasn't affected by the black symbiotic substance!(2). The John Travolta dancing trough the streets try to resemble a dark side of Spidey? Please watch Superman 3 (3) When Peter Parker plans to propose marriage to Mary Jane, that was the best he could do?, the ring in the champaign cliché is so repeated that i could'n believe this (4). How is possible that Harry's butler told him this ""small"" detail of his father death after all this time?, (5). Even with the previous flaw, how is possible that after Peter Parker throws a bomb to Harry's face, he suddenly forgive him?, in that point Harry don't know the reasons why Spiderman behaves that way. (6). I couldn't believe the end of the film, totally terrible!, Peter felt like nothing had happened, he was so calm after Harry's death.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MOVIE: Tobey McGuire plays here Spiderman and Peter Parker, Peter is facing a mature relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and want to marry her, but he also is showing an alter ego about his spider-man side, this start to move away him from her side. Peter faces his friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) as the New Goblin, with much of his father's abilities, in a fight of Goblin / Spidey, Harry had a hit in his head and lost his memory. Meanwhile when Peter and Mary Jane where out dating, some meteor crashed near them and a black living substance came out of it and sticked to Peter's motorcycle. Meanwhile Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) the man that was the true killer of Uncle Ben, escaped from prison and felled into a breaking molecules machine, full of sand, after this he became the Sand Man! a villain that changes the shape of his body with sand, soon after this, the black substance sticked to Peters body forming a black spider-man suit on him, this substance also develop a dark personality, that made him do some bad things and hurting Mary Jane on the way, he also start dating with Captain Stacy's (James Cromwell) daughter Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howards) and uncover some false photographs published by Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a new photograph of the daily Bugle; meanwhile Harry recovers his memory becoming again the New Goblin. When Peter tries to take out this substance from his body, it fall onto Eddies body (who was following him) becoming in the dark creature Venom. In all this Peter faces now not one, or two but three villains in the same time; this dark challenge take him to ones of the better action shots, in a building trying to save Mary Jane (again). <br/><br/>7/10!

","regarding to the question if venom is in the movie yes, but to think that venom plays a major role is false. to say that this film is a waist of money is not true though, this film had more action than the previous to both combined but the lack of depth with Eddie Brock, the lack of knowledge with how venom speaks irritated me.{this is a nerd thing by the way}venom speaks not as I, but as WE because of the inner turmoil between the symbiont(sorry for the misspelling)and Brock. they say we because they both agree to do something. back to the issue, is this worth seeing (YES) reason: it has comedy with drama that has a overwhelming sequence of action.i do understand why people would be hesitant on going, i was but at the end of the day i am glad that i saw the final movie of an amazing comic book that swept the world and provided a standard for all other marvel heroes. i give the movie an 8.5 out of 10."
"kinsho","7","2","2","4 May 2007"," Ambition killed its potential
","Spider-Man 3...the most awaited sequel of the year. <br/><br/>By now, you should know the plot overview. Instead of a lone antagonist, the movie has opted to feature three villains. Yes, three villains! As if properly weaving three villains into the storyline was not already a lofty goal, the movie decides to dip its entire arm into the cookie jar by centralizing Peter Parker's rocky relationship with Mary-Jane Watson. In between the confrontations and fights, you will be treated to moments of tension between Peter and Mary-Jane as well as moments of lunacy on Peter's end.<br/><br/>The movie's main problem is that it's overly ambitious. It seems that the production team wanted to cram as much as possible in 140 minutes. In doing so, a few of the characters were left largely undeveloped, the transitions from scene to scene were, at times, rough and absolutely lacking in style, and the plot eventually crumbles as it progresses.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, though, the movie is entertaining. If anything, the movie's truly spectacular moments comes in the form of its action scenes. Believe me, the fight scenes are much better when compared to the movie's predecessors. The action choreography and the visual effects have been refined to near-perfection. Every hard hit and slow-motion event serves well in drawing you into the experience. <br/><br/>The acting was all right. Rosemary Harris shined as Aunt Mae. On the lower end of the scale, however, Tobey Maguire stunk. Most of his 'sad' scenes had the whole audience in my theater laughing, what with his contorted facial expressions and all.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have to comment on the movie's message. The theme here is revenge and evil. The movie brilliantly extends its theme to cover not only Peter, but the villains as well. However, any potential for a poignant perspective on revenge or hatred is shattered at the movie's childish treatment of such a deep subject. To summarize, the movie basically has this to say about revenge: ""LOL, like, revenge makes U da evil!""<br/><br/>Despite being a good film, I have to nominate this as the worst Spider-Man in the series as of so far."
"NJRocker091188","6","2","2","4 May 2007"," Exciting Fun.
","""Spider-Man 3"" was exciting fun. I feel like this movie did not get as much credit as it should have. The movie had great fight scenes, and I got to see everything that I went to the movies for. I got to see Harry and Peter fighting, venom even though he didn't have much screen time his performance was still great, and the visual effects for venom were even better than I thought they would be. And finally the fights with Sandman and Spider-Man were great to. <br/><br/>The movie might not have been as great as the first two movies or as smooth but, it was good and quite entertaining. Although there where a few scenes that I didn't like that much such as the walk though the street where Peter tried to put moves on all the girls, and the jazz dance scene. However, they were overruled by the ending of the film. And just because it wasn't as great as the first and second movies doesn't mean it sucked, because it didn't suck at all. It had great special effects, was exciting, had awesome fight/attack scenes that where well done and every intense. This movie was good. Great action, wonderful effects, almost as powerful as the first two movies. It might not have blown me away but, it did withhold my interest until the very end. And since I loved the first two, I was able to enjoy this one. I might not be a big fan of the comics but it still appealed as great to me. There would have been absolutely no reason for anyone to have disliked the movie.<br/><br/>And if there is another movie I will be there to see it. And I just can't wait. Spider-Man 3 is beautifully well done.Since I'm not a huge fan of the comic books but am or was a fan of the cartoons, I was able to enjoy this movie was it was. I was waiting for this one since the end of the second one. Those that didn't like it, I'm sorry to hear that you didn't. I like what I saw. I just have to say Bravo, Bravo!!!!!!"
"ChrisMovieNut","8","2","2","4 May 2007"," Good But Could Have Been a Masterpiece
","I was disappointed but not devastated. What was good about this film was very, very good, but what was bad was pretty awful. Though I am happy to report that there is more of the good than the bad. The Sandman character was pulled off really well although it wasn't needed to have him be Uncle Ben's killer. I think it would have been better if Peter didn't have the meteor land right near him. It seemed way too coincidental. I would have had him notice an explosion and have him go to investigate it. I've been seeing a lot of comments about Peter being too ""emo"". No doubt this was coming from a lot of younger fans who aren't quit in touch with their own feelings. If you followed the movies or read the comics, Peter was always this way. There wasn't a single time in any of these film where Peter's crying or angst wasn't justified. But of course your average teen or pre teen will simply not get this. The acting, FX and action was quite spectacular. It seemed that this movie had a lot going on and sometimes seemed a bit all over the place. The way the film chose to portray Peter's ""dark side"" was where I find the most fault. The aggressive, arrogant nature I thought was fine, but oh my dear lord! The strutting and dancing in the street was ridiculous. And when did the alien learn to play piano????? Removing all the silliness and musical interludes would have done this film a BIG favor. Harry was done really well also. It was nice to see him learn the truth finally, though it would have been nice if the butler clued him in a little earlier...like say in the second film!!! But of course if they did that, Harry would not have found his dads stash and we wouldn't have gotten the really cool team-up we see in this film. It as sad to see Harry die in the film, but I understand why it was done. I thought Venom/Eddie Brock was pulled off great. Fanboys will argue that Venom was too small and he wasn't portrayed like this in the comics and to that I say ""This isn't the comics, its a different incarnation. Leave it at that, have an open mind and get over it."" I also believe that Venom is indeed not dead and he will return to give Spidey headaches in future films. I think this movie will get a bit of a bad rap from fans who come to expect so much from this franchise. I think whoever will be making the next film(s) will take note and make adjustments accordingly. All in all, I thought the first two films were a bit better. It was a really good movie that had a chance of being an epic, fantastic film but it fell a bit short...or long....about 20 minutes or so too long. 7.5 out of 10"
"dav2691","7","2","2","4 May 2007"," Film seemed over-hyped, and with SOME good reason...
","I saw the movie, and I'm split between it.<br/><br/>On one side, the visuals and CGI were quite amazing. Editing was top-notch, and exactly what you'd expect from a Marvel film. Venom looked exactly as he did in the cartoons/comics, and they did an amazing job with keeping his viciousness. Sandman, too, was fairly interesting, and it was cool to see how he mastered his powers almost naturally, from the second he got them. <br/><br/>The sequence when the Sandman gets his power seems almost too fictional and impossible (runs away from cops, and falls into a sand-dune in a scientific facility, only by climbing over ONE barbed-wire fence?), but yet, it looks amazing. Even when he rises up, it was almost comical to see him quickly learn that he has become a ""sandman"", as his own body collapses into sand. The sequence when the symbiote detaches from Parker and onto ""Eric Foreman"" (his personality almost matches that of which he plays in ""That 70's show"") is almost exactly as it was in the comics/T.V. show; amazing!<br/><br/>However, there were some pretty annoying parts, that left me wondering if I had gotten into the wrong movie (perhaps a musical?). The realism of the film (if you can call it that, with mutant superheroes and all) completely goes downhill when Parker walks with one of the most embarrassing struts I've ever seen, down the streets of Manhattan. You probably won't even see female models on a catwalk/runway overemphasize a walk so badly. And when symbiote-Parker starts dancing and shaking his hips, instead of laughing, the crowd was actually starting to boo. The lengthy and numerous dance-scenes were almost completely inappropriate for the plot, and some people even dared to call this a CHICK FLICK.<br/><br/>Mary-Jane. All she did was cry the entire movie. And then, when you thought it was over, she cried a little more. There were probably only two scenes where she DIDN'T cry (one at the very beginning, and one when she was dancing with Harry in the kitchen...). Overall, a fairly disappointing performance; ironically so because in the storyline she got fired from her job on broad way for having such terrible acting reviews..<br/><br/>This movie had amazing action sequences, for about 10% of the total film. When Hob-Goblin is chasing Parker, and even when Parker saves Gwen, it actually had me wondering if Spider-man would wipe out because of the amazing visuals, and action/debris filled sequences. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'd have to call this a chick-flick. 1. Too much crying 2. Too much singing/dancing 3. Way too much crying. I'm pretty sure every single character (except Mr. Jamison?) broke into tears by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>And another thing; get these characters some braces! Both Kirsten Dunce and ""Eric Foreman"" had terrible teeth, and it was such a turnoff during closeups. Please, in Spider-man 4, please have these characters get some kind of teeth-repair surgery.<br/><br/>And another thing; Poor venom was in the movie for about 15 minutes? And after getting knocked around by the original (red/blue) spiderman, was quickly mastered using the high-frequency sound waves, and torn off of Grace's character. Hopefully, in Spiderman 4, he should make a return (only logical character that would make a return), alongside a Carnage, or even ""The Shocker"" or Rhino. <br/><br/>The one thing I can say they did right was the comedy. Just when it was getting too tense, or even boring, one of the character does something really stupid and fruity (on purpose) that would make the crowd (myself included) burst into laughter. Great, well-timed comedy, just like you'd expect from a Marvel film.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm sure the DVD version will be better once they cutout the terrible dance-sequences, but still over-hyped."

Indeed like the first two the film is very much character driven, but importantly a much darker and essentially more fun side of Spidey is seen here, which reminded me of aspects of Superman 3. <br/><br/>All three of the bad guys are excellent particularly Thomas Hayden Church as the Sandman. Compared to the previous films the baddies occupy much less screen time particularly Venom, which I imagine people will miss, indeed Peter Parkers psyche is much more under scrutiny than before.<br/><br/>Stan Lee has a nice little cameo, and Bruce Campbell has a scene stealing turn as an hilarious Maitre D, which unfortunately ends too soon. The CGI barring a couple of odd moments is generally excellent and like every Hollywood film these days at least 15 minutes could be cut off this. Slight catty comment here, but Kirsten Dunst really was not looking particularly good in the second half of this film, presumably this was deliberate maybe to subvert the expectations of the babe girlfriend, which in itself was a nice change.<br/><br/>It would be nice for the series to go out on a high, but I see Spiderman 4 has already been announced, but to be honest I'm not really sure where else the series can go and keep its high standard."
"ZombieFan","4","17","34","5 May 2007"," Great fights and special effects, thats it
","Wow, cant believe I stayed out to 3 a.m to watch this. Not as good as the first two, too much like X Men 3. Hard to take this movie for an action/superhero movie when its mostly comedy. It just felt like half a movie to me. <br/><br/>The Good Aunt May is terrific as always, Bruce Campbell has a great cameo, J.K Simmons plays his part perfectly, Sandman effects are outstanding, Kirsten Dunst getting smacked in a failed attempt to try to get her to act better<br/><br/>The Bad a script that hinges on everyone being in the exact time and place that they need to be to witness major events/have things happen to them. There's more contrived conveniences in this one movie than in three seasons of Lost!, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst phoning it in, fight scenes that are pretty to look at but lack the punch and energy of the battles of the previous two films, a scene in a jazz bar that rips off The Mask. Not the '50s horror movie. The Jim Carrey movie, Sandman lands face down in a puddle. When he rises, only his arm is melting, ""To reflect my new dark side, I'm pulling my bangs over my eyes!"" Oooooooo..., Harry's butler, whose medical expertise is apparently beyond measure. According to him, he can determine that a man rammed a glider tipped with blades into himself rather than that he was stabbed by a superhero. However, he will only provide this expert knowledge when the assumed-guilty hero needs Harry's help fighting a duo of super villains, Using newscasters to describe a good chunk of the epic battle, Using same newscasters to quickly restore the public faith in Spidey, even though the info is actually wrong, Peter and Harry's cop-show banter when they team up. Yeah, they've spent almost two movies on, at best, tense terms. But when you're fighting an incarnation of The Sandman that looks like a pile of mashed potatoes with cinder block interspersed, it's important to be witty, Curt Connors is barely used, Venom is underused Sandman character is terribly written for, Borrows Peter Parkers evil side from the ending of ""Staying Alive"""

","OK. so the plot was all over the place, new characters were introduced with little development and there were some corny moments. SO WHAT!!?? the movie is about ACTION. and this film did AMAZINGLY well in ALL the fight scenes. just brilliant. and although there were some flaws (like all movies) there was nothing glaringly wrong with the film to receive such negative reviews. All the elements of our beloved Spidey were there and for once Kirsten Dunst didn't need strangling. Topher Grace fit his role very well, and the Sandman was cast perfectly. and James Franco, by far, stole the show. oh, and Venom was amazing.<br/><br/>Spiderman lives on. <3"

","After seeing the 2nd Spiderman movie, i was incredibly egar to see the next. I'm a huge Spider-man Fan and i have to say that this movie kicks the $h1t out of all the other Spider-man movies. At certain parts i laughed till i couldn't breath and at other i was amazed. The special effects and computer animation was fanaminal! The action scenes were Superb like the ending fight between Spider-man vs Venom and Snadman. Venom looked astounding and had perfect traits. If anyone else read the comic books you will notice that some things don't seem exactly the same but they're very close. The Scene at the church where Spider-man gets rid of the symbiote costume and Eddie Brock embraces it is stunning. You really couldn't ask for a better superhero movie. My brother is a huge batman fan and thought spider-man was a pussy. But when he Saw Spider-man 3 he took every thing back. This movie is a long 2hrs and 30 min but it is definitely worth it. So if your in the mood for a hard-hitting action movie with many laughs filled in... SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"

","I'm not a huge fan of the Spiderman franchise but I have to say, this is the best of the bunch so far. Story - as always - is complex with not one but 3 villains to contend with but (unlike the last batch of Star Wars) you can actually follow the story. And that's saying something. <br/><br/>Least interesting parts of the movie were the (very obviously) digitial flying/fighting scenes. It's a bit sad that with all the hundreds of millions thrown at the screen that it still looks fake. In its own way original Superman's effects were just as good - Just a different kind of fake. Digital extras stand out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Best thing in this movie is Thomas Haden Church's Sandman. Best supervillian performance in a while. Credible, fearsome and very moving. Tobey Maguire also stretches some acting muscle, playing a bad guy and a psychotic '77 John Travolta. There's are some genuinely funny scenes. Didn't even recognise Bryce Dallas Howard. Was surprised to see she played Blondie when end credits rolled.<br/><br/>Multimedia screening I attended garnered a round of applause at the end. Guess that's saying something."

"speargary","1","10","18","5 May 2007"," Seems to have lost its way.
","To like this film requires being a staunch Spidey/Comic book film fan. As a film-goer I found it to be a very dull experience that went on far too long. I can also say that I was not alone in feeling this as of the audience got increasingly restless as the film went on, putting coats on ready to make a quick get away. <br/><br/>The audience laughed at the supposed emotional scenes, considering his uncle has died and his girlfriend is being blackmailed to leave him, these moments held no dramatic tension and were badly acted. The condition of Toby Maguire and James Franco was laughable. When Franco steps out of the chamber he wasn't exactly muscular, and Maguire when bending forward displayed rolls of not so toned stomach. It is ridiculous to be expected to then believe that either of them to be able survive the fights. This seeming lack of commitment from the actors seemed to reflect the general laziness displayed throughout the film. Even Sly looked like he had worked to get into shape for Rocky 6 and wouldn't have caught him looking less than the part in Rambo or the other Rocky films. <br/><br/>The film appeared to have become a parody of itself, whereas the previous likability of Parker was that he was an average geek who has done well, Parker is now egotistical and full of himself. The character has lost all charm and if these were the sequences that supposedly made out he'd 'gone bad' then that just makes it look more pathetic. He hasn't gone bad on any deep level and he seems to have become full of himself from the start of the film so there really was no difference or development. <br/><br/>Parker says to Venom, he needs to be careful or he'll lose himself if he keeps wearing the dark suit. The film itself is lost in amongst many story lines that are in themselves rushed. Generally speaking the film moves slowly trying to tie everything up in the last 30 minutes. The sandman is seen briefly throughout and then suddenly needs to be addressed at the end. Venom only becomes Venom at the very end and for pathetic reasons. As for the effects, great but what's new, I'd much rather have a solid plot and a good script as well rather than some great CGI. I hope this is the last one, it couldn't get much worse."
"virindra","6","18","37","2 May 2007"," Not that great.
","I loved the hype around spider-man. Spiderman 1 was awesome! A lot happened. There was a lot of action AND s story! So it had everything you could wish for. So spider-man 1 was a success. Everyone wanted to see a sequel. Spiderman 2 came. Here was too much story and a little action. The story was a bit boring, too much romance. But when there was action, so it was great! So spider-man 2 was also a success.<br/><br/>Now spider-man 3 is out in the cinema's. I've seen is just yesterday. Spiderman 3 was a lot of story and a bit of action. And when there was action, it wasn't that great. Venom was not as big and gigantic as in the comics or cartoon. The action with venom was just a little and not awesome. Some people think Venom died, but he didn't. The teacher of Peter Parker has a bit of the stuff that came out of space. So the teacher can change into Venom, or a student who comes into his office and touches the alien stuff.<br/><br/>The relationship between Harry and Peter was great! But I don't know why the friendship between them had to involve in such way. The tearjerker at the end was sad, and unnecessary.<br/><br/>There is an open ending so there is more stuff for more, but I hope this third episode is the last one. I don't think Tobey and Kirsten will come back for more episodes. In that case it would not be worth is to make three more. But then again, Peter and Mary Jane aren't married yet..."
"jvidell","1","9","16","3 June 2007"," I want my money back!
","Hated it! Yes, that's right, I hated it! The only redeeming part of the movie was J. K. Simmons as Mr. Jameson. In my opinion he is one of the most perfectly cast roles in the history of Hollywood. But, it wasn't enough for me to really enjoy the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I think that my biggest problem with the movie was that the fight scenes were simply way to involved and complicated. They just went overboard with everything and because there was so much going on it was hard to really get into it. During the very first fight between Spidey and Hobgoblin Jr. I was actually bored. It's like movies back in the 1970's. A movie comes out and has a car explosion in it. Then, someone else makes a movie and they have to have 2 car explosions. Next thing you know they're blowing up all the cars in the world. I'm starting to see that with CGI. They're pushing the boundaries of what they can do, which unto itself is good, but I think that in some cases they overdo it and just make the fights needlessly complex.<br/><br/>I normally judge movies by how many times I check my watch. A good movie is one where I check my watch once or twice. During a really great movie I don't check my watch at all. During this movie I checked my watch about 10 times, which is a new record for me. At one point I actually thought about getting out my newspaper (which I had been reading while on the train to the theatre) and finishing up my crossword puzzle. The only thing that stopped me was that I didn't want to make any noise with the paper as I opened it up the right section.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, Bruce Campbell had a good roll in the movie, and I do always get a laugh whenever I see Ted Raimi on the screen. I think Topher Grace did an OK job, but I was really surprised that even though I was looking for his character I completely failed to realize it was him when he showed up next to the copper to take a picture of his girlfriend. But, his job wasn't a great job. Still, it's good to see him moving beyond his role of Eric Foreman. All in all, I wish I could get my money back and I wish I could get back those 2+ hours of my life. They would have been better spent watching some other movie (such as Breaker Morant which I just picked up on DVD and haven't watched yet) or doing something more worthwhile, like scratching myself and trimming my toe nails for a couple of hours. I guess that after The Return of the King and X-Men 3 that the old movie trilogy curse of ""Third time's a dud"" has come back to haunt parts of Hollywood."
"gibat51","1","9","16","7 May 2007"," A crapfest
","When I learned last year that Marvel was to produce its own films in the future, I feared they would produce crap such as Spiderman 3. You see, Marvel is in the comic business and not the movie business- but in their greed they thought they could do no harm after the success of some of their franchises. Well, they should seriously reconsider their decision after this monstrosity. Or maybe a few more bombs would really convince them. Beware the next Fantastic Four and Hulk! Any new production from these people is to be avoided at all costs- as I should have avoided this crapfest. Spiderman 3 is so bad, one does not know where to start but I do know how to end it."

","Spiderman III is one of the dumbest films I have ever slept through. Its pasteboard characters, its sub-literate moral prattle, its cornball special effects - will appeal only to little children.<br/><br/>It might at least pass for harmless entertainment - except that it goes far out of its way to teach a harmful message - which is, that you must ""turn the other cheek"", or risk becoming as bad as a person who injures you. Of course, this ""moral"" is unworkable and therefore cannot be consistently applied. Spiderman will continue to go after the bad guys, whatever syrupy lessons May Parker may try to foist on him. Still, it is demoralizing to be told that going after evil is itself evil - and such pap should not find its way into films that are shown to impressionable children."

","This was yet to be the worst Spiderman movie I have ever seen. There is No plot whatsoever. The whole story is completely skewed. Supposively Venom comes from an alien rock that falls 5 feet next to him some how oozes out and knows exactly to bind to his bike and hides for days before attacking him. Also Venom being a symbiont does not bind to him all the time? And is only with the suit? Completely skewing the concept of the symbiont.<br/><br/>Number two. Eddie Brock? supposed to be a big strong jacked guy. Yet Because i guess they decided to be cheap on the suit. They found somebody in similar size to Toby McGuire so they didn't really have to make another suit.<br/><br/>Three villains in one gig? Not working out exactly. Especially Harry Osborne. What is he exactly? hes just some dude in a suit looking for vengeance? He breathes the Body enhancer like his father did? yet he doesn't go completely mad? Also the butler of the Osbornes knew what was going on the whole time? Ridiculous! The sandman never dies. Spiderman was always known for his smarts. He would think of ways to defeat his enemies without using brute force.. However does he even learn with the sandman? He just keeps on attacking and attacking stubborn and dogged. He never does realize that HE cant defeat someone that is MADE just of SAND. And in the end? He FORGIVES HIM? and just lets him go? This quite frankly is one of the worst sequels i have ever seen.

I felt as though this movie was shot by some soap like Days of Our Lives or All My Children. This could have been a 35 minute movie. Venom was developed at the last minute in the movie. Peter dancing was embarrassing to watch. Really. I just wanted to leave at that point. But I endured on to the almost bitter end. Venom got whacked and we were out of there. Who cares how it ended, I wasted enough of my time on this lamer. Wait till it comes out on DVD, then wait till it hits the 99 cent rack at the movie rental. Then wait for half price Tuesdays.

The moral of the film, as blatantly obvious as it was, just had to be re- iterated by every clichÃ© plot mechanic ever conceived. And the chaotic cinematography had made me wish that the matrix had never come out; the redundant flare of the slow motion 360 shots had left me with a feeling of despair throughout the film. <br/><br/>The only good parts of this film could be summed up by a few frames taken of venom's wicked getup.

"motta80-2","7","17","35","19 April 2007"," Mild spoilers: Disappointing but not terrible
","I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Spider-Man 3 is disappointing. It's not terrible, but it's no Spider-Man 2 either. For my money the second film was the best of the three. With Spider-Man 3 they've dropped the ball. The most obvious comparison is X-Men 3. First film established well but had its flaws. Second film built character arcs, introduced new characters in a fluid way with exciting action and a solid story, third one forgot about the characters, largely wasted new ones and just went for spectacle. A fun ride to a certain extent but I had loved number two and three let me down, I expected more. Spider-Man 3 does the same.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is far too busy. For the first half hour it's ridiculous, doesn't know where to look as there are so many characters to introduce, re-establish, etc. There's so much going on and new characters Flint Marko, Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy are all thrown in with no real intro. Where has the character development of S-M 2 gone? There are too many characters and not enough investment in them. Even the returning characters often seem tacked on. The ever-great JK Simmons' J Jonah Jameson still provides random comic effect, Aunt May appears out of nowhere once or twice.<br/><br/>And the lack of development extends to the leads. You don't care about the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane in this one. Harry has the best through-line but only after a movie-device so hackneyed Ratner would think twice!<br/><br/>Comedy: They've turned Spider-Man 3 into a cartoon. It feels a bit like watching Batman Forever (though no neon). The J Jonah Jameson comedy moments have gone from the amusement of his acerbic character to full on sitcom ridiculousness involving Ted Raimi, Elizabeth Banks' Miss Brant, JJ, pills and a vibrating, electrified desk. As a SNL skit this could work and it is kind of funny but these scenes feel out of place in this world.<br/><br/>Then there's comedy Peter. New suit, new confidence, new attitude. The scene starts, the song works, it's fun. He makes a gesture to a passing woman, it's fun. He strolls down the street you think okay, having a bit of fun, time to move on. But no, let's continue this for another five minutes. This really overstays its welcome.<br/><br/>And then there's Bruce Campbell. I love Bruce as Ash, I loved Bubba Ho-Tep, and I laughed at his cameos in Spidey 1 and 2. Here you feel the Campbell cameo is coming and... its so ludicrous it takes you out of movie again. Sure, he's funny but like the JJ desk sequence it is so extended and daft it suddenly feels like you're watching a Peter Sellers movie.<br/><br/>The film is now so jokey, so surface, no texture that you wonder how the same people could be behind 2 and 3. I'll tell you this: Alvin Sargent may get a writing credit but most of this must have come from Sam and Ivan Raimi, there's very little to connect the script of 2 to that of 3.<br/><br/>The old guys: Maguire overplays the part this time, he's becoming a caricature. Also when asked to look sad he just looks constipated. And his playing of dark Peter - atrocious, not a believable character for a minute.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is fine as Mary Jane. She has the character down and handles it well.<br/><br/>James Franco is the best thing in the whole movie. He has the thankless task of dealing with the aforementioned ubercliche plot-turn in his character but ultimately he gets the only real development in the story and it's interesting, its well handled on the whole and Franco does a nice job with it. A whole movie with him as the main antagonist would have been a joy, or maybe one of two - so we have one new character - but no, let's have three and under use both of the other two. Which brings me to...<br/><br/>The new guys: Thomas Haden Church is marvellous. He is in a different movie. He is believable, sincere, up to Alfred Molina's standard but without the juicy part. Every time he comes on screen the movie hits a different stride. My money's on Sargent did most of the Sandman character. He works perfectly, but he's sadly underused.<br/><br/>Topher Grace is fine, but criminally underused. He's in the cartoon version, but then he's Venom! The sad thing is as Brock we barely meet him. He is a one dimensional side character there purely as a device to get Venom in. Sad, he deserves better, because then, when he's finally Venom, he's mostly lost in the effects.<br/><br/>Bruce Dallas Howard is perfect and wonderful as Gwen Stacy. She does the best she can to give Gwen a full character despite having zero to work with and she pretty much succeeds. But again she's not a character, she's a device to add tension to the Peter/Mary Jane, Peter/Brock story lines. That she comes out of it as well as she does is testament to her abilities.<br/><br/>The effects: The Sandman effects are stunning and for the most part they are closer to the high standard of 2, and much better than S-M 1.<br/><br/>Set pieces: Okay, entertaining but nothing to match the tension and excitement of the train bit and the Ock bank battle in 2.<br/><br/>Ultimately Spider-Man 3 will entertain you for much of its running time and it's not an awful film, it's not even bad. It's okay, maybe even edging on good. But it's disappointing because with the talent involved and coming off the excellent second film, and with the work Church, Howard and Franco especially are trying to give, it could have been so much better. But the clutter got the better of it."
"lucasaq-1","7","23","50","5 May 2007"," Second Best Entry
","Last year about this time, I was supremely excited about X-Men 3 or The Last Stand as it is titled, but I was supremely disappointed. It had a bunch of action and thin story. It butchered the series for me. I glad to announce this film didn't have the same affect. I was more wary this time, yes, but also still excited. The writers handled the story very well and there was plenty of eye popping action. Still the film lacked a good strong drive like its predecessor.<br/><br/>I will address the short comings first. I will point out the obvious. Kirsten Dunst can't sing very well, but that is addressed in the film. The thing is that we have to hear her sing twice, a very bad idea. It wasn't the most pleasant thing to hear although she is decent. My next point of minuses is the origin of the symbiote. It just falls from the sky. A rather weak way for it magically appear, but they had few options other than go with the Ultimate origin where it is man-made. Still little more cause for its arrival would have made it stronger. My third and final point is in regards to the final ending. It was needed at all and added nothing to the progression of the characters other than for a happier note to end on.<br/><br/>Now onto the positive stuff of which there is a mass. First the stupendous battles, and let me tell there are some big ones. They were very well staged and brought to being. The final battle especially did a great job of bringing everything together. The special effects are dazzling especially Sandman. The first appearance of his is pure film magic as we see the cells change in Marko's body and the reconstruction after being turned into sand particles. Venom was great to, but nothing spectacular aside from the ""Alien"" moments.<br/><br/>Before I go on praising this film I will provide a brief description of the plot. Picking up from where the other film left off, MJ and Peter have finally gotten together and things are looking fantastic for Spider-Man and Parker as he has the girl of his dreams and has the city on his sides even the newspaper, a shocker. But things quickly go south when Harry Osborne swoops in and tries to kill Parker as revenge because he believes Spider-Man/Parker's to be the murderer of his father. He looses not only the battle, but his memory after taking a few nasty hits. Flint Marko is then brought on the scene as a misunderstood runaway convict. Through crazy chance he falls into a test area and is turned into the Sandman. Parker is mad at Marko at this point because he believes him to be the true murderer of his Uncle Ben. I won't reveal much more, but Venom/Eddie Brock does have a pretty big part in the last section of the film as does the symbiote about half way and a little before when it falls from the sky. All in all, it is a nice setup for some serious encounters/fights.<br/><br/>The relationship between Mary Jane and Peter Parker is pretty key to the film as it drives much of Peter's personal decisions and problems. It's done quite well, aside from Mary Jane singing. Peter wants to ask her to marry him, but it doesn't work out. Aunt May has some great moments in here where she really shines. Everyone is back and more. Jameson is as steaming mad as ever and provides quite a few laughing fits involving his temper. Even the great theme is used to great affect from beginning to ending, something that was sorely missing in the last X-Men film.<br/><br/>The film is one of the best entries in the series, but not quite up to Spider-Man 2 which was pitch perfect and never stumbled for a moment. It successfully engages three villains with Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but it doesn't quite resolve everything as grandly as Spider-Man 2 did. Still far from a disappointment which is sure to please most everyone action wise and for those romantic fans it will frustrate you."
"JohnnyBravado","10","12","23","6 May 2007"," To be honest, I don't get why people don't like this instalment.
","I feel this is the best Spider-Man released. To think that it is the worst in the series isn't quite right (despite general public opinion)...<br/><br/>Peter's relationship with Harry Osborn and Mary-Jane Watson is becoming unstable, and if that isn't enough, he finds out a terrible secret about his deceased Uncle Ben. Flint Marko is a crook trying to run away from crime and live a happy life with his family. As Marko tries to escape from the city, so do his bones. Enter young photographer Eddie Brock. Brock works for The Daily Bugle (as Peter Parker does) and has a good paycheck, but he is shown up by the most unlikely person and, as a direct result, becomes frustrated at himself. All these events clash with each other in a nasty way.<br/><br/>New, brilliant, and even better than Spider-Man 2; please welcome...Spider-Man 3!"
"projectorman","9","12","23","22 April 2007"," Spider-Man 3 Rocks
","Spider-Man 3 will be the most debated of the Spider-Man movies. There is enough here to keep the fans happy and enough to make them want to burn their tickets in protest.<br/><br/>First the good: 1. The movie is about Peter Parker, not some great plot to conquer/destroy New York. Peter's actions and attitudes cause most of the end of the film's events. There are genuinely funny moments and sad moments along the way. But the movie's main drive is will Peter end up with MJ. There are serious curves thrown in the way.<br/><br/>2. The actions scenes are amazing. The final battle is the best and the worst.<br/><br/>3. The movie is really funny...at times. The Bruce Campbell scene is both funny and heart-breaking. All the funny comes from Bruce's French accent. And the first Jameson scene will have the audiences in stitches.<br/><br/>4. Stan Lee's best cameo yet. He even throws in a classic Stan Lee line.<br/><br/>Now the bad: 1. The movie could be maybe 10-15 minutes shorter. But I'd be hard-pressed to say what should be cut.<br/><br/>2. The Sandman scenes are good, but have a Mummy-like feel to them at times. Even the music during the Sandman armored car scene sounds like it's from the Mummy. But I really liked the Mummy.<br/><br/>3. Venom should not sound like Topher Grace. Fortunately, he doesn't talk much in Venom mode.<br/><br/>Now the you'll-have-to-decide-for-yourself: 1. Sandman's involvement with Uncle Ben's death. I didn't mind it, but the resolution was a tad cheddary.<br/><br/>2. Venom's only there for about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>3. Venom's appearance. Again I think they pulled it off, but fans of the giant tongue and brain-eating Venom will be disappointed.<br/><br/>4. The resolution to the Harry-Peter feud. The butler did it.<br/><br/>5. The character of Gwen Stacy. She's not a major character, but for what she's there to do, she does it. Maybe she could have been a different character, but then no one would believe that Peter could end up with her.<br/><br/>Overall, a really good movie, not just a good Spider-Man movie. In fact it maybe the best of the Spider-Man films. The pacing is similar to Casino Royale wherein stuff happens, character moments take over, more stuff happens, movie ends.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again"

It stunk up Hollywood so bad. I Think Stan Lee should denounce this movie and Sam Raimi should never make a movie again. <br/><br/>I felt very cheated out of my escape from reality.

","I really don't know if i should review this movie. So i will make it quick. Allow me to start with, I liked the first Spiderman. I DID NOT like the second one. The CGI was horrible. I do agree that the original Green Goblin looked like something from the POwer Rangers, but the first one was good. So tonight I went to the 12:01 a.m. showing with a friend who really wanted to see it.<br/><br/>We are returned to spidey(Toby Maguire) and his girl MJ (Kirsten Dunst, ick) and how wonderfully in love they are. Harry is still not happy with spidey/peter for killing his dad. MJ is performing on Broadway in a musical (with a not so good voice) and Spidey has become the savior of the city. It seems as though nothing could go wrong, but.... OUt of the blue, Harry decides he needs to seek revenge on spidey for the death of his father and becomes the New Green Goblin guy. A fight ensues, Spidey wins, knocks Harry unconscious, BAM he has forgotten the fact that Spidey stole his girlfriend (that he was too afraid to talk to in the first one, so I'm so on Harry's side here) and that he thinks spidey killed his father. All is well. The three are BFF. Enter Sandman/Flint Marko. Marko is an escaped felon with a sick daughter. The police inform spidey and aunt may that flint is the one who murdered uncle ben. This angers Spidey. Between all of this enter Gwen Stacy (played by a wonderful Bryce Dalas Howard) who is the daughter of the police chief and whom spidey saves and kisses (MJ gets mad). Throughout this some strange black goo hits earth from the sky, climbs to spidey and overcomes him. Flint Marko becomes sandman by some freak accident involving, guess this.....sand. Spidey becomes his own enemy and turns bad for a while, MJ and Spidey have some problems and topher grace is the only reason worht going to see this film as Eddie Brock.Cenom who is in love with Gwen. There are more corny lines in this movie than in all the national lampoon movies and American pie movies combined. The audience is supposed to be on spidermans side, especially when harry tries to steal MJ back, but really, what kind of friend steals his best friends girlfriend and keeps his identity a secret. I""m on Harry's side and i understand where topher grace's character is coming from. He gets called a fraud, but wtf is spidey, how does peter get pictures? I found this film ridiculous, in all honesty. THere are really stupid dance scenes. Corny one liners, the plot has too many villains and do not develop any of them enough for you to not want the to win. I know this will be the top grossing film of the year, which makes me sad. Because this film seems to have had no thought go into it, and some pretty rough acting by maguire and dunst. A movie for the kids, maybe.<br/><br/>Rated PG 13 for violence. 140 minutes."
"user-16916","1","8","14","8 May 2007"," awful, just plain awful
","although i didn't find the two first movies great, i still enjoyed them. With Venom added to the mix in the third installment i was quite excited to watch it. A few friends of mine had already watched it, and they had send me several warning flares. With the attitude: it can't be that bad, and i went into the cinema....<br/><br/>It was easily the worst movie of the year, and it candidates to the worst movie of the decade for me. <br/><br/>The beginning storyline mostly makes sense, Parker and MJ are building their relationship, and are having success, Spiderman is having great success. Somehow it just isn't portrayed so i feel it with them, as it was clearly meant to be. Stuff starts going wrong for them, Parker blacksuits and completely changes character. The doc says it emphasizes, but this was a complete turnabout, The Mask did this soo much better, this was probably the lowpoint in the movie, and the movie from this point was dead to me. I did stay to watch but it didn't help. Final battle was too predictable and grossed out to the extreme, starting with Spider landing in front of a big American flag, followed by the camera panning the awed crowd while they sigh and point, and cry, which they do multiple times during the fight.<br/><br/>The highlight was the french restaurant with Bruce, which lasted only about 5 minutes. <br/><br/>I say to you what i wanted someone to have said to me: Don't Watch This Movie, it will make you blind and infertile!"
"pennstatemike","10","8","14","6 May 2007"," the best yet
","I have to say that after seeing this movie, Rami did a great job on the characters. The New Goblin(why not call him Green Goblin 2?)actually did surprise me as to how much I really liked this character. His glider was almost reminiscent of the original goblin glider from his first appearance in the comics. The Sandman FX was just blew me away. The character from the comics was never my favorite, but I really did enjoy how they made him the villain he is. Venom really surprised me how cool and scary they made him.<br/><br/>Peter himself is still the everyman. This movie made him change from the geeky nerd from high school to see him grow to become the man he was made to be. It does show how hard it is in life to make yourself always follow the path of the straight and narrow.<br/><br/>I think the reason as to why many people seem not to care for this movie, is that they want to see the characters in the movie to be exactly like in the monthly Spider-man books. I myself have been reading him for over 25 yrs, but I think that Sam Rami had done a great job making these characters fresh and stand out for a new generation. I think it is hard to make these characters exactly the same. I think everyone from the small children to senior citizens can go to this movie and enjoy this."
"tribute_me","1","22","48","7 May 2007"," Waste of time and money
","Spiderman 1 and 2 what can be said they were great films worthy and true to the comics. However Spiderman 3 is one of the worst films i have ever seen to be honest it is terrible. The film struggles to make clear partition between action, comedy and musical, with Kursten Dunst having two singing numbers in the film one wonders is she trying to launch a singing career.<br/><br/>The comedy was the worst with the audience bursting into laughter but at the end of the film no one could remember why.<br/><br/>Acting, well what can be said besides what acting , at best it was wooden with Toby McGuire's illusive fake wide eyes looking like he was high through out the film and Kursten Dunst's fake crying where all you can see is her second chin wobble below her jaw.<br/><br/>The action when it arrives is good, very stylised but it lacks continuity. The fight scenes are over to fast except for the last one which just keeps on going as all the audience are on the edge of their seats to leave the cinema because they have been bored all the way through.<br/><br/>Listening to the audience leave the cinema, showed how terrible this film is. All were complaining that it was too long, there are two many bad guys non with particularly great motives.<br/><br/>In conclusion all i can say is save your money, this film shows me why people download movies because they save money on ridiculously expensive tickets and they don't have to sit through 2 and a half hours of an emo peter parker! Well Done Sam Raimi you ruined the trilogy!"
"colinw92","10","16","33","4 May 2007"," Awesome flick
","If you get the chance to see Spidey 3 this week, please do. This is the best spidey yet, in my opinion. All questions are answered, and you are told why for almost everything. With massive battles, and a great twist at the end, this movie is a keeper for sure. The special effects are amazing, and the villains are developed exceptionally well. The plot is great, and just different enough from the cartoon and comics that it keeps even an educated spidey fan guessing and on the edge of their seats. Again, please see this movie, even if your not the biggest marvel fan. It is well worth your money!!! Looking forward to spidey 4 (fingers crossed.)"
"mmossa9999","10","11","21","7 May 2007"," This film deserves anything but hate!
","This film had so many things in which it was excellent and a bit unexpected. The good parts were as follows: 1. Brilliant fights. if you ignore the everything but the fights, you can call this one of the best films ever.<br/><br/>2.The effects. This film far by has the best special effects ever which explains it to be the current most expensive film.<br/><br/>3. The acting. Not the best but still enough to give credit to the cast.<br/><br/>4. The plot. At least this did follow what was in the comic, eddie brock getting fired and angry with rival parker, the black parasites weakness was revealled to be fire and sonics.<br/><br/>5. The comedy. Plenty of humour in certain parts particularly the french waiter.<br/><br/>The only negative parts is that : There are too many story lines at once. There were was one about gwen stacy, one about harry, one about maryjane, one about eddie brock, one about the black parasite and one about sandman. when the film talks about each, the story is qiute rushed and there is not enough for each. The best thing they could have done was to allow maybe 3 story lines particularly about eddie brock (or sandman if you like), one about the parasite and one about MJ. They could have left harry a little later as he is a close character, leave out Gwen Stacy as it would make it too dramatic and save one of sandman or eddie brock for the next film.<br/><br/>Also with all the people screaming ""spiderman"", this makes the film a bit too comical, but at least people can see that he is a hero and not a vigilante as what jameson always thinks.<br/><br/>Conclusion: this film is a blockbuster and you will be thrilled from the action. Overall this is as good as the first but not as good as the second. If you have read the comic, then you will understand better. 7/10"
"Mcdizzlemaster","1","11","21","4 May 2007"," Waste of Time and Money
","Personally I thought that this movie was absolutely horrible and a complete waste of my night. They turned a good franchise into what seems to be a repeat of the Matrix. I mean come on, this movie had every tool available to make it a great movie and they really just screwed it up. The guy before me who said the only people who wouldn't like this movie was a spoiled child really doesn't understand the meaning of the word apparently. Somehow they took one the the greatest super villains of all time (Venom) and turned him into a little wuss that just wants to cry about everything. If I remember correctly Venom took the Host of Eddie Brock who was a HUGE X-con that really didn't like anyone. Not a tiny kid who works for the paper and cheats to get ahead in life. Personally I think a Pro wrestler such as John Cena, or Goldberg would have better suited for the part. Topher Grace does not in any way live up to the Venom Legacy. Not to mention that they Kill off venom in this movie, even though he really was one of the better matches of Spiderman. If they even attempt to make another sequel they are really running into a dead end because without Venom was possibly the greatest Villain that spidy ran into. And without Venom the only other real super villain that could be considered absolutely awesome would be Carnage and without Venom spider man can't beat him. <br/><br/>But besides the obvious misunderstanding of Venom himself, when did Spiderman decide that it was alright to hang upside down and cheat on his clearly more attractive, more interesting girlfriend in front of the whole world. Then her to become a cheating skank and do it right back. If you say that, that just adds to the plot, you pretty much are just proving to me that the plot to begin with was terrible and they were just making it worse. Oh and when ever even with the help of Venom did Spiderman turn into an Emo kid who has a taste for 70's music and can now play the piano like he has been doing it for 20 years. They really just pulled all of that out of left field, and even if it had some bearing on anything, they could have at least tried to put some reference to it in the movie so we knew some how or why. <br/><br/>All in all the only part that I even found decent about the movie was that they used Bruce Campbell and he was a great comic relief. Oh and I forgot about one thing, since when does everyone including spider man, Venom, and even the Sandman feel that crying like little girls adds to their character. My friend said it best in the Theater, they might as well have had Barny the Dinosaur come out and give them all a hug. So in conclusion my personal opinion is that the movie sucked and was not worth my money or my night. And I know I wasn't alone, in fact I have been to a lot of movie premiers and normally there is somewhat of a applause or even a standing ovation at the end. But everyone in the theater I was in Booed the movie and you better believe that I joined in. My advice is don't pay to see it, wait until you can see it for free or just don't see it you might be better off letting the second one be the end."
"fotboll_superman","8","11","21","4 May 2007"," Awesome! Really awesome!
","I cannot see how anyone can avoid this movie! It's the best Spider-Man movie because it tells you everything there is to tell. It has everything: lies,action,deception,drama...romance. And one character in the movie that is great is Venom, I will not describe him for you,because that will spoil the thrill. One other character you will see change during the movie is Harry...and he's also great,for me he's almost as great as Venom. I think that this movie completes the trilogy...I don't want to see one more because there is nothing to tell, or is it??? But anyway...see the movie it's really great! Believe me!"
"schmidt897","1","11","21","4 May 2007"," Did that just happen?
","I went into the movie with some high expectations aside from knowing that they were twisting the story pretty far to make Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben. But this was SO far from what it should have been. Turning the entire creation of the black suit/Venom from an interesting story to a four second blurb was junk.<br/><br/>The way I feel about this is everyone knows Spiderman and most people know a lot about Spiderman's story. The way they changed the story for this would be like having Jesus ride a Harley into the sunset at the end of Passion of the Christ.<br/><br/>The special effects were great if you can look past the obvious flaws and seeing equipment in shots.<br/><br/>Also, don't sit too close to the screen. Spiderman's tears might get on you every other scene.<br/><br/>I think the only enjoyable part of this movie was another fine cameo by Bruce Cambell. Well done, sir!"

","45 Years Ago Stan Lee created what would become the most successful Superhero in all History:Spider-Man. <br/><br/>With abilities that all of us would like to have,Spidey gathered millions of fans as the years came by. <br/><br/>The Story was captivating,the Villains tough,the Moves Cool and Mary Jane nice.<br/><br/>Spider-Man represented the superhero in all of us.<br/><br/>He wasn't an alien from another planet,he wasn't a rich businessman,but the Guy next door.<br/><br/>The Shy Guy,that rarely talks and is considered boring,but that when the moment comes,changes his personality and his alter ego saves the day.<br/><br/>Yes,Spider-Man came closer to teen fans more than the other superheroes exactly because of this:He was just a student,with lots of problems,exactly like most of his readers.<br/><br/>Years passed and the period when superheroes started appearing on the big screen came. <br/><br/>Due to the complexity of Spidey's moves,every attempt to create a Spider-Man movie failed.<br/><br/>All Up to 2002,when at last a man took Up the Challenge. <br/><br/>This man was Sam Raimi(the director of The Evil Dead).<br/><br/>The timing was right,since this is the age of special effects and almost everything can now be turned into a movie,and thus the movie was a success for a first try and fans were pleased.<br/><br/>2 Years Later,Spider-Man 2 was even better,with more action and a greater villain.<br/><br/>However,it was clear the the first two movies were just warming up. Raimi hadn't unleashed his best yet. <br/><br/>Now he has.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 isn't only a great sequel,it's the best Spider-Man ever.<br/><br/>The reasons are obvious. <br/><br/>We got even more action-packed scenes. <br/><br/>The story is as good as the ones before.<br/><br/>All actors give good performances and manage to bring,yet again,the comic book to life.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is lovely as MJ. <br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard makes a hot appearance as Gwen Stacy,Parker's 2nd love interest. <br/><br/>All this and a Cameo from Bruce Campbell(Ash from The Evil Dead)makes the movie nice.<br/><br/>But those reasons are not enough to make it more special than the other Spider-man movies.<br/><br/>What is it Then?<br/><br/>The Villains of course! How can't a Spider-Man movie be good,since it features 3 villains at the same time?<br/><br/>We got Spidey's childhood friend Harry Osborn,who follows in the footsteps of his father and becomes the evil Hobgoblin(or New Goblin as mentioned on IMDb) and makes the skies insecure as he flies menaciously.<br/><br/>Then we Got the Evil Sandman,who makes for a great enemy. <br/><br/>How can u beat a man made out of sand,who can regenerate every part of his body? Well,you'll have to find out in cinemas.<br/><br/>But the show is truly stolen by the Great Venom! <br/><br/>Combined with an alien symbiotic costume,Eddie Brock finally becomes Spider-Man's strongest(and scariest)enemy.<br/><br/>Almost all the merit for the greatness of this movies goes to him. <br/><br/>Ever since I first saw Venom in the animated television series,I couldn't help but doubt and dream how would he be in a possible movie.<br/><br/>At last my wish came true. <br/><br/>Venom looked awesome on screen,I couldn't have imagined him better. He will surely be this year's best CGI character.<br/><br/>To Sum Up,Spider-Man 3 is not only one of this summer's best movies,it is also the best Spider-Man yet.<br/><br/>Fans of Spider-Man 3,watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>With Venom finally alive,this movie is Not to Be Missed."

","I thought the movie was great. I was disturbed by some of the laughing from the audience at key points. There were a lot of moments in the movies that asked its audience for emotion. Maybe too many for some people. I felt like this required knowledge from the previous two movies. The characters were built really well through the three movies and I felt like this one had rights to ask emotion from us. I guess I can be a sappy guy or hopeless romantic. Whatever you want to call it. I did enjoy the movie throughly. I don't know if I gave it the emotion that Mr. Raimi was looking for. I was on the verge of tears at some point but just the verge. All in all I would say its worth the price of admission. Great action sequences and great build up of the characters. Don't know if we need another but I guess that will be up to Tobey, Kirstin, Sam and the rest. Hope you find this useful."

And I did get some great seats, right in the front center, but honestly the only amazing part of this film are trailers beforehand. The entire second act is ruined by Toby McGuire's non-ability to play the part dramatically as well as the fact that it seems to be a played out like a scene from West Side Story. While the overall terribleness of this film was sealed with the fact that Venom had at most 5 minutes of screen time. Save your money and wait until this film comes out on DVD."
"DICK STEEL","10","13","26","1 May 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Spider-Man 3
","Spider-Man 3 ushers in this year's many sequels in what would be a crowded blockbuster summer, but the question on everyone's lips is, with so many villains he's up against, will our friendly neighborhood arachnid prevail the movie sequel curse - that with many villains and being the third superhero movie in the franchise, it will most certainly be a dud and a victim of its own success? Sam Raimi will have none of that, and found a special x-factor from within his own Spidey movie franchise to ensure sustainability. And it worked great.<br/><br/>Superior sequels are a tough act to follow, and only a handful managed to survive the fatigue. It's not about putting in better effects, or introducing new and more powerful villains, but rather about the characters whom we have followed through from the previous movies. Here, we continue our journey with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco), their love hate relationship with one another, and the will they or won't they situations. Having the creative team return (sans Danny Elfman for the score) and the principal cast intact ensured no continuity issues, which have casted a shadow on and doomed many other superhero productions like DC's Superman-Chris Reeves franchise, or the Batman one started by Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Instead of relying on fluffy showmanship on the latest progression of how Spidey swings through Manhattan, and the temptation to shift all its grandeur action pieces to top gear, Spider-Man 3 actually had its characters spend much of their time out of costumes. Which is great, except for those impatient to get things going. It allowed for plenty of space for character development, a continuation of the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane, which on the previous movie's final scene, seemed to have an ominous feeling hung overhead.<br/><br/>And yes, things are not going well for our couple. One's a public figure behind a mask, getting plenty of adulation from the common man on the street, while the other, still a struggling artiste in a cold unforgiving city. For Peter Parker, he's thrilled to have people celebrate his prowess, and allowed for success to get to his nerdy head. A nerd getting all the attention, certainly puts him a bit out of whack. He hardly listens, and the keyword here is listen (take note, important to sustain relationship lesson abound), to his partner, and becomes emotionally unavailable, especially when she most needs him. And with miscommunication or the lack thereof, jealousy comes in the form of hot blonde bombshell Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), with whom Peter violates a special bond between him and Mary Jane at the heat of the moment (ok, all those who think it's being petty, might want to rethink that again).<br/><br/>As a reminder, this is not the comic's Spider-Man. If it is, then Peter won't have organic web-shooters. So don't go all rile about Gwen's introduction at this stage of the franchise. It's her on screen, so celebrate that instead. Although she's a bit role, I thought Bryce Dallas Howard allowed fan boys to salivate at the prospect of having Gwen Stacy feature heavily in possible future movies. If Kirsten Dunst wish to bury her Mary Jane Watson aside, the franchise can definitely move on with Bryce stepping in with her Gwen, even though this time the comic time line will totally go out of sync. But to be fair to Dunst, her Mary Jane almost always have nothing much to do when Spidey's in costume, unless she decides to challenge for scream queen honors. It's again the same old damsel in distress the character finds herself in for a fair bit, and there's certainly a number of times where you can be held hostage, before some smart alec will deduce the reason why."

Yes i agree with the critics, 3 stars suits the features of the film. It was a excellent, awesome, and hilarious film but some parts i LOVED, and others i didn't care for. Many things were packed into this film, and my favorite was the Spider-Man and Venom conflict, by far. Even though the film did a great job on the special effects, i mean a fabulous job, Venom should have been bigger and more muscular. My two favorite characters were the Anti-Spidey and Venom, the two funny characters in the film: Ant-spidey, funny and selfish, Venom/Eddie Brock, selfish with self centered funny comments. Go see this film, but get to the theater 1 hour and 20 minutes early, for parking, waiting in line for tickets, getting a satisfactory seat, going to the bathroom and getting you concession stand food and drink. Once the movie starts, enjoy the action, drama, and selfish humor that makes the spidey franchise what it is, i mean you always have to have at least one funny villain.

It seems like the writers got drunk, had an orgy and then decided to play a joke on America by writing the worst dialogue I've heard in a very long time.<br/><br/>Seeing my favorite Marvel villain, Venom brought to life almost made it worth it, but the character was short-lived, and had so much more potential.<br/><br/>do yourself a favor and just watch the first two instead."

","So, yeah, perhaps the worst eight dollars I've spent in five years. It was boring, hokey, and cheesy all at the same time. The use of horrible jazz scenes, the predictably cheesy lines in the final battle, and the increasingly awkward romance between Dunst and Maguire made me want to vomit. It was uncomfortable sitting there and watching it. It was like Raimi took the cheesy/quirky aspects of Army of Darkness, which made it a B movie classic, and tried to mesh them with a darker, more serious Spider-Man. Honestly, he ought to be ashamed of himself. As should Stan Lee. On a high note, Bruce Campbell is hysterical in it. His French accent was awful, but he pulled it off nicely. Although maybe I'm lenient on him because of nostalgia."

","awful acting, story and pacing. Its far too slow, it bores you to tears, its too long, the amount of disgracefully cheesy lines makes you shudder. The typical Hollywood ending on this is a disgrace. This film should not have been made, it will make money on hype only. you have to be a fool to enjoy this, as anyone can clump together a few good CGI shots nowadays and call it a film. Unfortunately, i cant call what i just saw a film. Kirsten Dunst looks nowhere near as good as she did in the first 2 films, Tobey Maguire still hasn't learnt to act and some of the plots are ludicrous. The only saving grace is, in fact, Topher Grace, who is the only character to have any sort of enthusiasm. Just...no"

","This film is being marked down harshly for it's need to re-write Spiderman 1.<br/><br/>We saw who killed Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>But suddenly the writer felt the need to invent a totally new person who had killed Uncle Ben, rewrote his already well established death and then have that person being a convicted criminal on the run. Wouldn't the very first place the police look be his old home? The open to the air particle accelerator was a laughable plot device too. He'd have been torn to pieces by the sand.<br/><br/>Along with the really bad science that a carbon based life form can be transformed into a silicon based life form.<br/><br/>The whole new Green Goblin angle was really poorly explored and the question of where the new Goblin gadgets came from wasn't answered.<br/><br/>The feel to introduce a new love interest in Gwen was pretty pointless, even if it did mirror a scene from a previous movie. I personally always thought Venom was Spiderman taken over. Not this Brock person, whoever he was.<br/><br/>The films set pieces are incredibly weak, ambling from big fight to big fight with no point or reason at all.<br/><br/>The film is heavy on action and special effects but very low on story, plot and any attempt to further the Spiderman movie series.<br/><br/>Watch with brain turned off."

","Quite the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to pay money to see, at one point a cheesy comedy, the next a strange kind of musical threaded through with an unbearably patriotic 'we all love the USA' theme. Not to mention the laughable 'evil peter Parker' dancing down the street like an idiot scene. The plot was hard to follow from start to finish even with knowledge of the first two films (who's only saving grace is that they were hardly as bad as the new one!) and was overly complicated by having two bad guys and a string of moral and romantic dilemma's all running at once. The cgi for such a high budget film was unconvincing, but was it supposed to be realistic? Maybe not but it should have been. There's only so much thread shooting and swinging from buildings that an audience can take. One positive: The police chiefs daughter was quite hot."
"beeks21","10","10","19","6 May 2007"," What I thought of the third installment of Spider-man
","I know some people are ready to say they expected more from Spider-man 3, that the story line had no direction, but to those who have paid attention to the comic book, or even the cartoon as kids you know the story and I for one was thrilled to see it on the big screen! Because no mater what the bad guys will keep on showing up and Spidey will keep on knocking them down. The producers managed to keep it close to the comic's script and made the Sandman, the New Green Goblin (Jr.) and Venom come to life the same as they did with the original Green Goblin and Doc Ock. The struggles Peter had with the Black Suit were well put together right down to the bell tower in the church and Brocks transformation into Venom was remarkable. I also appreciated that they made Parker a little more complete with more of the witty remarks for this film than the others and in doing so managed to make you laugh, and that even with Harry's death in the end you are relieved by knowing that he and Peter were friends again without secrets, and no more lies. It's just a shame these movies take so long to produce and that the cast may not return because I for one would love to see more. Definitely need to see this one in theaters to do it justice."
"alex_t4444","3","12","24","9 May 2007"," A weak effort by all involved
","The first two Spiderman films, the second especially encapsulated everything that a superhero film should. Drama, excitement, incredible action scenes, good triumphing over adversity and so on. The third failed on all of these levels. Firstly it took ages to get going and was overly sentimental, secondly it had too many villains and as a result failed to develop any of them fully, thirdly the action scenes were poorly choreographed and confusing, fourthly...you get the picture.<br/><br/>It seems as though Raimi wanted to include as much as possible in as short amount of time as possible which resulted in glaring inconsistencies, weak character development and many unexplained occurrences.

It doesn't take itself seriously, e.g. Spidey:""Where do these guys come from?"" The design of the whole movie is breathtaking and I couldn't believe it. The trilogy is complete and every single movie exceeded the one before it, so the question is : Can you beat this film?

"skymovies","7","14","29","28 April 2007"," Some new additions but Web 3.0's no upgrade
","Sam Raimi's Web version 3.0 proves that  like the increasingly shoddy sequels to Batman - when it comes to comic book villains, less is more. Really, does anyone remember anything that Two-Face and Poison Ivy actually did? After building his rollicking action empire with tight, one-on-one contests between our friendly neighbourhood hero and his nemeses, Raimi falls into the trap of taking Spider-Man 3 a villain too far. It has nothing to do with the CG qualities of either Sandman or Venom (they're as well-rendered as you'd expect from the next instalment of an $800million franchise). It's simply that the film introduces so many problems for Peter Parker to deal with, it doesn't fully focus on any.<br/><br/>On the verge of proposing to Mary Jane, Peter is so caught up in his own hype that he has become a self-absorbed prat. Outwardly, they're fine, but he is so busy enjoying the adulation and attention - hey, police chief's daughter Gwen Stacy, how YOU doin'? - that he's oblivious to any problems MJ might have.<br/><br/>And anyway, there's also some unfinished business with Harry 'Goblin Jr' Osborne, cocky photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after his job at the Bugle, and convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is now a much bigger problem than when he first escaped after having his DNA replaced with sand. The guy's a walking building site.<br/><br/>Then a black goo from outer space which feeds on human aggression (drug metaphor ahoy!) transforms Peter into a swaggering, greasy-fringed idiot - like a member of The Killers who's seen Saturday Night Fever too many times.<br/><br/>But his turn to the dark side is reflected in the spider-suit's cool new look which is later adopted by Brock when the terrible treacle turns him into Venom. Let's get ready for a tag-team rumble Needless to say, it all looks fantastic. But, for all its impressive, whiplash-inducing set-pieces, jokey interludes, cute cameos (including Bruce Campbell as a Pythonesque maitre d') and general vertiginous pizazz, the plot regularly loses momentum.<br/><br/>How many messages on commitment, redemption and doing the right thing does one film need? What's with the ridiculous climactic commentary from that TV reporter with the bad English accent and her geriatric, googly-eyed anchorman? Would Bryce Dallas Howard like to give me a call the next time she has this little to do in a movie? Like Spidey himself, Raimi appears to have gotten carried away by the success of his previous exploits. Webby 3.0 certainly gives you plenty of whiz-bang for your buck, but it doesn't get that spider sense tingling."

","I rather liked the first two films, and I understand that this is a big, colourful blockbuster sort of a movie, but when exactly did Sam Raimi just stop caring? A dreadful script mixed with radical changes of pace (it's an action film! No, it's a screwball comedy! Now it's a darkly psychological drama! No, now it's a song-and-dance extravaganza!), combined with Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst and Topher Grace all competing to out-suck one another all adds up to a film that is both poorly executed and - bizarrely, given the subject matter - deathly dull. Not even the special effects are that glittering. JK Simmons, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell make it almost worth watching bits of, but a better evening's entertainment could be had slamming one's genitals in a car door. The dialogue would certainly be better."
"davepotwin","6","6","10","7 May 2007"," The formula that could have saved Spiderman
","By just following these simple steps, the recipe for disaster that is Spiderman 3 can be saved.<br/><br/>Step 1. Remove the Sandman character, as there was no need for it in the film. His motives were weak (saving his daughter)? His actions were none like that in the comic books- as a hardened criminal, not the big softy portrayed. You snuck his character into his uncles death scene... now you can sneak him out.<br/><br/>Step 2. Focus on Venom as your main villain, but involve more back story on the birth of venom, not just some blob that randomly drops from space and just so happens to want to symbian itself to a suit.<br/><br/>Step 3. Replace Topher Grace with Scott Caan. The character Eddie Brock was a muscle bound, cocky Olympian who when he wasn't taking photos, was always working out. I also found it inaccurate that when Tobey wore the suit, he was the same form, but when Topher wears it, he became twice the size. Besides, Scott Caan is always up for picking a fight with anyone.. he was born for the role of Venom.<br/><br/>Step 4. Stop with the ""chick flick"" everyone crying bit. Every, I mean, EVERY character cried before the end of the film. The movie is based on a comic.. ""THERE's NO CRYING IN COMICS.."" At least not this much.<br/><br/>Step 5. If your going to do cheesy dance sequences that have no relevance to the movie.. Hire Jim Carey and call it ""The Mask 3"". Bruce Campbell is all the comedic humor the series has ever needed, otherwise stick to the formula.. - Good guys kick bad guy ass.. Insert witty one liner.. Done.- <br/><br/>Step 6. Remove the final scene and create something for a ""hero"". The whole basis for the character is that they are super(HERO'S) that save the public from crime and avenge justice. Fighting each other on a construction building had no relevance to saving anyone but Mary Jane. The first movie introduced the role, it's villain, and created the hero that you looked forward to seeing save the day. The second film took it one step further (ie. the train scene- The best comic hero sequence I've ever seen) and made Spiderman not only save a few lives, but those of the whole city in the end. But in this third installment, there is no major threat to the community, except for the cheesy crowd shots and news reports to a finale that was nothing but personal vendetta for the ""super"" hero's.<br/><br/>All in all, these steps could have saved the film and possibly worked itself into a fourth and fifth reprise. But for the first time, I am actually hoping these don't happen, just like a certain Batman series that went to hell after the second film. Leave well enough alone."

","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")"

","Ahhh Spiderman.... It is a good story with a great hero, with a normal guy getting powers and using them to help the greater good. And the first two movies depicting this great hero did a great job. But in this case 1+2 = 0. SPiderman 3 was the worst movie i have seen in the last 6 months. And believe me i have seen some stinkers. <br/><br/>With the cheesy story to the mildly crappy CGI I could not have been more disappointed. I laughed at the ""serious"" parts, and almost threw up when Tobey Maguire tried to be some weird emo kid. Come on... Who wrote this script, was it a 4th grader. I think some elementary school had a project to make a spoof of a movie that they like and some genius kid made this hilarious spoof of Sipderman. Unfornately the studio thought this was a legitimate script and ran with it. If this was the ""darker"" of the three movies, why no blood, no hardcore violence, and why the weird French restaurant.<br/><br/>The whole time watching this movie i was waiting for the actors to just come out with it and say this movie was a joke. I was waiting for them to say that the new corny SNL put them up to it and they caved. <br/><br/>Spiderman three had great potential but it failed miserably. Topher Grace was the only remotely good thing in that movie but they killed him ""literally"". <br/><br/>And how can Thomas Haden Church go from Sideways to this. It seemed like he just took his brain and pumped it into his muscles, pathetic. <br/><br/>I lost sleep over this movie even though i didn't get out of this cornfest until1:30 and yet i was kept awake.

","I went into the cinema expecting a crap film after reading several reviews and some user comments, but I found the film to be better than the first two films in some ways. This was not like your usual spider-man film as it contained a lot more humour and daft scenes that were not necessary, also some scenes were done but not done with enough detail. For example, the scenes where the symbiote crash lands on a meteor seems out of place as it happens right next to peter and mj - without them realising! Also, the whole sandman killing uncle Ben is put straight in and (the most important some might say) venom's transformation happened with about 50 mins left of the film however he only fully appeared with about 30 mins to go. Venom's fight with spidey is cut short and should have been a lot longer but hey, we got venom in the movie and he was done pretty well. Some people are saying that the scenes with ""Emo"" peter are poor and pointless, but it is only showing what the symbiote has done to peter and how his behaviour changes. At my cinema the whole audience applauded at the end, although the slow beginning (that was probably building up to the battle royal at the end)- which was well worth the admission price- the film does get better and i would say that it is only slightly worse (overall) than spidey 2. I give the film 8 out of 10 for the superb battle scenes and for the way that it builds up the finale (minus the pathetic news report of fight at the end)plus the emotion at the end. I hope that if they do another film, then they allow some more time to develop scenes, etc before going all out for the action - still a great film though."

","Brothers and sisters of IMDb<br/><br/>After so many years of trusting your judgement in categorising the ""truly awesome"" over the ""truly awful"" in the world of film, I am shocked and stunned by your rating of this absolute stinker of a movie. How enough of you have voted it into the region of 7/10 is an utter mystery to me and in writing this article, I feel like the only sane voice in an insane world.<br/><br/>Just to say it out loud - this film was to the Superhero genre what David Hasslehoff is to pop music - an embarrassment. (Sorry Hoff, you are a legend but only the Germans are tone deaf enough to buy any of your records - stick to TV, the camera loves you).<br/><br/>I for one did not go to the cinema yesterday and part with nearly £30 (allowing for fiancée in tow and the usual mortgage to buy a small coke and popcorn) to see a horrendous love story, crammed full of nauseating schmaltz about the love between a man and a woman, a man and his friend, a man and his aunt, a different man and his sick daughter, a spider and a gooey black alien, etc. etc. I paid that money to see Spiderman kick some ass, rescue a bunch of people, throw around some really heavy stuff with his super strength, and generally save the day.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started about the ""humour"" that was attempted within the film. On what felt like at least a dozen occasions I found myself sliding out of my seat, trying to hide myself from the rest of the audience in case anyone recognised me watching the worst film of 2007 (it would have been the worst film of the last decade, were it not for ""The Thin Red Line"" - 1998).<br/><br/>For anyone planning to make a Superhero film from here on in, do yourself (and more importantly the rest of us) a favour, and do two things. First, watch Batman Begins, then, phone Christopher Nolan and ask him to Direct your movie. That is the kind of gritty, action packed film people want to see, with an excellent script and perhaps most importantly, a plot.<br/><br/>I was going to end this article, Spiderman R.I.P., but Batman was salvaged so there is hope, but the current franchise has certainly sent Spidey towards the plug hole......."

","Why do people ALWAYS compare sequels from the original? It HAS to be different and original at the same time. Peter as the emo flirting punk? Funny, yes. But it adds depth and twist to the story. That phase was so important for the evolution of the character. I agree that it needs more Venom, but he doesn't actually fit to the ""revenge is a poison"" theme of the movie as much as Harry and Sandman's portrayal. He was there for the sake of marvel comics readers, and to attract those guys who are just starting to know the story. It would be nice to see Venom appear on Spider Man 4, as the main badass villain. Harry's change of heart at the end is foreseeable though and he died as most fans expected."

"Monotreme02","4","13","27","5 May 2007"," Disappointing - overdone, underdeveloped and just plain lazy
","Everything that was good in Spider-Man 2 was completely undone in this installment, although its biggest flaws lie in its screenplay. As I had feared from the moment the first plot details were released, the film is way too cluttered. We jump from storyline to storyline, character to character; each so condensed in order to fit into the runtime that none are nearly as developed as they should have been. The biggest problem is that most of them seem entirely unnecessary. Harry's story, for instance, feels like it was included because the makers set up his villain for the third film at the end of the second and had no choice, and from there was just made up as they went along. Harry ends up dying way too many times and then unexplainably returning; his amnesia is utterly pointless since he ends up remembering everything, and couldn't Bernard have told him about his father's fate earlier and saved him all the grief? Gwen Stacy is almost entirely unused and is even less developed. I'm trying to remember if she had any important part in the film at all except for being part of various action sequences and nothing comes up. I honestly can barely see how the film would have changed had her character been removed completely, and she appears for so little time that we barely even know who her character is. The Flint Marko/Sandman character is also disappointingly underdeveloped. Instead of crafting a totally rounded, character-driven villain like Doc Ock in the second film, Raimi creates a totally flat and uninteresting villain who pretty much has just this one little banal reason as his motive for evil and has nothing else going for him. There are also various plot elements that just seem way too hackneyed and ridiculous you wonder if Raimi has learned any lessons from the failed comic book movies of the past. And when Harry joins forces with Spider-Man and the two literally hold hands and fight evil, I was reminded of how the introduction of the Robin character was clearly the straw that broke the camel that is the Batman franchise's back.<br/><br/>In terms of drama and setting, Raimi effectively chucks into the rubbish bin everything he built so well in Spider-Man 2 in terms of characters, dynamics, drama and realism and replaces them with banal, clichéd and corny material that is so over-done it comes across as worse than a daytime soap. Pretty much every character in the film cries more than once, and for the most ridiculous reasons. I was seriously right about ready to leave the theatre, go into the bathroom, return with a box of tissues and chuck it at the screen. And after having seen Spider-Man 2, I thought that Raimi knew that drama doesn't mean you need to have everyone sobbing about everything.<br/><br/>The film is also strangely disappointing even in the action department, and although the film is saturated with action scenes, none of them are nearly well thought out or executed well enough to have left any lasting impression at all. This is in contradiction to the action scenes in Spider-Man 2, which are some of the most memorable, well-executed and just plain fantastic in the entire genre - in particular, the train fight with Doc Ock but also others.<br/><br/>But the film doesn't disappoint in every aspect; there are some fields in which Raimi and his crew really hith the nail on the head. I actually liked what he did with Mary Jane's character, it's just too bad that he botched up Peter Parker's character so much that the dynamics between the two don't work at all. Also, Bruce Campbell's cameo in the film is by far his best in the trilogy and possibly the funniest part of all three films. But the single best element of the entire film was the character of Eddie Brock/Venom. Topher Grace is easily the best newcomer to the cast and may be the best cast villain of all three films. He has impeccable comic timing and makes Eddie Brock immediately likable and believable. And the character of Venom is, to begin with, a fascinating villain. But once again Raimi makes a crucial mistake and reduces Venom's part to miniscule proportions  the villain is only first introduced in the final act of the film, instead of being built up beforehand.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Spider-Man 3 has turned out to be a major disappointment. I can easily point at two primary reasons why the film failed to deliver. The first is laziness  Raimi and crew were simply too lazy to craft anything nearly as good or interesting as the previous installments, especially Spider-Man 2. The film is under whelming in nearly every aspect  character development and drama become flat, banal, clichéd and soapy; the action and visual style are uninspired and unimpressive; and the film's finale is probably the most unimaginative and uninteresting of all three films. On top of that, the second reason the film disappointed was that Raimi attempted to cram every plot line and character he possibly could into the film. This creates a jumbled, lazy mess that is really all over the place. The structure makes no sense, characters are painfully underdeveloped and don't get nearly enough screen time, and the whole thing just explodes in a shower of incoherency and detachment. Had the film focused exclusively on Venom, excluding both the Harry and especially the Sandman characters, perhaps it would have worked; that way, Raimi would have had more time to develop Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy, and we would have been able to see more of Venom, who was surprisingly absent for the majority of the film and is removed from the picture just barely after he first shows up. And the high hopes I had from Raimi and the crew after the outstanding achievement that was Spider-Man 2 make the debacle all the more disappointing."
"moviefan1725-1","5","11","22","6 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3....the web snaps, and brings us down with it.
","Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie. Just a mediocre one. Very much a been there, done that experience. The problems are many: 1. There is very little actual Spider-Man in the movie. For a movie that is almost 2 and a half hours long, do you realize that Spider-Man himself appears on screen for a mere 25 minutes total? How do I know? Well, I have a copy of it, timed all the various times he appears on screen, and added it up. 25 minutes. Sorry Tobey Maguire, but your Peter Parker is not a very interesting character. Three movies in, and you should have evolved beyond the whiny geek you were in the first movie. No change at all. In fact I think Peter cries more in this movie than in the first one. 2. Sam Raimi has said in public that he does not like the character of Venom. Among fans however, he's a favorite. Many, I'm sure, actually like him MORE than Spider-Man. Since Raimi doesn't, he does not do the character justice. On screen, he's never referred to as Venom, never refers to himself as ""We"", thus eliminating the whole purpose of the symbiote existence. The goo is attracted to rage and negative feelings? Great. They took the pink slime from Ghostbusters II and turned it black. Venom was what the majority of fans were looking forward to in this movie. But we're given the scrawny Topher Grace giving a performance almost as whiny as Tobey (""Do you remember how you hurt me?""). He's never shown as being as evil and as powerful as he is, even needing Sandman's help to defeat Spider-Man. Yeah. OK. Raimi obviously gave in to studio pressure to include Venom. His heart wasn't in it. 3. Sandman is not a very interesting villain. We're never given any reason for Spider-Man to root against him. The scene with his daughter establishes the fact that he's not a bad person. So when it's said that he really killed Uncle Ben, any person with a modicum of common sense will instantly realize that his death was an accident. They show Peter's nightmares about what happened, but the intelligent moviegoer knows that that's not how it happened. So Sandman's confession at the end is just another reason for Tobey to cry. Plus, he lets Sandman go! He just flies off. What? The death of Uncle Ben may have been an accident, but he's still a criminal. He hurt several people, including police officers, since his escape. So...Spidey will let a criminal go as long as he hasn't done anything to him personally? Sandman's storyline is never resolved, so in the end, there was no point of him being in the movie to begin with. 4. The absence of previous screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. They are the creators of Smallville. Both with Smallville and in their Spidey 2 script, they showed that they have a real gift of knowing the characters, and developing them properly. Their absence on Smallville is felt in the current hit or miss season. It's also felt in Spidey 3 because Raimi and his brother are only slightly better screenwriters than George Lucas. They have no real grasp on character development. Tobey Maguire has not matured at all as Peter or Spider-Man. Mary Jane was at her most annoying in this movie. She says to Peter ""Everything is not about you"", but it's her that seems to have that attitude. ""I got fired. Pity me."" With Harry Osbourne, we get the cruelest injustice of all...amnesia. It is one of the oldest, and poorest excuses for conflict in a script. His friend-turned enemy-turned friend-turned enemy-turned friend routine in this movie is cheesy and manipulative, because we know it won't last. The resolution to the whole this is far to convenient, and a sell out. I've already said the problems with the handling of the villains, so there's no reason to go into that. 5. The visual effects. They were bad. There's no two ways about it. The backgrounds never fit in with characters in close up. This is especially evident in the fight between Peter and Harry. It SCREAMED blue screen. The CGI doubles for the actors always looked rubbery, and never looked convincing. 6. The movie ends on a down note. It's supposed to be a heroic movie. Even if you look at this as a trilogy, the second act (Spidey 2) is the one that is supposed to end a down note, to be redeemed by the end of the third movie. Here, we don't even get Spidey's triumphant swinging across the city, which in my opinion, is as necessary as Superman's flight over the earth at the end of his movies. Here we get yet ANOTHER sequence of Peter and Mary Jane staring silently at each other (which I had enough of even before the end of Spidey 2), before slow dancing into a fadeout of Peter's solemn face. HUH? Nothing like sending the audience out depressed. Now the movie has opened to $148 million in it's opening weekend. In all probability, it will gross more than $300 million. Problem is, it doesn't deserve it. It opened big because of the popularity of the first two, and some slick marketing by the studio. The product itself doesn't deliver on what was promised. Not by a long shot. Shame. Because it's success will show the studio that they don't even have to try anymore. They can turn out a mediocre product, and the American movie-going public, like the drones they are, will line up, and hand over their money without a thought. So if you, like me, were severely disappointed...be honest. Tell people it's not worth it. Wait for video, because you aren't missing anything. There's nothing here you haven't seen before. Let the second weekend grosses plummet. Show the studio we deserve better than this. Not that they'll listen. But it's worth a try."

I really wanted this movie to be good- not just do well (that was inevitable), but actually be good. But as I sat there watching it, my hopes slipped away.<br/><br/>The movie is overlong. The tone set by 1 & 2 has been lost in a stew of too many subplots, too many Aunt May speeches, and way too much sobbing and fighting between Dunst & Maguire.<br/><br/>Folks, I'm all for character development. I think it's great that Raimi has taken us into Peter Parker's personal life. I really like the fact that he has taken villains to a more human level instead of just making them ""baddies"" a'la Joel Schumacher. However, this thing is a complete jumble. After awhile, I kind of wished Mary Jane would just go away, Harry would die, and we could just get to a good old fashioned Marvel battle between Spidey and Sandman.<br/><br/>It's not all bad here. Praise goes to Thomas Hayden Church. He is probably the best villain in any of the Spidey flicks with Molina pulling a close second. Both of them played the villains as real people not just prancing lunatics in funny costumes. His only problem is he's drastically underused. What a shame! Great effects and an awesome look are cut short for one too many scenes of whiny junior high soap operatics between Peter Parker & MJ.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know what to think of Venom. I like the character but I don't feel he fits in this picture. He's almost like an afterthought, much more suited to be in another Spidey movie as the lone villain.<br/><br/>I was really hoping they would do something worthwhile with Harry Osborn in this one and they blew it. We get a great fight sequence in the beginning, a goofy, ""aw-shucks"" bubble-head for the middle act and finally a complete turn-around for the finale because his butler set everything straight for him?! All mental illness and vengeance cleanly wiped away in one lousy scene. Dumb.<br/><br/>I had to laugh at the ""Evil Peter Parker"" sequence. Not because it was truly funny, but because it reminded me so much of Superman III. Ladies and gentleman, that's just not a good thing to be reminded of.<br/><br/>This picture suffers from too many villains and too much love story crap. I'm hoping that Raimi eases off if there is indeed a Spider-Man 4. We've been teased with Curt Connors for three pictures- lets see what can be done with him and if MJ is out of the picture for awhile, fine.<br/><br/>Right before this came out Kirsten Dunst made a comment along the lines of, ""there would be no Spider-Man movies without Tobey and me."" All she did here was cry, scream, and whine. Tobey Maguire spent more time out of costume than in. Lady, you two can easily be replaced."
"black_wolf_1970","1","5","8","24 May 2007"," Th worst of the worst
","I had high expectations for this film and was so disappointed that I wish I had been unable to go see it because I was down with a case of Plague. It started out OK then blam it all but turned into a combination of subplots that felt like you were riding over a pot hole filled road. Lets see with have The Sandman as a criminal with a bad streak of luck who killed Pete's uncle by accident while trying to steal money to help his dying daughter and gets to walk away free after saying he was sorry. Harry accepts his dad went insane and in trying to kill Pete killed himself and then dies fighting to save Pete holding M J's hand. With have Gwen in this one who was Pete's GF for quite a period of time in the comics until she is killed then he goes to M J, but in this one she lives and is used to hurt M J while under the influence of Venom. Now Venom started out OK but now instead of part of Pete he is just a suit he can take on and off until he tries to reject it. It seemed like they were less trying to put a classic comic to the big screen and falling into the pit of Hollywood to make a big FX movie with bad story and a lot of chick flick tear jerky crap and big action scenes that seemed to have been added just to give the teenage boys some entertainment. I will admit parts were OK but over all this had to be one of the most hyped up and disappointing movies I have screen recently."
"bsuab0","1","5","8","23 May 2007"," Worse film EVER!!
","Please people, do not go and see this film. It literally is the worse film I have ever seen. Some films are so bad they're funny, this one doesn't even manage that. Everyone who had any involvement with this film should hang their heads in shame, as I will be doing for wasting my £4 on a ticket.<br/><br/>For a start, this is supposed to be the most expensive movie ever made, and yet there is nothing remotely new or revolutionary about it, no new graphics or cgi its all been seen before (i'll cast your mind back to the mummy.... it looks like they've used stock footage!) <br/><br/>Next, the jazz club scene.... i'll cast your mind back again to the Mask, its a complete rip off! What else, oh the American flag scene, come on! All in all, i kid you not when i tell you, this is the worse film ever!"
"spaccygirl","1","5","8","22 May 2007"," Almost as bad as The Hulk
","Great special effects but bad story! I didn't care about anyone in this movie, not the guy not the girl. I didn't care if the guy got the girl. Well I did care about one person and largely because he's a very good actor and his character had the most depth, guess who? Harry. He was the only likable character of the main trio. Who else did I like? Gwen & Venom - also more depth. I really liked Venom. It's funny in a movie where you are supposed to be rooting for the heroes I was rooting for Venom and Harry. How odd. If they were to do this movie again, they should get a better story, one where you actually care about the characters. What's with the marriage plot? They are like 25. Average age to get married in this society 30. It was like a plot from 1910 or trying to marry people off at 18. In a movie, movies about marriage don't really cut it unless they are for 12 year olds, epics or romantic comedies with lots of crude fart jokes. I hate when they do this. They did it to superman: lois and clark. That was such a great show but then they tried to make superman a daddy. The action was great in this film but in the final action scene, I found myself saying 'is it over?' why because I didn't care. And also it didn't make sense. I mean Harry lives through being smashed against a brick wall, falling 50 feet, and a killer explosion with only second degree burns. Like come on. Spiderman saved him in the beginning in two seconds by rushing him to a hospital, like he couldn't manage that again in the 10 minutes of sap. He certainly had enough time."
"adamweisberg","2","5","8","20 May 2007"," Spidey 3 Sucks
","Great special effects.... that's it. The script for this movie was lame, lame, lame. The acting was bad, bad, bad.<br/><br/>I was cringing throughout the movie at awkward exchanges between Mary-Jane and Peter or Peter and (insert character where dialogue was exchanged).<br/><br/>People were laughing in the theatre - not at the intended jokes but at the awkwardness of the script. The evil Peter parts of the movie that were supposed to be funny were just annoying.<br/><br/>There were too many villains in this movie. And the guy from ""That 70's show"" should have never been cast nor should that washed up tool from ""Wings"".<br/><br/>Compared to Spiderman 1 and 2, this movie was a huge let down. Yeah millions were spent and we are supposed to like it because it's Spiderman but... It sucked. It really sucked. If it were possible for a DVD of Spiderman 3 and a DVD of Superman Returns to mate - the offspring would be a Betamax copy of Ishtar.<br/><br/>That's right I said it - it sucked. This movie deserves to lose money. It's too bad that it won't."
"yannzeeuwe","8","5","8","18 May 2007"," Very good
","First of all I want to say it was totally different than the first two spiderman movies. Where the first two movies had a nice and clean storyline which was easy to follow, this one was a bit more vague. In this episode several story lines are blended together (the sandman, the venom, son of the Green Goblin), I don't think that was such a good idea. Overall the plot seemed a bit unfinished to me. Perhaps if the movie was longer and the characters where more evolved it would've been better.<br/><br/>But yeah, there is always something to complain about. Everything else, and I mean everything else in this movie was absolutely over the top! The CGI is perfect, the actors play very realistic, the film has humor, it is thrilling, in short: everything you could wish from a movie like this. That's why I believe everyone who liked the first two parts should watch this. In my opinion this movie deserves an 8/10.<br/><br/>Yann"
"bobg480","1","5","8","16 May 2007"," A 6th grader could've wrote a better screenplay
","I am very disappointed and ashamed of the franchise's putting out such a bad movie. IF you thought X-men 3 was bad this is far worse. It is hard to believe that after how great movie #2 was, that they could produce such a horrible movie. I have a hard time believing that an entire movie crew approved this final cut. It was laced with inconsistencies, plot holes, unnecessary scenes, and was anything but a spider man movie, but rather a soap opera. I read some of the reviews and wanted to see for myself. I think a lot of the people were far too generous. With the level of expectation that the franchise put on the public with previous movies, I find it hard to believe they blundered so badly. My take is they just didn't care. It was so sloppy, it indicates the studio treated like a joke. There was a time when trilogy finales were great; Indiana Jones, and Return of the Jedi... But lately studios seem to not give a darn and just produce anything just for the money.<br/><br/>Spoiler warning: Maybe there will be a part 4 to redeem the franchise, certainly the scene with Curt Conners revealed a lizard skeleton in the background, and the absence of any remains after the bomb exploded on venom shows signs of a possible sequel. However it seems that studios like to end on a bad note these days."
"Gatoronastik","4","5","8","9 May 2007"," Big disappointment
","Spiderman 3 turns out to be a success in the box office, but a major disappointment to many Spidey fans. Raimi's approach of making the movie bigger and more exciting was not the right path to take. Although there were some positive things, there are too many flaws to call this a good movie. The CGI was very impressive, such as Sandman struggling to pick himself up after the particle generator turned him into sand, and Venom looked good. But was it necessary to have three villains? Spiderman is already struggling with other things such as trying to convince Harry that he didn't kill his father and getting ready to propose to Mary Jane. With 2 more villains on top of that caused the plot to seem random at some points and jam-packed with too many important events to have in just 140 minutes of film. Just having sandman as a new villain would have been a better approach considering he was one of the first villains in the comics and Venom didn't come till later. Also there was not enough time to explain what Sandman is really going through. We know he wants to help his daughter and he killed Peter's Uncle Ben, but we don't understand enough about the character to either like him or hate him because he rarely speaks. <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy is introduced through an action sequence where she is hanging from a building, but a new character should never be introduced this way because the audience doesn't know her enough to care if she dies or not. They don't get that feeling of being on the edge of their seat as they would if a more familiar character was in this situation such as if it was Mary Jane. Which makes the whole scene a waste when it could have been better.<br/><br/>In the last two Spiderman Movies very little of the public thought of Spiderman as a hero where a big majority thought of him as being bad, but in Spiderman 3 they are having parades for him and he is being thanked for saving the city on the front page of every newspaper.<br/><br/>When the symbiont takes over Spiderman, it gives him a bad temper and causes him to battle himself by trying to prevent the Black Spiderman from ruining his life. This all leads to ridiculously bad humor in the movie. Peter Parker is trying to impress woman by his new EMO look and make Mary Jane jealous by bringing Gwen Stacy to her work which turned out to be the worst scene in the movie. While Mary Jane is about to sing, Peter Parker randomly plays a piano very well and dances around with no one caring. <br/><br/>With Venom being the character that everyone wants to see it was a disappointment to only see him at the end of the film, and it rarely showed his face because when he would talk to Spiderman it would show Eddie Brocks face. After Eddie Brock became Venom he asked Sandman to help him kill Spiderman but Sandman had no reason to want to kill Spiderman. If he did then he wouldn't have apologized to him at the end of the movie for killing his Uncle. When Spiderman asked Harry to help him fight Sandman and Venom, Harry wouldn't because he couldn't forgive him after thinking he killed his father. The Butler then tells him the truth that he knew his father killed himself, but why would he be saying this now as appose to telling him when peter and him were trying to kill each other earlier in the film? He then helps Spiderman Fight which by this point really changed any part of the story line that was based around the comic.<br/><br/>There were to many things happening in the story that made it too random such as Sandman happening to fall in a particle generator as it was about to be used, and the symbiont falling out of the sky right next to Peter Parker. If the movie was based around the symbiont, Black Spiderman, and Venom then it could have made a really good movie. Instead of a meteor falling from the sky they could have made it like the cartoon where J Jonah Jamison's son goes into space where he finds the symbiont on an asteroid and brings it back to earth after having to land on the George Washington bridge because it takes over the shuttle. It would have made a great action scene and they already introduced J Jonah Jamison's son in Spiderman 2 making fans think that thats how the symbiont would have gotten to Spiderman but the meteor falling from the sky was just a way to save time only because there was too much to cover in two hours and ten minutes.<br/><br/>I give this movie five stars because although i am a huge fan of Spiderman I was very disappointed with this film. Especially for all the hype it got. It is upsetting that this is the Spiderman movie that ends up soaring into the record books when the other two were much better"
"dennis_chiu1","9","5","8","6 May 2007"," The Ambitious Spider-man 3
","Spider-Man 3 tells an ambitious number of stories in a 140 minute film. The story/character conflicts are: <br/><br/>(1) Spider-man vs. himself: Peter has begun to succumb to Spidey stardom in New York and as any nerdy unpopular teen, he begins to become self-centered.<br/><br/>(2) Peter Parker - Mary Jane Romance: As Spidey's fan base increases, Mary Jane's luck as an actor hits the skids. This creates tension between Mary Jane who needs Peter to be there for her, but where Peter is mostly wrapped up in his star status to understand. Mary Jane eventually turns to Harry Osborn for comfort.<br/><br/>(3) Peter/Spider-man vs. Harry Osborn/ New Goblin: Harry, living to avenge his father's death, whom he believes was felled by Spider-man, attacks Peter just as he is about to propose to Mary Jane. Peter still believes Harry is a friend and desperately tries to rebuild a friendship.<br/><br/>(4) Peter/Spider-man vs. Sandman: Peter and Aunt May are told that the Sandman is the real criminal that shot and murdered Uncle Ben. So Peter is also consumed by revenge, like Harry, to kill Sandman.<br/><br/>(5) Peter/Spider-man vs. himself/Venom vs. Brock/Venom: The symbiotic black entity Venom catalyzes Peter's vengeance and aggression, leading him toward the darker nature of man. Eventually Venom takes over Brock, a discredited photographer unmasked by Peter, and Venom catalyzes Brock's vengeance to destroy Peter.<br/><br/>From a writer's perspective, five story/character conflict dimensions are ambitious for any film, especially for a Summer blockbuster that must include $250 million dollars of special effect action sequences.<br/><br/>However, there are so many brainless, plot-less, stupid Summer blockbusters, I cannot help but be impressed by Spider-man 3's ambition to be more. After all, this has been the triumph of the prior films -- dare to have characters and story in addition to terrific action sequences. This is also the triumph the Spider-man comic hero that has endeared him to so many. Spider-man is more than a comic book hero. He is a hero that bleeds, makes mistakes, and fights his personal demons.<br/><br/>Sam Rami and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent have always been talented observers of humanity and the need to create real characters on screen. The character of Venom, actually did not appeal to Sam Rami, because of Venom's pure evil nature, until he was convinced how useful Venom worked as a catalyst to display the darkness in even the most human of characters, such as Peter Parker.<br/><br/>It was this ambitious need to explore humanity that led to a film that tells too many stories. It is hard enough to create a film that delves into two or three levels of character conflict let alone five levels.<br/><br/>I will give Mr. Rami and Mr. Sargent credit though. Along with the extremely talented cast, they almost pull the whole thing off -- almost, which is amazing. Not everyone can create an epic and almost pull it off. And, it is because of this, that I recommend Spider-man 3.<br/><br/>I think the well-known critics that have chosen to tell film goers to stay away from this film do them a disservice. It is better to dare to accomplish too much, than to accomplish too little. Mr. Rami showed heroic courage even to attempt this story.<br/><br/>In the end, I believe history will judge Spider-man 3 as a modern epic of glorious proportions. I, personally, don't agree with the tying up of all of the lose ends so neatly, but I understand why Mr. Rami did; he wanted to complete a great trilogy, comparable to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>In summary, ignore any critic who says this film has no plot -- they are incompetent, and understand what critics mean that this film maybe over-ambitious because it is. However, see the glass as overflowing and drink it in, because Spider-man 3 will fill you with a film experience unlike most blockbusters will this year."

","I loved Spiderman and Spiderman 2, and I was anticipating the release of Spiderman 3 for months. When the mixed review came in, I couldn't help but be disappointed, but just assumed the critics didn't like it but I would. Then I heard from friends attending the midnight preview that it was a horrid waste of time. I didn't care. I wanted so badly to love Spiderman 3 and walked into the theater with very high hopes.<br/><br/>To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. First off, there was way too much going on, and every character in the film was underused. Bryce Dallas Howard is a wonderful actress, but hardly had time to shine. There were too many bad guys. Each bad guy had a fascinating story, however, and I wish that they were put in separate films so the audience could see more of them. The first two films had a great balance of action and romance, the third one too much romance. At the end of the film I felt as if nothing had been accomplished, like I had just sat through two and a half hours of nothingness. I was very bored."

I'm a girl and I'm not only seeing it to look at the wonderful tobey maguire or hot franco. I just love the problems brought up in the movie that actually appear in real life. Tobey Maguire plays greatly once again and so does Kirsten Dunst. The movie is a continuous surprise. THe fact that Peter Parker has to overcome the dark forces not only the external power surrounding him but the eagerness that brings him closer to that evil. He fights it in the end but it is great seeing how he can also show his darker side..it proves that superheros are people too and that they make mistakes just like every other guy.. Stereotypically Superman or any other hero would pretend not to care about the opinions of other people. He would pretend like he doesn't like the commercialised part of his achievements..but lets not forget that every human would be delighted to know that the public allows them.

And Peter was doing the dumbest dance ever in a night club and was all like hey i'm really stupid. I won't by this movie it was that bad. I was a huge Spider-Man fan before I saw this movie and now I'm almost ashamed to say that I even own comics or anything Spider-Man related. I saw this movie for free since I work for AMC Theatres, but just the movie overall there was I swear like 5 minutes of venom in the movie and he dies. Harry Dies and Sandman gets away like a wizard of oz good witch type thing. But just the movie oh my God like I will let you decide for yourself if you really choose to but unless if someone is going to pay for you to see this horrible film then I suggest you go for it and make up your own mind about it. But it sucked so bad. Sam Raimi is now one of the worst writers as well as directors in the entire world. And just count how many times the characters in the movie were like crying it got ridiculous didn't even feel like a Spider-Man movie it felt more like the lifetime version of it. He became an Emo-Man with his hair it looked awful and the suit oh God it was horrible. Only True Spider-Man fans will walk away and hate it."

","It isn't that bad but it isn't that good either it's just meh.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Peter Parker in the beggining was the character we all loved and they were trying to give him something to make him develop which was good but his character arc was a mess.
He becomes Edgy Peter parker for a few seconds reverts back because Aunt May said some stuff reverts back again after what Harry did and then he starts to dance and then it becomes a short pointless petty love triangle in that one scene were Peter slaps MJ and then he reverts back again.
They are trying to convey this one Theme but it's such a mess that they don't manage to execute it well enough.
Harry was an alright character who was a bit weird.
He lost his memory and regained it after looking at a picture of Norman Osborn (which is stupid but fine) he becomes this ""intimidating"" villain who want's Mary Jane to do something that ever gets further executed.
He wantäs MJ to brake up with Pete and then he admits to Pete that it was him who made that plan and it was never explained what the purpose of the plan was.
And Bernard or Bernie whatever his name was he should have said that Norman killed himself a long time ago and how the hell did he know that?
You could have said that Spider-Man told the cops but then Harry would know so it's only Spider-Man and this Butler who knows about the death of Norman and the Butler wasn't even there (makes no sense).<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Venom was a terrible villain.
He should have been set-up for Spider-Man 4 cause Eddy Brock is there doing shady stuff later want's to kill Peter Parker and then becomes Venom in a stupid way.
If he knew that stuff was falling down (cause symbiote was falling on his jacket) he would have moved but nope he stood there and just let it all consume him.
And he want's to be bad cause he likes it which is a terrible motivation.
Sandman was an actually decent villain but he should have had way more screen time than he got.<br/><br/>VERDICT
It could have been great but sadly it's meh.
It had the right ideas but the problem was the execution of those ideas."

"carologletree","7","3","4","9 November 2016"," The Weakest of the Spiderman Trilogy, But Still a Solid Film in Its Own Right
","This film really tends to get a bad rap. Many consider this to be a disappointment and a weak ending to the trilogy because of the many story lines and villains stuffed into it. I disagree. While I would say this is nowhere near as good as the first two films, I still think this was pretty good as far as third installments go.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire gives a great final performance as our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Of course, the dance scene with ""emo-Peter"" seems to really get a lot of backlash, but I really didn't mind it much. If anything, I just laugh at it.<br/><br/>There may be a lot going on in the film, but I thought that most of it was handled well. The CGI for both Venom and Sandman was top notch. Sandman is another sympathetic villain, and is played well by Thomas Haden Church.<br/><br/>The main storyline involving the relationship between Peter and Harry is very well done, and I found the final scene where they reconcile to be very touching.<br/><br/>The action scenes are just as entertaining and exciting as ever, giving the audience the bang for their buck. The supporting cast also does a good job and we have another strong soundtrack.<br/><br/>It isn't without its flaws. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is nowhere near as compelling as the previous villains in the series, and he doesn't even become Venom until late in the film.<br/><br/>The story does have some questionable elements, such as the section of the film where Harry had amnesia and how Harry's butler for some reason not having told him the truth about his father's death a lot earlier. The film is also a bit overlong and could have left other characters out, such as Gwen Stacey.<br/><br/>However, I still found this to be a solid movie overall. It seems that people pan this mainly because it's a third film in a series and because it had a lot going on in it. In reality, however, this film is an action-packed, emotionally resonant, and mostly satisfying ending to the trilogy. It may be the weakest of the trilogy, but still gets a recommendation from me.<br/><br/>RATING: B"
"powermandan","8","3","4","27 October 2014"," Really Not As Bad As People Say.
","People were all excited to see Venom in Spiderman 3 since Venom is Spiderman's coolest and most popular villain. And since Spiderman 2 was so well-received, it would only make sense that the follow-up movie would possibly be better. I will be the first to admit that this was not as good as Spiderman 2, but I would say this is the second best Spiderman movie made. A little bit better than the first and much better than these new ones. I can see why some people would nit- pick at this, but they go too far by saying this was trash and that it was the worst superhero movie they'd seen. Ever see Superman IV? That's about was bad as 1959's Santa Claus.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Peter planning on proposing to Mary Jane, but her frustrations with her Broadway career and jealousy of Gwen Stacy liking Peter gets the better of her. That is a flaw. We waited for two full movies for Peter to get the girl and he still can't? However, Maguire and Dunst are great actors so there is really nothing to worry about. Plus this adds tension because everybody wants Peter to get Mary Jane and he still has troubles. But you know he is just one step closer. There is also Harry Osborn who has become New Goblin and wants to destroy Spiderman. He gets amnesia in the process, but soon comes out of it and adds problems to Peter and May Jane's relationship. I don't think that Franco was all that good as Harry and New Goblin, but because of the build-up and characterization, the feud is awesome. And Harry screwing up the relationship makes the love story original and not very dull. Plus, there is Flint Marko who turns out to be uncle Ben's killer. He becomes Sandman and wants Spiderman gone. Flint is a bit weak, his story and place was weak, but when he turns into Sandman, look out! He is soooo awesome. The last villain is Venom: Edward Brock Jr. Eddie Brock is an up-and-coming photographer that envies Peter Parker as Parker outdoes Brock and his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, takes a liking to him. Played by skinny Topher Grace, I found this to be the biggest flaw. A bizarre piece of goo crash-lands on earth and turns Spiderman black. It also alters his personality. Peter becomes mean emo-Peter who struts around and dances randomly. Some parts of this were dumb, but Maguire was very convincing. Realizing the toll it takes on him, Peter takes it off and it lands on Eddie Brock, turning him into Venom. Another thing I liked about the toll it takes on Peter was his transition from nice, timid, Peter to vain, weird, emo- Peter. He was convincing as both, and his links to the emo and back were very well-done. A transitional character down the right way, like here, always impress me. Eddie Brock has always been displayed as a big guy, so Grace was a wrong call. Plus Venom is barely in it, when he is, they mostly show Brock's face. So I can se why most people would feel cheated by that. But when Venom is actually Venom, it is awesome. Everybody has to admit that Venom looked really cool. The end sequence when Spiderman fights both Venom and Sandman is monumental. The stakes were high and you really thought Spiderman was going to die. Then Harry finally saving Spiderman and both fighting Venom and Sandman was even cooler. The actions sequences and special effects were dazzling, so I don't get why those weren't praised like int he others. The character development and chemistry is an all-time high in the series, but some of it was too much, so the viewers felt cheated. The use of villains made the viewers feel cheated too, but it really want that bad because the positives erased most negatives. But because this was poorly received, producers tried too hard to come up with a great story for Spiderman 4. With too many disagreements, the plug was pulled and Sony rebooted the series. I hate what they've done. Spiderman 3 had the stuff for a sequel we were waiting for. Dr. Connors still had a piece of the goo that Peter gave him, Eddie Brock's death wasn't shown very well, so there would have been more Venom and maybe even Carnage. Instead, we now have arrogant, undeserving Peter Parker with villains used worse than this.<br/><br/>Tobey's Spiderman is a true hero. He was played as a total loser that got powers that gave him the confidence he needed to be a better person. He always triumphs over odds as the going gets tough.<br/><br/>3/4"
"davielee15","8","3","4","28 September 2014"," A mixed bag and disappointing, but I still liked it for what it was
","Everybody hates this movie for too many things going on, and Peter's little night at the Roxbury dance scenes. I completely agree that Spider-Man is a superhero and superheroes don't dance. It is completely unnecessary and is a big zero to the film even though it was sort of hilarious. However if they did not have him dance in the movie, I think it could have been a lot better and I think people could have like it better as well. This is a very mixed bag to say the least. However, I don't think having too many things is a bad thing because when you have more stuff going on it makes it more watchable. In Spider-Man 2, barely anything was going on and it was so boring to watch. In this one a lot of things are going and that is why I still liked Spider-Man 3 for what it was. The special effects are still outstanding as ever. I like the theme forgiveness in this movie and it anchors the film. I thought the cast is great. Kirsten Dunst is still good as Mary Jane. Thomas Haden Church is great as Sandman and I liked the subplot with that character. The CGI Sandman and the fight scenes between him and Spider-Man are awesome. I thought James Franco and Topher Grace stole the show. The conflict between Peter and Harry still works in the film. Franco helps anchor the film. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock fit perfectly as opposite Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and did a good job. A lot of people were disappointed with Venom and I was too but I also thought that it was awesome when Venom appeared in the movie but was not the real Venom I was expecting. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy but was completely underused here. Tobey Maguire has some great moments and tries very hard. I enjoy watching him sometimes and liked his evil Peter Parker moments, but he is just annoying and was ridiculous with his punk hair. I also thought he was too nerdy and took spider man as a celebrity way too far. The climax of the movie: They did a great job of setting up the climax and it was awesome seeing venom fight spider-man for the first time as well as fighting Sandman at the same time as well. It became exciting as it went on. I love the set up: Spider-Man and New Goblin vs. Sandman and Venom; perfect. But it started looking like a cartoon and was disappointing. Venom did not look like Venom anymore and they should have came up with something better with the Spider-Man and Sandman ending. But it was still overall satisfying. Also, J.K. Simmons is still perfect and hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>The fight scenes, action sequences and special effects are even better than the previous films but it still looked like a cartoon. The cast makes it happen and I like that there was more plot lines and characters. But the dance scenes ruined the movie and Venom had barely any screen time. Maguire has great moments but is annoying and does too much.<br/><br/>This is a mixed bag. Spider-Man 3 is good but it is disappointing that it is just good because good is not good enough for a huge event movie like this. Has great moments but also has sluggish moments as well.<br/><br/>I still liked it for what it was. It just could have been great.<br/><br/>Overall: 7.5/10"

","In Spider Man 3 it talk you a little deeper in to the mind of Peter Parker. He is going thought the people that most people face, but about ten times harder. He will face talk three new foes The Sandman, new Green Goblen, also Venom. He will make so choose that will make you think that Spider Man is not all Jokes and games. He is ready to do what ever it takes to keep the one he cares for safe. He will have choose between power and his loved ones. He is more dark then any other Spider Man you have ever seen his ready to kill any on that get in the way of what he is tying to do. I really like this Peter parker. I think more people can learn to like him because he is not the same old same old. It give you some that what to see. Mary Jane is here for him and he keeps push him away. I believe that peter has been have a lot of trouble in his mind sense Uncle Ben die and he blame him self. In these movie it all comes out of him at one time. So he is made at ever one. That is why his is ready to destroy any one who would stand in his why. He will come to the choose to the point we he must understand that with great power comes great responsibility. For Spider Man this will be one of his greatest test."

","Spider Man is loved by the citizens of New York. He spent time happily but thanks of the black object, life and human relations collapse. Meanwhile, Sandman and New Goblin are born.

I was surprised by black object because Peter's character changes bad and it changed Peter into black Spider Man with further power. I thought if such ability reaches me, I will become glad and I may act rashly. This movie has many action scene and it is written more deeply about human relations than a previous work. I thought Peter and MJ's relationship is so good but Peter is a person easily pleased by praise or flattery., too.

"Mr-Fusion","4","3","4","17 April 2012"," A pretty solid superhero franchise drives right off a cliff.
","""Spider-Man 3"" wasn't so much a letdown as it was a massive disappointment. A movie that was so preoccupied with the effects budget that the filmmakers forgot to cook up a decent script. I wanted to see if five years' passage would improve my outlook on the film, but it's still just as aggravating as it was in May of 2007. <br/><br/>For starters, the movie suffers from too many bad guys. And none of them are in Doctor Octopus' league. Harry Osborn's still super miffed at Peter Parker for killing his father (even though he didn't), and has taken up Norman's mantle as some sort of misguided Green Goblin 2. At the same time, a freak accident turns escaped con Flint Marko into the Sandman - pretty much the granulated equivalent of Robert Patrick's T-1000. He doesn't have a beef with Peter, but he does need convenient bank job money to afford health care for his sick kid (and Spidey naturally stands in his way). Peter is also dealing with anxiety over proposing to Mary Jane (whom he's fought tooth and nail for two movies to win over). That seems enough for a movie, doesn't it? <br/><br/>Nope, needs more.<br/><br/>A sticky black substance plummets to Earth, finds its way to Peter's apartment and bonds to his skin. Turns out it's an alien symbiote using Peter as a host organism. Good news is it makes Peter more powerful. The downside is it also makes him a bit of a douche. So Peter finally manages to get this thing off of him, where it finds another host; this time, it's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), the new photog at the Daily Bugle. Brock's relationship with the symbiote manifests itself in blind rage, and we have our third villain: Venom. <br/><br/>The villain congestion underlines a major problem with the screenplay: Sandman's the only character that feels like he got a full showcase as bad guy. Venom and Harry are treated as momentary distractions where they feel like they could've carried a lot more of this thing. And the black costume was a pretty major storyline in the comic. But here, he's in possession all of 20 minutes' story time. It's symptomatic of too many cooks getting short shrift in the kitchen. <br/><br/>And that is precisely what is so infuriating about Spider-Man 3: the script. One that comes as not only lazy, but altogether cheap. Take Harry's character arc, for instance:<br/><br/>1. Harry and Peter have a knock-down drag-out fight, Harry suffers head trauma and forgets he was ever mad at Peter. 2. Harry suddenly hears his admonishing father in his head, remembers why he was out to kill Peter, and now he's evil again (more fighting) 3. The butler (who wasn't even there in the last two movies) conveniently shows up and lays it all out for Harry. Dad was the bad guy, not Spider-Man! You've had him all wrong all along! 4. Harry sees the light and proceeds to help Peter fight the Sandman and Venom. <br/><br/>But wait, there's more ...<br/><br/>Peter and Aunt May are told by the police that the guy they thought killed Uncle Ben in the first movie was only an accomplice. The real killer was actually ... wait for it ... Flint Marko! <br/><br/>I'll admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to see this brand of retcon. It's smacks of laziness, and it's dismissive of the audience's intelligence. I get it - they needed to give Peter an emotional reason to go after the Sandman. But even kidnapping his girlfriend (though it's been done before) is more ingenuous than this. Or Marko could kill Harry, and that might give Peter a reason to grow annoyed. <br/><br/>What's mystifying about ""Spider-Man 3"" is witnessing just how many things went wrong, compared to just how many they got right with the previous movie. ""Spider-Man 3"" has too many villains, subplots and bad writing to be anything other than background noise when you're washing the dishes. Or, when you've lost the remote, and can't shake your vegetable torpor to get up and change the channel. It's not ""Superman 3"" bad, but it's not good. <br/><br/>Not good, at all.<br/><br/>4/10"

I regret this, having just viewed the film on DVD this weekend.<br/><br/>What an outstanding, if uneven, movie. While I can agree with some of the people writing here who are critical of a few bits of clumsy dialog and exposition, it by no means detracts from those many places in the film where the movie WORKS.<br/><br/>Part way through the film, I found myself remembering some of the lapses and flaws in the narrative of the first two films, and I became worried that there would be a new set of loose ends hanging by the end of this. But to my surprise, it all fell into a satisfying state of resolution.<br/><br/>I have discovered in the news that none of the creative people of this set of Spiderman films will continue in the series, with Spiderman 4 set for a 3D release in 2012.

"alphabetgreen1996","7","3","4","7 April 2010"," A sad ending does not necessarily a bad movie make!!
","I've just finished watching the DVD of both Spiderman sequels tonight. That was after reading glowing reviews about Spiderman 2 and mediocre/bad reviews about Spiderman 3. Now I know why. The former ended on a high and the latter didn't. OK, people thought there were too many super(anti)heroes in the 3rd one. Maybe, but I thought it balanced out alright. But one should not be too quick to judge the film based on the way you feel about the ending. I thought 2 was really slow to get going and didn't really move until the science demonstration by the good doctor. And the only real action was on the train. In contrast, 3 had me hooked from the beginning. All these little stories popping up. In fact the best line of the movie was Peter Parker's when he was emptying sand out of his boots: ""Where do all these guys keep coming from?"" followed closely by: ""Oh God, I hate these!"" when his mate was throwing spinning blades at him.<br/><br/>My actual criticism will surprise most people, and that was, that for $200 million plus, the effects were disappointing. I was ready to be blown away by them but they seemed to be pretty run-of-the-mill in comparison to the first two movies and other films of that ilk (the effects in Superman Returns were better, to be honest). I mean, that Sandman (when he was huge, towards the end of the movie)looked like he had been drawn on the film by a kid, for goodness sake.<br/><br/>All in all, ten for ambition, seven for entertainment value (and that's the only category any review should really be marked upon)."
"piccologenkidama","8","3","4","10 January 2008"," Better than people say, but . . .
","Still not quite there. Spiderman 3 is a good movie that holds up well against the others. You won't be blown away, but you will be entertained. Nevertheless, most fans of the movies and the comics will see that the potential for an excellent movie was wasted, which leaves the above average experience tainted with a tinge of disappointment.<br/><br/>But let's start with the basic plot. Spiderman is a celebrity now. Adored by legions of fans. But he has allowed this to color his relationship with his one true love, MJ (I personally never much cared for the character or Dunst in the role). And of course, Harry Osborne, his one-time best friend, still intends to kill him. The villains this time around are Venom, and the Sandman, the former is wasted, and the latter overused here.<br/><br/>The problem with the plot isn't the presence of three villains as many have suggested. It's the presence of too many story lines. A cohesive story could have been weaved around Harry Osborne, Eddie Brock, MJ and Parker. But the addition of Sandman just throws the whole thing apart. The Sandman just wasn't necessary here. I personally never found his character that compelling, and it doesn't improve with this incarnation. Thomas Haden Church doesn't give a bad performance by any means. He does very well. But it just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie. Church gives so good of a performance that you almost forget we get very few scenes that explain his motivations. What exactly is his motivation for teaming up with Venom? I still don't understand. It would have been better to concentrate on the most entertaining spidey story, the black-suited Spiderman and the rise of Venom. Harry's story could have been given more credence without the Sandman as well. Both of those ideas are enough for one film.<br/><br/>There are also too many ridiculous moments. Comic books aren't exactly realistic, I know. But even they maintain realism within their own set of rules. There are just too many moments that conflict or make you cringe. The most obvious is the idea that the Sandman suddenly turns out to be Uncle Ben's real killer. His transformation at the beginning also makes little sense. Then there's the soap opera scenes between MJ and Peter. Harry's sudden amnesia is hard to swallow. The first half of the movie had a less than Spiderman feel to it. And then there's the fact that the most villainous thing Peter Parker does while under the suit's control is a bad jazz routine. Topher Grace is also wasted in a surprisingly good performance as Eddie Brock. His character's development isn't given nearly enough screen time. James Cromwell's presence in a useless role is also perplexing.<br/><br/>But all of these negatives sound worse than they are. The film is still very very good. Don't let those criticisms fool you, there are enough surprising twists, and epic battles to bring out the geek in all of us. It's just that there are enough of these excellent moments to make you realize there could have been so much more."
"dfranzen70","3","3","4","8 January 2008"," Spider Pig would have been a better choice
","Spider-Man 3 might be best subtitled, ""Peter Parker Grows a Pair."" That would seem like an endearing quality if this was a coming-of-age movie about the sand-in-the-face nerd finally overcoming bullies and low self-esteem to win the girl of his dreams, but it's not so wonderful or interesting in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Sure, Spidey DOES have low self-esteem, and sure, Peter Parker IS a nerdy little twit, but he's no weakling - that ship has long since sailed. Now, Spider-Man is the hero of children across the city, so there's less reason to empathize with him, to identify our own uncoolness within Parker.<br/><br/>The problems with this movie are manifold. To begin with, the webslinger has far too many bad guys to face. First, there's the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict who fell into a particle accelerator and now has the properties of, well, sand. Then there's an alien parasite, conveniently falling from the sky so it can latch onto Peter and bring out the worst in his repressed personality. Then there's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a supremely vicious rival photographer. Oh, and Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of the Green Goblin; he thinks Spidey killed his pop (he didn't), and he knows Peter is Spidey (oops). So you can imagine what's on Harry's mind.<br/><br/>With all of these villains, you'd think there'd be plenty of conflict. Clearly, however, the writers felt something else was needed, so they invented a highly contrived plot thread in which Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) relationship disintegrates. It should be no surprise to you whatsoever that somehow this relationship gets resuscitated by movie's end. They're together! They're apart! They hate each other! They love each other! You'll hate them both! And what bugs me more than the obviousness, the sheer craptastic predictability of the relationship angle, is that both MJ and Peter act like completely selfish, rotten jerks to each other - and we're supposed to eat that up. Apparently, we're supposed to think, ""Hey, yeah, that's exactly how it is!"" Supporters of the movie might point to the fact that Peter's under Venom's control when he's treating MJ like garbage, but that's not true - he's a creep to her well before Venom shows up. He's smug, self-centered, clearly soaking up the adoration of the city like he was Donald Trump handing out low-income housing in Brooklyn. Okay, maybe not that smug, but still. Peter Parker, in this movie, behaves exactly opposite from what makes Peter Parker interesting to the rest of us in the first place - that he is an insecure dweeb who happens to have superpowers. A crass, smarmy punk is not appealing.<br/><br/>There's one telling scene - it was in the trailer, too - that shows Peter strutting down the street, wearing the Venom costume under his normal clothes, and every girl stops to stare at this supposed virile paragon of masculinity. Yeah, Peter Parker. The problem is that Tobey Maguire isn't much of an actor, and when he has to stray from the golly-gee innocent-lamb of Peter Parker, his inabilities are completely exposed. In short, he sucks ass. He can't carry a scene without putting on a mask and looking like he's swinging on some web-like substance. The casting of Maguire made sense originally, because he looks exactly like the kind of doofus nitwit you'd expect Peter Parker to be, but in this movie, when he has to be more than just that doofus, Maguire can't hack it.<br/><br/>Speaking of looking like he's swinging .... isn't the whole purpose of CGI to make awesome things look real? Remember back in the day when actors would be in a car, appearing to drive through a city, when it was obvious they were on a set with the city scene playing in the background? I mean, on the cheaper films, it was pretty clear what was going on. The CGI in this movie is a lot like that. When Spider-Man is swinging between buildings, it looks like they took Maguire jumping around and plopped it onto a city background. It looks terrible, and it's distracting.<br/><br/>So, let's recap. Too many villains (they should have stuck with Sandman and Harry), a shallow, ridiculous relationship, poor special effects, and bad acting, at least on Maguire's part. But hey, I can't blame him entirely - Sam Raimi's script turns Spider-Man into Emo Spidey - complete with stereotypical Goth haircut and dull monotone! And who knew that simply wearing the Venom costume could make one an accomplished jazz pianist and dancer? With all of these obvious inadequacies, you'd think that the door would finally be closed on this series, but since the movie did well, you can bet a S-M 4 will pollute the theaters sooner rather than later."

","It's sad to see a great trilogy end so horribly. That is, if Spiderman 3 is the end of the series, (i.e., it has made so much money another sequel may already be in the works). Spiderman 3 is not only the worst film in the series; it is one of the worst films of the new millennium. The third outing in the otherwise excellent film series centers around an assortment of characters; Peter Parker, (Tobey Maguire), and his acceptance of being a hero loved by New York, Mary Jane Watson, (Kirsten Dunst), and her anxiety of being a failure as an actress, Harry Osborne, (James Franco), and his obsession with killing Peter, Eddie Brock, (Topher Grace) a photographer compelled to take Peter's job, and Flint Marko, (Thomas Haden Church), a criminal that turns out to be the man who really killed Peter's Uncle Ben in the first Spiderman film. The intimidating cast of characters seems to be too much at first, and in the end, it still is. There is too much time spent on introducing the characters and getting to know them that the plot loses screen time to the characters. There are about 5 more main players in the film that I haven't mentioned already, but if I tried to explain them this whole review would be filled with names and pointless plot lines. Sadly, in a stellar cast, only three actors show their excellent acting abilities, in little screen time; Bruce Campbell (of the cult film Army of Darkness from the Evil Dead trilogy), who plays a gut-busting Maître d' at a French restaurant, Thomas Haden Church, (Sideways), as not so much of a villain but more of a lost soul in a role as a criminal and villain Sandman, and Topher Grace, (That 70's Show's Eric Foreman), as an aspiring photographer whose hate eventually turns him into the infamous Spiderman villain Venom. One of the films major downfalls is its ridiculous plot. The most important element of the plot, the black ooze that turns Peter from normal to evil, and Topher Grace's character into venom, comes from an asteroid that falls out of the sky. To showcase how evil this makes Peter, the filmmakers put makeup on him, have him strut through New York snapping his fingers and eyeing women for nearly fifteen minutes all while wearing his ""evil-spidey"" black outfit underneath his clothes. What is supposed to be funny turns out to be dumb, tedious, and irrelevant, ultimately killing any chance of the film being good enough to view more than once. There is so much wrong with this film that I could fill up all of Rolling Stone with its failures. I hated this film. Even if you loved the first two films, Spiderman 3 is boring, brainless and not worth seeing. Ever. Let me put it this way; instead of dumbing down the plot to get to the widest audience, the plot is so dumb it may actually lower the audience's IQ."

Harry tries his best in this movie to get back at Spider-Man. So it sounds like Peter had a lot going on in this movie. Peter Parker gets a new colored suit and he doesn't understand why it is black or why he loves it so much, it makes him feel better, then he goes slap crazy and his looks change, his personality changes, and his attitude changes, and then when it finally goes through his head that the black suit is a parasite that makes him something different he tries to get out of the suit and it turns out that the blackness is Venom looking for someone to live off of. Then it moves on to another guy who tried to steal Peter's job at the Dailey Bugle. It had a lot of action in it. Venom scared me to death he looked so freaky, but thats how you make a good villain. I am a huge fan of Spider-Man so i am looking forward to the 4th movie of Spider-Man."

","Upon first seeing Spider-Man 3, I was largely disappointed, as were a lot of faithful fans. I thought the story was rushed, it didn't make sense, and it didn't flow. Despite these initial impressions, I went to see Spider-Man 3 again last night with a family member. You wouldn't believe how incredibly different the experience was this time.<br/><br/>Don't ask me how, but I know that I loved Spider-Man 3 the second time around. Weird, right? I know, but that's how it is! I found myself laughing at the humor more and finding the action much more exciting. The overall story seemed to flow much better, and, most surprisingly of all, it didn't feel so crammed as before. Even Venom didn't seem as pointless a villain this second time around. I did not find myself wanting to rush through the middle of the movie to get to the final battle and I was more appreciative of the character development, which itself seemed to be more integrated into the story. I guess what I'm trying to say is this: Seeing Spider-Man 3 a second time was like watching a whole new movie, and a much more enjoyable one at that.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the movie the first time, go see it again. I think you'll find it more likable than you did before."

","Enjoyed the film immensely, though the origins of Venom & Sandman were changed totally (i should know ...i have the 1st appearance issues Amazing Spiderman #4 & Secret Wars Mini Series).<br/><br/>How dare you say that a petty rogue like Sandman killed our Uncle Ben? The concept of ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" is rubbished because the painful experience of Petey in the killing of Uncle Ben by the robber he allowed to get away after the wrestling tournament has been reduced to meaningless. Afterall the Sandman killed your Uncle. (dumb idea!!!). Sandman was defeated in the comics by Spider-Man by using a vacuum cleaner (I swear Petey is smarter in the comics) <br/><br/>How dare you under-develop the Venom character? It would have been better left out till when you had the time to read up on Secret Wars <br/><br/>That aside the animated work on the Sandman was fantastic.<br/><br/>When is Dr Connors finally going to become The Lizard(Spidey 4 i bet)? The Lizard is my greatest Spidey foe (many thanks to Todd McFarlane 4 this).<br/><br/>Why did they have to kill off the Globin's character like that. I'm pretty sure Dr. Oc's character will resurface sooner or later. Let's hope the whole cast stays on for Spiderman 4.<br/><br/>Please introduce Mysterio & The Lizard in Spiderman 4 Will the Sinister Six come into play in Spiderman 5(Dr. Octopus, Sandman, Mysterio, Electro, The Vulture & Craven The Hunter)?<br/><br/>awesome Movie with loads of action ...A DVD Collector's Item."
"omegacwa","9","3","4","14 May 2007"," Worth Multiple Viewings, Let it sink in and enjoy!
","I am a manager at a movie theater, and when I found out that we were getting spider-man 3 I was ecstatic. I had been waiting 3 long years for this sequel and it was finally here. I saw both Spiderman 1 and 2 opening day, first show of the day, but now I actually got to see it the night before its release.<br/><br/>Now what did I think of the movie? I thought it was excellent. Not as family friendly as the last two, which might send some children running, but still an action packed thrill ride that I had come to expect.<br/><br/>The script is a bit shaky though, I love Sam Raimi, but you got to give the guy credit, he was under a lot of pressure from fans and producers alike to fit a lot in. I know that Sam didn't want Venom in this movie, not that he dislikes the character, but he didn't feel the time was right. The movie was originally going to be all Sandman, and you can tell. Sandman is really well developed and you really feel for him and his personal problems. Thomas Hayden Church is perfect, and works well with the few lines he actually had.<br/><br/>Topher Grace as the snide Eddie Brock Junior is an odd choice, but he plays it well, although not looking the part. His Attitude is almost perfect Eddie Brock, but his appearance makes him seem more like a spoiled kid, and less of a vengeful muscle bound maniac.(IE the way he was in the comics). I am not saying that muscles would have made the difference, but a few days in the gym couldn't have hurt either.<br/><br/>As for Venom, he looks really good. Not perfect, as they took some liberties with his appearance, but he still comes off the way he should, a disgusting monster.<br/><br/>James Franco churns out an excellent performance (as both goblin and Harry). I dare say he was the best actor in the movie. He was SO good.<br/><br/>Tobey McGuire is great once again. I am please to report no really odd facial expressions this time around, which were prevalent in SPM2.<br/><br/>He also turns out a great performance as the symbiote wearing Peter. Most critics don't seem to get it, but I, a long time fan, understood what was going on immediately. Although the ""EMO"" look worked somewhat well, I think a stubble beard and spiked hair would have been more appropriate, and more accurate to the comics. I also feel the whole symbiote story was rushed a bit, but what are going to do? Kirsten Dunst puts out her worst performance as Mary Jane, but that by no means makes it bad. I just felt her part was really stagnated in this. I feel she could have been written a little better.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is gorgeous as Gwen Stacy, a short lived but well acted part in the movie. Really just a cameo for long time fans, same with Captain Stacy.<br/><br/>Rosemary Harris is back as Aunt May, although her part is really limited this time around, making her seem more like a wise-woman than Peter's dear aunt.<br/><br/>JK Simmons. Oh how I love the, The perfect casting for J. J. since day one. If they start a new trilogy, he should be kept on.<br/><br/>Cameos by Both Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Norman Osborn are used well. I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, so I was happy to seem him once more.<br/><br/>Notable Cameos by Bruce Campbell, and The guys who played the Robber in the first movie, and Flash Thompson. Not to mention Stan Lee's most obvious role ever.<br/><br/>The special Effects are top notch, with only a flaw or two here and there. Definitely better than Spiderman 2, which I felt had very obvious CGI.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are well acted and very crisp. A bit of humor in the final battle scene kind of killed the mood, but if you look past it, it's fine.<br/><br/>Some Cheesiness here and there and a bit of a wash over script pull the movie down a bit. 10 more minutes and a modified ending would have made this movie and A.<br/><br/>This movie falls somewhere between 1 and 2 for overall quality. I still can't decide where I place it though.<br/><br/>If it was split into two movies, I think it would have been better, because there really is two movies worth of info in one, which can become confusing to the casual viewer.<br/><br/>This movie's biggest flaw seems to be that it leaves you wanting more, with lots of loose ends not tied up at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it very much, and plan on seeing it again. I hope people will go see it and make their own judgment, and not listen to critics. Well, if you are going to listen to one, listen to Joel Siegel, he gave it the most accurate review."

Critics say the story wasn't at the expectancy level, that the story would evolve more steadily, with perfect pacing, focus at the same time true to the spiderman escence.<br/><br/>People complain about too many villains and different focuses on meaningless characters(gwen). But as a fan first rather than a critic, i still enjoyed it. It was fun and entertaining.

"fridayscaptain","3","3","4","9 May 2007"," disappointed, too much stuff in one overkill!
","I am a very big fan! Beening reading the comics from the time I was 5.(my dad collected them from the 50s). Loved both movies 1 & 2. So my whole family (there's 4 of us) been waiting for the movie to come out. Boy! were we disappointed, very disappointed. Don't get me wrong as a comic book reader I understand movies can't follow things to closely and that's fine. But I have a few problems some of the special effects & the plot of film. The effects are great like Sandman and Peter's black suit but some of the actions scenes were blurry to me (my brother also thought so) But the biggest problem was the plot, Like why is every one crying all the time in this film especially Peter, it drove me crazy. (spoiler)What about Peter dealing with the Sandman who is his uncle's killer and making friends with him afterwards or the part about the black suit with the living black glop. You know the perfect set-up was done in the last movie with J.J's son. He could of gone into outer space after M.J dumped him for Peter and brought it home. Instead it crash lands by a meteor like in slither.(there are series of books about this stuff) Another has having Gwen Stacy in the story as background, in the books she and Peter are married for 5 years before she is killed by the Green Goblin.I mean M.J. and Peter are still together at the end so why bring her in at all.(spoiler) which brings me to Harry. Harry can't be a nice guy at the end! He hates spider-man! He's crazy It makes no sense.I could go on and on but I won't. What I will say is that with the way it was ended,(I won't spoil that part) I thought (as well as the family) that this was going to be the last of the spidy movies. All in all there is too much stuff put into this film, it's very packed with plots, sub-plots and sub,sub-plots. but the holes are very visible. Some parts are boring as in is it time to go yet, while other parts this are this is so great(most of the special effects are worth it) But the ending will disappoint you. After all this is just my opinion and what one person likes someone else doesn't. If you are like me, you will take this comment with a grain of salt and go see this film away, but may-be you will go to the cheap show instead."
"fragileaswelie","5","3","4","9 May 2007"," What, did I miss something? Was this film ""Spiderman""?!
","**May Contain Spoilers**<br/><br/>Sigh. After the success of the first two Spider-man movies, I expected the third one to be as impressive, if not more. Needless to say, I was somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Since when is Spider-man supposed to be a comedy? I don't mind a few light-hearted jokes here and there, but cheezy lines and sentimental scenes just don't do it for me. Sure, you will find your typical action-packed Spider-man scenes, but you will also find Peter Parker dancing down the street like a fool. The majority of the film was one big joke, in more ways than one.<br/><br/>All through the movie I looked for something that somehow made the money I paid worthwhile, but I couldn't find one thing between the silly jokes and childish scenes. Even the Revengeful and Evil Side of Peter Parker is turned into a joke. The ending was possibly one of the soppiest, cliché endings I've ever seen. <br/><br/>How are we supposed to take this movie seriously? Was this Spider-man? Was this a cheezy low class, low budget comedy? I don't see a difference...<br/><br/>5/10, only because the action scenes were on par with the first two movies.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD."

","Spiderman 3 was considered ""the most anticipated movie of the summer"", apparently. While this might have been true, do NOT get your hopes high about seeing a fantastic movie. While there are some who say it is downright horrible, it isn't. But it isn't nearly the best of the trilogy; in fact, it's the worst.<br/><br/>The plot was very rushed, and was poorly made. But it did have a good start. After the start, though, during the middle, you're rather lost, wishing you could go home, and, finally, at the end of the movie it picks up again.<br/><br/>This 'flick' is worth your money, but will NOT fulfill your expectations if you're expecting a masterpiece. A lot of the plot was coincidental, obviously not well thought-out, and is deserving of a B as a grade.<br/><br/>Thanks, Trey."

","Snore and bore. It is time to say goodbye to Tobey and Kirsten. Do they even act anymore or are they the McDonalds of movie going? Same thing over and over and over and... well you understand. But they weren't even the worst part. What, you might ask, could possibly be worse than those two hams? The direction and the screenplay - that is what. The director seemed intent on making this a comedy. The sad thing is that it wasn't even darkly humorous. The screenplay, written by the person who directed it was horrible. I do not want to spoil anything so I will just say that I thought half of the film was stupid and I missed the other half because I was asleep. James Defranco was fun to watch and is the only actor of the three. He gets my vote to portray the next Spiderman. If you producers read this - then say goodbye to me seeing Spiderman number four unless you pull your heads out."
"jimwest59","9","3","4","7 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 Delivers Tons of Action and a Message
","Like most sequels of highly successful predecessors, Spider-Man 3 is held up by critics to a somewhat ridiculous standard. So don't let people who downgrade this movie fool you. This movie delivers exactly what the previous two installments provide: a roller coaster ride filled with action, surprises, and classic Spidey-like personal problems. In fact, although this film obviously takes virtually no plot line from the comics, it captures the madness that Spidey's life often becomes superbly (even better than the first two).<br/><br/>Granted, there is an awful lot jammed into this movie. You do start wondering, how can one person's life ever be this screwed up? Ask any teenager or college student struggling to fit into a world that seems to throw them one curve after another. Naturally and fortunately, most teenagers don't have to deal with being pummeled by mega-villains with super strength and nasty weapons.<br/><br/>And all performances in this movie are excellent; and in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst can sing!<br/><br/>So not only do you get all the ""amazing"" action you have come to expect, but some great plot twists, some good humor relief at the right moments, and a simple but important message: anger and hatred will destroy you and all those that you care about if you can't forgive those who have caused you pain."
"siege223","6","3","4","7 May 2007"," Loved this movie!
","Spiderman 3 held my attention from beginning to end. The mid-air fight scenes were AWESOME! The special effects team did a great job. The only thing that prevents this movie from getting a 10 out of 10 from me is that it was a bit long. The movie had three villains, all with their own back-stories--none of which were very well developed, I'm thinking due to time constraints. The movie also catches us up on what Peter Parker has been up to and focuses on his relationship with Mary Jane--something that I personally think could have been left off, but I guess the romance aspect of the movie draws female fans. There was a lot going on--easy to follow, but still--a little too much for a single movie in my opinion. There were some great comedic (although slightly cheesy) parts of the movie too. I don't know how anyone could not like this movie. Definitely go see it on the big screen."
"GuyCC","7","3","4","5 May 2007"," A Good Movie, But Slight Fraying Is Showing Around The Webbing.
","Spider-Man is a childhood hero of mine. I've enjoyed the comics over the years, and the second Spider-Man film is one of the greatest comic book to film movies ever made. From that standpoint, I review this as a fan, but as a film enthusiast as well.<br/><br/>I was very excited about seeing the black costume and Venom, my personal favorite moments from the comics. Spider-Man 3 was enjoyable entertainment, and broke the ""curse"" of ""Part 3"" destroying a good comic movie series (Batman, Superman, X-Men). But this didn't overthrow Spider-Man 2 as the best. It could have, but some liberties taken with the film ultimately cost it.<br/><br/>The story arcs for villains Sandman, Harry Osborn (I loathe the name ""New Goblin"") and Venom were VERY accurate to their comic counterparts. If some of it seemed a little coincidental or contrived, in honesty, that's how the stories progressed over the years, especially for Harry and Venom. They took a few liberties with Sandman, but the saving grace is that they keep to the trend of not making the ""bad guys"" one-dimensional villains.<br/><br/>This film dealt with a LOT of plot threads. Venom should have been saved for a fourth film, as once he is ""created"", he becomes underused, which is a shame for a major villain in the Spider-Man mythos. Truthfully, the film could have worked with or without Venom, who felt like an afterthought or ""fan service"". However, with 18,000 story lines running rampant in the movie, they somehow manage to keep it all together and pull it through to the end, while tying up the entire plot. That feat alone is impressive, so kudos to the Raimi's writing talents.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* <br/><br/>Still, it seemed that the only character that went anywhere by the end and actually moved forward was Harry Osborn. Peter and Mary Jane just didn't seem to end up anywhere new or different by the film's end, leaving them somewhat ambiguous. The same goes for Gwen Stacy. Another iconic character in the comics, but her status remains unknown.<br/><br/>*/SPOILER* <br/><br/>J.K. Simmons' role as J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell in his ""Where's Waldo: Spider-Man Movie Edition"" appearances in the film are once again comedy gold.<br/><br/>The real problem of the film lies in the black costume. The comic's concept holds true in the movies, but the added aspect the story gives it also introduces elements in the film that I thought was the worst moment of not only this film, but out of all three films as a whole.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* <br/><br/>Peter's need to comb over his hair ""emo"" style whenever he suited up in the black costume: The ""emo"" thing as a whole is irksome, but the movie makes it clear this is some conscious and deliberate decision on Peter's part. It's irritating that they would do this, however indirect the reference may have been. And all I could see was ""Emo Spider-Man"". Leave the fad sub-cultures out of films, please. Not just this film, but any film. It's silly to allow a comb over show that this is ""angry"" Peter, like the audience couldn't figure it out.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the film again related to the black costume. The costume isn't supposed to magnify emotions of the wearer. And when they gave that description in the dialogue, another comic-based film popped into my mind. And sure enough, Peter becomes a disco dancing, crotch thrusting show-off that that seemed to be a direct reference to Jim Carrey's ""The Mask"". If Peter has suddenly cried out ""Smokin'"", I wouldn't have been surprised. In fact, I was just waiting for him to say it and get it over with. The scene certainly went on long enough, and outwore its welcome. This is the first and only moment of all three films that made me shake my head with disbelief and disappointment.<br/><br/>The final contention point was like the second film, Spider-Man remained unmasked at any given opportunity. I'm sure this was due to making sure Tobey Maguire got some ""face"" time, but Spider-Man (until recently) had a secret identity. It felt like he'd whip the mask off for no necessary reason at any given time. One starts to question why he even used a mask at all after a while.<br/><br/>*/SPOILER* <br/><br/>Another criticism is the ""New Goblin"". I never liked the original Green Goblin costume as it was far too ""Power Rangers"" for its own good, and the biggest deviant of all the character's looks. New Goblin gives Harry an ""Extreme Snowboarder with an anger management problem"" look that honestly, he could have called himself anything, and the audience would have never made the ""Goblin"" connection.<br/><br/>Despite some issues, Spider-Man 3 was a very good film. Not a great film, but it was a good closure to the unresolved plot threads of the first two films. And overall, the characters and their motivations remained intact. As a trilogy, the films hold up very well. Thankfully, the story didn't veer off in some alternate direction that seemed inconsistent with the first two films and left one scratching their head in confusion.<br/><br/>That said, as much of a Spider-Man enthusiast as I am, I hope they don't push any farther with the series (though I'm sure they will). There are a lot of stories and villains they can cover, so the lack of source material is in no danger of being used up, but for the first time, I began to see the rough edges start to wear around the series. After the mess made with ""X-Men 3"" (putting a real chink in the armor of that series), it's best to bow out now, and keep the dignity intact of this series. As I said, the movie held up, but it became apparent that it's not going to always be so lucky in the future."
"rajdoctor","7","3","4","5 May 2007"," Spider Man 3
","This Spider Man is a bit too long, bigger than before and from my point of view a bit better.<br/><br/>There are four plots carried forward from Spider Man II  mainly his girl friend Mary Jane Watson; his friend turned enemy Osborn Junior, his grand mother and lastly his job / boss. There are a few more sub-plots  an alien black organism transforming Spider Man and later his competitive reporter to evil ones, and lastly the Sand Man. So in this movie as you must have noticed there are three enemies that Spider Man has to fight  Sand Man, Osborn Junior and the alien. With love story, action, drama and emotions - in the end Spider Man triumphs and I liked the movie just for its total entertainment value.<br/><br/>The Director Sam Raimi has himself taken a shot at co-writing the screenplay with his elder brother Ivan Raimi. I think Sam has handled the complicated story line in a very sophisticated way on screen. He has given ample time and scope for each character to develop. The under-lying emotion in the script is obviously the love-story of Spider Man. The friendly neighborhood Spider Man is vulnerable, funny, humane, emotional and lovable when he is Peter Parker. There are good sequences of actions spread across the whole movie from time to time. With the number of enemies growing  we become eager to watch the ending on how Spider Man will fight all of them. This Spider Man also dances and grooves like John Travolta on the street showing his mean side.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire excels in his role and it would be difficult to image any other face than him as Spider Man. Kristen Dust, James Franco, Thomas Hayden (as Sand Man) have played their part with director's cut.<br/><br/>If you ask me what is not there in the movie  I have to think a hundred times to answer that question. Everything is there. The movie has all the entertainment cliché  but I never expected more than that from a Spider Man movie.<br/><br/>I was happy to see for the first time - young, old, boys, girls, man and woman people  a whole range of mixed crowd enjoying the movie. Being a spectator I too enjoyed it. Take a huge bag of pop-corn, bottle of cola and chill out with die hard Spider Man fans  I think you will enjoy it more than me.<br/><br/>(Stars 7 out of 10)"

It was great to see Tobey Maguire portray Peter Parker like we've never seen him before. Topher Grace pulls off Brock/Venom surprisingly well. I have minor complaints about the story, well one, but I don't wanna spoil the film.I also thought the F/X were well done as usual but the fights/action weren't as solid as Spiderman 2, than again, this was the most story driven part of the trilogy.

"DragoonKain","8","3","4","4 May 2007"," I think they tried to do too much.
","This was a very good film. Spider-Man 3 stays true to the comic with it's depiction of the villains. But I think it tries to cram too much into one film. At two and a half hours, it seems very rushed. And this one film seemed to cover over a decades work of the comic book story arc into one film.<br/><br/>First problem. There are too many villains. You have the second Green Goblin, whose story is pretty much set up for us by the first two films, so we have room for one more. They decided on The Sandman, who is probably the best part of this film, both in it's impressive cgi use, and the great acting of Church. Lastly is Venom, who, in my opinion, deserves a film all to himself. He's pretty quintessential. While the set up for him as accurate, I still feel like they didn't have enough time to really develop how he goes from seemingly normal guy to crazed psychotic supervillan.<br/><br/>I have a distinct feeling that a lot of necessary scenes wound up on the cutting room floor, and probably would have benefited from having more scenes with Eddie Brock, and less with the Mary Jane story arc, which is nice, but at this point it's treading a lot of the same ground from the previous movies.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it seems to come together pretty well. This is also probably the funniest of the three Spider movies, with some really laugh at loud funny scenes. It also has some pretty strong heartfelt moments, particularly towards the end. Raimi is great at shifting emotions on a whim with this film, which is a sign of a truly good director. I just wish he included more witty banter during the fights. I know he wants the audience to be on the edge of their seat during the action scenes, but come on, it's Spider-Man. He needs more one liners, especially when he's fighting Venom, who usually had the best comebacks."
"ghostscript","9","12","25","6 May 2007"," Only true Spidey fans should be allowed to comment...
","If I were not a Spider-Man fan, I would say that this movie took on a different tone than the other two and that they ambitiously packed a lot into one movie. As a Spider-Man fan I can say the same and say that they did it well. They took Spidey's emotions and flaws to the forefront more so than ever before and managed to pack a WHOLE lot of accurate Spider-Man lore into the film while at the same time not being insulting or stupid with the parts there weren't accurate. They tied everything together very effectively and even though they had to rush the character development they managed to properly and appropriately develop the parts that were important to the story. They established Eddie Brock and the symbiote's reasons to hate Spider-Man and even managed to show all of the emotional vibes the both Harry Osborn and Sandman have gone through over the years and somehow manage to tie it all in to the story. All in the all, they did Spidey justice and gave such a great mix of action, romance, drama and told a story of love, revenge, inner conflict, redemption, forgiveness, friendship, jealousy, I could go on and on. It really had something for everyone and again even if I weren't a Spider-Man fan, I could appreciate it for what it was. Is it perfect? Of course not, but it's a good time that will show you so many different aspects and life and fantasy that it has something for just about any mood you could have and THAT makes for a very good film."

But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines.

","This time Raimi goes Gothic, incorporating the Spider-Man~Venom battle in the bell tower as seen in the Amazing Spider-Man comics ~ Spider-Man first took the venom costume in Secret Wars # 8 (1984), when his own red-and-blue costume was damaged. He discovered the symbiote costume in a facility in the world where a whole host of Marvel heroes and villains had been sent by the Beyonder to battle.<br/><br/>In Raimi's film, the costume finds its way into Parker's bedroom, the alien substance attaching itself to Parker (Tobey Maguire), lending him a new costume which in turn lends him a far greater  albeit more dangerous  power. The costume also changes his characteristics, making him more confident, arrogant and at times  aggressive. It is at the bell tower scene where he loses the costume to reporter Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). Parker realizes the costume is vulnerable to high pitched sounds. Brock has been humiliated by Parker, while Parker is under the influence of the black costume, and follows him to the church. Brock becomes venom, one of Spider-Man's most deadly foes.<br/><br/>The second villain to appear in Spider-Man is the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), a criminal who is caught in an experiment gone wrong; his physical state is that of a malleable sand-like substance that can be shaped according to the Sandman's will.<br/><br/>The third is the return of the Green Goblin, the character this time taken by Harry Osborne (James Franco) after his father (Willem Dafoe) died in the first movie.<br/><br/>Villains aside, the other storyline is the ongoing troubles between Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), their relationship still on the slide here, and not eased by Parker's new-found powers born out of the symbiote~alien costume. Even the villains claim some small shred of empathy in Spider-Man 3, their own personal lives being as troubled as Parker's, or else their lives affected by the symbiote~webslinger.<br/><br/>As a bonus there is the Gwen Stacy~Captain Stacy (James Cromwell) storyline, Gwen being the girl who attempts to steal Spider-Man's affections from MJ ~ Too many villains, some say? I thought this was almost as good as the first movie (the origin). The scene from the bell tower  taken frame-by-frame from the original comic  was as well-made as the 'Spider-Man No More' sequence in 'Spider-Man 2'.<br/><br/>Action-packed yet dark and Gothic in places, Spider-Man 3 is another triumph for Sam 'Evil Dead' Raimi.<br/><br/>Also stars Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson), J K Simmons (an amazing transformation as J Jonah Jameson), Bruce Campbell (Maître d'), Teddy Raimi, Emma Raimi, Lorne Raimi and Henry Raimi.<br/><br/>Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review."
"barry326","1","4","6","31 August 2007"," I would slap Stan Lee for allowing this movie
","Sorry Stan, much respect for you, but I don't understand how you let this happen. I watched this at the movies the first day it came out in Australia.<br/><br/>As I watched the opening, I thought "" well this is odd, but at least venom is coming"".<br/><br/>Then as it continued, I still held on to the dream. No matter how bad they screwed the storyline, at least venom was coming, and that would save everything.<br/><br/>And then venom turns up, and he destroyed any chance of redemption. He is supposed to be a big guy, who has joined with a symbiote, and has a double voice, sounding like a scream, with a really scary face. Instead, they have that weak little girl from that 70's show, and instead of making him scary, by giving him venom's scary face, they remove the face, and have the actors face and voice, whining like the little girl that he is. Whats up with that???? I know I have completely ignored the aspect of sandman, but thats because he's not worth it. He's dull, and unnecessary. Venom would've made or broken this movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he broke it.<br/><br/>From the time I heard the first movie was coming out I was excited, because I knew that meant Venom would be there eventually. Then I heard the 3rd movie would be his, and I couldn't wait. Now my dreams have been shattered.<br/><br/>Now there is only one more great character left. His name is CARNAGE. If you cannot portray him, and his struggle with venom correctly, please do no not try. It will only ruin it for us and the new following of younger fans will in no way make up for the older ones of us that you lose.<br/><br/>I'm begging you to stop now, if you can't get it right.<br/><br/>Sincerely Barry."
"Solnichka","1","4","6","3 June 2007"," Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen ...
","My wife and I were laughing AT this movie: the plot had no purpose until the last 1/3 of the film, the subplots meandered all over the place with no continuity or flow (probably the result of poor editing; the first hour felt like two hours!), and the inexplicable ""black goo"" from the meteor was ridiculous. It was like that joke in ""Thank You for Smoking"", where you can explain anything away with a bit of scientific dialogue: Dylan Baker's role was essential worthless, except for his two-bit contribution to the ""black goo"" subplot (""It's a strange form of alien aggression!""). Do the producers think we're stupid? Evidently.<br/><br/>Topher Grace was a disgrace; that character had no value whatsoever. At least the ""Sandman"" subplot had substance; it may have been the only redeeming part of the movie. The woman who plays Parker's aunt is also worth every penny you pay to see her; however, she's not the focus of the plot, obviously. The love triangle of Franco, Dunst and Maguire was stale after the first movie; stretching into three movies just made me yawn. I mean, we can only grasp the fact ""MJ"" sucks as an actor so many times, right? And what the hell was with that scene where MJ ""dumps"" Peter in the park? That was never resolved in the movie's plot, even as Lil' Osborne dies. Was Peter just supposed to forget that ever happened? Evidently, the editors thought we'd be stupid enough to not notice that plot hole.<br/><br/>The CG is not good for a movie of this stature; the Green Goblin Jr. scenes are just silly. The whole Parker-as-Travolta scenes are just cheesy; again, we were laughing AT the movie, not with it as I am sure the producers wished. All I can say is thank god we only paid $3.50 for our tickets to this horrible movie."

","I had enjoyed the first two, they were good, so I was looking forward to this one. Oh boy, it was an experience. Originally myself and my daughter (age 16) went into the cinema and someone brought in a TWO year old child!!! The kids next to us behind us and in front of us were talking noisily and the parents did nothing, in fact one mother actually encouraged her kids by talking just as loudly. After 10 minutes of this we gave up and left. I saw the manager to complain and get my money back as we had travelled 90 miles there and had to travel 90 back to see this movie, luckily he said there was another showing due to start in 15 minutes on another screen and it was empty in there. So in we trotted and it was quieter. Oh boy, the sound quality was poor and despite several people going out to complain it didn't get better, but, it was still better than sitting amongst a group of noisy brats. As for the film, well, it was unbelievably poor, a good half hour could have been cut out, including Tobey Maguire cringingly awful sequence when he's emo, Gwen Stacey was pointless, so was much of MJ and Peter's tribulations. The high spots were the action sequences, Thomas Haden Church was tragically underused as was Topher Grace, THC last scenes were the high spot, borough down by the great big cryfest over Harry (blah). And I didn't get what was going on with Harry, he seemed to heal awfully quick after being hurt not once, but, twice, but no explanation was given as to why. Was he genetically altered from going in his Father's machine or was it just plain lazy scripting?<br/><br/>Anyway, an all round poor experience. What a shame as it could have been so much better"

","being a fan of the first two spiderman movies i couldn't wait to see the third. when i finally did i couldn't believe what i just saw. i am willing to say that the hulk was a hair away from being a better movie(sorry hulk fans but that was a really bad movie). sadly the writers and directors dropped the ball. beside the sappy chick flick elements the took up the entire movie, the fight scenes that we've all come to love in the series just weren't there (well they were, but in 2 minute spurts every 30 or so minutes). sadly the best part of the movie was the banter between j.j. jameson and his secretary in the beginning of the movie but is still a forgettable moment. while the hero that gets the girl in the end is always a good thing in a superhero movie in this case the troubles between parker and m.j. just got annoying. you couldn't help but not care. the relationship between harry and parker was not fully explored as well as it could have been. sorry to say but there are nothing but holes in every single character.<br/><br/>i will however admit the special effects were amazing, but a movie cannot be based on it's effects. it still has to have a solid or a reminisce of a good story.<br/><br/>i have never wanted to walk out of a movie, but came really close on this one, in hopes that the final fight would save the movie(guess what? it didn't). you are better off waiting for the fx premiere to see this but if you must see it save your money and rent it from blockbuster."
"DunkD","2","4","6","18 May 2007"," Betrays what went before
","It is surprising that Spiderman 3 was directed by Sam Raimi, who directed the first two movies - as Spiderman 3 betrays the major flaw of sequels directed by someone else. Namely betraying what we learnt in previous movies for the sake of a lazy plot.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers follow - if you still care ***<br/><br/>In the case of this movies, these are serious betrayals. We learn that Spiderman did NOT kill the first green goblin, and we learn that the guy that killed Peter Parker's uncle in the first movie - well actually it was some other guy who turns into the Sandman in this movie (and it ain't the Gothic Niel Gaiman Sandman.) And what we get for this betrayal isn't something exciting or clever. It just feels like they made it up each day as they arrived on the set.<br/><br/>Then you've got the special effects. So damn lazy. ""Hey - I know - let's take something that's formless and give it the form of a person and some other things"". This hasn't really wowed this viewer since Terminator 2. Has the big multi-million blockbuster SFX movie really not moved on from this in the last 15 odd years? TWO formless substances (sand and mysterious black goo) that can take on lots of different forms isn't really twice as exciting. OK - it is a bit more refined in delivery, but hardly jaw dropping. Surely special effects people can come up with something a bit more exciting for the dough.<br/><br/>Then we get this camera work that is almost unwatchable. The action moves so fast you can't really tell what is going on - shame, since the first two flicks were fast but clear. Did they forget what worked. The chase scenes would work well in a computer game, but not a movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the plot. Really. It shouldn't matter, but it is so boring it detracts from the fun.<br/><br/>For me, this movie follows in the footsteps of X-Men 3. The end of the superhero movie. Time to move on folks."
"mbrook6","1","4","6","16 May 2007"," Spidey 3 sucks...
","Profoundly disappointed is the only way to describe how I felt about ""Spiderman 3"". In fact, commenting on what was good in the movie is easy, Kristen Dunst, that's all. The entire movie felt like first take scenes strung together by coincidence and contrivance. I found none of the fights or action sequences to be entertaining or thrilling or remotely engaging. I have read many reviews which equate ""Spiderman 3"" into nothing more than a glorified video game, and I find that insulting to video games. Much more thought and care goes into the construction of video games and their respective story lines than anything that Sam Raimi and Sony vomit up on the screen in ""Spiderman 3"". <br/><br/>When blended correctly with animatronics, make-up, and real action, CGI can be an enormously effective tool in movies (See the original ""Jurassic Park"", The Lord of the Rings series, The Harry Potter series). However, nothing but CGI does not illicit any response at all. It is flat and boring with nothing to emotionally invest the viewer in the action. ""Spiderman 3"" felt like a contractual obligation, and Sony just wanting to blow as much of their wad on the screen as possible. The best thing is that for $250,000,000 it looks pretty crappy. If you have seen ""The Mummy"", then you have seen the Sandman effects, which are only slightly better. The best thing about the first two Spiderman Movies is that no matter what happened, it all came down to very human and believable characters thrust into very special circumstances. ""Spiderman 3"" looses its focus and goes the way of ""Batman and Robin"" by just cramming as much crap as they possibly could in order to justify the budget and try to deflect attention from the fact that it is really an awful movie. Tobey Maguire and James Franco gave Peter and Harry so much depth in the first two are basically turned into either jokes or CGI figures with the actors heads digitally pasted on top. New additions to the cast are also completely useless, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas-Howard, and Thomas Hayden Church barely get any time, any lines, any depth, or any reason for the viewers to give a damn about what happens to them. <br/><br/>What bothers me most is when people treat comics with the proper respect and really take full advantage of the emotional punch they can pack just decide to give up and make hackneyed crap like ""Spiderman 3"". This sentiment is best illustrated by the scene in ""Spiderman 2"" in which a room of doctors try to remove Doc Ock's newly fused tentacles. That scene in ""Spiderman 2"" is thrilling, dark, action packed, and really showed just how much Sam Raimi respected the mythos of Spiderman and its possibilities. This scene and the treatment of the Doc Ock throughout the movie, along with the original Goblin, gave me great hope that they would continue this tradition in the third movie, especially considering the inclusion of the Venom character. This movie had all of the potential and resources to make a dark, funny, thrilling, and moving third movie. Instead, the villains in ""Spiderman 3"" are flat and uninteresting. Sandman and Venom become nothing more than excuses to utilize special effects that are in no way innovative and have been done much, much better.<br/><br/>Sandman is boring. His initial set of motives in the movie is even less compelling, and it shows by the screenwriters desperate attempt to tie Sandman emotionally to Peter and Aunt Mae. It just felt contrived. And poor Eddie Brock/Venom! What a f**king waste of an enormous opportunity! ""Venom's"" (if you want to call that CGI booger Venom) inclusion and total dismissal in the movie smacks of Sony forcing Sam Raimi to include a character which he didn't like or understand. Venom, the symbiote, the black suit, and Peter's turn to the ""darkside"" are treated as nothing more than a joke, or, worse, a convenient way for them to attempt to ratchet up the action in the final battle between Spidey and what amounts to nothing more than a sandy version of the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. The Venom/Eddie Brock storyline was more than ample enough to provide fertile ground for the entire plot of ""Spiderman 3"". Proper handling of the Venom storyline would have enabled ""Spiderman 3"" to easily become the best movie in the series. All of it could have been incredibly emotional, dark, twisted, thrilling. Instead, we get this heap of crap that you don't even have to see to know exactly, and I mean exactly, what is going to happen from the minute you walk into the movie. Hell, you don't even need to see it! Just based on the information released by Sony before the movie's release was enough for me to find not a single scene of interest in the entire film, except for a lone fight between Harry and Peter in the Osbourne Mansion. After very conveniently crashing to earth at the exact same time that Peter and Mary Jane just happen to be in the same spot, the symbiote turns out to be nothing more than a creeping pile of alien dog doo that amplifies aggression, which no one who steps in it can scrape off, and the final 15 minute full incarnation of Venom is not threatening, scary, or even necessary. Here's hoping that they learn their lesson and don't make the same mistake with Carnage in the next movie. <br/><br/>Finally, before the third film was released, everyone was speculating what would happen if Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, and Kristen Dunst decided they didn't want to return for a 4th, 5th or 6th film in the series. Well after seeing what the did to the third movie, the answer is simple and blatant: maybe they can redeem themselves and make a film that isn't just plain insulting to anyone who wastes their time or money on ""Spiderman 3""."

I would have rather sat through two hours of crappy soap operas then watch that movie again.<br/><br/>Every scene that they were trying to make funny turned out so corny and overdone that you could hardly even watch.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible.

"paulogomescoelho-1","4","4","6","11 May 2007"," To a Marvel fan this was bad
","I'll try to be short. Spiderman 2 was the only acceptable movie of the trilogy, it had a lot of JJJ, least of Tobey playing his dumb scenes of Peter Parker (instead of just being a shy, rational guy), and a good villain (in fact villains were the overall positive things of the trilogy), Spider2 just lacked on action, it just should have had more, it made the movie a little boring. Now some things about spider 3. 1st, Peter Parker, that wasn't Parker, was the usually dumb Tobey. Damn, even the characters of SandMan and Venom were better than I expected, but this actor, Tobey was at his worst, more than ever. He stands behind the crowd without the mask =| He fights without the mask, he does that donkey face and starts to dance...he made me sick with just 2minutes of the movie start. His spider sense was OFF, and he gets more beat than superman and still stays OK, I don't get it. I think MJ was really OK, it's hard to do better when we're not physically similar to the BD MJ. JJJ is GOLD but was deeply underrated on the this movie. Harry...well Harry is bad, at least cut your hair man! To be a bit similar to the real harry, at least physically. Topher Grace (Brock/Venom) and Thomas Church (Sandman/FlintMarko) were OK, I really think sandman was more than OK, he succeed in to pass that feeling about family he has at BD. I'll not bother you more, just mention some things like: Venom should appeared more and be bigger than spider, that would make bigger impact, Goblin's pumpkin makes a scar to harry but kills venom, wow; And that's it, sorry my bad English, I'm Portuguese.

","I cant believe how bad it was. The movie focuses on a sandman who is a good guy and a bad guy, at the same time. Where did his character come from? Thin air. No plot development for his character he just existed because they wanted another story line for the movie. Which brings me on to my next point.<br/><br/>The movie has too many story lines and to many characters, they have no depth, to rectify this the actors forced emotions that weren't even called for and just showed up as terrible acting. It appears if the movie was just made up as they went along, and saying to themselves ""10 minutes of the movie to go, ah we forgot venom lets just put him in and kill him off real quickly""<br/><br/>And then spiderman gets affected by the poison that just happens to come from space oh so conveniently, and harry just happens to suffer from amnesia to satisfy the needs of the movie. The script was so terribly put together it just showed a lack of direction and forethought.<br/><br/>And the worst part was the lack of direction in both film genre and character emotion. Is it an action film or a drama or a thriller or a Broadway disaster. And then when you think this movie cant get any worse spiderman turns into an emo, yes, an emo.

"Vynson","5","10","20","5 May 2007"," This movie betrays the Spider-Man mythos
","Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>There's great CGI here. Wonderful fight scenes and tons of action. But the relationships don't work. The Pete/MJ chemistry seemed absent. I didn't care if they were together or not. Gwen had nothing to do, but Howard and the script at least hinted at the kind of person she was in the comic and why Peter Parker loved her.<br/><br/>The relationship that worked was Pete/Harry. It was far more interesting than anything else in the movie. I can see James Franco going on to great stardom. I also enjoyed the warped variation of the villain/butler relationship as contrasted with the Batman/Alfred cliché.<br/><br/>Topher as Eddie Brock was painless, if not especially interesting. Seeing the guy go to church to pray for Peter Parker's death seemed kinda stupid, but OK. That he happened to go to the same church where Pete was hanging around the bell tower trying to peel of his alien costume was asking a bit much. And why Pete was in the bell tower anyway when he hadn't figured out that loud noises are the symbiote's weakness is a bit disturbing. Why would anyone choose to strip in a bell tower? So the goo drips onto Brock and he becomes Venom. Always thought he was a rather stupid villain with no real dimension. This film did nothing to add depth to the character for me.<br/><br/>So the first thing Venom does is get Sandman to help him take on Spidey. Why? He's got new powers and should be feeling very tiptop... but he thinks he needs to team up with Sandman before he even thinks of confronting Parker. What kind of villain is that? What kind of writer, in trying to build up the sense of menace in his villain, decides that he needs to make fear of the hero a defining characteristic? Weak! Weak! With that confidence issue, it is hard to see Venom as anything more than a wuss.<br/><br/>The tiny subplot of Sandman and his daughter was interesting. Far more interesting than any of the Venom stuff or any of Mary Jane's whining/singing/whining/more singing. But they never paid it off. I guess we are left to wonder if Flint Marko is going to go finish stealing the money he needs to save his kid (with Parker's implied blessing), or if he is going to turn himself in and let her die... or just what the hell he's going to do. The writer's bit into something interesting in their setup of this character, but never chewed it or digested it. Just spat it out without a thought, leaving the audience distracted by CGI smash and crash as if enough mayhem might pass as substitute for humanity and actual plot points.<br/><br/>But when I care more about the little girl in Sandman's locket than I do the girl Peter is giving Aunt May's ring to, the jewelry parallel that could have been an interesting bit of writing, becomes a trap that the writers' lack the talent to escape. I didn't care if Pete and MJ stuck together or got engaged. I wanted Sandman to save his little girl. And I wanted his wife to appreciate the lengths he went to in his efforts to save their child. Theresa Russell's loathing for her ex didn't ring true. It was tired and clichéd.<br/><br/>But these aren't the biggest problems with Spider-Man 3. The biggest problem is that Sam Raimi betrayed Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. He betrayed the character of Peter Parker. He did this by having Flint Marko emerge as the actual killer of Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>Understand what this means. It means that Peter's off the hook. It means that the man he refused to stop was a mere thief; not the future murderer of Uncle Ben. It means the man he chased into the warehouse and pursued to his death was a petty thief. It means that Peter need not feel any guilt about his Uncle's death. It means that the event that taught him his defining lesson of great power and great responsibility never happened.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's defining moment... gone.<br/><br/>And so Raimi has betrayed the character and the franchise with this outing. I am very disappointed."
"alltrier","3","10","20","4 May 2007"," Not everything magically turns Out for the best in the end
","This is the first review I've ever written on this page, and I'm a long-time user, so I believe it counts for something when I say that I didn't really like this, the third movie of the series. As a fan I really don't want to say this, because like everyone else I've been waiting for this movie for three years in hopes of some kind of epic blockbuster to come out of it. It is therefore that I with heavy heart have to declare Spider-man 3 the biggest ""suppose-to-be-blockbuster"" flop of the year. <br/><br/>Where to begin? Oh yeah, the characters! All very nice done from a visual point of view. However, there could have been room for much more development of the characters, had one been removed from the story. I think the obvious choice would have been The Sandman, thereby also removing the whole ""This is your uncles real killer"" BS and a lot of scenes with grown men crying. Don't get me wrong. There should be room for that to in a movie like this, but I think Raimi over exaggerated just a little bit when it came to writing these scenes. Enough is enough! Also, had The Sandman been left out of the script, it would have given Venom a chance to live up to his comic self, who by the way is almost unbeatable. However Spider-Man manages to finish him of in less than ten minutes, and almost entirely by himself. Let's face it! Movie-Venom is a pathetic loser compared to the Venom from the comics, who we all love to hate. Finally the one thing I hated most about The Sandman was his origin. I am, of cause, thinking of the sand spinning machine in witch he gets caught. I know that the movie is not supposed to be believable, but this is pushing it. Even for a comic-to-movie adaptation. They don't even try to explain what it does and to what purpose, it is simply just there.<br/><br/>It's not that I didn't give the movie a chance. Through the first half of it, I credited it for the way it stuck to the comic genre, maybe a little too much, but none the less. Then as it progressed with scene upon scene with raw action I thought to myself: ""This might just work out."" However, it did not. And if so, it was very poorly done. There was no kind of release to these scenes, and at the end of the movie I wanted it to continue. It was like something was missing. And then I realized that it was a proper ending, or at least just an ending. That would have been nice. It was like Raimi and the other writers had reached the point in the script, where they were suppose to place a proper ending, and then, in stead of doing so, put in the words: ""Everything magically turns out for the best within about ten minutes or so The End."" Realizing now, as I write this, that the whole movie actually needed release. One should think that this was what disappointed me most about the film. However, it was not. It's not that I'm anti-American or anything like that, but when Spidey stopped for a photo op. in front of the good old red, white and blue, while the love of his life is in the hands of a psychotic super villain, I felt like I wouldn't be able to say one decent thing about the film. Luckily I came up with a couple, which leads to the rating of the movie.<br/><br/>It gets two stars because it stays true to the comic style. Then it receives a single star for the Goblin-Spidey relationship at the end. And a final star simply because I don't wish to give a Spider-Man movie less than four out of ten stars.<br/><br/>I really hope they go through with the fourth movie, and that it makes up for predecessor."

"hmmdrmike","1","46","121","6 May 2007"," Like 2 Bad Movies Combined into One Really Terrible Movie!
","First, let me say that the fighting sequences were EXCELLENT. Better than the first two combined. With that said, the plot is fraught will HUGE plot holes, the acting is atrocious (James Franco & Thomas Haden Church) being the only two watchable actors, and the dialogue was ridiculously bad.<br/><br/>The Plot - it really seemed like Sam Raimi was trying to combine 2 movies into one. The fact that he tried to cram so much into such a short amount of time ends up hurting the movie more than anything else. No storyline is developed properly and the audience is left wondering why most of the action is happening.<br/><br/>The Acting - I'm a huge Topher Grace fan, but he's a terrible Venom. I'm not entirely sure why he was chosen to be Eddie Brock, maybe because Sam Raimi knew that most of his viewers wouldn't know the comic book version of Eddie Brock, but honestly Toper Grace was just a terrible choice regardless. Kristen Dunst is one of the worst actresses in Hollywood. I don't know why people continue to cast her in movies. Mary Jane Watson is supposed to be a supermodel. Kristen Dunst looks like a horse. Barbaro would've done a better job. Everyone else, however, did a great job.<br/><br/>The Dialogue - It was just cheesy and terrible. Like everything else in the movie, it felt rushed and forced.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie will go on to break box office records when it really shouldn't. It tricked me into watching it and I'm sure it'll trick millions of other people. If you MUST see it, wait until the DVD and get a bunch of friends together to make fun of it. Terrible 1/10"
"Quinoa1984","9","22","53","4 May 2007"," nearly the best, or at least most overall satisfying, of the franchise; has terrific (and gleefully corny) humor, big action, and superb characterizations
","Sam Raimi knows what he's doing with the Spider-Man franchise. Some will come away from this third installment and disagree, that he's put out an over-long, angry/sad/delirious blockbuster that doesn't reach into the same levels that the first two films did. For me, if anything, Raimi has gone further in the best possible ways: he's made the kind of grand entertainment that he's been working for since the last two films. One thing to remember, of course, is that the Spider-Man movies are each rides unto themselves, with lots of emotional twists meant to get the audience sucked in by its complex human characters and the wild new villains. <br/><br/>But this time there's a darker element to it- something that could be comparable to the Star Wars movies- where the old key Spider-Man concept (power=responsibility) is really put to the test. It comes in the form of a black gooey parasite-whatever that comes out of the remains of a small comet that's hit Earth. How it got there or why it does what it does isn't so much the issue as what it does to that which it connects to: it brings out what's easier to have as a person, vengeance, lust, greed, and above all a lack of conscience. It's an agent of cinematic contrivance, to be sure, but it's a crucial one for the series as Peter Parker has to come to terms with this other choice- and he's not the only one.<br/><br/>There is a good deal going on in Spider-Man 3, no argument about that. There's three foes of Peter/Spider-Man: Harry has gone fully into being a chip off the old block by taking on his late father's technical gear to get his own vengeance; Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), escapee from prison, who is really the one responsible for Uncle Ben's death, and succumbs to a particle-changing mechanism and becomes Sandman; Eddie Brock (a surprise, Topher Grace), who's not so much a foe as a kind of cocky annoyance to Peter, and who doesn't really become much of a threat until the third act when aforementioned back gooey stuff comes into the picture. And there's some added girl drama with Gwen Stacy (Howard), who comes in as an unintentional block in the way of Peter and Mary Jane's happiness, albeit as not the main block. There's layers this time to the Parker/Spider-Man saga in that this is the first time we see Spider-Man as the hero of the city, or cheered on as such, and so this time Peter/Spider-Man is in the power position, which then goes on to affect his relationship with MJ. Then there's another line with Harry, who gets short-term memory loss after a fight, and what this brings out between the three of them (Peter and MJ that is).<br/><br/>Add on to this the black suit, and its own immense connotation. This is where Raimi has some of his most devilish fun as a filmmaker in years, but at the same time gets out of it on the whole some of those especially poignant and morally questioning points out of comic-books that many take for granted. Of course, it's hard not to laugh as we see the 'bad-boy' Peter, with his hair ala Flock of Seagulls and attitude to spare. Yet it brings to question what Peter, not just Spider-Man, needs to be for those closest to him as much as with those in the city. And even more than the second film, Raimi and his cast get to some fascinating dimensions with the villains. <br/><br/>These aren't just simplemutants or miscreants; they've got incredible, massively damaging powers, to one degree or another (Sandman can destroy the most and make the biggest impression, but Venom is the black suit personified as a real monster, and Harry has got only one real nemesis), and deep down are damaged themselves with how they've dealt with the real world and personal trauma. Even when Spider-Man 3 edges onto its most cliché and corny material (including one shot with Spider-Man behind an American flag in his flight), it's a sort of earned corniness because it doesn't fail to be amusing, if only in recognizable ways (recognizable in that we're all used to and respond emotionally to the characters), and leads up to somewhere satisfying on a mass-appeal scale.<br/><br/>And one more note should be made to the visual effects, which are par for the course spectacular (what else will one do with millions and millions and millions of dollars?) and expansive for the villains- the incredible detail with Sandman- as well as in general what isn't noticed during the fight and action scenes. But to me it's all the more impressive that Raimi and company uses all of these tools to his advantage by not letting them overpower the story at hand. Even during its moments of pure pop-opera and put-on magisterial effect, there's substance that's rewarding and a lot deeper that many in the audience might take for granted. By the end, nevertheless, it's a Raimi picture through and through, loaded with tongue-in-cheek bits and action-packed, high-flying theatrics, and ending on a note that makes the series feel all the more complete....."

","Raimi has done it again. I feel that this franchise continues to get better and better. It is because the director has learn the great secret of great movie making. If the audience cares about the characters the effects just enhance the experience. I am a fan of the comics. So it is suffice to say don't go to this movie expecting a concrete copy of the characters comic lives. What Taimi has done is capture the soul of the characters. Peter Parker is interesting because he continues to have problems. Not just the enemies he faces but the enemies within. I felt that the first films theme was responsibility, the second film's theme was choices, and this new movies theme is about forgiveness. This is what I love about this film though it is dark the hero still manages to rise up and face what ever odds are against him. Each character is important and the villains are delightful. Definitely a 10/10.We are in rare territory where a entire trilogy is continues to impress."
"wlan","1","7","13","6 May 2007"," A true disappointment
","I'm a huge comics fan, esp. spider man. I loved the first 2 movies, and thought 3rd one would be the best of the series. It wasn't... I had expected Peter Parker to spend more time with the alien costume, fight for good. But Sam Raimi wanted to put to many things in one thing and all went wrong. Black costume is not an ordinary clothes. It is alive. You can't just take it out like an outfit and lock it in a box. It hides itself on Peter's body when Peter wants to wear his casual clothes. In addition black costume design was awful. Tobey Maguire cannot play bad guys, I saw that. If you think of an emo kid when they tell you about a real evil guy, then you all got it wrong. Raimi got it wrong. He wasted the black costume legend in this movie. You can't tell Venom's story in 15 minutes. He is the biggest villain in Spiderman history. He must have threaten Peter's family and people he loves. Only thing we saw was Venom's cooperating with Sandman to finish Spiderman off, which he couldn't succeed. I suggest Sam Raimi not to direct any action movies from now on. To sum up, SM3 was the biggest disappointment in 2007."

This Spiderman is nothing else than a complete disappointment. The cherry on the cake was the appearance under the American flag.Do I have to watch such a cheap propaganda? this film shows New-yorkers like total jerks, converts them to characters. a cheering mass away for any sense of danger. This is a movie with a totally stupid spider-man, with only one respectful character, yes the sand man. And finally the complete stupid: ""I forgive you"". Seems that any movie those days has a meaning, a deep one to be honest. And yes, lots of CG. But unfortunately, this is not cinematography. especially after last month's ""300"". Turn back to read the comics or even the animated series. This is a rip-off spider-man..."

","It is a weird feeling to walk out of a theater barking about just seeing the worst movie ever made, but also having a sense of enjoyment, because hey, at least you got to laugh for over 2 hours. A laugh is well and good, but not when you hope for a serious movie that turns out to be horrific in every way possible.<br/><br/>Spider-man 3 is a travesty. And the worst part is that all involved could care less, because they got all of us to see their piece of crap and are rolling around basking in the glow of millions of dollars. The acting is joke. Tobey Maguire is up there with Orlando Bloom as one of the worst actors in Hollywood. Any serious line out of his mouth can only be followed by laughter. But maybe it is not his fault. Let's put that on the writers' who gave us a predictable, boring story line that a seven year could write. For example, the 5 minute scene where Maguire dance walks around town, sporting his new attitude so brilliantly portrayed by his changed hair style, which makes him look like an out of work model. Or how about the wonderful forensic skills of the Osbournes' butler, who advises Harry that the mortal wound on his father chest was from his glider and not from Spider-man. He certainly would have the expertise to deduce that fact. I could go on forever, but the point has been made.<br/><br/>I guess this all should have been expected. The first two movies in this series were awful also. At least I waited for those to get on TV before I saw them. Stay away from this movie like you would the plague...unless you are in for a good chuckle."
"lecomtess_montecristo","5","7","13","4 May 2007"," Great Expectations...
","Before you turn away, know this: I'm a huge Spiderman fan; he's my favorite superhero and I adored the first two. I liked this movie, but it's more complicated than this. I was about to go see it again with some friends tomorrow, but now I won't. I don't even know if I should get it on DVD or add it to my favorites, although I'll probably do both (I can't have 1 and 2 and not have 3). In the long run though, I believe that this movie was a dreadful victim of circumstances and had the potential to be something much greater and better (and if Sam Raimi had stuck to his original plan for it rather than listening to Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin, I'm sure it would have). So anyway on to the review. This movie was two and a half hours long, but for all it contained, it was still too short. Too much was packed into this movie; far, far too much. Too many villains, and too many characters. Gwen Stacy was entirely unnecessary (even played by the wonderful Bryce Howard), and one of the villains, be it Venom or Sandman, also had to be left out. In fact, the entire plot was a mess and instead of making sense, it was only more confusing from one moment to the next, up to the point when you couldn't but wonder, 'what are they on about now?'. The acting in this movie wasn't exactly something to write home about, and Tobey Maguire disappointed me the most (and I wish I didn't have to say that because he is one of my favorite actors). His acting suffered greatly from the writing his character suffered from. Most of his on-screen time, he looked like he didn't quite know what to do with himself or what they wanted from him. He had no idea what his character should be like in (whatever) particular situation and frankly, I can't blame him, because neither did I. as an actor, I'm sure this film was hell on earth to go through. The supporting actors were all rather flat as well, and Kirsten Dunst has given, again, one of her less-than-admirable performances (and unlike Tobey, she can't quite blame it on her character). The only ones I can praise in this movie to a certain extent are James Franco and Rosemary Harris. They are the only ones, in this chaos, that managed to somehow make sense, and bearing in mind their character suffered the least, they at least had it easy. Some scenes in the film were so cheese dripping that I wanted to choke. I actually laughed out loud in that dreadful all-American scene of Spiderman popping up in front of the flag. The American patriotism and the idiotic news report simply killed the movie all on their own to a certain extent. That aside, there was far too much symbolism, and what's worse, for some reason they felt they had to spell it out for us, and what is even worse than overdone symbolism is obvious symbolism. The religious connotations in the church ridding him of evil and the bad guy (who abused god for evil) getting it on himself instead was way overdone, and same with Harry's half mutilated face, apparently reflecting his inner battle, and of course there is more. And just something I wonder couldn't his all-knowing butler tell him that daddy had died by his own hand before Peter kicked half of his ass? Of course not, because that would have actually made sense. Leaving out New York's obsession with Spiderman and the utterly and dreadfully idiotic Spiderman-parade would have made sense also. Most of the themes examined in this film were too far fetched and undeveloped. The father-daughter thing with Sandman made me roll my eyes (me, the ultimate daddy's girl!), Eddie's idiotic competitiveness-turned-vengeance-gig got the same reaction. The Peter/M.J storyline was completely senseless and there was absolutely no reason for them to be so unrecognizably messed up that I could see. They should have just given them their happily-ever-after cheese and moved on. The only good thing was the Peter/Harry relationship development, but even that was somewhat scorched around the edges. In fact, Harry was almost the only good thing about it, and to top the already misguided and flawed ending, they killed him off. The special effects were awesome, nothing to say there. The black-suited Spiderman was absolutely fantastic and I loved every second. However, the special effects were, also, overdone. There were simply too many of them. The best thing about special effects is when they are done within reason, when you consciously don't notice them. Unfortunately, it was not the case in ""Spiderman 3"". The battles themselves often felt like lesser remakes of something we had seen in the previous two films, and that was a shame. I can't say I was all-around happy with the way they were done. There were, of course, quite a few good moments. The black-Spiderman scenes were superb, as well as some of Tobey's other scenes (especially in the evil-Peter capacity), such as his little performance in the jazz club, that was really fun to watch. His teaming up with Harry in the end was also rather well done. Well what else is there to say, really? I don't know. I'm thinking right now about something definitely good that I could point out, but I seem to have run out of those (already pointed out the ones that were worthwhile). Yes, I know for a fact now, I will get this film on DVD because I simply can't not add it to my collection, and hell, the Peter/Harry dynamics and the black suit alone made it worthwhile. And still, I can't help but wish for so many things to have been different. I was expecting this one to be the best of the three, and I'm afraid it just might be the worst."

I can see why Toby McGuire wants to distance himself from this franchise now. I believe he has stated he will only do another if Raimi stays on board and Raimi is evidently looking to move to different projects now. So Toby has a "" polite"" way out. He must be breathing a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>I just hope Raimi gets his act together for whatever he does next.<br/><br/>Judging by the poor pacing, poor storytelling and poor balancing of Spiderman 3 I can only hope he does not get ""The Hobbit"" as is rumoured.<br/><br/>My awarded score is based on the excellent acting,( ALL actors in the film were great by the way, and the guys who played Eddie Brock and Sandman were fabulous ) and amazing action scenes.

"shanfloyd","7","9","18","5 May 2007"," Good enough... but tangled up too much.
","Oh how we love those summer blockbusters... it's true we expect too much from them, especially when they're sequels to really quality films. And it's also true we pounce to criticize them with harsh cruelty when they fail to meet our expectations. 'Spiderman 3' is a perfect summer blockbuster at its own credit. But it has got two wonderful movies as its prequels... so, it faces a tough challenge.<br/><br/>Three villains... one of them my favorite - Venom. Where the movie really fails is its attempts to show the backgrounds of all three of them. OK, the goblin needs no background. But Venom gets the least screen time and I'm not satisfied. A good villain needs time to grow... See, all of the major Spidey villains have their brighter pasts from where they slowly transform to villains. In this film this transformation is hurried and shown abruptly, which quite kills the movie's mood. I believe the film wastes more time on Sandman than it needed.<br/><br/>Another major aspect of the film is Peter Parker's alter ego as the black spiderman after he's infected by the symbiote. I loved the sequence in the jazz club for sure, but I also think the character is shown overtly egomaniacal and unnecessarily irritating. Maguire tries hard to create the contrast between the real Peter and the infected Peter and thus in both cases, he over-acted. Along with his acting, several scenes are also written with excessive emotions and often they are laughable.<br/><br/>But, there are also numerous bright points in the film of course. I just loved the use of humor in this film... especially in scenes involving JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell. And the special visual and sound effects are awesome, you know, as they should be. The fighting sequences, though not very innovative, but always fun to watch. The overall acting is not bad... with James Franco and Topher Grace both stealing the show.<br/><br/>So, to wrap it up, one would definitely enjoy the film. But every time I think about Spidey2, I compare them... and this one somehow loses."

","In my estimation SM1 was a 9 and SM2 was a 10. Given that I have to give this a 6.5. They needed to pare down this story multiple villains, multiple plot devices that were just too convenient, several very obvious ploys, some action sequences seemed forced in trying to top SM2's subway sequence instead of just trying to be something new and fun and some poorly done melodrama. Did I hate it? No. Is it by far the weak sister of the 3? YES! The relationship problems with Peter and Mary Jane were, at times, barely believable. Too many things were overly convenient, not the least of which was the butler finally telling Harry the truth about his father's death after all this time when it was convenient for the plot. Harry accepting this information and deciding to help Peter in spite of his disfigurement at Peter's hands. How did Venom/Brock know about Sandman's daughter? Harry gets MJ to break it off with Peter by exercising control over her and then she just walks away and it is never mentioned again!? This story could have moved along nicely with only 1 or 2 villains not three. And then one redeems himself, one turns out to be a victim of circumstance and poor decisions, and only Brock (now completely insane) 'dies' a villain. The desk buzzer in J. Jonah's office though funny was nonsense. Gotta love how no matter how many times Spidey's mask is torn off in battle it will be lying next to him when he goes to get up. Some of MJ's problems with Peter and the relationship were a bit too irrational even for an immature girl (which she is supposed to be a talented thus disciplined actress). The Eddie Brock character was rapidly developed (too much so) as was necessary with the over ambitious story. Also, even though the film wasn't terribly long several in the group I saw it with observed that there were some slow points.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong a decent movie just not up to the standards of the series. Let's hope if they make more they will focus on a villain, let the action flow not try to force it so much, and write the relationships better.<br/><br/>High points are the look of the villains, Tobey, Rosemary Harris, adding Gwen Stacy and casting Bryce in the part, J.K. Simmons, Bruce Campbell's cameo, the strongest performance by James Franco, Ted Raimi, the overall look of the film, the redemption of Harry though the mechanics of it were lacking, and making any tinkering that was done to the existing Spider-man mythos for a reason. The casting in general was very good (with the new characters well represented with Topher being the weak link). Sandman sequences were especially well done and looked great! When you set the bar as high as you did with 2 I expected a drop off, but had hoped that they'd be able to achieve the level of 1 and perhaps in trying too hard to top 2 they fell short of 1. Fingers crossed for a possible 4."

Overall,I think this joined other movies of this year that were just painful for my eyes to see because of lameness and so many production errors. If you choose to waste your money on seeing it then see it. The first Spiderman is the best one and none of them will ever beat it. That is what I thought about Spiderman 3.

"alexa7890","1","10","21","5 May 2007"," Spiderman thinks he has found balance in his life but of course that isn't the case
","I like Spiderman. I have seen the first two movies multiple times each and I have never read the comic books, so my opinion is not biased in that manner. I hated ""SpiderMan 3"". It is terrible and I'll try to explain to you why. It's terrible with its characters, dialogue, action, plot development and ending.<br/><br/>The writers in the first two movies managed to characterize the main characters in an interesting, complex and real way. But with this movie it is like they forgot what made the characters interesting to watch. They turned Peter Parker into a clueless dope who couldn't understand why anything went wrong. They turned Mary-Jane into a clingy and unsympathetic 'damsel in distress'. The writers got lazy with Harry and had him have a head injury and conveniently forgot everything that has happened in the past two movies...only to remember again (this is an instance where the movie was overly long and could have been cut). Now, the villains were even worse. Firstly, they should have chosen one villain for this one because having two villains made the movie to packaged and it didn't leave enough time to properly introduce the characters. And that lead to them trying to make the Sandman character sympathetic but it didn't work because the film makers didn't take the proper amount of time to do that. On top of that the film makers put in the vengeful Venom character, which I do think they introduced well which leads me to conclude that they should have cut Sandman and left him for a later movie. Another character they should have cut altogether was Gwen. If it was just Venom as the villain then she would have worked. But she really didn't have any point in this movie other than make Mary-Jane jealous.<br/><br/>The dialogue was terrible and you would have to watch the movie to truly understand why (but don't watch it) The last two Spiderman movies had great action. This one fell short. The action scenes were few and far apart. And the action scenes they did have were cluttered and hard to follow. One of the first Sandman scenes they decided to use a shaky camera which didn't do anything to benefit the scene but it did make it difficult to watch. The end battle scene was actually set up well and executed well but it does not compensate for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The entire plot wasn't good. As I have said before they should have left out one of the villains. But more than that they shouldn't have focused on Peter and Mary-Jane and their issues as much. The whole Gwen jealously was completely pointless. And that lead to a horrible dance scene that was uncomfortable to watch. Another thing that bothered me was that they somehow resolved all the problems that were set up in the second movie. It would have been nice if the movie makers put more continuity from the second to third one.<br/><br/>The ending was truly terrible. It was a good action scene that lead to a contrived finish.<br/><br/>To see a longer review with spoilers go to http://tetrichourglass.blogspot.com/"
"jaa686s","4","10","21","4 May 2007"," Good ideas....but too many of them....
","This movie ran into the same problem as did X-men 3. If you are a comic book fan who is looking for fan-boys goodies...this movie will satisfy. However, if you go to see this movie for it's value as a film....you will be disappointed, especially in comparison to the fantastic work done on the first two.<br/><br/>This movie tries desperately to cram two movies worth of plot into one, and suffers for it. The film is a jack-of all trades of trilogy wrap-ups, it tries to do too many things and doesn't excel at any one of the things it tries. The plots running about in the movie end up tripping over each other and weakening the entire piece.<br/><br/>There plots are as follows: Peter and Mary Jane having relationship troubles. Peter and Harry feuding over the fate of the dead Mr. Norman Osbourne. An entire character intro and development on Sandman. The development of Eddie Brock. The Development of Gwen Stacy. The arrival of the symbiote. The internal struggle of peter. The creation and motivation of Venom. As well as the mini-plots around all the supporting characters like Aunt May, Jameson, Betty Brant, the Russian Land Lord, and still the long dead Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>There are also several points in the film where dialog is delivered as blatant and unabashed exposition. Doc Conners, Harry's Butler, and a random news Crew all are reduced to mere narration for the sake of moving the plot along.<br/><br/>Several events in the movie also feel entirely contrived. The landing of the symbiote is the first one. An arbitrary asteroid lands on earth literally 100 yards from Peter and Mary Jane, who do not seem to notice, and a random alien life form latches onto Peter's scooter and follows him home, the film offers no further explanation. The origin of Sandman's powers also feel terribley contrived. He runs through the wilderness from police and falls into a random pit literally 30 seconds before a scientific experiment is about to be conducted. Even though the police see him fall into the pit, no further investigation is made into his fate, and apparently whatever experiment was being conducted in the pit required very little follow up since the next morning Sandman crawls out completely unnoticed and carries on. And lastly the death of Harry is a horribly clichéd movie death. Harry takes the bullet for peter, Except in this case the bullet is the blades of a glider. Granted it was appropriate for him to die as his father did, but given the amazing fight scenes of the movie, it seems very fake at that point that Harry would jump in front of an attacking Venom with his back turned to take the spikes for Peter rather than say, jump Venom or in some way fight him.....it felt very fake.<br/><br/>The Death of Venom is by far the worst. Even though it was established that sonic noise was the Symbiotes weakness....the terribly powerful creature continues to trash and struggle as the sounds echo...and spider-man's make shift sonic chamber would have been easily knocked down or escaped from by Venom despite being encumbered by the pain the sound caused.<br/><br/>Overall this movie only makes sense if you know the comic lore and does not stand on it's own. The movie would have been great if the plots would have been limited. If the movie had revolved around the Peter/Harry dispute and just one of the Villains, it would have been much much better. The movie lacks the compelling human elements the first two did and is only satisfying as a sensory experience."
"infinitelyprolonged","9","10","21","1 May 2007"," A Masterpiece by Raimi
","Going into the theatre I was pretty sure I was in for a good time. The last two editions were too good for me not to expect that. Wouldn't have spent a rare free evening (the movie released on Labour Day here at Singapore) cooped up indoors otherwise. But I really hadn't imagined the movie would be this good.<br/><br/>It's very rare that, in a trilogy, movies get better progressively. Spider-man 3 is a great improvement over the last two, and that itself says a lot.<br/><br/>The first mid-air fight sequence, a few minutes into the movie, is breathtaking and a sign of things to come. And every few scenes, at an even pace, we get lots of these out-of-the-world sequences. There are three villains - Sandman and Venom make an appearance here - and each one gets ample screen time. Could have done with a little more of Venom. But what the hell, I won't crib.<br/><br/>Every actor is in top form. The story, even with the slightly slow-moving emotional scenes, moves at exactly the right pace. The action doesn't get overdone. The drama doesn't make you yawn. It's near-perfect. I simply loved the manner in which Raimi gives depth to each character, even the fantastic villains. The CGI is brilliant, but never overshadows the acting - the true test probably of any movie in this genre. And there's really awesome comedy to complete the package.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie the day it releases in your city. Watch out for a short appearance by Stan Lee too."
"prats_patra","8","6","11","4 May 2007"," I don't see what's not to like!
","While this was not the best of the spider-man series it was definitely a worthy sequel. To those who think that because of three villains the movie will be over-crowded, I'd like to say that I thought that too but I was wrong, the movie balances all the three villains out evenly, and yet there is not too much of violence as the fight sequences are shown in quite adequate places. Even though in the starting you think that the drama is over the top it actually is pretty necessary and helps in going with the flow of the story. To give any spoilers away would just be stupidity. The comedy of the movie is also pretty good and frankly action comedy and romance all in the same movie, what more could you ask for."

"Superunknovvn","6","6","11","2 May 2007"," If it makes you happy...
","""Spider-Man 3"" has more or less the same strengths and weaknesses as the first two entries in the franchise. The CGI is quite good (although not perfect), the action sequences move at a breakneck speed and the villains are charismatic. At the same time there are unbearable lengths with sappy dialog (and no, this movie didn't have to be over two hours long!) and some really crappy acting.<br/><br/>As much as Tobey Maguire seemed like an interesting pick for Spidey/Peter Parker at first, his performance in this one really makes you wish someone else had gotten the part in the first place. When he plays bad-boy Parker at some point in ""Spider-Man 3"" it's totally unbelievable and annoying. It's not solely his fault, though. That whole scene is completely exaggerated.<br/><br/>The character developpment is a mess at times. Characters swith from good to evil to sick to good again without any logic, just so at the end the right characters can be killed or die a heroic death that also rids them of any guilt they had brought upon themselves earlier on.<br/><br/>Among the whole big name-cast, the special effects and the spectacular action sequences, the hidden highlight is once again Bruce Campbell, who has a ""Fawlty Towers""-esquire little cameo here.<br/><br/>The main flaw for fans is probably that Venom, the one villain they waited for the most, doesn't get enough screen time and yes, it's true that the main villain, Sandman, just isn't very interesting. It would have been a good idea not to cram so many different story lines into this sequel, but to concentrate on one of them and flesh it out carefully.<br/><br/>As it is ""Spider-Man 3"" is certainly no improvement over its predecessors but it's still quite entertaining. It would be a good idea if Raimi ended it right here on a relatively high note."
"bandofoutsiders","6","8","16","9 May 2007"," disappointing; too much melodrama; too many villains
","I feel cheated after watching Spiderman 3. Part two was had a lot of merit, but Spidey 3 is just an effective marketing job and Sam Raimi has finally yielded to the pressure of the movie's backers. The fake melodrama, especially towards the end, makes your stomach turn. No amount of CGI can make up for a poor plot line. Both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were on the BBC to plug the movie. Then it was already obvious that Mary Jane's part would be disproportionately inferior to that of Spiderman's. Actually, nearly all the good scenes in the movie occur when Spiderman meets his dark side. It was kind of fun rooting for the bad guy. The rest of the picture was far too cheesy."
"sambafish","3","8","16","9 May 2007"," I'm going to be blunt. This movie was terrible.
","I want to be perfectly clear here: I didn't read a single review before seeing this movie, and I walked into the theater wanting it to be great. As a comic book fan, (I had subscriptions to ""Web of Spider-man"" and ""The Spectacular Spider-man"" for 6 years, and I used to wait for them to arrive in the mail so I could read them cover to cover) of course I wanted this to be an enjoyable movie! The first two installments, especially Spider-man 2 (I know, I know, some of you are tired of hearing this) were excellent and after seeing the trailers, and finding out that this movie was loosely based on one of my favorite story lines...I was dying to see this movie.<br/><br/>I just want to say that in the half hour that I've now spent reading other's opinions on this board, I've noticed a few users seem to be taking any praise or criticism of this film as a personal attack. I respect the opinion of all whose differ from mine and I am not trying to disrespect anyone with this post. Anyways on with the review REVIEW I'm going to be blunt. This movie was terrible. Believe me it hurts me to admit this more than it probably hurts many of you. What started off with what seemed like a good deal of potential, this film lost its steam, somewhere around an hour in (I'm being generous) and ended in an absurd mess of unbelievable plot twists. Being a fan of the comic book character Spider-man, the first two movies and of Sam Riami, the first question I asked myself was; ""Was it really that Bad?"" The answer, tragically, is yes. The few memorable scenes (the crane out of control, the first fight scene between Spidey and Green Goblin) are eclipsed by the scenes I wish I could have permanently removed from my memory.<br/><br/>Looking back, one of my complaints about the first Spider-man was that some of the scenes felt like they were unfocused or purposeless. Spider-man 2 felt like the direct result of that criticism. The film seemed very tightly cut and the scenes felt like logical progressions in the storyline. But, if Spider-man 2 was a step in the right direction, Spider-man 3 was an equal step in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>There were some truly disastrous scenes in this film. I've seen the other threads so I will simply address the one that really bothered me. The scene where the butler confesses to Harry, at the last minute, that Spider-man didn't kill his fatherdirectly. As bad as things were up until this point, I was still holding out hope, but this scene really sobered me up to just how bad this movie was. Had I not seen it for myself I really wouldn't have believed such a painfully blatant plot hole patch up had been written into the script, much less actually been filmed and released.<br/><br/>And this film sells itself out in more ways than one. The first two films involved realistic characters with emotions you relate to and understand. In this film there is an absence of any believable feelings or emotions and it seems a more physical, visible emotion tries to fill the gap. But it doesn't succeed and it only makes the film feel more hollow. I know some of you will suggest that I'm looking for something that doesn't exist in a ""comic book movie"" or a movie that ""doesn't take itself that seriously"", but you're wrong. Being serious and being believable are two different things.<br/><br/>In closing, I had every reason in the world to like this film, and even in my doubts that it would live up to the last entry, I couldn't have imagined a failure of this magnitude. To those of you who liked it: You're completely entitled to your opinion. More power to you. But I'm a movie fan with standards, and this doesn't measure up."
"SkidMcCormick","3","8","16","6 May 2007"," How To Kill a Franchise - Star Wars can rest easy
","I'm sure by the time you've read this, most of you would've seen Spider-man 3. Of the good points I will mention, I thought most of the special effects were great and definitely the biggest highlight for me, was the segment of Peter Parker becoming badass (to the point where the audience were cheering their heads off at Tobey Maguire's sex-machine routine. Does anyone know who that funky Spider-man sample was done by?).The other point worth mentioning is James Franco, who definitely ate his lines for breakfast & spat them out during the main course.<br/><br/>And now the bad points (trust me, there's loads). Why is it that during the swinging-crane-of-control scene -(a nice nod to the 60s Spidey cartoon) - was Gwen Stacy just staring at the beam, before realising it was coming straight at her?? Quite possibly the worst bit of direction & editing I have ever witnessed. Gwen is a major part of Spidey folklore, as she is considered to be the true love of Peter Parker. Why was Sam Raimi allowed to write this story & make her a less significant character than she actually is? I had goosebumps when I learned she'd be appearing in this film & Bryce Dallas Howard was great choice to play Gwen. Alas, we have 10 minutes of screen time from her and that's it. To say this is insulting is an understatement.<br/><br/>Another thing: Why is the hellbent-on-revenge Harry Osborn suddenly reduced to being a good guy at the end? It doesn't make sense that he suddenly transforms into a goody-goody & helps Peter. For this injustice, his character suffers at the hands of Venom in order to save a pasty-faced Kirsten Dunst?? Personally I'd have preferred Scarlett Johansson or Mary Elizabeth Winstead to have played MJ.<br/><br/>If you wanted to add dramatic irony to this third & dark sequel, I would've written it so that bad Parker as black Spidey kills Harry as the Goblin; only to find out later the consequences of his actions. Speaking of the black suit and if memory serves me correct, but in the comics & 90s animated series, doesn't Parker find out that noise affects the symbiote, which prompts him to seek the church tower bell? That being the case, why is it that Spider-man enters the church tower without any explanation for his actions? And why was the origin of the symbiote not referred to? (Wasn't it brought back by John Jameson after a space mission? Instead, Raimi chooses to rip-off the meteor crash scene from SLITHER).<br/><br/>The last points I want to touch on are that bloody English reporter! Someone shoot her! Quite possibly the worst piece of commentary recorded on celluloid...EVER. Honestly, it was so bad the audience I sat with just laughed or were as embarrassed as I clearly was. And as for the shameless flag-waving, forget it. America isn't the Super nation it thinks it is & quite sure that this patriotism wasn't prevalent in the early Stan Lee issues. By the way, is it me, or does anyone else find the Sandman monolith just as unnecessary as it is pointless? Didn't The Mummy do this to better effect? And why doesn't Sandy form his hands into hammers when facing Spidey? In the comic books, he's a proper bad guy; but here, they try to make him sympathetic being like Alfred Molina's Doc Ock. Unfortunately, this didn't quite work for me & suggesting his killing of Ben Parker was accidental, is utter crap.<br/><br/>This film was so bad (in that it destroyed the Spider-man ethos) I needed to see Blades of Glory again to take the taste away (note to Raimi: That film cost a fraction of Spidey 3's $250 budget and has already made over $100 million worldwide).<br/><br/>In short, make mine not Marvel, but Live Free or Die Hard (unless Fox kill that with making it a crappy PG-13), Ocean's 13, Transformers (kick ass trailer of the year) POTC: World's End & Shrek the Third. Oh, and The Bourne Ultimatum (if we don't suffer the shoddy editing which killed the sequel)."

The first spiderman paved the way to promising sequels, and if you are a spidey fan you will not regret watching this.<br/><br/>The plot, action sequences, screenplay, visual effects and acting were all very well done. The flow of movie was just so perfect, that it kept me entertained throughout the whole movie. They kept the drama, humor, action in such an amazing pace, that you would at times be very serious, or at times be very nervous during action sequences or be bursting into fits of laughter on some classic hilarious scenes! The movie is longer than its predecessors, about two and half hours. But it justifies every minute of it! Highly recommended!"

"upton-si","6","8","16","4 May 2007"," My Spider-sense is... well... not working particularly well at the moment.
","To begin with, let me say that this movie is one big flashback. It wasn't good for a third installment if indeed there is going to be a fourth. Overall the film was mediocre at best. Sure the special effects were great, and there was some staple spidey action, but the overall flow of the movie was just not good. It seems as though Raimi tried to fit too much story into the movie. The end result was that proper justice was not done to too many of the characters. Peter Parker/Spiderman - Not much I can say about the star of the show, except that it seems like they wasted a lot of time with stupid stuff on him. The whole funky street walk scene was just absolutely retarded, and, if it were necessary (because at least it showed him to be the dork that he is), they should've cut the scene to like... 5 seconds. Also, his crying over Mary Jane was just ridiculous, and he should've used his spider-sense (or common-sense) to suspect something of Harry. Lastly, the Jazz club scene with him playing the piano like Harry Connick Jr. was just plain hokey and terrible. I did like how the black-spidey suit enhanced what Peter Parker was already experiencing. A lot of ego. Mary Jane - Okay, your boyfriend is frickin Spider-man. Why give into Harry Osbourne? And what's with the attitude in the beginning? ""I just want you to try and know how I feel."" Don't get me wrong, I love MJ. I dig the red-heads, and especially Kirsten Dunst as a red-head, but this was possibly the worst written character of this installment. She's still hot though Harry Osbourne - You aren't a good guy. Stop it. That was possibly the most cheesy part of the movie. And for that, I'm glad he died. A bit of irony shaped how he died and I liked that. Eddie Brock - Surprisingly well played. I didn't think Topher Grace could do it, especially since Brock is traditionally thought of as kind of a blockheaded gym rat, and Topher Grace looks like he hasn't ever lifted weights, except that time he had to eat that huge lunch-portioned salad, and he had to use that fork that outweighed him... yeah... it was just a normal fork. Anyway, I liked his character, his dependency on the symbiote and his general malice. I just thought he went down a little too easy... maybe we'll see a return somehow. Flint Marko - Hard to believe that was the same guy that played Lyle of Wings. Oh to work with Helen Hunt... Anyway, his character was great up until the very end. I like how Harry was battling him. Turning the sand to glass. But his dumb little crying episode was just out of place and all of a sudden he's a good guy too... incredible. Again, they did a good job with including some story elements (Gwen Stacey, who was looking mighty fine, Ms. Brant, how Spidey can never keep a girl no matter how much he loves them, Curt Conners, etc.), but a lot of the movie was just off the mark, moving from one vague piece of the story to the next. Again, it was like they tried to fit too much movie. I give it a C+ overall, because it IS Spiderman after all, and some of it was quite cool, but definitely did not do the Spiderman story the justice it deserved."

There is plenty of action and special effects as well are terrific (and of course, considering the budget) but the attempt to handle subjects like power, forgiveness, betrayals and so on made the result oversentimental and too mawkish, so that a fourth installment would be unnecessary in my opinion, producing a kind of idiosyncrasy against actors and director too.. Tobey Maguire is still suitable for the characters and gets to inject the dose of noise that Parker needed after the first two outings.

","One may quibble over their exact position, but amongst the five best superhero movies are the three Spiderman films. In fact one can convincingly argue that the Spiderman movies back up into the first three slots,(with the third one being the best), for the Spiderman movies alone amongst superhero series may stroll alongside Lord of the Rings and Star Wars as movie series comprised of individually outstanding films that maintain or improve in quality and depth with each iteration.<br/><br/>A few superhero movies combine special effects and a solid plot to provide an enjoyable, escapist experience. It's when superhero movies attempt profundity that many falter. The inherent psychological complexity of the Hulk beckoned its writers to focus on David Banner's inner struggle and the writers failed miserably; the Hulk not only offers no non-obvious insights, but is ridiculous and boring. The X-Men movies focus on social analogy and encounter some success, but only middle-schoolers consider ""accept the other"" themes profound. Only theSpiderman movies have been able to dig into issues of human motivation and social responsibility without slipping into the resultant hole The Matrices are the ultimate example of movies with overly ambitious themes). It's the combination of it's excellent story, fine performances, quality non-overwhelming special effects, and solid exploration of the human condition that earns Spiderman its five stars.<br/><br/>Full review: www.nelsonguirado.com/index.php/reviews"

All filler to this movie was really not very good.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm sayin is the last twenty minutes were worth it, but that's about it.

","I just saw Spider-Man 3 and I thought it was great. And I wasn't the only one, since the people in the cinema started applauding at the end of the film (this is the first movie I see at the cinema getting applauses at the end). I've seen a lot of comments saying that there was little character development, poor acting, etc. In my opinion, for a movie that lasts only two hours and a few and can make you sad, make you laugh and give you adrenaline rushes all in one film, it's great.<br/><br/>I agree to the fact that the character development was poor, but for a film with three villains and quite a few supporting characters, it handles all their story lines pretty well. After all, Spider-Man is an action packed thrill ride, it's a very fast and dynamic film, if you want strong character development for a comic-book based film go see Batman Begins or wait for The Dark Night. The CGI is stunning; it's worth every cent of the 250 million dollars invested in this movie, especially the scene of Sandman's ""birth"".<br/><br/>As for the acting, I say it again, for a super-hero action flick, it's pretty good, JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell are very funny in their scenes, and I even found the scenes with ""possessed emo-style"" Peter to be quite refreshing and funny. Regarding the supporting characters, I think that they weren't given much screen-time on purpose, their appearance here being merely a sort of introduction, and I'm sure they'll get their moments of fame in the upcoming sequels.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was a great movie, one of the best super-hero comic-based films, and definitely over its prequels. And I say it again, it should be regarded as an overall positive and dynamic film, focused on action, but also with elements of drama and comedy - not a dark, psychological thriller, focused on drama and character development."

","I loved the first film (which I watched twice in theaters) but recall that the second installment was rather less enjoyable; this seems to me to be slightly superior to its predecessor. Unfortunately, however, the action set-pieces are too dizzyingly-edited to be properly evaluated; still, the high-rise stunt early on and the climactic battle of the mutants are undeniably spectacular.<br/><br/>Besides, the complicated plot results in gross overlength - featuring yet another round of the Tobey Macguire/Kirsten Dunst/James Franco love triangle, too many adversaries for Spider-man (with allegiances shifting frequently and unconvincingly), and a baffling insistence on the deaths of the Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson characters from the first film! A platinum blonde Bryce Dallas Howard brings some much-needed freshness to the proceedings - though her role, ultimately, proves of little consequence.<br/><br/>The Sandman's back-story is especially ludicrous and sentimental with an utterly wasted Theresa Russell as his resentful wife; Venom, however, is interesting (especially in the way he represents Spider-man's alter ego) - but comes to the fore far too late into the game: his demise is nicely handled, too, but it's then ruined by the apparent necessity to eliminate the Topher Grace character. The scenes involving the 'Evil Peter Parker' swagger, then, are eye-rollingly embarrassing, as is the musical number sung by Dunst during her disastrous Broadway stint! The film allows Bruce Campbell yet another delightful cameo, and there's even a wonderful bit involving Spider-man co-creator Stan Lee. In the end, SPIDER-MAN 3 succeeds mainly as a slick and solidly entertaining ride (as long as one doesn't analyze it too deeply)."

Oh, and he actually commits suicide. Under no circumstances should Harry Osborn have been given a hero's death.<br/><br/>However, this movie was bad for other reasons too. MANY other reasons.<br/><br/>This is a simply a prime example of trying to fit too many plot lines into one movie and consequently not being able to thoroughly explain anything. Many people have remarked that Spiderman seemed to have lost his ""spidey sense"". This is actually true, though they film declined to explain why. Because the symbiote is from outer space, the spidey sense doesn't work with it. Hence, Peter cannot sense Venom. You grow attached to Sandman's daughter, yet at the end of the movie, she is still dying. Couldn't Peter have shown how much he truly forgave Sandman by somehow helping his daughter? I waited for lots of Venom action. I waited in vain. 15 minutes out of the 2 hours and 20 minutes had Venom. Talk about a disappointment.<br/><br/>However, even if none of these complaints were valid and all my corrections had been made, the half hour of EMO Spiderman was enough to make this one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It would have been better if Peter had followed the trend of many Emo teenagers and decided that life was not worth living."
"johnsen-12","1","7","14","5 May 2007"," WORST Spiderman yet
","I don't understand how people are giving this movie good reviews. The only reason I enjoyed several parts of this embarrassingly bad movie was because of a morbid interest: I was fascinated at each awful decision the director made.<br/><br/>We should have been warned when Raimi said in an interview that he was never a fan of Venom. Spiderman represents good, Venom is evil. It's a classic match up, yet Raimi decided to add 30 minutes of Peter Parker becoming emo, thrusting his hips, and a dance sequence. Why have an epic battle between good and evil when you shoot yourself in the foot and focus on hormones? I bet if I would have tried to come up with a way to ruin this movie, I wouldn't have come close to what Raimi accomplished. <br/><br/>Also, Raimi must assume that the audience is made up of imbeciles, because every remotely subtle plot development was rehashed with direct dialog and flashbacks. The worst of these was when Raimi had an ""Alfred-Batman""-esque scene where the anonymous butler had a heart to heart with Harry, instead of the orphan figuring out the truth of his father's death himself. This excruciating scene, along with many others, was shoved down the audience's throats, and all that I could think during them was, ""Thanks Raimi. I never would have gotten that.""<br/><br/>So in summation, PLEASE don't see this movie. In between all the singing, dancing, and emo inspired scenes, it had room for a sparingly amount of action sequences. And those weren't even that good. If you feel you really need to see it, still don't."
"FallDownAgain","1","7","14","4 May 2007"," A real disappointment
","I just got back from seeing the midnight showing of this movie and was disappointed to say the least. With the amount of money this film cost I expected a script that was half way decent with the exception of a few good lines it was bad. I can't figure out what was going through the minds of the people who worked on this film. The dancing was ridiculous and not needed anywhere in the film not in the kitchen, street, or in the jazz club. It seemed like the story just dragged on and when you wanted to see more of something you were not given. And exactly what was going on with Toby's hair and the Peter Petrelli(Heroes)look when in the other suit it just didn't make sense. If you liked the first two movies you will probably hate this one so my advice is save your ten dollars and either rent it or watch it when it is shown on television.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie in my opinion were the opening credits and the Pirates OF The Caribbean preview."
"cdnrugbyplayer","1","7","14","4 May 2007"," Save your gas and Money Marvel Fans this is hardly movie of the year material
","First and foremost, I'll say I'm a marvel Fan, and an even bigger Spiderman Fan. After the Second movie, which was Decent, and had left a great ending to lead up to Spiderman 3, I had high expectations for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie was the most disappointing movie involving a superhero i have ever seen. The plot was so underdeveloped that it ridiculous, Tobey Maguire's character has so many mood swings that i couldn't help but wish i saved my gas and money. The villains were mediocre, the ones which should have had more time on screen didn't live up the to potential.<br/><br/>The villains were all pretty badly done except Venom who sadly wasn't on the screen long enough to win back a good review. From Eddie Brock, a News reporter who was a motor mouth to a escaped inmate who was trying to do the right thing by not doing the right thing and ending it with ""My daddy didn't love me"" Harry Osborn but lets examine the main character, which was the reason the movie failed.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire did an great job in the first two spiderman movies emoting the struggle of being a hero and a person. In this one, he seemed confused as to what he was trying to present. at one point he played the arrogant self absorbed nerd who was so happy to be the Center of attention. then he transformed into a sappy lover to mary jane. want an example? remember ""You're beautiful because it is i who is so in love with you"" from star wars episode 3? yeah its like that but worse. then once he gets the Symbiote he starts acting like an emo kid, with the hair and acting all bad to the bone, only thing missing was the black nail polish.<br/><br/>the only thing through this whole movie was the work they put into Venom to make him look authentic as Venom. I only wish they put more into this character and give it a bigger role. I cant say the same for the alter ego of Venom though, Topher made the effort but what worked for that 70s show doesn't work for this. He looked like a rambling fool who sucked up so much that he i couldn't tell him from from Jameson's behind.<br/><br/>Im too tired to point out more, it was just bad, plain and simple. If You don't believe me, watch it yourself and you'll understand.<br/><br/>Its sad because i know a lot of people will go to watch this movie, expecting an epic ending to a great trilogy. sadly the only one benefiting from this will be Sony Pictures because of all the money they will have made off of the poor people expecting a good movie. If possible i would have given this movie -10 stars but sadly one star will have to show my disappointment."

The acting and dialog was so bad that everyone was laughing at the most dramatic moments. Spidey become some emo kid with a bad wardrobe and worse haircut. Even worse only one of the baddies could manage to act, but the Venom CGI ruined even that. This was a special midnight showing in every theater of the multiplex and it didn't even sell out. Oh, and expect to see at least 40 metric tons of Spiderman merchandise. Toby McGuire is a total hack, or maybe it's just the severe lack of plausible dialog. Definitely see this move, it's classic."
"moviedude1","9","11","25","3 May 2007"," Kudos to all who had input on this film...
","Tobey Maguire is back for the third time as the web slinger, fighting crime in the city of New York, while fighting to hold onto the love of his life, Mary Jane Parker (Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>Among his turmoils include an inner one, created by an alien force that finds a host and bonds with that host, but creating hostility and aggression in the process; a fact that even chemistry student Peter Parker can not combat.<br/><br/>I think that if you're a fan of these films, you will DEFINITELY enjoy this film. Another great story on the side is Mary Jane's own inner turmoil and battling her own demons, in which Dunst turns in an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Films, as a rule, tend to fall off in their ratings when they get further and further into making sequels, but this one, like the Indiana Jones trilogy, just keeps on putting out fantastic story lines."

A little short of a masterpiece. The Special FX, storyline, acting and new enemies are simply marvelous.<br/><br/>I know there are many haters of this movie out there, but in my opinion, i loved it! It was definitely the best of all 3. It was very emotional, and wasn't just pointless fighting.<br/><br/>From the very first scene to the last, Spidey 3 is a delight. The venom was done in a very clever way, and the ending was outstanding.<br/><br/>So for anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie, i recommend for you to go to your local cinema, relax, and enjoy one of the best movies of the year!"

","Every Spiderman movie so far has been a good movie making Hollywood experience. This one had the potential and went to big heights. I believe this is the best of the trilogy. Bringing in not 1, but 2 villains was kind of cool for once. We got to see the Sandman and Venom in one total movie. I am finally glad that they used Venom, which is one of my favorite Spidey enemies. To me this showed a little more humor and comedy than the other two. Not that this movie was intended to be a comedy, just it had it's moments were it seemed kind of like a comedic film. In any event this is one that you either have to go see right now or wait to buy or rent it when it comes out in a few months. Either way you see it, theater or at your own home, it's a thrilling movie experience. A classic in the Spiderman movies. I like this better than the other of the trilogy."
"spidey_3001","10","5","9","4 May 2007"," Got weird parts and flaws BUT still a great movie
","I was expecting a better movie as a matter of fact but though i liked this film.I think it has many parts that are unnecessary and who slows the tempo of the action scenes.(Some parts made for the comedy but they were too long and got ridiculous at some point, *SPOILER* and i just cant believe the scene on the bridge where peter cries like a child and where his acting was poor) BUT its not the film that everybody laughs at, i think you will enjoy this movie if you love spider-man.The jokes were very good and the comedy parts was funny(a bit excessive:) *SPOILER* the dancing parts on the street and in the bar etc...were a LOT and it should have been much shorter.<br/><br/>The symbiote costume was good ;first of all and its not a mistake that its just black.On the comics Peter Parker got it from the Secret Wars and he was thinking spider-woman so symbiote turned into something similar to her costume.In the film since there is no such thing as Secret wars it makes sense.Symbiote combined good in overall.<br/><br/>The actions scenes are so good ,theyre just perfect.They're like greatest battle scenes of all time.and i liked the cgi use a lot.The villains were good.I was wondering about the venom but venom was definitely great.No size problem at all.And Topher Grace did a great job on acting he was very good.His moving and transforming were awesome.<br/><br/>As i said above,the story-line got some cheesy dialogs but i thought in general the movie covered them.I think you'll enjoy this movie.I don't want to give much SPOILERS but i think you'll agree with me when you see the movie and thought about it."
"Tom-AVA","10","5","9","4 May 2007"," Is it good??
","On so many levels could this film have gone wrong. The 3 villains in it could have confused the storyline, they could have got caught up with the special effects and just made it a showcase of that. They could have crushed everything that was built up over the last two films. But they didn't!<br/><br/>No, they didn't forget the formula that made the last films so great. They didn't forget the balance of the love story and drama in the films with the action scenes and the special effects. They didn't forget all the reasons why we loved Spiderman 1 and 2 and that for me is why this film is so great. I have to tell you that it all worked perfectly. <br/><br/>The 3 story lines worked around each other and you never got lost and then all came together for one amazing finale. The characters were all awesome. Each one played their part so well, it was like finally seeing a comic book on the screen the way it should be done. Kirsten Dunst was amazing, as always. Topher Grace was a brilliant Venom/ Eddie Brock, Thomas Haden Church was brilliant as Sandman/ Flint Marko and James Franco was just great as Green Goblin MK2/ Harry Osbourne. <br/><br/>And then there is Tobey McGuire as Spiderman/Peter Parker. What can i say. It was a genius performance. This was he Peter Parker from the comics, this was the Spideman from the comics. He was a character you could understand what he was going through, understand everything that happened to him, you went on his remarkable journey with him. There were just so many small bits in this film that all came together and that really made it brilliant. <br/><br/>However, in spite of what i said above, this film does have its flaws, and some major ones at that. The script isn't all that great but there are some good moments in there. There are some scenes where you wonder, why the hell did they put that in there/ why didn't they do that in the last movie? Some of the dialogue between characters can be just shocking, but hey, its a comic book movie. But one of my major problems with the movie was that fact the this film was way over-hyped and so people expected a lot more than they got, and this is the reason for all those idiots out there saying that this film is either too dark or too cheesy (please make up your minds which one it is because it cant be both).<br/><br/>But do you know what, in the end none of this matters because it really is a great film, with some classic scenes. Sure its not as good as Spiderman 2, but that was a difficult act to follow. When you see this film, just sit and enjoy it for what it is. This film will make you laugh, it might even make you cry, but i promise it will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>So don't listen to all the stupid Spideman fan-boys, don't listen to the critics, go and see this movie for yourself, make your own opinion on it."
"jdesando","Null","13","31","28 April 2007"," An amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor.
","Like a middle-aged man on a mission, Spider-Man 3 sags in the middle, takes a while to get somewhere, but still likes the girls, swells a progress or two, and shows some of the old idealism that fights with maturity's pragmatism. Most disappointing of all is this pre-mid-life hero, Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), obsessed with his love, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and his desire to marry her.<br/><br/>Enough already. He needs to save New York from the Sandman (an interesting new villain played by a fine actor, Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace). Director Sam Raimi, who knows a thing or two about split-personality Spider-Men and the evil forces overcoming good men with his Simple Plan, indulges his melodramatic longings through most of the film's mid section with the endless exchanges between Peter and MJ.<br/><br/>Raimi does do well with the dueling good and evil theme, starting with Peter's sudden change brought on by black globs from another world. When he supposedly eliminates the Sandman for murdering his uncle, Peter is confounded by his will to do it and his moral compass, which keeps getting into his conscience. Even the Sandman struggles between his devotion to his little girl and acting like King Kong to scare the heck out of Manhattanites. Raimi does a service to the youngsters of the audience by stressing the importance of choices, a kind of comic-book existentialism.<br/><br/>But Marvel Comics and Stan Lee live on. Yet, at 139 minutes (12 more minutes than SM2), SM3 is 39 minutes too long, notwithstanding the outstanding FX. SM 2 was much better, not just because Pulitzer-winner Michael Chabon was one of the writers, but because it took Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) so seriously he seemed to have more lines than Dunst, who here is petulant and self-centered enough to lose my interest. As I wrote in 2004, Spider-Man 2 ""is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did."" SM3 is an add on, an amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor."

And third, I just hate to have to say the following.<br/><br/>Have you ever had the experience that someone in a fully packed theater, and thought: ""What the h#ll am I doing here?!"" Well that was exactly the feeling I had with Spiderman 3. Just like the rest of the audience, which became clear when one viewer started boo-ing and the rest of the crowd cheered him on. (I honestly have never experienced that before!) I'll give them that the action scenes were phenomenal and well coordinated. Venom looked great, Sandman was well thought of, Gobby Jr was okay. Yet, I spent most of my time getting overly annoyed at the mooshy-mooshy overly predictive emotional babble and having the 'Get-On-With-It!!!'-line stuck in my head most of the time.<br/><br/>I'm sure there were much better stories/story lines to come up with. Better dialogs to come up with. In my opinion, Sam Raimi (and co) did an awful job on this one!

The only plus side for this film is the action but it does not save the film.

Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.<br/><br/>Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed.

What I love about this franchise is that it deals with the concepts of ""good"" and ""evil,"" but it doesn't insult us by making us believe they are mutually exclusive. In this installment, Peter Parker gets ""taken over,"" for lack of a better word, by a symbiotic organism from outer space that heightens a person's aggression and power. As you can imagine, this new found power ""feels good,"" as he says, but it comes at a price. Joining this outing are Sandman and Venom, both brilliantly played by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace (one of my all-time favorite actors). The special effects are pretty good and the fight sequences are exhilarating. Sam Raimi is having fun with this one, and takes a few moments to cut loose. Especially funny is the cameo by Bruce Campbell as a French maitre de, and the sequence when Peter Parker is grooving along the street is priceless. (An homage to Saturday Night Fever, maybe?) Hilarious. Stan Lee also gets his brief on-screen time. With the word that this is the final installment, I can't help but feel a bit saddened. We need more! Great work!"

I mean, they're essentially the same character only Harry's faster and younger. (Eh. . . kinda bad. But forgivable.

","I went to the theater with high hopes for this film because it looked good in the trailer..But it wasn't what I expected..To me this movie was awful..If it wasn't for the great acting I would still be at the theater asking for a refund..<br/><br/>Okay..The point of the movie starts with Peter Parker A.K.A. Spiderman talking about himself as he always does at the beginning of the Spiderman movies..You see him and his girlfriend (Mary Jane)and it seems like everything is going great for them..Sounds like the normal average hero vrs. villain movie and thats what it is..Everyone knows Spidermans going to win..He's a hero, the good guy and they can't lose..but it doesn't work like that in the real world and it was kind of disappointing how Hollywood can't shed some light on that for this film..But that wasn't the most disappointing part..The worst part about this film is it's cheesiness..Are we led to believe that a meteor came from the sky and then some black stuff turns Spiderman full of revenge? I'm sorry but you lost me..then you have an escaped convict who is running from the cops and ends up in a test facility(in the middle of New York City) and turns into the sandman..If thats not cheesy enough for you think of the fact that he happened to of killed Peter Parkers Uncle..Wow are all the villains related to Spiderman? Then Peter Parker proved that a photographers photos are fake so he gets the blacks stuff from the meteor on him and turns into Venom..Wow think for a second.. You get fired from your job and now you must Kill? If the world was that bad then I wouldn't want to live..And the movies predictability is endless Just like knowing that Spidermans going to win..We know that hes going to win; we just want to know how he does it..and of coarse Sandman and Venum are going to join forces to stop Spiderman.. and of coarse Harry is going to forgive Spiderman and help him defeat the evil duo..It really is hard to see Topher Grace go from a wimpy little pothead to an evil villain..I guess thats why they tried to dye his hair..<br/><br/>and thats about it for the movie..it's just 2 and a half hours stretched out..For an average person that doesn't watch many movies and doesn't know what to look for would think this is awesome but for a natural movie goer/critic this is something I'd stay away from...<br/><br/>I give it 3 stars for acting.."
"johnkel","9","6","12","5 May 2007"," Awesome film
","This movie was awesome. It is a but darker than Spidey 2 (which was a bit darker than Spidey 1). I must say that I hope this pattern does not continue otherwise Parker may end up drunk and homeless in Spidey 4 :)<br/><br/>I will not write a scene by scene review, just go and see it. The action is great and the villains are fun. We also see Parker's inner conflict come to life.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it seems that in some ways the characters are fighting the same battles that they have fought in the previous films. So there is a bit of a sense of repetitiveness. But overall, it was still huge fun. Great job Raimi and company...<br/><br/>OK I have one more complaint. This film is busy. Three villains in one film and I think that only Goblin jr. got his story fully told. What happens to the Sandman and his daughter? Venom shows up 2\3 of the way thru the film and dies at the end. I wanted more on these subjects. And yet, I STILL liked this film."
"Sarfield-1","9","6","12","5 May 2007"," The best of the three (where it counts)
","I had read plenty of reviews before going to see Spiderman 3. Not that I actually consider any reviewer's opinion before deciding whether or not to go watch a flick, I was simply curious. Most reviews say the same thing in a nutshell: they tried to cram too much into the movie (3 villains?? insane!), the effects were great but the story was poor. <br/><br/>No arguments as far as the effects go. They truly are spectacular, particularly several scenes with the Sandman. They're not the most polished effects I've seen, but they've got remarkable ingenuity - it's a pleasure to watch them. <br/><br/>And now to what counts: The story. This is, without a doubt, the best movie in the trilogy when it comes to the story. It's powerful, smart, and retains all of the elements which made the previous films so amazing. As I've mentioned, some people seem to have serious issues with the three villains, and are understandably aggravated by the relatively short screen time Venom received. But unlike Spidey 1 and 2, the villains in this film are much stronger plot elements, rather than 'reasons to have a flashy action scene'. In the previous 2, the villains, while awesome, were replaceable. Perhaps the Goblin had a more important role considering the story arch that Harry goes through, but Doc. Oc had little to do with Peter Parker's character development. He was there as a catalyst for what Pete had to go through, but it could have easily been some other bad guy. It could have been Connors' Lizard (which is what I thought it'd be at first).<br/><br/>In this one, however, with the brilliant story they've written, the villains are integral to what happens to Peter and what he does. Which is why, in this film more than any other in the series, I would prefer to not even address them as 'villains'. They each have strong reasons for doing what they do, which are explained in the film, and they each have their shot at Pete. The exception would have to be Harry, who doesn't get much of a back-story to how he behaves. That is understandable, however, and means that one would have to watch the previous two films to fully comprehend what is going on between the two best-friends, Harry and Pete. And then we have Venom. I will obviously not say much about him, except that I believe he was brilliantly portrayed in the film and like everything else in it, his reason for being there is a direct result of the story and it feels right and not pushed in. And as for his screen time - I like to call that the 'Darth Maul' factor. I'll explain. I guess anyone reading this probably knows who Darth Maul is so I'll refrain from providing information about him and get right to the point. When Episode One came out there was the same kind of uproar about Darth Maul's part in the film, which was similarly small as Venom's. But what they failed to realize was that it's that same element that made him such an amazing villain. It added a level of mystery to what he was. The same goes for Venom. I don't believe Venom could pull off an entire movie as the main villain. Just because it works in the comics doesn't mean it would work on screen, and we have several unfortunate examples of this in other comic-book adaptations. Sam Raimi was brilliant in knowing Venom's part in the story and knowing to give him just enough time in the film to knock you off your seat and provide the elements the story required. It was brilliant.<br/><br/>The downside to all of this? The action. Let's face it, people cry and cry for more story in their blockbusters but what they really want is flashy action, and the downside to having this wonderful, fleshed-out story is that the action sequences in it are shorter. In Spidey 2 there were pretty much 3 serious action scenes in the entire movie, and they were long and brilliant. In this one there are more but they're over just when you get sucked into them. In that respect the previous film was better. But, like the title suggests, this movie is the best one where it counts. You might need to watch the movie twice before you can really appreciate the action (as I plan to do), but as far as everything else goes, it's just perfect and you will not want to miss seeing it on the big screen."

"the-regicide","5","6","12","4 May 2007"," Watch if you feel like going to the cinema, and don't feel like watching 300 again.
","The screenplay is an amalgam of Spiderman 3 and 4, and since the director couldn't separate the movies in a meaningful way, that fact is obvious. In two hours twenty, the movie has about an hour and a half of ""boredom"", which in and of itself isn't boring, as it advances the plot(albeit slowly) but is left uninterrupted by action, and that's why it hurts. The beginning is promising, but it is soon diluted, and some of the details in scenes or even plots repeat up to three times.<br/><br/>So, in this movie, we have Spiderman, Symbiote Spiderman, New Goblin(think hybrid of the Green Goblin from the first movie with Hobgoblin from the comics), Sandman, and last but not least, Venom. They fight. The fight scenes themselves are awesome, with he first and the last being quite lengthy and gratuitous, but they are rare and are lacking in a good musical background. The Venom character is, in my opinion, misused, and very different from the comic. But I did like Topher Grace as Venom, which was a very unexpected casting, and he manages to pull off a great Eddie/Venom. Raimi tickles and hints at many plots and subplots, but he doesn't finish them as he should, but just cuts where he isn't supposed to, and drowns it.<br/><br/>In this movie, it becomes obvious that Sam Raimi is shaping his own Spiderman world, which is a little bit different than the Marvel universe. In S2, and even in S1, it was apparent, but was skillfully done, without harming the movie or the franchise. I don't agree with some of the character or plot decisions that were made in the movie, but whatever, I guess those differences are here to keep even the comic fans surprised and entertained, or something like that. Either that, or Raimi had no clear vision, and got lost in joining four and a half hours of scripts into two and twenty.<br/><br/>The conclusion... I find it difficult to conclude something, it's difficult to grade the most expensive US movie to date with just one number. The movie isn't bad, just somewhat mild, diluted. The effects, photography, characters, fight scenes, they are all impressive, but not in the foreground. The romance parts, if you will, are also quite well done, but just doesn't fit, confuses the audience and kills the epic feel and impression. This goes to show you that sometimes, something is actually less than the sum of it's parts. All these things separate are great, but together, they endanger the whole. I clicked on 6 on IMDb, and I do believe that it's a fair grade for this movie.<br/><br/>Watch if you feel like going to the cinema, and don't feel like watching 300 again."

","I just came back from the theaters where I saw Spiderman and it was absolutely great. I loved it.<br/><br/>I have only given 4 movies a 10 and this is the 5th. It is fantastic. I saw Spiderman 1 in theaters and I thought it was pretty good, so when Spiderman 2 came out and saw it, I became more interested in the whole Spiderman-thing and now that I've seen Spiderman 3, I have a new favorite trilogy.<br/><br/>Summary ***Spoilers***:<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) makes a new friend from outer space, a symbiont, who takes over one of Peter's Spiderman-costumes, which turns black. When wearing it, Peter feels great, but then he notice he becomes more aggressive. Peter's relationship with MJ (Kirsten Dunst)is going so good either. When Peter fights Harry or The Green Goblin (James Franco), Harry gets knocked down and is suffering from memory losses, but when he remembers that Peter killed his father, he wants to take revenge, but then finds out that Peter didn't killed his father, but he killed himself. Meanwhile, the symbiont left Spiderman's costume and took over Eddie Brock (who wants to kill Parker for humiliating him in public) and becomes even more aggressive than Peter was and becomes Venom. Venom teams up with The Sandman, who turns out to be the real killer of uncle Ben, to kill Spiderman. After hearing the truth about his father, Harry teams up with Spiderman, trying to defeat Venom and The Sandman, who kidnapped MJ.<br/><br/>The way they made The Sandman and Venom completely blew me away. I was really surprised how good it was. And I especially liked the way they tell the story. And the acting was very good, they really put emotion in their characters.<br/><br/>This Spiderman-movie is the best in the trilogy, but I like the other ones too. Definitely a 10 (out of 10). Now waiting for it to come out on DVD :) And Spiderman 4 :)"
"gareth-158","2","23","64","19 April 2007"," After peaking with Spiderman 2, it all comes crashing down...
","*Although it says spoilers I don't refer to any specific plot points, mostly just inane out of context scenes...*<br/><br/>Saw this last night at a preview screening in London... I have to say that I thought it was terrible. I loved the first 2 movies but this one seems completely different in tone. As though Sam Raimi wanted nothing more to do with it and is trying to kill the franchise!<br/><br/>The story is very run of the mill, and overcrowded with characters. Gwen Stacy is introduced and completely underused. As Peter says ""She's just a girl in my class"". Pointless. Sandman is just a re-hash of Doc Ock, the villain with a heart. Venom is simply an evil version of Spidey; with claws, jaws and black webbing. ( Why does Eddie Brock have pointy teeth when you see him under the outfit - where did they come from..?) Green Goblin 2(?) is quite a good idea but never fully realised and only seems to be included so that the kids have an Xtreme hover board dude to cheer for. And the symbiote (the alien material that turns Spidey's suit black and eventually creates Venom) is never explained. Where did it come from? Why did it land on Earth? (I know it fell from the sky, but what the hell..? Is that it?)<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes and pointless scenes it boggles the mind! To show that Peter is a 'changed man' he wears his floppy fringe over his face and appears to be wearing eye liner... And instead of just asking for, he 'demands' cookies and milk from his neighbour - what a mean and moody character he's turning into, eh? Then we are treated to a 5 minute montage of him walking down the street winking and pointing his finger pistols at girls he meets, before getting a new suit and doing a Saturday Night Fever impression! <br/><br/>Later, Mary Jane and Harry Osbourne dance the twist while cooking an omlette..?! (What was the point of that scene exactly?!) But then this is all topped off with Peter actually having a dance routine in a jazz club - using his spider powers... after playing the piano, of course (It reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchor Man). There are so many more embarrassing scenes... And while being relatively amusing they sit really uneasily within the film as a whole and especially when compared to the tone and feel of the last 2 movies.<br/><br/>If they had trimmed all these irrelevant scenes and made it a sharp 90 minutes it would still be the worst entry in the trilogy but at least it would have some credibility. This is the 'Batman Forever' of the Spiderman franchise, but without Joel Schumacher... I can't believe Sam Raimi was actually involved in this. <br/><br/>I'm giving it 1 star for the special effects, as some of the scenes with sandman are spectacular, especially when he is initially 'transformed'. And another star for once again using 'the Chin', Bruce Campbell! But 5 minutes of great effects and 5 minutes of Bruce Campbell in a 2 and a half hour runtime do not make a good movie. <br/><br/>Most disappointing film I've seen in a long time..."

Don't mistake the movie for being bad it was done like the others the bad reviews are because so many people waited for it with suspense and because it didn't blow them away their angry . but it actually wasn't bad like the reviews make it sound . I could have done without EM spider man and the pelvic thrust , and the dancing but otherwise it was pretty much like the first and second . the action was great and the cgi too. I admit it did dwell on his personal life a bit but like the second didn't as well. God if you haven't seen it don't listen to the bad reviews their just retarded . It wasn't bad in fact it's my personal favorite.Venom is a big issue as well . If your a fan you know he was infected by the symbiote . His time in movie was small but in order to have a plot you need character development like peter turning evil because of the suit .

Even if there are many plots - watch Crash for example- Or Babel. Can you recognize something?<br/><br/>I agree that Venom comes too short in this movie.

The only redeeming factor about this movie is that the budget was so big and the film so bad that they won't make another. Sam Ramey needs to sit down and stare at the back of a chair for awhile.

","Just went to see this movie tonight, and I gotta say I don't understand why people have a problem with this movie. It was an excellent movie with unbelievable action scenes and a very good storyline with good acting all around.<br/><br/>First off, I've seen a few people complain about the CGI being the worst of the 3. That has to be a straight-up lie as the special effects in this movie are invisible if you ask me. There wasn't a single point in the movie where I noticed that it was CGI (yes I know how much CGI was in there).<br/><br/>Next complaint, too many villains without enough back story. Let's walk through them shall we? Harry, a.k.a. New Goblin. His back story was pretty well filled out by the time this one started so none needed and basically none given. Flint Marko, a.k.a. Sandman. Not a whole lot of back story but enough so you know a bit about who he is and how he became sandman. Personally it was enough for me, he didn't feel like a cardboard cutout character. Eddie Brock, a.k.a. Venom (name not mentioned in the film). His back story is like the first hour+ of the film, with time spent both on what the symbiote is and does, and why Eddie isn't very fond of Peter.<br/><br/>Next complaint, lack of cohesion. Again I just don't see this here. Overall, everything came together by the end. No unintended loose ends here that I saw.<br/><br/>Okay... now for my only complaint. The only thing I didn't like was the section where they showed Peter on the street with music in the background, kinda like in 2 where they were playing ""Raindrops keep falling on my head"". For some reason this section in both films really bothered me, it felt completely out of place. But that's like maybe 5 minutes out of a 140min. film.<br/><br/>* * * * * * * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br/><br/>Next complaint, too many villains. Yes, they had 3 villains in this film, but even if they had 3 just to make use of $250M I think they pulled it off. The reason they had 3 villains was so that they could use Harry as a villain early on but have him redeem himself in the end to help Peter fight Venom & Sandman to save MJ.<br/><br/>* * * * * * * * * * * *END OF SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br/><br/>Overall a VERY VERY excellent film.

Spiderman/Peter spent most of the movie either being a selfish, self-centered, egotistical jerk, or he was moping around miserable that MJ wasn't returning his calls. And MJ spent the entire movie feeling sorry for herself since she got kicked out of the play and now has to work in a small jazz club. She should be glad she even got another job that fast. Most people can't.<br/><br/>They killed off all the good characters. Harry was the only really likable character in the movie. And Venom got less screen time and story than the engagement ring. The ring got tons of story and airtime.<br/><br/>There were some really bad scenes in this movie. Just plain bad writing. Like right in the middle of the film, it suddenly turns into Saturday Night Fever 2007 as Peter does a poor imitation of John Travolta's strut down the street. And the Sandman scenes were just horrible. Why are we suddenly supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He's a villain. I don't want to care about him, I want him squashed.<br/><br/>But the saddest part of all was that by the time the final fight scene comes in, Peter/Spiderman is so deserving of a beatdown that you are actually rooting for the bad guys as they pound the stuffing out of him.<br/><br/>Bad writing all around. It's not an entirely unwatchable movie, but it's not a happy movie, and it doesn't really leave you feeling like you'd want to see it again or really want a part four.

Too many plot contrivances (and loopholes from the last film) and too little overall plot. <br/><br/>Let me expound on this last point...A meteorite crashes into the ground 30 yards away from Peter and MJ with the thunderous boom of a fluffy pillow falling on the floor. The exposition and explanation of the black goo/Venom is given about as much screen time as the creature in ""Jeepers Creepers"" (about 20 seconds). Flint Marko becomes Sandman in about the same fashion as Poison Ivy in ""Batman & Robin"": Whoops. I tripped and fell where I shouldn't have. Now, I'm a super villain. It just looks a lot cooler here. Apparently Harry's butler became part of ""Crime Scene Ivestigators"" (because this website won't allow me to write out c.s.i. in capital letters because that's considered ""shouting"") since the first film and can conclusively confirm something about Willem Dafoe's death there's no way he could possibly know...not to mention the fact that he should have mentioned this information...oh, I dunno...in the last movie. I was howling at this scene. And what happened with J.J. Jameson's son getting jilted at the alter? It's a wonder Parker is still able to work at the Daily Bugle. Shouldn't J.J. be extremely ticked off at Parker for taking his son's wife-to-be away? I know J.J.'s a cheapskate and probably got some $$$ refunded to him...but at least it should have been addressed or mentioned. <br/><br/>The only thing this move really had going for it was #1) the relationship between Peter and MJ didn't feel forced this time. Maguire and Dunst didn't sound like they were just rehearsing lines in a play. They actually felt like a couple going through real issues. #2) Bruce Campbell...can't get enough of this guy.

","So... Some parts were rather lengthy and could have been cut short without harming the rest of the plot such as dancing, singing, etc. I liked how the storyline was weaved into the previous Spiderman movies, but at times it seemed a bit dull in this one. <br/><br/>Topher Grace (AKA Eric Foreman) as a villain?!?!? Seriously. It was more humorous than anything. <br/><br/>It definitely picked up in the last thirty minutes, and I enjoyed it for the most part. For a third movie, it definitely does not disappoint like many normally do.<br/><br/>One last observation: People always standing in the streets under flying objects that could potentially land on them and massacre them. Pretty stupid."

","This is Sam Raimi's most complex film to date, yes it is a superhero movie with a very human story to it. Its a brilliant piece of work and congratulations to everyone who was a part of this gigantic monster of a movie, for me this is easily the best of the three.Lot of people complained of spiderman 2 having very little action, but i would say to them watch the third one for sure as it makes up for it and more. What else does an audience want when watching a superhero movie, its got 3 villains, 2 leading ladies and great action sequences.<br/><br/>watch it in the theatres.<br/><br/>8 on 10."

","i was not at all impressed. the movie had little to no action and was more about the characters real lives then it was about fighting against sandman, venom or the green goblin. it was confusing and the way it wrapped up in the end was just total garbage. very disappointed and very bored and very stupid of me to watch the midnight release and to skip work the next morning. i guess it was good for them to start developing the characters real lives, but it seemed to be to long. i didn't really care, i just wanted to watch the fighting between venom and spiderman and there really was only one major fight. so yeah i was a little disappointed. oh well... i still like the franchise a lot.. just don't think that it was worth all the hoopla that surrounded the release. i was just bored.. sorry"
"tbach-1","2","7","15","4 May 2007"," Biggest Waste of Potential Ever
","I'm not a comic buff, all I did was watch the cartoon when I was a kid but that was one of the worst movies to ever grace the big screen. <br/><br/>The majority of the movie was Peter Parker crying in front of people. Whatever potential the movie had was squandered when Parker and Mary Jane split up. As soon as he started doing his John Travolta strut down the street, the movie was lost. The symbiote is supposed to turn Spiderman into a bad-ass, not some emo kid wanna-be playa. He even had an emo hairdo. Did no crime happen between defeating the Sandman and ditching the suit? Show us how Spiderman has changed by how he treats criminals. He may have tried to kill the Sandman but that's different. That was the man who killed his uncle, not just some random thug who robbed a grocery store.<br/><br/>Most ridiculous, though, was the shot of Spiderman landing in front of the American flag. That gave nothing to the movie. Everyone knows that Spiderman is American, there's no need to remind us of that. Never has a movie had so much potential and then squandered it all. This movie felt as though it were a spoof of itself. There was too much stupid humor and attempts to teach us moral values.<br/><br/>*MAJOR SPOILER*<br/><br/>The only redeeming part of the movie was the first battle with Harry Osbourn and then the final battle with Venom and the Sandman. The rest of the movie felt half-assed. What was the point of introducing Venom only to kill him 15 minutes later?<br/><br/>*END SPOILER* <br/><br/>I can honestly say this was the closest I have ever come to walking out on a movie. I felt cheated of my ticket price and of my two and a half hours. No movie has ever let me down more than Spiderman 3."
"dvc5159","5","7","15","1 May 2007"," Terrific way to start the summer, but overall very disappointing after watching it a second time.
","This, is perhaps, the worst of the Spider-Man movies thus far. And this film has many reasons to show so. Such a reason is that it is crammed full of characters and irrelevant subplots like a pack of sardines, the and also characters become overly emotionally driven. Another thing is that we get to see Spidey fight THREE super villains, but the fights itself are abrupt. The story is a shattered mess and it feels forcibly rushed.<br/><br/>This can be considered as Sam Raimi's most expensive film by far, in my opinion. In fact, it was because he directed all three Spider-Man films that the franchise was able to survive. He has heart and soul while working behind the camera, but his and his brother's screenplay just did not make the cut. He's hardworking, though. Usually, directors often quit after the second film when making a superhero film. Such as the case of the horrendous Batman film franchise (before the fantastic Batman Begins). I will look forward to seeing Spider-Man 4, if there will be one.<br/><br/>Special effects are the only things that are praised here. Scott Stotdyk does an incredible job with keeping the special effects, and it seems that he may be good enough like John Dykstra, who won Spider-Man 2 an Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and left the third to do the much anticipated live action adaptation of the popular children's toy series Hot Wheels.<br/><br/>Here, all the familiar faces do their job like in the first, with comments for Maguire and Franco for playing their characters in a slightly unusual style. However, the best acting here goes to Thomas Haden Church, who steals the show as Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman, whose crime involving the death of Peter's Uncle Ben has a motive behind it, and so his character is understandable.<br/><br/>Judging from the plot outline above, one can't help but feel whether this film will get complicated in a way, with all the happenings in it. Fear, for the complicated plot is what keeps this film from being a worthy entry in the series, and that's what's crappy about it.<br/><br/>As I said in the beginning of this review, what a great way to start the summer. Watch it in the cinema once (recommended), but do not bother getting the DVD unless you're a die-hard fan.<br/><br/>It should have ended with 2.<br/><br/>5.6/10"
"frognscorpion","2","12","30","9 May 2007"," Don't even waste time on renting the DVD in 3 months
","I was so disappointed in this movie. It just would not end. The ONLY thing I found interesting was that Topher Grace was cast in it. I always thought he and Tobey McGuire looked alike. My bad...Topher is MUCH better looking.<br/><br/>I would go on ad infinitum about how horrible this movie is, but it would appear that I am not the first one to do so.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was uninspiring. The Young Miss Howard is pretty, but I would have to put the word 'average' on the end of the pretty. Anyone could have played her part.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Topher play a bad guy, and boy do I miss Thomas Haden Church on Wings. <br/><br/>The actress playing Aunt May was excellent as always, but even she could not carry this heap of garbage out to the dumpster."
"seniorlimpio","9","8","18","2 May 2007"," Seriously, I feel sorry for you if you can't enjoy this movie...
","I had a blast with S3 partially because it felt so much like reading a great comic book! Really, the notion of 15-20 years of comic collecting as such a foundation of my person finally being made into such successful high-end Hollywood tent-pole product can't help but have a euphoric affect- but, I'm one of those who goes in wanting to have fun- not one who's thinking ""okay, how are they going to f-up my heroes this time?"".<br/><br/>THC was perfect as Sandman, and the effects were fantastic. It's hard not to get anyone's hopes up, and I never expected to say this... but Venom was actually cooler than I anticipated!! His bodily surface texture and the way it looked when he ""spoke"" was just kick ass cool.<br/><br/>I want to see it again in order to fully compare it to the other Spidey films, but I guess that's a good thing- 'cause I AM looking forward to seeing it again. Some might argue that there's too much going on with 3 villains, some powerful friendship issues, and more than a couple romantic tuggings, but I absolutely had fun with it. It may have played a hair long at 2hr 20min, but I also could tell there were some things cut out- so I'm expecting a director's cut DVD with like 30 minutes added in.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell's stuff was even better(and more hilarious) than his Spidey 2 cameo, which I also loved.<br/><br/>Emotional Beats- I want to mention something here because it could make or break the film for some people. Much like Spidey 2, right at the end there's an attempt to hammer the audience with a quadrifold of emotional downpours (be it good, bad, whatever). Some of it almost felt forced, some of it almost felt contrived... but, just as I wanted to roll my eyes in frustration it worked itself out nicely. As I thought ""okay, I guess they're going to try and wrap THAT up now"" my chin nearly buckled and I started fighting the urge to shed a tear (and I could hear people around me sniffling)- so by that standard I have to say it worked. MOST people could potentially be choked up several times over by the end, and for me it worked all the way down to the very last shot, which I felt was great (I actually thought ""okay, a shitty movie would have done it this other way, but Raimi did it right by keeping it wonderfully subtle and unspoken"".)<br/><br/>WARNING: SUPER SPOILERY PARAGRAPH- In regards to the emotional beat breakdown, here's the ending layout (if I remember it correctly). Even though you saw it coming a mile away, you feel tingly when Harry shows up at the last minute to help Spidey defeat Sandman and Venom. Don't know if you feel much when Harry sacrifices himself to save Spidey because you really see it coming, but no big deal. After Venom's defeated, Sandman tells Peter how the gun accidentally went off when his partner-in-crime bumped him before getting in Uncle Ben's car. It was borderline silly with Sandman's flashback insert, then the holding up of the locket with his dying daughter's picture in it, however, Peter says he forgives him, which as a character moment makes it work great (in my opinion). Then we get to Harry's cliché ""dying in Peter's arms"" scene, but somehow you feel something in what's said between them. Just as you're bordering on emotion (if you made it though Harry's death scene without buckling- that's where I heard some sniffles), you're shamelessly thrown head first into the funeral scene- which if done properly can sucker anyone into emotion- and Raimi pulled it off with simply a voice over narration from Peter (which I felt was perfect- not too much). THEN we cut to a scene maybe not too far in the future, with Mary Jane singing in a jazz lounge, which we knows she's not happy doing (she'd been kicked off a Broadway show earlier in the movie because of bad reviews). At this point a divide of several layers had been created between them despite Peter's having told her that he meant to propose during one of their dinners (but it got flubbed- that's the humorous Bruce Campbell scene). As the scene began I thought ""it's going to be really cheesy if he walks in and shows her the ring"", and gladly I was surprised: no dialogue at all... the final shot is of him walking in without saying a word. Mary Jane stops singing as soon as she sees him, and Peter simply extends his hand. She takes it, comes down from the stage, hugs him, and they slow dance to the music she'd been singing to. The camera moves around them to close in on a shot of Peter as a tiny bit of happiness shows, and the film ends. The only thing that kept me from breaking a tear, was my anger in having been manipulated so masterfully with stuff that should have been cheesy. Nice job! --END SUPER SPOILERY.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's some musical silliness that made me want to cringe, but a good chunk of your everyday crowd will no doubt love it (kind of how I loved the ""me say day"" sequence from Beetlejuice when I was younger, but now it plays pretty stupid?). <br/><br/>And yes, the cgi camera work is amazing, whipping and whirling in and around mid-air battles and what not is also reminiscent of reading a comic- which I'm all for. <br/><br/>Lastly, I wish we could have seen Spidey's black costume like it was in the comic, as opposed to it just being a black version of the red and blue costume. No big deal, but when you see the ""real"" black Spidey costume as Venom's costume it's awesome as hell."
"ssj_frozen","4","5","10","12 May 2007"," Curse of the Three
","This review is being broken down into three parts. Good, Bad, Forgivable, and Non-Contributing. This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Bad : The biggest mistake was tying Sandman into Ben Parker's murder. Spiderman is one of the few heroes that actually was successful in avenging the death of his family member. But because he could have stopped it and didn't, it drives him to help others. You don't need every super villain to have some personal connection to the hero. The villain is bad, the hero is good, and the cops can't stop the villain, cue hero, enough said. The next big mistake was the symbiote suit. The suit was never able to be removed like ordinary clothes. Not to mention that it could morph into any type of clothes the host could desire. Also, it was shown as more as an addiction than a real parasite. Also, there was many points where the characters went to places for no reason than to further the plot. Biggest example. Spidey goes to the church for no reason to get rid of the suit, and Eddy Brock just happens to be at the church at the same time to be the new host. I know arguments will be a plenty for this next point, but Spidey has on many occasions fought multiple super villains and won. Sure, we can still see him take a beating, but the movie portrayed Spiderman as a wimp in this movie. Finally, while Spiderman wore the Venom suit he never actually made any finishing moves to kill anybody, he would come close but than come to his senses. The movie portrayed a different view, as if Spiderman no longer cared, when his conscience would always stop him at the last moment. As a minor note, Harry is supposed to be insane and see the original goblin in reflective surfaces. Windows, mirrors, etc. Not to mention, that he doesn't really want to fight Peter. More of this interaction between the two Goblins, as the Green Goblin persuades Goblin Jr into fighting Spiderman, would have helped flush out Harry's character into more than a one sided figure.<br/><br/>Forgivable : Being a movie, it is always a given that certain details are modified, as in the movie making world, they just don't pan out. While some things can be modified, not all are acceptable as they change the very essence of the characters. The following, were acceptable. Since we can't send Jameson's son back up into space to bring the symbiote back, the meteor does just fine. The suit looking like a black recolor of the original spider suit is also acceptable. If we were to be picky, Parker would have had to develop the web shooters in the first movie.<br/><br/>Good : Despite all the flaws, there were some decent parts to the movie. There were several good humorous parts to the movie. Like Parker strutting through town and while he was on the phone with Conners. The fights with the new Goblin were really good, and Bruce Campbell's scenes were great. The symbiote suit worked correctly on Eddy Brock.<br/><br/>Non-Contributing : As a final part, I feel one final piece must be said. I made no mention of special effects until this section for a reason. There are movies that make us go wow with their special effects. These movies represent the leaps and bounds of visual technology on the big screen. From Star Wars to Willow (the movie that brought us morphing technology) to Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. Each brings us a step beyond what was previously done. However, with each new step, as other movies incorporate these technologies, it does NOT remain the same degree of impressiveness. Yes, Sandman's CGI animation was ""top notch"". But it was nothing great by our standards today. In fact, it was just that. Standard. If you want to get technical, it was basically the same as the sandstorm in The Mummy. Does that mean I will not doc this movie if it has bad CGI, no. Because it means the movie hasn't kept up with the visual technology that it needs. While I didn't notice anything along these lines, the CGI was not anything to compliment on to give it a better grade."
"kgprophet","6","5","10","7 May 2007"," The difference between a great 2 hour movie and an overlong 2 hour and 20 minute movie:
","1. Absolute nonsense detour of musical numbers. Sam Raimi, if you desire to do musical numbers, go make another movie musical, but please, spare us action movie audiences these groaners. <br/><br/>2. Convoluted Sand Man who was real Uncle's killer, who had to kill Peter's Uncle to save his daughter....whah? The backstory, which is repeated a few times throughout the movie because it just makes no sense at all. What did the Sandman guy have to do with robbing the wrestling club owner? And how does creating general mayhem as Sandman monster help save his daughter? <br/><br/>3. Recycled Green Goblin backstory, with the same rivalry over MJ. Been there, done that. <br/><br/>At least two reels worth of this movie was just story on autopilot. What barely saves this film is the the rest of parts that keep you watching. The action sequences, even though they get repetitious as they whirl around in the air, nevertheless are a roller coaster ride on the big screen. As usual, Raimi injects the right amount of small film humour to keep the characters somewhat grounded. The action set pieces have a few new things to offer, but even so seem routine these days (watch how disinterested bystanders are during some chase scenes). If a couple subplots were removed, this movie could have been as good as #2. There are enough elements, such as the Photographer/Venom character, that breath some life into this sequel. <br/><br/>I found the look of the film to be on par with previous efforts, with a suitable score bringing us through the highs and lows. I was warned by the reviews that there is a little too much tearjerking going on in this movie, and it's true that when you hit those emotional beats too many times, they lose impact. One thing that does not make sense is the ridiculous price tag of $250 - 300 million to make this film. An open checkbook causes excess. Raimi comes from the B-movie horror genre that has creative ways to make less look like more. That creative economy also helped to make tight scripts and fun movies, not just showpieces. I wouldn't say this movie fails in this respect, but it has fallen symptom the the 3rd sequel curse; been there done that forces over the top. But then it feels like jumping the shark, and turns either into a farce or dull tedium."
"deastman_uk","5","5","10","6 May 2007"," The franchise dies on the editing floor
","The last time I was in a film in which the audience just burst out laughing in an emotionally dramatic scene was the dreadful Attack of the Clones. But as Green Goblin junior spent some quality screen time crying with his mates, one laugh in the audience started a chain reaction of unstoppable mirth.<br/><br/>I'm actually going to blame Alfred Molina. He provided such a good counterpoint in the last film - a non camp baddie - that the job was too hard for the scriptwriters this time. Hayden Church had a weak script, one expression, and no back story. I think the final film was a desperate attempt to cut what remained into a film but it failed.<br/><br/>So see this film from the view point of the editing team. There is one and half hours of good film, there is plenty of good CGI action. There is some good humour, but everything else is lacking. So by putting in as much as possible, you get to make good previews. So the film stinks? People will see it anyway, and number 4 is coming - ready or not.<br/><br/>But I think the franchise is clearly in trouble. The Silver Surfer looks cool, and Batman has returned. The third X-men attempt now looks kind of good. Odds are that Rami will jump ship, or maybe two franchises will merge. I think the web flinger will live on, but this kind of disaster surely won't be repeated."

","I walked into the theater with no real expectations, i didn't want to set myself up for disappointment. Well it couldn't be helped since i watched this film. This series of spiderman doesn't follow either the comic books or the last installments, it seemed to me more of a director/producers vision of what spiderman should be. To me special effects are great if used as a part of the story and not""as was the case in spiderman 3"" to make the movie. No one can say the effects were not good, they were, but to what end. To cover up a really horrible told story. I read many comics as kid and spiderman was some of what i liked, never did spiderman make friends with his enemies like was portrayed in this movie. It was ridiculous. Then of course the whole original ides of our heroes evil side, i was waiting for superman to fly in with his nicotine based kryptonite. Oh and we cant forget how to get to the good guy can we, grab his girlfriend. WOW never seen that before. I think the name of this movie would have been more descriptive if it were""Spiderman 3 the cliché'"" very unoriginal. Now the love triangle boy meets girl, girl loves boy , girl goes back to EX, EX uses girl , other boy gets mad and does the same, then at the end they are all friends again.........SIGH........ That hurt just writing that. Over all i see this movie only as a possible DVD collection, only to make your series complete, nothing more. I give this movie a 5, but that is purely on the special effects parts of the movie. I left the theater feeling betrayed, and feel they spent so much on advertising that my ticked must have helped pay for that. Don't go to the theater, stay home and rent the DVD when it comes out in three months. At least that way you have a toilet to run to after this film makes you sick."
"coasterwes","5","5","10","6 May 2007"," Itsy bitsy boring Spider-Man
","I must say first and foremost that I am a huge superhero/comic book fan and have been for a long time.<br/><br/>I have only sat through a few of the Marvel-based movies where I was truly bored - The Hulk being the top of my ""Most boring"" list.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 seems to have too many things on its mind and none of them are done all that well.<br/><br/>I guess since this is SM3, we have to have 3 villains...why? None of them are all that interesting, especially Venom, who is one of my all-time favorite Spidey villains. He seems only thrown in at the end to set up a 4th movie.<br/><br/>Mary Jane is just a whiny little annoying girlfriend in this movie. I found her neither sexy nor interesting like in the first two movies. What happened Kirsten? I love almost all your performances, but here I wanted to see less and less of you.<br/><br/>The whole dark Spider-Man thing just didn't work. It was hilariously BAD (and not in the good sense of the word). Peter is supposed to be battling demons within and all he does is go around looking like Chris Gaines and pointing at women on the streets.<br/><br/>For the most part, the movie followed the comic books, but in a very mechanical sort of way. There's really no life in this movie. Very sad.<br/><br/>Venom alone is a very interesting character, and here he just shows up at the end of the movie for about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Blah is about the word to describe this movie.<br/><br/>Hopefully they'll get it right in SM4."

The ending was cool and very entertaining. The best part about the movie was Bruce Campbell and j.k Simmons they were so funny thats what real comic relief should be like. the movie didn't really have that cheesiness that I'm used to from a Sam raimi picture (just looks at evil dead) the way he directs is a cool way to, like the transitions he uses like the wipes and fade outs and stuff and the close up of a hand with a chainsaw like in the second one, the third movie really didn't have eny of that stuff and i was kinda disappointed but u should still go see the move couse it really is good"

","OK, so, I've gotten in the habit of reading people's opinions of movies on IMDb. For the most part, I'll agree with what is written. So, after I read most of the reviews here, I was expecting a 'cheesy' movie without much plot... Nothing further from the truth in actuality!<br/><br/>Spidey fights 4 bad guys (if you include his own inner demons) and everything ties up at the end in good comic book fashion. The sub-plots help the movie along and I didn't see any extra characters that had no point in the movie. The Sandman was the most underutilized of characters, but with a movie 140 minutes long, someone has to be cut, or we'd have a 180 minute movie!!! <br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed it very much and I always use my wife as the movie barometer... if she snoozes then the movie is at best so-so; if she stays awake, then you have an exciting and entertaining flick. She slept through the first two Spiderman movies and was wide awake through number 3! That says it all from my point of view!"
"jameshartnell","1","5","10","5 May 2007"," Very, very poor...
","Well, that was a few hours of my life that I won't get back. Hugely disappointing, very slow, 45 minutes too long, lacked any character development because of too much going on, the acting was wooden, the romantic angle was wet and unbelievable and the story was simply rubbish.<br/><br/>Honestly, I was so close to walking out and that hasn't happened for a long time. I was with a group of movies fans that agreed that while the first two Spidey films were never going to be Oscar winning, they at least were a good romp with a coherent storyline. This film lacked so much and we were all left wondering how the studio execs could actually say that it was good enough to do the franchise justice.<br/><br/>But hey, the hype will work and continue to make the Marvel guys one of the most profitable studios going."
"wherearemybones","1","5","10","5 May 2007"," Bad acting, Didn't follow the comics, utter trash!
","I have to say, I went into this movie with very high expectations. Sandman and Venom are easily the best Spiderman villains, but this movie was more disappointing than the first two.<br/><br/>The acting was horrendous, screams were quite fake, and dialogue was laughable. It wouldn't have been as bad if two-thirds of the movie wasn't dialogue, but, sadly it was.<br/><br/>Topher Grace playing Venom was not a good casting choice, since Edward Brock was supposed to be a muscular jock, according to the comics.<br/><br/>The ending was very disappointing, as Sandman just, well, gave up. In the comics, Sandman never gave up. He was captured, escaped, wreaked more havok, repeat.<br/><br/>All in all, the only thing that was decent enough about the film was the special effects, although some of the scenes were still laughable, especially when Spiderman runs in front of an American flag, almost posing. Disgusting! It didn't help that in the first two films, the science of the villains was explained. In Spiderman 3, not so much.<br/><br/>Certainly the worst film I have seen this year."

"TJ1380","7","5","10","4 May 2007"," Good, but still the weakest Spider-man film so far.
","It becomes pretty obvious why this ""Spider-man"" film is the weakest of the three when one looks at the plot. After two movies of nothing but bad luck, things are finally going well for Peter Parker. He's loved by all of New York, he's acing his college classes, and he's ready to propose to Mary Jane. In fact, his life is going so well that he doesn't seem to realize that his relationship with Mary Jane is failing. Meanwhile, Harry has finally decided to try to kill Peter to avenge his father's death, but a head injury causes him to lose his memory and basically go back to being the best friend that he used to be to Peter. Meanwhile, an escaped convict named Flint Marko has a bizarre accident and becomes a being made entirely out of sand (naturally called The Sandman). It is also revealed that he was involved in the death of Peter's Uncle Ben, which drives Peter to seek revenge. Peter is also competing for a staff position at the Daily Bugle against a sleazy new photographer named Eddie Brock. While all this is happening, a strange alien substance that crashed to Earth on a meteor has bonded with Peter, which increases his powers and gives him a cool new black suit, but it also turns him into a cocky, angry, arrogant, violent jerk.<br/><br/>Any one of the main story lines could've made a good movie by itself. The problem here is that we get all of this as well as a handful of minor subplots in one movie that still isn't long enough to handle them even at nearly two and a half hours. It doesn't handle any of this stuff particularly badly, but it's still way too much for one movie to handle. The film seems to introduce one subplot, focus on it for awhile, and move on to something else. Some genuinely interesting characters are introduced and quickly disappear until the film is ready to pick up whatever subplot they're involved in. <br/><br/>That's not to say this is a bad movie. There's still a lot to like here despite the obvious flaws. The acting is still on par with what we saw in the first two movies. Tobey Maguire still plays Peter Parker like a geeky yet earnest young man that the audience can't help but like, yet he's giving something new to do here for the first time in this series. The main plot focuses on Peter's dark side as it is brought out by the black alien suit, and the film really has fun with that. There will probably be a lot of complaints about the fact that Peter's transformation is handled with more of a sense of humor than anything, but I for one enjoyed seeing Maguire act like a total jerk. That's really the best way to describe Peter's behavior. He gets angry with people over small things, he starts dating an attractive classmate to make Mary Jane jealous, he orders his coworkers at the Daily Bugle around like he owns the place, and generally behaves with a cockiness and arrogance that we haven't seen from the character before. Like I said, this is usually handled with more of a sense of humor than people might like (there's even a goofy moment where Peter struts down the street like he's John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever""), so I have a feeling the hardcore Spider-man fans who know about this subplot from the comics will be divided. The supporting cast is largely the same as in the first two movies, with J.K. Simmons once again stealing the show as Peter's quick-tempered fast talking boss J. Jonah Jameson. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst once again make up the main supporting cast as Harry and Mary Jane. Franco has probably the most interesting and tragic story arc here, with his character undergoing numerous changes that are all surprisingly believable. On the other hand, Dunst is practically wasted. The relationship between Peter and Mary Jane has always been at the heart of the ""Spider-man"" movies, but I just didn't care for Mary Jane at all here. She comes off as selfish, petty, and so unlikable that I really didn't care when she was inevitably placed back into the role of damsel in distress. As for the newcomers Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace, they do a great job as long as they're on screen. Church plays The Sandman as a reluctant and genuinely remorseful villain who almost has a good reason for doing what he does, and Grace manages to make the audience hate Eddie Brock for being such an arrogant prick while still giving him a great story arc that turns him into a real threat to Spider-man. Both of these characters make great villains, and it's a real shame that the film can't go into greater detail with them.<br/><br/>The action and special effects are about what I expected from this kind of movie. They never reach the heights that they did in moments like the great fight on the train in ""Spider-man 2,"" but they still manage to be exciting. The two best moments are clearly the birth of the Sandman (in which Flint Marko slowly pulls himself together after turning into a pile of sand) and the final battle royale where all the major characters fight it out at a construction site. Like I said, there's nothing that tops the train scene from ""Spider-man 2,"" but the film does come close.<br/><br/>Despite it's obvious flaws, this really wasn't a bad movie. It still retains plenty of the charm of the first two ""Spider-man"" movies, but it just tries to do way too much for one film to handle. I would've rather seen Sam Raimi go the route taken by ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and film two much tighter movies instead of one rather sloppy one."

","Before I get hardcore critics and fans of the film blasting my comments I must make the point that I do not in any way, shape or form pretend to be a professional film critic. I am however a long standing Scottish cinema manager, have a love for films and have (like everyone else here) an opinion. When commenting here I draw from my film experience as well as my boy-hood love of the arachnid hero! <br/><br/>I am fortunate to have had an advance screening of the 3rd installment and had been excited for weeks and months and yes, I probably did build my expectations up too much but this was only setting me up for a plumit to earth with no web to fire and save me! On a positive angle I could not have been more impressed by the action sequences. This is a fine example of what C.G.I is capable of and is really the saving grace of this film and is what is going to pull the punters through our cinema doors.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I found these sequences lost in what was a fairly average and lost plot. There seemed no structure with this movie and I felt it was always just too long a wait until the next 'big scene'. Please tell me also why I should have to cringe at least 3 times in this film after watching scenes which seemed to be better placed in a 3rd rate rom-com. You should not be cringing at Spiderman...you should be on the edge of your seat! Didn't want to give spoilers away, just my opinions. Most will enjoy this movie but it is not a shade on the fantastic second Spidey. If you haven't seen it yet...enjoy. It is the start of a great summer of film hits!"

"SirianRue","7","5","10","2 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 is a Dark Movie
","I really loved Spiderman 2, I can say that. It was the perfect blend of fantastic action, compelling story, and believable characters. It was a light movie that got you excited and emotionally involved with the characters, I really fell in love with these characters. It was light enough that I could laugh, enjoy, and yell out ""go spidey go"" and leave the theater with nothing but joy in my heart. That was Spiderman 2, I gave it a 10. Spiderman 3 resembles a vampire movie. It starts off on a melodramatic note and yes folks it stays that way throughout the movie. By the end of the movie I was hating Peter Parker for his cruelty and pitying Mary Jane for her self-pity. Other reviews say things like ""Peter and Mary Jane finally grow up"". I'd say just the opposite, they become totally engrossed in their egos and become a bickering couple. The innocence of the first two movies is gone. I kept waiting for it to redeem itself in the second half of the movie but it just gets more and more unbelievably dark. Most of the movie takes place either at night or in some darkly lit sewer. The fun, colorful scenes of Spidy 1 and 2 is gone. It's a constant flow of anger, revenge, What happened? I must also ad that the villains wern't really very fleshed out. The name venom wasn't even mentioned and the whole concept of the black goo was vague and shallow. The finally was way to much to swallow, Raimi had to let go of his flawless character/storytelling to allow the Animators to step in and have their 20 minute cliché battle sequence that leaves one feeling like they just finished watching X-men 3. Yep, I hate to compare my beloved Spiderman series to the ill-fated X-men series. Really the only way to redeem this is by giving Raimi, Tobey, and Kirsten another shot with Spiderman 4. Left as it is, the series does indeed resemble the X-men series."
"andydreamseeker","7","5","10","1 May 2007"," Movie Review: Spider-Man 3
","Would it be fair to say that 3 is not better than 2? That is if I make a comparison between Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 2. But regardless of comparison, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie. It just isn't great, that's all.<br/><br/>The movie began with a lengthy title intro, throwing in snippets from the movie Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, which left me with a bad feeling to how things will turn out. The intro wasn't well done. It was quite shabby, even lazy if to put it more harshly. Aesthetically speaking it wasn't impressive.<br/><br/>It was like as if portraying the way Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-Man is living his life after being celebrated as the city's hero. Life is good, so good that our hero has forgotten his place and purpose. Spider-Man, in this latest from the franchise is missing its spunk. It has forgotten what made it great. I'm talking about having the audience emotionally touched by Peter Parker's struggle, having mind-blowing actions that leaves the audience in awe, and the impact of the dialogues that inspires.<br/><br/>My suspect is that the filmmakers tried to put too much into this movie. There must be something somewhere that went amiss producing it.<br/><br/>Let me explain. While the main focus of the film revolves around our hero's disposition from fighting the darkness that exists in him, there were too many sub-plots that took away and undermine it. There was the love story between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). There was the meaning of friendship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco). There was Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) being linked to the murder of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). And there was Venom (Topher Grace).<br/><br/>With so many motives to act out, it is inevitable that the film would fall short. There are too many pieces in this puzzle too trying to piece together in one film, despite its length. The tempo is really slow right from the start. If not for the hilarious-ness of some scenes, with quite a few notably of James Jameson (J.K. Simmons), Peter's boss at the Daily Bugle, the movie can be considered rather dry for a comic genre film.<br/><br/>Sandman and Venom, the main villains, were not well depicted. There were supposed to be much more about them, yet in the film they were reduced to just mere bad guys with bad luck that ultimately led them to become Spider-Man's foe. Character play is weak.<br/><br/>It is agonizing to see Spider-Man 3 following X-Men 3's path of condensing story lines and mixing in Superman Returns's mellow love story attempt. This is not the best formula for an inspirational Superhero movie.<br/><br/>The last fight sequence toward the end where Spider-Man battles Sandman and Venom though became the savior for this Superhero film. Thank goodness for it.<br/><br/>All in all, ""With great power comes great responsibilities"" wasn't that great. But I'll like to agree with this message that Spider-Man 3 brings and that is in life we are given choices, some will lead to good and some will be bad. When confronted can you do the right thing?<br/><br/>Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) told Peter Parker in the film, ""Do yourself a favor by first doing the most difficult thing, forgive yourself.""<br/><br/>All of us had made choices in our lives. For all those that went wrong, there is no longer anything we can do about them, but we can always learn from them so we can make right choices in time to come.<br/><br/>At least that part in Spider-Man 3 is right. ""May"" Spider-Man 4 be ""right"" after 3."
"fairviewed","1","14","38","6 May 2007"," Cheese atop cheese
","This movie was awful. One mushy scene led into the next, and the dialogue was lame, forced, and badly acted. The third Spiderman was nothing more than a pile of cheese. The audience is told to make the right choices in order to be the best person, and the characters continually forgive one another and become best friends all over again and again and gag me with a freaking spoon. The gratuitous hero shot with Spiderman swinging in front of a full screen shot of the American flag made me laugh out loud. This is a kid's movie, except that they also put in vicious violence and we see Spiderman hit in the face with a metal pipe among other things. I hate sounding like the snooty critic who can't find anything good to say, but I really have nothing but criticism for this movie. I can't believe anyone really liked it, and I can't understand why it's breaking box office records."

","A jumble of poorly-conceived scenes and even more poorly-written scripting. Perhaps as bad a script as Star Wars Ep.3.... no, in fact I think it may be worse. A real pity; once again I left the theatre wondering how so many people could be involved in making something like this without someone somewhere within the process saying, ""wow, this really sucks"". Tremendously poor film-making, a tragedy for each of the actors within it -- let's hope their careers can recover from it. Sony -- time for some heads to roll over this one; talk about an ""annus horriblus"" for the one-time kings (and it's no accident that Spiderman uses the same font for the ""3"" as used for Playstation... Sony, ditch your marketers first, then cull the film division)."
"broadfoot","9","6","13","7 May 2007"," Perhaps They Should Have Stopped At Number 2
","I thought ""Spider Man 3"" was great. However, some of the special effects and acting are rather overblown, especially the scenes where Peter Parker, wearing the black Spidey suit, struts John Travolta-like down the street, occasionally stopping to do the hustle. The special effects used to create Sandman are also a bit much.<br/><br/>To me, a better plot would have to be Peter asking Mary Jane to marry him at the beginning of the movie. Of course, the wedding can't go ahead until he takes care of all the villains, including himself when he's wearing the black suit.<br/><br/>The casting of the villains is perfect. Topher Grace certainly isn't the wet noodle character he used to be on ""That 70s Show"". Here he exhibits a lot of intensity. The same goes for James Franco and Thomas Haden Church."

Listen, just because it isn't a two-and-a-half-hour action sequence, but instead actually contains a very well thought-out plot and a lot of emotional backing, doesn't mean you have to automatically hate it.<br/><br/>Did nobody pay attention to the first two movies? Peter Parker was always a righteous person, so why isn't anybody moved or surprised when the symbiote fills him with rage and hate? Nobody found this interesting? Or were they too busy complaining to their buddies about the ""relationship scenes"" to pay attention to this major part of the film? Which reminds me, did nobody know that Peter wants to propose to Mary Jane in this movie? WHY are people upset at the amount of scenes involving their relationship? A superhero movie doesn't need to be nothing but macho beat-em-up nonsense, it can have a plot or, God forbid, a love story, too. Oh, and I'm sorry that the action scenes that WERE included were by far the best out of any of the movies.<br/><br/>So stop whining about the love scenes and the dialogue, because this was by far the best Spider-Man movie out of the three, and had the best plot, themes, and character development out of any of them."

When Tobey first turns ""evil"" there is are two awful scenes where he thinks he's a bad@$s. and it sucked. The last fight scene is also a big disappointment. Topher Grace is a fantastic actor, he just isn't the person to play venom, when everybody knows him as that goofy kid from that 70's show. The Sandman's character was really stupid, he just wanted to make his daughter better and he tried robbing banks. He didn't even really hate spiderman.

I want spider sense tingling and uppercuts and flying martial arts web action. Does anyone seriously expect me to cry on a Spiderman movie? Hours go by without any kind of action, instead you have to suffer trough this: ""Peter, why do you want to push me away from you?"". I will not even go into the infamous emo-Peter-fever-dance- sequence, to leave room for the part when Eddie Brock kneels down in a church and asks Jesus (I repeat, that's Jesus Christ) to ""KILL PETER PARKER"". At that point I wouldn't have been surprised about Jesus descending from the cross to actuall battle Spiderman. Around the end, we also get a shot of Spiderman posing in front of a giant, waving American flag, that kind of did it for me and several other people in the cinema and it was all laughter from then on, the best part of the whole flick.<br/><br/>I was promised a darker and deeper Spiderman and what I got was a ""f*ck- you"" and a kick in the nuts.

I also read a few bad reviews stating the dialogue was weak and the acting was poor, but I did not want to believe such statements. Common, it's Spiderman 3! I'm sorry to say this, but Spiderman 3 was hyped up in the ads and ended up being a sore loser. <br/><br/>Okay, so I sit down, and the movie starts. The dialogue was weak right from the beginning of the movie, but hey, I told myself hang on in there, the movie will get better right?

As in garbage, I mean distasteful humor, bad acting, a bad script, and just bad scenes! They made Tobey Maguire into a fool with the scenes they put him in. The only good in the movie was from a few good actions scenes, but hey, that's all you'll get for 10 dollars.<br/><br/>There was no connection between scene to scene as the storyline was scattered with so many different villains. To make matters worse, Peter Parker himself was scattered in his personality as well, is he a nerd, superhero, arrogant superhero, cheater, villain, friend, selfish man, or how about EMO.

The movie seemed about half an hour too long, and even though it seemed never-ending, when it finally ended I felt as if it needed at least ten more minutes to wrap up the loose ends. The movie is probably worth seeing, but I don't think it came close to living up to the hype.<br/><br/>I'd compare it to V for Vendetta.

","My friends and I just saw the premiere of Spider-Man 3 and we had a great time watching it! The theater was packed and everyone was so hyped to see it, I mean, could you ask for a better movie experience? Spider-Man 3 has massive special effects that I have to admit were very impressive, the actors were fun, and the story was pretty good, but I have to honestly say that after all that hype, I wasn't incredibly impressed. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 left me and my friends with no closure to what could have been an excellent trilogy. But still this was indeed an exciting summer blockbuster that I'm sure you won't wanna miss.<br/><br/>Spider Man has been given a day in dedication from New York, he is admired and loved by all, and quite frankly, it's getting to his head. Peter however is still the geek in real life, not too respected by anyone, but he still has Mary Jane who he wants to ask to marry him. Mary Jane is struggling in her career and is questioning her relationship with Peter and Spider Man. Harry is also back and during a huge fight between him and Spider Man he is knocked unconscious and has short term memory, but slowly realizes that he is still thirsty for revenge on his father's death. But that's the little of Peter's problem when a black goo turns him into an evil alternate of Spider Man and when Peter finds out that the man who actually killed his uncle is at large, he lets the evil out and is only out for cold revenge.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3 is a great blockbuster that is the big start to our summer of trilogies, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone, it was a lot of fun to watch. But I wouldn't expect the greatest movie, I still love the first one the best, but I'm sure you will get 2 hours of pure entertainment, the special effects were awesome and I hope there is eventually another Spider Man in the near future.

The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) shows up to...something (the movie's really not clear on that) and an alien symbiote turns Spidermans' costume black and turns Parker AND Spiderman evil. Then Venom (Topher Grace) shows up later on.<br/><br/>Talk about overdone! TOO many villains, too many plot lines (and plot holes), WAY too violent, too long (the longest one of the series) and surprisingly dull. As always the special effects are incredible but the dialogue and stories are still at a dumb comic book level. Maguire surprisingly acts (a little) here. He was blank in the first two movies but here he actually smiles. However when he's called to play a badass guy it's hysterically bad. I was laughing out loud! Dunst was good in the first two--here she's just blank. Also she sings two songs--that was NOT a good idea! Dunst just can't really sing. Church was lousy as Sandman. He speaks in a monotone and never changes expression. Grace was GREAT as Venom but he can't save the film. Franco seems sort of confused in his role and his 180 degree turnaround towards the end didn't make sense. As I said it's WAY too violent for a PG-13.

I rather they used the money to give Britney Spears lipo and a few plastic surgeries so she can start looking at least close to what she used to. I stopped watching the movie like 7 times. I needed to take a break from sitting through the worse movie ever. And yes, I finished it because like many of you say... it is spider-man. BUT NO, THIS HORRIBLE FILM IS NOT SPIDER-MAN. <br/><br/>The problem started with (as many of you say) combining 3+ stories in one. What were the writers thinking? well I bet they weren't. It seems like they advertised Venom yet the movie was about oh wait... hmm what the hell was the movie about? was it the sandman? was it peter's and MJs love? maybe harry? oh maybe Gwen? hmmm I saw an interview of Tobi on TV before the movie came out and never realized why he looked so bum down. And now I know, he not only HATED this film but felt bad asking people to go watch it (he has to pay his bills so I don't blame him for marketing). <br/><br/>I think you are spending better time reading this comment than watching this movie. OK here is what you should watch. 1. The crane scene was pretty good. 2. Spiderman VS Goblim Part I was great. 3. OH the part with Stan Lee was awesome. 4. hmm Peter Parker dance off... wait, what was that? dance off? YES PEOPLE!, BAD AS* Spider-man breaks out in dance, oh and it's kind of funny but only if you think the smell of throw up is funny. 5. Peter hitting MJ was good. (I wish the goblin would have thrown her in a parallel dimension in part 1 and she came back looking like the girl from ""the village"".) 6. the last scene is kind of fun if MJ wasn't screaming so much, I wish a boulder fell in her mouth.<br/><br/>I am just shocked, disappointed and I am glad someone else rented this movie for me.

They didn't show any part of the back story between them and casting topher grace ( I think I'm to cool to be called Christopher) was as bad as casting Don Cheadle to play a guy with an English accent in ocean's eleven.

People stormed to the movies not because the movie is good, but they want to see Spidey. What makes this movie great is the special effect.<br/><br/>The storyline is what I found the most appalling part. I thought the second movie's plot line was okay (though a bit twisted already), but this one, is super-tangled. Some new story lines are added to the plot, making it MORE twisted, but somehow the creators managed to untangle it in the end, in a somewhat awkward and sentimental way.<br/><br/>I mean, for example, the police officials announced that somebody else killed Ben Parker and it kinda makes Peter feel SO guilty cos he killed the wrong guy, but in the end it was all a misunderstanding. That is what I meant by adding up a twisted plot and untangling it. Another thing that really bothers me was when Sandman went like ""Oh I want to kill Spidey, oh I want to kill Spidey,"" but in the end what did he say? ""Please forgive me."" Oh and since when did the Osbourne butler become an important person? ""There are certain things that I've seen but haven't said."" Yeah right. If there really were, why didn't he clear up the misunderstanding but keep the truth to himself? So 2 best friends could kill each other? Sorry for being kinda mental, but that's how disappointed I really was. The list could go on forever, but I'll leave it to that.<br/><br/>Kudos to the special effects team to did their wonderful job making the effects look so realistic, for which I think is the only task that was carried out perfectly.<br/><br/>For Spiderman lovers, go and watch this movie, but don't complain if it's ugly. For good quality movie seekers, I would not recommend this one, aside of being a waste of time and money, it's been a waste of energy for me too as I haven't stop complaining about it.<br/><br/>5/10"

","SUPER SPOILER SUPER SPOILER SUPER SPOILER i had so many problems with this movie i don't know where to start, and i loved the first two! first off, his teacher didn't turn into the lizard! if your gonna throw an excessive amount of villains into one movie at least tie up what you started. TOPHER GRACE WAS A POOR CASTING CHOICE FOR VENOM/EDDIE BROCK. why would the green goblin turn into a good guy?, (ill get back to that one), and why did he act so stupid until he remembered how angry he was at peter? Why did so many adults cry when given half a chance? why was every character linked to each other like a bad soap opera? the whole superhero idea is a little outside of reality, granted, but watching that many coincidences one right after another was a little draining. i was half expecting Eddie Brock to be peters long lost brother, it was all so ridiculous. But my biggest problem was the ending, the two cool villains die, shortly after one turns into a good guy, and the lame villain makes up with Spiderman and they both go home. it sounds like the writers couldn't come up with a way for a 6 foot spider to defeat a pile of sand, a crazy half alien half 90 pound guy with bleached hair, and pretty much a duplicate of a villain hes beaten before. but unfortunately that was there job. i was more confused than entertained, but the cgi and venom did look sweet!"
"orjg2","10","3","5","6 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3: My Review (Spoilers)
","A solid and good film, but lacking the greatness of most memorable third installments. I recently saw Spider-Man 3, and I must admit it's a solid, interesting and entertaining film, but, like I said before, this film is unable to reach the greatness of third installments or chapters such as RETURN OF THE JEDI, REVENGE OF THE SITH, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and RETURN OF THE KING. The positive elements of the movie are the amazing action sequences and the interesting human dynamics, which were kept from the previous movie, this is the department where Spidey 3 really pays off. Unfortunately Spidey 3 is flawed in many ways, one of which was trying to fit too much into the film, which is a common flaw in many third installments (including memorable ones) but here this flaw becomes more evident and hurts the film even more: your attention keeps jumping from one issue to another very quickly, therefore being difficult to understand the storyline coherently, even if you are a Spider-Man die hard fan. All the previously mentioned things make the third chapter of the Spider-Man saga, uneven; its predecessors ,unlike this film, had a more stable and coherent storyline. Now lets talk about the story itself, here is where I find a major flaw: Uncle Ben's death. The death of Uncle Ben was a very important, canonical and pivotal event in the Spider-Man universe, it was Peter's negligence by failing to stop a criminal what caused Uncle Ben's death in the first place; the writers twisted the story by giving Uncle Ben's killer a different name and a different face, therefore tampering with the essence of the Spider-Man mythology; the powerful premise of ""great power and great responsibility"" is deeply hurt with this unwise twist. Second, the arrival of the symbiotic substance, wow, that was pretty lame for a summer blockbuster, the 90's cartoon featured the arrival of the alien suit in a more exciting and dynamic way, here, all we get to see is a falling meteor; the same way science fiction monsters fell from space to earth in B movies such as THE BLOB. Sadly and unfortunately, Spidey does not walk out of this one clean; honor and dignity are nowhere to be seen at the end of the film. It was interesting to notice many similarities to SUPERMAN III: a new girl, the hero becoming evil, a big catastrophe where the hero saves the day (Spidey's crane and Supes chemical plant), unexpected villains, comedy elements and bad taste (Superman getting drunk and Spider-Man hitting MJ). I don't think Spider-Man 3 is the worst of the trilogy, the original movie was a weak by the numbers summer blockbuster, the second one an entertaining and interesting wisely written story, slightly better than the third, and Spider-Man 3 bears a second place medal between the first two movies. When Danny Elfman left the project (SM3) I could smell trouble a mile away, and it seems I was not wrong: the musical score in this film is equally uneven, but I don't think this was a very big production problem when they were making the movie. Well, here you have my review of SPIDER-MAN 3: a good film that could have been better."
"yaqitah","4","3","5","6 May 2007"," not worth the 10 bucks on opening night...
","I don't expect much from action movies other than explosions and good stimulation, but when, despite fairly low expectations about overall quality, an action movie's still bad, that means it's pretty bad. A lot of things in this movie flat out don't make sense. Is Peter Parker (some sort of physics genius) REALLY so stupid that he doesn't know how to listen to MJ when she's literally crying? There's too many bad guys thrown into this movie, and everyone is created from, uh-oh--! a science experiment gone wrong! So do people running nuclear experiments not notice ENORMOUS threats to their experiments, which are probably meticulously planned and executed and probably cost thousands per experiment? And if spiderman has to turn to the dark side (which he probably should, given how lily-white he is) why can't this be born out of his own internal struggles, rather than that creepy oil stuff? I also thought that could have been a lot more fun than uncombed hair and bad dancing--like when Christopher Reeve as Superman went bad. He was bad, but not over the top, or too comical not to be scary. And WHERE is the spidey-sense? Things in this movie frequently pop out of no where to attack spiderman, who appears to not have spideysense at all in this movie. Bottom line: more of the same, but not necessarily at the same level as the other two movies. The effects for the Sand man were pretty good, but the rest of the action is the same as we've already seen."
"stepwallace","5","3","5","6 May 2007"," See it for the SFX, and the George Lucas like dialogue...
","Wasn't expecting much, and I didn't get much. If there's one thing I hate about comic book movies (and sequels in general)it's their inability to stick to the facts (as created by them). ""We want to make the Sandman a personal enemy.... so he actually killed Pete's uncle"". - What the?!? Oh and while we're at it, lets have the kindly natured butler (can you say ""Alfred"") reveal at the last possible moment that Spiderman didn't kill Harry's dad. I mean it's not like he wouldn't have mentioned it in passing earlier.<br/><br/>But comic's are always good for plot holes. If Stan Lee makes another cameo and doesn't die this time - I'm walking out. No questions, just walking out, it's not a fun fact for the fans anymore - it's just damn annoying. Nothing breaks the suspension of reality more than the author making an appearance.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell's appearance however was one of the very very few highlights of this film. His comedy was a wonderful change from the flat pace of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Go see it, enjoy the SFX, just don't expect value for money."
"nathan_034","8","3","5","4 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 was superb, but...predictable?
","Great effects, great story, all in all, maybe on of the best of the spider-man trilogy. the fact that there's 3 classic spidey foes (Sandman, Green Goblin and Venom) gives a real treat to comic lovers everywhere. Great performances are delivered by the characters and some characters are looked into a lot more as they have been overlooked in the past 2 movies. HOWEVER, to those who've watched spider3 and the last two. don't you think its a tad repetitive? Other than the main plot (ie Spiderman's alien symbiote) the rest of the movie was quite alike the last two. Spiderman fights a villain, the villain somehow manages to capture Mary Jane Watson, Spidey rescues her, all is done, graveyard scene with peter parker saying some stuff, end. hope you agree with me but, getting a tad bit repetitive eh? Still, awesome blockbuster movie with a lot of great characters we have all missed for the past two years."
"blink182_lovah","7","3","5","4 May 2007"," Room for improvement
","I just returned from the midnight showing of this movie, and i have to say, it was good. However, like a lot of movies, there is room for improvement. Two and a half hours seemed like a long enough time to show three villains, but it would have been better *SPOILER ALERT* if they had not killed off venom, and kept him to continue the fourth movie with. Acting was superb as usual from the regular cast members, Bryce was hot as Gwen Stacy, all in all, a powerful story that shows the struggle between Spider-man and his dark side. Still, room for improvement, coulda been a tad bit longer (it was only really 2 hours and 20 minutes not including the credits), and please, no Jake Gyllenhaal for the fourth movie....Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man in my opinion."

","Well i thought this movie would be just a bit more mature and better since this is the third part...guess again. the movie was boring, and predictable at any intense moment...and filmed in a way a way that made me wonder if some one is pulling a prank on me...perhaps it is meant only for people under age 12 or something.only a scene i would like to mention...when that profesor looks under the microscope that black thing, and says it's aggressive...i mean i'm no scientist but what was that ball hitting others, just the thing that made me realise this just isn't a serious project...it really made me laugh...conclusion: if a movie makes you sleepy and think about how long it is and wondering when it will end...it just isn't good"
"zetes","6","8","20","7 May 2007"," Welcome to Summer '07!
","This is first giant blockbuster of the year, and like most of them, it's not very good. Unfortunately, it follows two pretty good Spider-Man films, so that's kind of a disappointment. If you've seen the previews, you can probably guess what goes wrong: too many villains, and too many characters in general. If you thought Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was sloppily written with all its stories going on (and I didn't myself), this one's going to look like Hell. They have to cut between Peter and MJ, Harry Osbourne, Flint Marko (aka Sandman), and Eddie Brock (aka, at least late in the movie, Venom). A million things happen, and the screenwriters (only three listed, but my guess is there were dozens) have a difficult time keeping it together. They seem to forget characters' motivations at times, and they forget to explain some things, or explain them so quickly that, when they're referenced later in the movie, you have to backtrack and figure it all out. My favorite is the whole relationship between Eddie Brock, Peter Parker's photographer rival, and Gwen Stacy, a classmate of Parker's who becomes Mary Jane's romantic rival. Gwen serves as about ten different plot points at once; it becomes pretty amusing. And she's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, most famous for her extremely bizarre turns in M. Night Shyamalan's last two movies (and to a lesser extent her excellent performance in Lars von Trier's Manderlay). It's just weird to see her as the blonde bombshell type. Gwen and Eddie's relationship is briefly mentioned twice early in the film, with the two barely making contact in the two scenes they share. Later, once Brock is Venom, he is apparently angry at Spider-Man for stealing his girlfriend. This whole thing just made me giggle. Oh, and don't even ask about Harry Osbourne's butler, who magically appears at one point and delivers the stupidest deus ex machina in recent movie memory. Okay, so the movie's badly made. Doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, though. The action sequences are fun, even though a couple of them are so fast you can't tell what's going on. There are a couple of comic sequences which are amusing, even if they feel weird in the context of the film. Particularly funny is the scene where Peter Parker struts down the street wearing the evil black Spider-Man costume under his clothes (it amplifies his aggression, or some such swiftly explained nonsense). And, hey, although it's bad, it's never boring, and I'd even say it's close to entertainingly bad. I mean, I can't hate a film too much that has a climax where Tobey Maguire fights the mechanic from Wings and Eric Foreman."
"rghughes-12203","10","4","8","7 September 2019"," WHY SO MUCH HATE
","Gotta put some people straight. The movie is a great end to a great career, it only takes a crap production by sony with the andrew garfield franchise to show just how talented toby maguire really was. An aged character for the role and still man aged to show how impressive he was. Tom Holland has done the character some justice but is helped greatly by the actors around him. Toby Maguire will in my eyes forever mainatin as the number 1 spidey espceially for his time, he did the character justice and did great alongside some great peformances Thomas Haden Church shows a depth and inside to the sandman role we have never seen before.<br/><br/>Overall, i feel that Toby did a great job with what he was given, remember the other sony productions we've had"
"Boyo-2","8","4","8","21 May 2007"," Semi-interesting
","Having seen the first of the installment, and pretty much hating it did not dampen my spirits going into this one. I was with a friend who had seen them all and was very excited to see this one, so I was basically just being nice and cooperative seeing this movie. Its not like there is a ton of other stuff worth seeing anyway...<br/><br/>But it was very good. I think it could have lost twenty minutes along the way, somewhere, but what's there is very interesting. I liked that it seemed to concentrate quite a bit on friendship - the importance of it, the loss of it and the idea that it should weather anything that might get in the way of it.<br/><br/>Mary Jane has the hardest time of it, in many ways. This girl cannot get a break. After being fired from her Broadway debut (there's not a chance in the world that would have happened the way it happened, but if the main character in your movie flies through the air, you cannot expect full logic and you cannot ask for the things you might normally expect to get from a movie) and then getting a total lack of attention from Peter right when she needed it the most, she's lacking several things necessary for one's happiness. Dunst does not have a whole lot to do other than look pretty annoyed most of the time. Its not exactly her movie anyway but you kind of want the leading lady to be a little less joyless.<br/><br/>Harry is also at a crossroads. Having battled Peter and then conveniently forgetting it ever happened, he's re-born as a nice guy following his 'accident' and then as his memory returns, he realizes that..'oh yeah, I want Peter Parker to be dead', things of that nature. When they are unable to reach an understanding, they battle again but Harry's elderly butler butts in, telling Harry that Peter was not responsible for his father's death, and this does not happen a moment too soon, since Peter needs Harry's help in order to rescue Mary Jane from not one but two evil dudes who are out to remove her from not only his life but her own as well.<br/><br/>The f/x for the emergence of the Thomas Haden Church Evil Dude character are very well done. The same cannot be said for the Topher Grace character, since they are fairly cut and dried.<br/><br/>Laughs are provided by Elizabeth Banks, as J.K. Simmons assistant. Bill Nunn, Theresa Russell and Rosemary Harris have a little to do with the proceedings, but not much.<br/><br/>Its not a bad movie, its just not that memorable. Its rather somber at times and even sad. It does seem open-ended in its conclusion, so many there really will not be a sequel. Okay with me. Better to end while you're ahead, I always say. 8/10."
"sven-goran-lindqvist","6","4","8","18 May 2007"," Don't listen to the critics!!!!!!!
","From the words of a true fan....Spider-Man 3 is a great movie! It has action,drama,romance,humor,great special effects and really good villains.I don't get why fans and critics are complaining on this film,if you liked the first two you just have to like this.Some say that it's biggest problems is that it tries too much and has too many villains,but I think that it works great and nothing seems rushed or unreasonable.The cast is once again great and Tobey Maguire is yet again fantastic in the leading role,I especially like scenes when he turns ""bad"" and explores his dark side.Thomas Haden Church is very good as sand man and his character is far more interesting than Topher Grace's Eddie Brock.although Grace also does a good job.But my favorite character is James Franco's Harry Osborn,it's really interesting to see how his and Peter's relationship develops throughout the film and and how Harry really grows.You just got to love him!Kirsten Dunst unfortunately doesn't have a lot to do but to look sad and getting kidnapped,but she does an OK job and the chemistry between her and Maguire is good.And Bruce Campbell does his best cameo yet. The ending is good,although a bit sad and I won't be surprised if a 4th movie will come along. To sum up Spider-Man 3 is a great sequel that fans just have to love,it's not quite as good as S-M 2 but it's better than the first one and is simply a must see!"
"Paul_Chung","8","4","8","18 May 2007"," Bravery And Originality
","I am bewildered and saddened with the negative reviews this film has garnered. I believe this to be the best Spider-Man yet. I was very impressed with the inventive action scenes and applauded the way that Raimi allowed enough screen time to provide rounded back-stories to all the villains.<br/><br/>Topher Grace was excellent as the charmingly, cocksure photographer and I thought this was Maguire's best Spidey performance. This was the only Spidey film where he's been able to show such an emotional range to his character. His scenes where he struts down the street 'finger shooting' attractive women were genuinely funny as his confident, womanising scenes were totally believable.<br/><br/>I understand how the less exciting MJ or Aunt May scenes were needed to push the story along but they could have been a little more engaging. I couldn't help but smile as I noticed how people in the audience would wait for these scenes before dashing out to the toilet! Another gripe would be how the alien meteorite happened to (conveniently) land a few meters away from Peter Parker but as we're also being asked to believe a man made of sand, it can only register as a minor bugbear.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has rounded off the trilogy on a high with his imaginative action scenes and brave choice of sympathetic villains whilst recapturing the stomach churning, skyscraper swinging feeling that was missing from the second instalment. I take my hat off sir."
"TheHande","9","4","8","18 May 2007"," Notable improvement
","Having only seen the first one I can say for certain that Spider-Man 3 was a notable improvement. It finally takes on some of the traits more common with the comic-book and combines this with a plot that has both shades of comedy and tragedy.<br/><br/>Spider-Man still lacks his internal monologues, but his musings at the beginning and the end of the movie were still a nice addition. Also, the plot and its many sides are what make this movie superior to the first. We get an entire story-arc's worth of plot in one film, rather than having to buy anywhere between 2-20 issues of any Marvel comic book.<br/><br/>The film also gave me new respect for the Sand Man which I had previously considered to be one of the lamer villains in the Spider-Man roster. Harry's role is also wonderfully diverse this time and Eddie Brock also known as Venom is also very convincing.<br/><br/>Aside this the plot is very dark at times such as when Spider-Man begins to succumb to his darker side with his second encounter with Sandman. On the other hand great comedy is spread throughout, such as the kid in the Spider-kiss scene, Jameson's buzzer and better yet, Parker's ego-trip after exposing Brock.<br/><br/>The only slight point of criticism is probably that as a villain, Venom didn't get to shine a lot, but his story-arc was also handled extremely well so his ultimate fate was only minor hinderer to the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Also the ending was wonderfully whole."

I will definitely go and see it one more time on screen and when it is put out on DVD, it is Spiderman watching time. It is fun to watch all three in the same day on one of those really lazy days.

"fjel","9","4","8","6 May 2007"," Enough With The Negative!!!!
","This is NOT the ""worst comic book movie ever"". There is so much to enjoy here. The fight scenes are outstanding, but I was really surprised by how well everyone's acting was. Tobet Maguire with the black suit is really fun to watch, even when he's NOT playing Spiderman just because he's so full of himself and it's fun to watch. The villains are cast really well. Thomas Haden Church gives a very emotional performance as Sandman (who by the way has some of the best special effects I've seen). His performance is great as a villain who really doesn't like what he's done with his life and is just doing it to help the people he loves. James Franco shines as Harry Osbourne. He does of great job of switching from a good friend to Peter to a really good villain who shows us some of the creepiest sneers ever. Seriously, they are scary. It's not better than 2, but there's still a whole lot to enjoy here. People who hated this expected WAY too much non-stop Spidy, and it just isn't that kind of movie. If you see this movie, you can't spend the whole time thinking ""oh, when's Spidy gonna come"" because that will only shield you from what it is, which is a great movie with outstanding acting from EVERYONE, good humor, and some heart-wrenching scenes in addition to the very nice fight scenes, including a nicely done four-way fight at the end. Take it for what it is and enjoy."
"HeyKurtz","9","4","8","5 May 2007"," Best Spider-Man Yet!
","I really enjoyed ""3."" If you accept what these movies are--pure escapism not designed to tax your brain too heavily--you can't except a much better movie than ""Spider-Man 3."" The story was interesting, the acting was solid if unspectacular, the action scenes and special effects were about the best you'll ever see and the movie even delivered some laugh-out-loud comedy. Some have criticized the length of the movie, but it had no problem keeping me interested for the full 2 hours and 20 minutes. My wife and I took our 12- and 9-year-olds and it turned into a great family night at the movies.<br/><br/>I think the only people who will have problems with this movie--based on some of the comments I've read here--are comic book aficionados. For the rest of us, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a great ride."
"DarthPaul85","7","4","8","4 May 2007"," Not the best spider-man yet, but not bad...not bad.
","My top ranking: Spider-Man 1, Spider-Man 3, and then Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>I do want to commend the movie on navigating through some tough spots. First of all, tackling three major villains in one movie is a lot, but somehow the movie keeps it all under control. Second, some of the humor is the best in the series. Third, great action scenes (although arguably no better than Spider-Man 2's). Fourth (and this seems to be my unique opinion), I think the acting (as a whole) is the best in this movie.<br/><br/>But, there are a few things I just can't ignore. One, WHY did they have to try to do so much in one movie? While they definitely pull it off, Venom, Green Goblin, and even Sandman could carry an entire movie alone. There's definitely a lack of a ""main"" villain in this movie. It actually hurts a little to see Venom treated as a tacked-on villain.<br/><br/>Two, how do I describe it...a lack of satiety. For a 2 and a half hour movie, I still felt that there were some pieces missing. The movie was entertaining, but is THIS going to be the last one in the series? If so, all I can say is I'm not satisfied...I want more. Pardon me for sounding pretentious, but I feel like spider-man has not completed the emotional journey he starts in this movie. It's like the movie built up to a climax that doesn't quite happen.<br/><br/>Still, taken on its own the movie is definitely worth watching, entertaining, and funny. If nothing else, this movie does two things very well: Spider-Man's decent into darkness, and sympathizing for the Sandman.<br/><br/>7/10"
"rbangert","9","4","8","4 May 2007"," Spiderman 3-Very enjoyable!
","I must say that I really disagree with some mainstream movie critics in their tepid response to Spiderman 3. On the whole, it's a very engrossing, albeit complex story. Yes, the special effects and physical conflict scenes are terrific, but there's a good deal of humor, drama, interpersonal struggle, romance, and a commitment to principles peppered throughout. One of the best features of Spiderman 3 is its complex presentation of heroism--of sacrifice with regret, courage with fear, confrontation with cost, and of redemption after mistaken judgment. Spiderman is a hero not because of what he is but what he chooses to be, and he repeatedly discovers that being a hero is choosing to be decent when it would be more appealing to be simply powerful, popular, or selfish. Much of this is developed without special effects, in ordinary interactions among the characters. Critics of the movie seemed to want Peter Parker to be darker in his moments of failure. But Parker's awkwardness in trying to be ""cool"" is a great satire of the brooding adolescent. At first I thought it weak that Spiderman's two challengers never fully cooperated against their enemy, but even this seemed a useful contrast with the quality of Spidey's friendships. Yes, it takes a bit of mental work to make sense of several villains various motives and special abilities, but isn't that life? I'm surprised the critics couldn't keep up."
"keiichi73","4","4","8","4 May 2007"," My Spidey Sense should have warned me about this movie.
","Lord save me from the Idiot Plot! It's bad enough when it infests romantic comedies and thrillers, but when it starts to invade previously strong super hero film franchises, that's where I start getting annoyed. Spider-Man 3 is an overblown, overstuffed, joyless fiasco that is riddled with plot holes and character motivations and actions that make no sense at all. Series director Sam Raimi seems to have lost the confidence that guided the previous two films, and has given us an overly juvenile romantic melodrama broken up by over the top action sequences that are often soulless. <br/><br/>Young hero Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally starting to enjoy some success as his alter ego, Spider-Man. We can tell early on that success is starting to go to Parker's head, and so can his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). She's feeling left out, since Spider-Man pretty much dominates his life. Peter has plans to propose to Mary Jane, but there's never the opportunity to do so. It certainly doesn't help that there's a certain pretty young aspiring model named Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who seems to be attracted to both of Peter's identities. Because the movie is infected by the curse of the Idiot Plot, Peter never says anything, and keeps on letting things escalate out of his control. He even intentionally makes things worse by sharing a kiss with Gwen in public in front of Mary Jane. Why, you ask, would he do this when he's planning to propose to M.J.? Because if he didn't, there wouldn't be any reason for turmoil in the relationship. His actions answer solely to the plot.<br/><br/>Aside from the romantic melodrama, the web slinger has three different villains to contend with. Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), still is holding a grudge against him and has decided to follow in his crazy villain dad's footsteps, and is now zooming around the city as the New Goblin, hell-bent on killing Peter. There's also a convict on the run by the name of Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who, while on the run from the cops, unknowingly goes running into a massive science experiment and in the process gets his molecules rearranged and mixed with sand particles so that he can literally change his form into that of a hulking monster made of sand that kind of looks like King Kong crossed with kitty litter. Oh, did I forget to mention there's also a black blob-like substance from outer space that recently crashed nearby the city? This is tied into our third villain, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is a freelance photographer at Parker's day job at the Daily Bugle, and he's vying for a permanent position. When Parker humiliates him on the job, that's reason enough to drive the guy psycho. When he comes into contact with the alien substance, he's transformed into a black Spider-Man like monstrosity called Venom, who solely acts as a special effect for the film's climactic action sequence. <br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is so stuffed with plot, characters, and filler material (including an out of the blue musical dance number in a jazz club) that the movie can barely contain it all within its nearly two and a half hour length. Plot points and characters are introduced and dropped seemingly at whim. What made the previous Spider-Man films work is that they were much more intimate affairs. We were drawn into Peter's world, and the films mainly centered on a small group of characters. This time around, there's too many characters and too many story lines vying for our attention. Even long-standing memorable supporting characters are generally shafted, and seem to exist only because they were in the other movies. Peter's loving Aunt May pops up just long enough to spew out some Yoda-like fortune cookie advice to him in one or two scenes, and the comical blustering windbag boss as the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson is reduced to a mere forgettable cameo.<br/><br/>The action sequences have largely lost the personal touch that was found in the previous films as well. We are no longer watching characters we have come to be interested in doing battle, but merely a multi million dollar special effects reel. That's because the villains are the most forgettable bunch to ever grace a Spider-Man film. Flint Marko initially seems intriguing and a somewhat tortured villain, but as soon as he gets in that lab accident, he stops being human and spends most of the movie as a towering CG sand monster who rips through the city. We never get a chance to truly know him, since he completely disappears for a large chunk of the film, only to come back for the climactic showdown as the Stay Puff Sandman. Eddie Brock/Venom comes across even worse, as we never get a truly successful story for him, or a reason why he should even be there in the first place. The movie hints at a number of possible reasons for Brock to hate Peter/Spider-Man, but never elaborates on them. Like everything else, it is barely touched upon and comes and goes whenever the screenplay sees fit. <br/><br/>I'm not so delusional as to think this review will have any affect on the film's box office. Spider-Man 3 is certain to make a killing this weekend, and will probably go on to produce some big numbers. The question is, like all summer blockbusters, how will it be remembered? When all the hype, fast food promotions, and fanfare go away, you're forced to see the movie for what it really is. Spider-Man 3 has a lot of plots and special effects trying their hardest to prevent us from seeing just how hollow it really is at its center."
"LoganJSmith","2","4","8","4 May 2007"," Hands-down one of the worst films I've ever seen.
","Really, that about sums it up. VERY few things could redeem this film, one of which was the fact that my girlfriend paid for my ticket. It was almost as cheesy as the 90's Batman films... No, scratch that, it was almost as cheesy as the 60's Batman show. The action is great, but only because it's the most expensive film ever made. Literally. And did I mention there's even less comic continuity than in X-Men 3? <br/><br/>There are three different villains, and four if you count Peter Parker battling against his symbiote-controlled self. Is that really necessary? Each villain easily could have had its own movie, like the other two films. It seems like the producers, knowing what awesome potential it could have, tried to cram as much action and cameos and campy humor and touching love scenes and powerful self-realization moments... well, you get the picture.<br/><br/>One thing movie producers seem to be doing nowadays, and of which this dump-heap of a movie is a perfect example, is thinking that, since 'less is more,' then more will be super-more! Unfortunately, these people are still allowed to live and, even worse, make movies.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, if you really liked superhero films like Batman Begins , DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. If you really liked the Spider-Man comics and think the movie will have a similar story, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. If you're not too interested in superhero films and are just going for James Franco, maybe see this movie. But try to get someone else to pay."
"jonathanhigh5-1","8","4","8","4 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 Shows the Dark Side of the Web.....
","Spiderman 3 is a very interesting film. It's a great accomplishment in the way that it gets you thinking. Of course, it is complete fiction, but it relates to real life on a watered down level. Sam Raimi did successfully what Richard Donner mastered at in Superman the Movie. With just the right mix of humor and action, Spiderman 3 succeeds.<br/><br/>This movie is an experience, we go from seeing Spiderman be at the top of his game, to being tempted by evil, and finally to realizing his faults and starting over. Spiderman 3 gets you thinking as it allows you to see what temptation and the desire for revenge will do to a hero. Peter Parker turns to the dark side (excuse the Star Wars reference). He soaks himself in his greediness and acts in anger. This is a theme that has been repeated in so much literature and film but it is a true emotion. What is created in this film is a look at what happens when a hero is persuaded by the devil.<br/><br/>However, despite the apparent darkness Raimi provides comic relief so that people will be laughing anyway. Many people might take this as stupidity, but it is required otherwise this film would be a total drag. Honestly, if this film did not have comic relief, people would look at it as too dark. It is the balance of darkness and humor that gives this film its amazing feel. Unfortunately, there is not enough hours in the day to describe the emotions that this film evokes, but it is the central theme of love that can be taken away from this movie more than anything else."
"dean_is_cool","9","4","8","3 May 2007"," Stronger, faster, funnier, better!
","This film has it's flaws but it's the best ride so far. The themes of sacrifice, friendship, love and choice are all there as in the previous 2. However the value of forgiveness is a new one that shines through as the beating heart of the film. As well as what the posters and trailers suggest, ""the greatest battle lies within"".. No matter how hard things get we can choose to be on the right side of the war inside... Very inspiring stuff and it was actually these themes that for me lifted this film above the first two.<br/><br/>Mcguire shows his comedic side in this film and man, he's a funny guy. A lot of people seem to have a problem with Kirsten Dunst but I've always thought she's been great in the part and I thought she was again. Franco I think has the best part in the film. I wont spoil it for you but his performance is really terrific. The character development of the three main characters is all full. Church played Sandman really well, you felt for him. Topher Grace was good fun.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi is clearly a master of mixing comedy with action and drama and this movie is the quintessential bench mark of that. He's done a terrific job. My only reservation about this film is that Sandman's birth wasn't really explained much. Although perhaps thats because it's so far fetched it relies on us knowing so little to buy it. Although in the world of spider-man this can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Unless you've got a really good script Sony, don't make another one because this ends the story on a high. Though I do want to see Connors turn bad...."
"ninjagaiden007","8","4","8","3 May 2007"," It's nothing like the first two movies.
","I honestly don't know what to say. Good direction. Okay story. Fantastic effects and action. The story itself is getting pretty old. The whole love affair not working out with Peter and Mary Jane is getting rather old. Well, to me anyway. What I really liked about this movie is that we experience Peter's dark side. Like with Venom taking him over and Peter expressing his pain to all the people that have picked on him instead of Peter been the good, polite and generous hero Spider-Man. That's what I liked about this movie. We see Peter Parker as a brand new dark character. Sandman was pretty good. There was a huge secret about him killing Uncle Ben right at the end, but I wont spoil it. Harry as The Green Goblin was a good idea, if not predictable to see coming after watching the second one. Harry loses his memory after he tries to kill Parker, but it slowly grows back to what he has to do...KILL SPIDER-MAN. Venom was excellent. Only problem was he came in just after 100 mins of the movie. He's my favorite villain. I wanted to see more of him. But Venom was powerful, quick and awesome. He's in it in the last 20 mins. From 100-120 ins you'll see him on screen. But a pretty good movie...but the whole love affair between Peter and Mary Jane needs to be stopped and over with. It's getting too much. Other than that, pretty good movie. 8/10"
"jsanped","9","4","8","3 May 2007"," A Big Departure...
","Spider-man 3 was a big departure from the series, and especially from the whole comic book-movie genre.<br/><br/>From the beginning, they did an excellent job of recapping the entire series, hardly done by sequels. The music, as well, was different; it was a goodbye to the rock songs that fill up the entire soundtrack, as they relied on more of a score, and a very emotional one indeed.<br/><br/>This movie departed from the normal profile of a superhero movie, by adding the internal conflicts and emotional struggles, with a theme you can somewhat get out of a Paulo Coelho book. It showed a different side of Peter Parker (with some outrageous performances from Tobey Maguire), Harry Osborn and their friendship/rivalry (a much better acting job by James Franco, when I once thought his acting level was pretty much like Hayden Christensen; he didn't act like a rich brat in this one, but a more sensitive fellow), Mary Jane and their love story (coming from a superb script and acting), as well as a different kind of bad guy in Flint Marko - the Sandman. I think this is the first film I've seen with a not-so-bad-guy, a somewhat understandable ""villain."" <br/><br/>Topher Grace's performance as Venom was good, but it could have been much better. His character, Eddie Brock Jr., received a considerable amount of airtime, especially when leading to his becoming Venom. They developed his character somewhat, but I just think that the character could have ""grown"" more, as well as showing Venom to be as cool as some would have expected.<br/><br/>Something similar goes for Gwen Stacy, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, where her only ""big"" part was at the jazz bar. Oh well, what more can you make her do, when her character was actually supposed to have died by the hand of the Green Goblin somewhere during the first film, where Gwen, according to the comic, was held captive by the Green Goblin on top of a bridge, then Norman Osborn, or the Green Goblin, threw her off it. Spiderman was able to catch her with a web, but eventually realizing that Gwen was already dead, with her neck broken. It may have been an effect of falling on the web or suffered at the hands of the Green Goblin beforehand, but Peter blamed himself all the same.<br/><br/>Too bad they killed a main character off in a similar manner to another in the first movie, but at least this one had more meaning. Despite all the seemingly tragic moments in the film, it ends with a high note, a happy ending, albeit without a hint to a possible next film, as they did with the second. They could have made it a 3-hour movie or longer, but that's just me.<br/><br/>Overall, I guess they made the choice to make it something different, as I believe they did want this movie to be something bigger or better than the others. The choice makes us who we are, as Peter says in the end.<br/><br/>A very good job done by Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco, as well as the scriptwriters who actually put very valuable morals in a superhero film about love, choices, revenge and forgiveness."
"helmutty","8","4","8","2 May 2007"," Spider-man 3
","This is considered the best spider-man movie, the 1st spider-man movie was about the beginning, the growing, the 2nd movie was about, mostly touching our hearts, sad and lastly, the 3rd movie showed both of the types from the two movies which is good, the best spider-man movie. It has some great deal of actions and at the same time, it touches our hearts. The story followed Peter parker, spider-man, having some serious problems, he wanted to propose to Mary jane, his girlfriend but something got him and he did not propose, meantime, harry remembered his father's death and decided to take over his father and became the new goblin to kill Peter, not only that, sandman was also running away from the police which ended up that Peter knew him plus a freelancer, Eddie brock was out to get the job and ruined Peter's life and getting the job. Soon there was a blackish goo rise from outer space and needed a home so it mixed with Peter and transformed him into a new person, the bad and the cool side of him. There are so many things happening in a time. The fighting scenes are not so bad, more brutal than the last spider-man movies, the last fight scene is the best, you will get to see peter and harry teaming up together in order to fight with sandman and venom. You will get to see the long-awaited villain, venom which is cool but happened to appear in the last part of the movie only, only if the director had extended the last battle, it would have been good.<br/><br/>The story is good, the CG effects are cool, (it seemed that the director was well-trained) this movie is a must-watch movie for spider-man's fans but newcomers may be good with it. It is not like any action movies, it has the story for you to keep on."
"rogerdob","1","6","14","4 May 2007"," Where was the central plot?
","This was basically a plot less movie. Sure there were bad guys and bad things happen. There was some kind of love story going on (Kirsten Dunst was so annoying). There was some action (much less than there should have been). But what was the plot? I challenge anyone to explain what the movie was about in one sentence---it can't be done because there wasn't any plot. This movie was a total waste of time and money. The other things wrong was that it was too long (dosn't the director know that trimming a film is a good thing), the special effects looked like special effects (can you say green screen?), and Kirstin Dunst is annoying (Oh, I repeated myself!)"
"bob the moo","Null","5","11","31 May 2007"," Average multiplex stuff at best with weak writing and a frantic overuse of effects (spoilers)
","Revenge is a powerful and rarely a good one. For Peter Parker it is clearly something to be avoided as it has turned his former friend into his most deadly enemy. However Peter himself finds himself sucked into the web of revenge and violence as it emerges that the man who police now believe killed his uncle has just escaped. A simple feat to bring him to justice? Perhaps, but Flinto Marko has also stumbled into some sort of experiment and has been transformed into the Sandman. While battling these two foes, Parker finds a use for a black, symbiotic substance that has attached itself to his Spiderman suit, giving him great power. But is the power from this alien source as innocent as Parker hopes?<br/><br/>After seeing the third Pirates of the Caribbean films and being very disappointed and bored, I decided to keep my toe in the summer blockbuster pool (what choice do I have?) and see the third Spiderman film. Having been impressed by both of the other two Spiderman films I was quite disappointed to find an overly busy film that offered me very little apart from special effects. These were impressive as always but (as with Pirates) the ability to do so much on screen should not mean that so much has to be done. Sadly here the effects sequences are overly busy and frantic and it was hard to feel involved in the action or build a tension  in a way it was often little more than a swirling video game sequence.<br/><br/>The knock on of the effects is that the whole film does feel quite superficial  something to be expected to a point from a summer multiplex filler but not something that should be embraced in the way it is here. The most glaring issue is the volume of characters in the film because this causes so many other problems. Flow-wise each of these characters has to be introduced and mostly this is done by handy coincidence and lazy writing; eg Venom hits Earth just as Parker is in the woods and doesn't jump him until he happens to be in his Spiderman suit, or how, guess what, now Marko killed your Uncle, or Eddie Brock happening to be in the church where Venom leaves Parker etc. One of these is forgivable but there are so many of them that it reveals the whole thing to be build on easy narrative devices that lack sense. The writing problems continue in the way that the theme of revenge is dealt with; it could have been a real strong base for the action but instead it is very superficial with no meat on the bones; the killer for me being when Harry forgave Peter simply because his butler said ""oh yeah, forgot to mention, your Dad died of his own wounds  sorry for not mentioning it sooner"", at that point I nearly laughed out loud.<br/><br/>The lack of meat in the script but an abundance of characters also means that it flows at a basic level and a lot of the fun is gone. There are still some funny moments and JJ is still a great side character but it doesn't have the buzz and energy of the other films. The cast struggle with this as well. Maguire works at the same level as the script and his inner turmoil is just as superficial and seems to be switched on or off in each scene. It doesn't help that his ""evil"" look is that of a spotty emo in a mood with his parents but he can't find anything in himself to improve matters. Dunst and Franco are equally as basic and they act knowing that there are no ""real"" people on their pages, just cardboard cutouts. Church is rubbish for the same reason and his final scene was as bad as he was. Grace was a weird find but his fall to revenge was too quick and easy and it robbed his end of any meaning. Simmons can do no wrong for me and produces one of the funniest scenes, although another one belongs to another Campbell cameo who is wonderfully ""French"" in the background of one scene.<br/><br/>Overall then it probably has just about noise and popcorn appeal to pack them in and indeed it has broken opening weekend records in the US but this does not indicate a good film, which this certainly is not. With too much going it the potential is wasted and the ideas and themes are sketched rather than detailed. This knocks through into everything else and produces little more than a video game with cut sequences. Not terrible by any means but a massive drop in quality compared to the previous two films."
"redfox742","3","5","11","4 May 2007"," A stunning disappointment...
","I have been anticipating May, 2007 for a very, very long time. This month will see, amongst several other quality releases, a trio of tri-quels from series that have each already produced two excellent, hugely successful releases. The competitions for viewersand especially second-time viewerswill be huge. Analysts have placed their bets. Fan-boys and fan-girls are wetting their pants. Box office records will likely be shattered.<br/><br/>And it is amidst this level of hype that Spider-Man 3 swings onto the screen with a colossal thunk.<br/><br/>Our worst nightmare is confirmed: the curse of the tri-quel strikes again. Spider-Man 2 was superior to the first in nearly every way except earnings. The action scenes were cooler. The emotional scenes hit harder. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) came of age in spectacular fashion, descending through a dark valley of self-doubt and emerging to save the day, get the girl, and once again win our hearts.<br/><br/>In Spider-Man 3, Spidey again descends into darknessif ""darkness"" can be defined by bad hair, black eyeliner, and hitting on everything with a pulse within fifty feet of himself.<br/><br/>The convoluted, overstuffed, throw-everything-at-the-screen-and-hope-something-sticks plot goes something like this: When we last left our hero, he'd won the love of the fair Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and the gratitude of New York Citybut the hatred of his ex-buddy, disgruntled, alcoholic playboy Harry Osborn (James Franco).<br/><br/>In the film's best sequenceconveniently already made available on the InternetHarry dons his daddy's Goblin suit and goes out to butcher his ol' buddy Pete. The first sign that something is going terribly wrong is when this results in Harry contracting amnesia, forgetting everything he's spent the last two movies getting pent up. (Wait, amnesia? Is this a Sam Raimi film, or General Hospital?) Meanwhile, in a series of deus ex machina that boggles the mind, a meteor containing a strange black substance crashes to Earthapparently on the outskirts of New York, seemingly unnoticed by anyone (including Peter and MJ, not a hundred yards away). At the same time, escaped murderer and petty-crook-with-a-heart Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church, impersonating a plank of wood) falls into an absurdly low-security particle accelerator and gets sandblasted into the Sandman.<br/><br/>It's a superhero flickyou suspend your disbelief for this long. But then things just get silly. The black substance, it turns out, is symbiotic in nature, and it slowly begins to corrupt Spidey. Unfortunately, the ads lie. The black spider-suitfeatured in every posteris on screen for five minutes at most. Instead, director Raimi decides to focus on the slow degradation of Peter Parker's soulincluding the aforementioned eyeliner.<br/><br/>This leads to one of the most laughable middle portions ever committed to screen, and certainly the most laughable ever given a $300 million budget. As brilliant as Tobey Maguire is at playing sweet, dorky Peter Parker, he can't do ""evil"". (""Evil"" Tobey was last seen raping Cate Blanchett in The Good German, another utterly ludicrous flick.) In a memorable shot, ""dark"" Peter stands in front of a mirror andgaspdrops a black forelock over his face, bearing a sudden eerie resemblance to Pete Wentz. If you thought Spidey went emo in the second film, you ain't seen nothing' yet. Maguire leaves the mask off, instead pompously (and unconvincingly) strutting around Manhattan, shooting leers at the girls, and, like he just dropped in from Flashdance, busts out his moves across a nightclub bar.<br/><br/>Remember those couple very funny moments from Spider-Man 2the snooty usher, the goofy violinist, the creepy landlord's daughter? Raimi has seemingly decided that the best way for Spider-Man to match Shrek the Third at the box office is to take those foibles and use them for two-thirds of the film. While several of these gags are funny, their overuse means that when Spider-Man 3 tries to get serious, it completely falls apart and instead turns from being intentionally to unintentionally hilarious. An audience should not be giggling maniacally through a protagonist's deathbut they were in my theater.<br/><br/>There's some random stuff thrown in too, most of which doesn't work. MJ sings two musical numbers, which are dull and unnecessaryas is her two-minute omelet-making routine (what?) with Harry. The scenes with Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) have lost all emotional punch. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her father (James Cromwell) appear as unnecessary fan-service. The Sandman's action sequences are hit and miss. J.K. Simmons does manage to bring a little of the first two films back in yet another scene-stealing performance as Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>And then there's Venom (Topher Grace), also known as Peter's photographic rival Eddie Brock Jr.. If Venom had been saved for a fourth installment, given his own film a la the Green Goblin and Doc Ock, it would have likely been a thrilling success. Instead, Venom is an afterthought (the name ""Venom"" is actually never spoken in the film), appearing to inject a smidgen of life into the last segment of the film. Topher Grace plays the role with aplomb, easily overcoming his slight stature (Brock is heavyset and muscular in the comic series; this Venom seems to be inspired by the ""Ultimate"" continuity), and perfectly capturing the ordinary-guy-driven-to-hatred mentality. And he menaces a hundred times better than Maguire could dream of.<br/><br/>But Venom is in the film too briefly to ever use his legendary teethand the film itself has none. People were filing out of the theater well before the last shot, and the ones who remained were jeering derisively at the screen. Raimi and Maguire's canny evasion as to whether a fourth film is in the works now becomes clear. It's not a good thing when the most enjoyable part of an audience's night was the first two minutes of Fracture coming on by mistake.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Spider-Man 3 should spell the death of the series. Let's pray that Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End hold up better than this piece of cinematic garbage. C-minus."

","Who cannot enjoy a descent super-hero movie? Even though they are more common and their plots are often similar with no unique qualities, the Spiderman trilogy has not only been action-packed, but also has an in-depth plot behind it.<br/><br/>I admired the fact that the film had so many circumstances or situations that were identifiable for any individual. That just like anyone else, Peter Parker (a.k.a. Spiderman) had to face his own inner demons as well as the conflicting issues he had with many others such as his true love, Mary Jane Watson and his best friend, Harry Osborne.<br/><br/>Their's not much more I can say, because I don't want to reveal any key plots, but I encourage anyone to watch this film and enjoy it, for it was awesome, heroic cinema."
"bigben5","1","5","11","5 May 2007"," And I thought Catwoman was bad!!
","Catwoman may be a terrible movie ,but it is God compared to this load of crap...<br/><br/>Let's get this straight, there are two things fundamentally wrong with this film: A shallow plot that is devoid of all logic and the fact that they tried to cram about two hundred comic books into one movie. <br/><br/>For those of you who haven't seen Spiderman 3, it would be a good idea to park your brain at the door before stepping inside the theater. A lot of things simply make no sense and feel forced in order to get their point across. For example, I thought that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had already tied the knot given the way Spiderman 2 ended- at least it was implied that way. MJ leaves Harry standing at the altar in order to be with the man she truly loved - Peter- the dweeb she kept putting down until she realized it was him who was her Knight in Shining Armor all this time. But no, one innocent kiss on stage to another woman, causes MJ to throw a fit and suddenly they no longer love each other. Hello? Does that sound credible folks? Apparently Mary Jane feels very insecure, as him saving her LIFE twice in the previous films doesn't count as being loyal. Other examples of things not making sense, include Harry choosing to help Spiderman defeat Venom and Sandman after Peter nearly beat him to the brink of death. He threw a grenade at him that exploded one inch away from his face, permanently scarring him. Now for some reason he is still alive and easily forgives Pete, after his butler tells him that his father died by his own hand. Really? How did he figure that out? And if the old man figured it out then, why is he telling Harry now? Why wait until he starts killing people? Some people have tried to explain that the serum that Harry drank kept him alive, but if his father could easily die with two blades piercing his stomach, don't you think a grenade would have blown Harry's head to bits?<br/><br/>The second problem, as I mentioned before is the problem of cramming too many comic books into one movie. A lot of things simply feel under developed and rushed. In the comic book, Peter Parker gets under Eddie Brock's skin a number of times, breaking him to a point where he can't take it anymore, forcing him to seek revenge with the aid of the suit. In this movie all Peter has to do is prove that Eddie's photograph if Spiderman is a fake and apparently Eddie was dumb enough to bring the evidence along with him and lay it out on the table for Peter to find. Eddie loses his job and loses everything in a minute. They also tried with little success to make the Sandman a very tragic character, almost every time you seem him he is looking at a picture of his daughter and shedding tears. But it is never explained what his daughter is sick from nor why it costs all millions of dollars to cure her. Perhaps, it would be better to force a surgeon to perform surgery on her instead.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a lot of cheesy romance in this film that forces Peter and everyone else to cry every 10 minutes. The scene with Peter and Mary Jane crying at the bridge sent everyone in the theater roaring with laughter. It's so bad and felt so rushed that you have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>So was there anything good about this film? Well, sure, the cameo by Bruce Campbell. He was hilarious. Then again, they had to write a good part for him, otherwise he'd probably sue."

I know they are trying to appeal to a bigger audience, but don't forget about the fans that actually read the comics one SMALL detailed that would have made the Venom character bearable would have been if he used the word ""WE"" instead of ""I"" when referring to himself, any comic book fan knows what I mean.<br/><br/>Why add so many characters if the development of the characters are limited....<br/><br/>I could go but this comments box has a limit of 1000 words, and I don't want to be stop when I'm venting.<br/><br/>Worst movie ever, and hopefully Marvel will pick up the slack and make sure the studios are keeping somewhat true to what the TRUE writers intended for the characters."
"Diplodocus55","7","5","11","4 May 2007"," Has its moments, but overall disappointing...
","I expected this to be less entertaining than SPIDER-MAN 2, but I wasn't prepared to like it less than the original! This movie moves in fits and starts -- never reaching the delightful flow and magic of Part 2. I don't think the problem was too many subplots -- more that the wrong subplots were explored over the more compelling ones. For instance, why not spend more time on Sandman (maddeningly one-dimensional) and Venom (a wickedly-cool creation that seems to be only on screen for a couple minutes total)? Instead, we spend most of the time on Peter/MJ's relationship problems (who cares!). Another element that really bugged me was that we rarely saw the superheroes and villains the way they should be seen (in their glorious superhero garb). We seem to see more of Peter Parker in action sequences rather than Spidey. And when he is in Spidey-gear, he usually has his mask off (as if Tobey Maquire had a stipulation in his contract that demanded more face time). The Venom fights would deflate fast when the creature's ""mask"" continually pulled back to reveal Topher Grace's mug. In fact, there were hardly any lingering ""money"" shots of Venom. The New Goblin costume was way uninspired (why not go for one of the ol' actual goblin face masks?). And the look of Thomas H. Church as classic Sandman was terrific except that the filmmakers decided to instead show him more as a King Kong-like sand-beast (like one of those brainless giant trolls from the Lord of the Rings movies). I was also confused as to the physics of Sandman -- he is malleable and can shape his body into any form he wants, yet he seems to get ""hurt"" when shot by a bullets? And since when does the chief of police call in a family to personally tell them the real killer of their loved one is still on the loose? Also, there was something very unlikable about Aunt May in this film. All that being said, I would still not call this a ""bad"" movie. But pretty disappointing seeing as that all the elements for a kick arse superhero movie were there. And for all this talk about this being the ""dark"" Spider-man movie--it was actually more kindergarten-friendly than either of the 1st 2."

It actually made me frustrated because it was just so corny. And don't get me started on the Emo Saturday Night Fever/Anchorman Jazz club nonsense.<br/><br/>The real problem with this movie isn't quality so much as potential.

And thankfully, the film did not disappoint as much as I was lead to believe in the days leading up to it.<br/><br/>The rumours are true. There is a hell of a lot going on in Spider-Man 3. So much so, that a quick synopsis will not do it justice. But in essence, much like the first two films, the third film is about Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) struggle to juggle his personal life, his love life with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and his life as Spider-Man. Thrown into the mix this time are two villains: Flint Marko aka Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an ex-con looking for the money to save his ailing daughter, and Eddie Brock aka Venom (Topher Grace), a rival photographer just looking to move up the ladder.<br/><br/>And of course, they also have Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), Peter's scheming friend Harry (James Franco) and another female love interest, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard).<br/><br/>While it is heavy on plot and even heavier on story, it is held together fairly well. Despite clocking in at one-hundred and forty minutes, the majority of the film moves at break-neck speeds, rarely slowing down at all. There is a lot of emphasis on Peter, and his slow brooding ego-centrism, but there was a surprising amount of material for the supporting characters too. Franco's character is really well shown, and his motivations are felt throughout. His scheming tendencies are put to good use finally (and not just nudged at like in the previous film), and really helps to flesh out his character. Much the same can be said for Dunst, who is probably the most evolved of any of the characters. Church and Grace's story lines are done fairly well, although I wish they both had a bit more material to help flesh them out even further. Howard's character, while being a bit of an anomaly for comic fans, is not too bad, but she sadly is the most underwritten of anyone in the main cast.<br/><br/>If anything can be said against the story, it is that they play up Peter's ego a bit too much. I understand that it is the central core to the film, but some of his most ego-centric scenes are played off more so for laughs than anything. I liked them, but they could have done with a lot more dramatic flair.<br/><br/>The same goes for the dialogue. I laughed a lot, and I enjoyed his smart-ass quips, but when the real emotionally wrenching stuff comes, I still felt a bit of an urge to laugh. It is very true to the language of a comic, but it could have done with a bit of beefing up with how serious it had to be. Some of these sequences are downright heartbreaking, and having the characters just rhyme off comic book dialogue can only go so far for so long. I will say though, it did not help that I had a running commentary going on behind me, making a joke out of just about anything dramatic the characters were saying. But if it was that easy for them, then clearly something needed to be fixed.<br/><br/>But even with saying that, the acting is not ruined. It actually is the strongest of the series. Maguire is at his absolute best, playing the conflicted web-slinger. Even the slightest touch of evil from him feels magnificent. If anyone was not convinced before that this was the best choice for Peter Parker, they will after seeing this movie. Dunst and Franco are both excellent, and bring a lot of previously unseen maturity to the franchise. They work wonderfully against Maguire. Church is great as always, and Grace is pitch-perfect. I was absolutely awestruck by just how good his performance was. Smaller roles from series regulars like Harris, J.K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks, Dylan Baker and Ted Raimi are all done with just the right amount of finesse, and cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell are more than applause-worthy.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film does not skimp out on the action, or the special effects. With a mostly fast-paced runtime, the film weaves itself in and out of impressive action sequences that slowly become greater in both the stakes at hand, and the intensity of the scene. And even the smallest fight scene tops anything done in the previous two films. They are choreographed wonderfully, and are captured even better. The effects are really in high gear here, and never is a scene left looking too choppy or fake. Even the most ridiculous of sequences has great CGI. They are outstanding in every sense of the word, and are not easily going to be topped. The transformation of Sandman is a particular standout, as Church is blended beautifully into the sand in one fluid motion, leaving the audience wondering if the scene was actually real or not. It is unbelievably well done, and is one of the key highlights of the film.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 was an ambitious project that could have been a complete disaster. But thankfully, despite a few blemishes, the film delivers and sets the bar for future comic book films to come. The acting is top-notch, and the effects are above and beyond superb. If this is how the summer of 2007 is going to begin, I can only hope that the rest of the films coming can live up to this one.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"chickapee87","3","5","11","4 May 2007"," Bad
","Of all the Spider-Man movies this was the worst. The first problem is that you can't tell a good story with three villains. The second problem the director could not decide whether it was a drama, comedy, or a action so instead of actual picking one he just throw them all into the movie. The third problem is that they try to place some moral on each of the villains. Both the Sandman and the Hobgoblin story lines went nowhere, and the Sandman was an entirely useless character. Honestly. I just don't know what happened the movie was just so predictable, also both the writing and acting were sub par. The special effects were of course good, overall it was entertaining but I would rather watch Snoop Dog's Hood of Horrors then having to dig myself out of all those cheesy lines."

","I won't recapitulate the same things that other people seemed to not like about the movie but one thing no one seems to be mentioning, the dancing! Seriously, how horribly bad is the scene in the jazz club? It was so ridiculously out of place and they EASILY could have come up with a more believable way to make Peter into an asshole. I wasn't all that thrilled with the movie to begin with but once I saw that scene I might as well have walked out.<br/><br/>And two and a half hours?! They could've made 3 decent movies out of those 3 villains and made each one a normal length. Why they decided to fill in as many characters as possible and give them all a whopping 10 minutes of background is beyond me. These are comic book characters, they're hard to make believable in the first place. You really need to give a character like that some depth for an audience to not want to ridicule them."

","This movie was completely hyped up and makes spider-man 1 and 2 actually more watchable. Sure the fights between harry and spidey were hot but the entire movie process was an endurance contest I saw this in Manhattan and everyone who walked out of the midnight preview was laughing. Almost as bad as X-Men 3. The best Villains were given their powers and then destroyed the next day. I feel ""Lucased."" Ridiculous amount of hype for a year and watching it you couldn't help but think they took some elements from batman begins to go darker but then they mixed in their emotional B.S. way too much. Venom never really succeeds as a great villain like hes supposed to. Gwen Stacey is forced into the movie and then quickly dismissed mid-movie. You don't even need to see the movie because the best scenes were in the trailer. Oh and lets not forget Peter Parker dancing on the streets and wasting my time with his moves. Dr. Connor's story arc is never followed up and I can go on and on. Like why did they bring in the astronaut in part 2 and not 3 to bring back the symbiot. Anyway you can wait for this one on DVD Def. not worth my 10 bucks."
"MiddleOfNowhere","5","5","11","3 May 2007"," 250 million dollars, but no more magic.
","Spider-Man 3 shows that not everything can be improved simply by throwing a lot of money at it. This movie may have cost 250 million dollars, it has lots of villains, pretty girls, special FX and twists, but it is - sadly - lacking a heart.<br/><br/>Before blowing off steam, I have to say that I *wanted* to like this movie - probably more than any other coming out this year. I watched the first two Spider-Man movies several times and bought the DVDs. Especially Spider-Man 2 was a perfect blend of all the ingredients people want to see in a mainstream action/super-hero movie: A good script, good acting, good chemistry between the lead characters and great special effects. When I saw the trailers for the third movie, I had my hopes up high. Everything seemed to be in place both for the hardcore comic fan and the mainstream audience.<br/><br/>But the result of all the hard work that undoubtedly went into this movie - with the exception of the script, which tries to please too many people without risking anything - simply isn't working.<br/><br/>The characters that were as interesting, believable and vivid as comic characters can be in Spider-Man 1 and 2 now are cardboard figures. The magic between the main characters is gone; both the love affair between Peter and M.J. and the friendship/antagonism between Spidey and the New Goblin seem forced (also, James Franco should be nominated for a Razzie Award - his ""acting"" is even below the level George Lucas would have found acceptable for one of his CGI-saturated space westerns).<br/><br/>Also, it is sad to see that both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire now come off as one-trick ponies: the slightly melancholic, cute girl next door and the nerd with the shy smile, both obviously a bit weary of each other and their lives, losing focus and (almost) each other. Yes, there are the obligatory damsel-in-distress and the dying-bad-guy-realizing-the-error-of-his-ways sequences, but what worked brilliantly two times now has the sour smell of a cheap cliché.<br/><br/>Also, the comedy bits seem forced, especially the scenes at the Daily Bugle and Peter Parker's James Brown impression - they might be amusing for seven year old kids, but do not work as part of a movie with this budget and target audience.<br/><br/>Looking back, a cynic might say that Spider-Man 1 and 2 were essentially the same movie: The young hero faces challenges, has to take responsibilities and sees sympathetic father figures (first Norman Osborn, then Dr. Otto Octavius) turn into mad wizards. But it doesn't matter: They both were *good* movies. The conflicts and challenges seemed plausible. As a guy, you empathize with Peter Parker, you see the mess he is in and want him to succeed. And in the end, you know that the girl saying ""Go get 'em, Tiger"" was worth everything he/you ever had to endure.<br/><br/>In Spider-Man 3, these conflicts and their solutions are presented in an annoying ""in-your-face"" style: Save the ""right"" girl (red-haired singer/actress) instead of the blonde Barbie, and you will be rewarded. Forgive your friend (who tried to kill you several times), overcome your anger (symbolized/amplified by a symbiont), forgive your enemies ... when Spider-Man meets Sandman after the grand finale, about the only thing missing from their respective ""Yeah, I've done bad things, but I didn't mean to"" speeches is hugging each other.<br/><br/>Come on - I understand the positive message you are presenting here in a not-so-subtle way, but this isn't group therapy.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but Spider-Man 3 looks like ""creativity by committee"" - a big budgets, lots of ideas, but the heart and soul of the franchise is lost.<br/><br/>This is not a bad movie, so I'm giving it a 5 out of 10 rating.<br/><br/>It just could have been so much more."
"singwaileung-1","5","5","11","3 May 2007"," My feet has never smelt as cheesy
","'Go get 'em tiger' - you just couldn't have asked for a cheesier line than what we all got with one that closed off Spiderman 2. The cheese sadly didn't end there as out came Spiderman 3. The cheese of the friendship between Peter and Harry ""Hey there buddy. Go get them buddy!"" ""Hey pal. They are my best friends, I would do anything for them."" Oh god! One can only take so much! I will keep my review short. Over all, what keeps the film alive are, as you would expect, the action and sfx. They are at their usual top notch quality. I'm not a great fan of over the top sfx, but that is what these Marvel films are about, so credit has to go to where its due. The characters, even Peter Parker, do not give the viewers enough to care for. The series of sub plots just creates a mini soap opera, that can become rather over bearing. By doing all they can to cram all of these characters into one film just doesn't give them enough depth. Why not save certain characters for a part four? I'm sure fan's wouldn't mind a fourth outing - it doesn't have to end on a trilogy. Anyway, I shall leave you all to judge for yourselves whether you like this film or not. I wasn't greatly impressed, often feeling annoyed, and my attention on other things other than the film itself.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to a 4th in the series, but after 3, I think I've had enough."

The only problem is they went through the storyline awfully fast. I like to savor some of the details, and that was a bit lacking in the movie. They were cramming a lot of information into 2.5 hours after all. Sandman is actually an interesting villain.

"borneobrian","6","2","3","12 February 2019"," An ""OK"" film
","It is pretty understandable what this movie is trying to do: be a good movie. But unfortunately, it suffers from a lot of studio interference. The studio wanted to tangle a lot in this movie with the love triangle between Peter, M.J, and Harry, the goblin story arc for Harry, and dealing with a new villain, but they shoved too much into it and made it less enjoyable as we would've liked it. Here are a list of some of the problems
1. Too many villains
Sam Raimi originally just wanted to have Harry as the villain and Vulture as a side villain. The studio made him cut Vulture and replaced him with Sand-Man and sadly went further by forcing Raimi to add Venom as a 3rd villain. All this does is makes it very hard to follow 3 bad guy's stories at once.<br/><br/>2. Bringing in 2 love triangles
In this film, the add Gwen Stacy to the mix to get another love triangle going with Peter and M.j. This is unnecessary and underdeveloped as well as time lengthening. Peter's triangle with Harry is fine. Any more is just time consuming.<br/><br/>3. Revisiting Uncle Ben
In this film, it is revealed that Sandman is the real murder of Uncle Ben, causing Peter to seek revenge on his death AGAIN. Peter had just gotten over his death and moved on. This just takes all development away from his character<br/><br/>4. The message<br/><br/>The movie's message is forgiveness, but the way they do it is very phoned in and not very looked upon. The movie barely shows any reason to be interested in this topic<br/><br/>5. The symbiote
In the comics, the symbiote is a type of black alien material that turns the user into a black costumed figure, but also makes them evil. This was the purpose for black spiderman and Venom. The symbiote in the movie does have both these characters happen, but in campy ways, When Peter has the suit on, he does good with the black spider scenes, but for the civilian scenes, he is pretty much a annoying jerk who dances randomly for no reason instead of acting more aggressive like in the comics. When Venom has the suit on, he looks and says nothing like the comics. He's skinny, annoying, doesn't have his echoing Venom voice and doesn't refer to himself as ""we""<br/><br/>On the positive note, this film does have interesting performances by Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church and has a few good moments and fight scenes and an excellent score. SO if you want to watch it, go ahead. Enjoy"
"bservice-56423","8","2","3","25 October 2018"," Not as bad.
","The dancing matches the goofy themes of the 3 movies along with the cheesy fun acting.
They handled venom poorly but the rest is brilliant, the best part is harry fighting peter ( both times) as the first time it shows peters control and patience with harry were when he's under venoms influence he's brutal and violent and really cocky.<br/><br/>
My other problem is not with the movie but the audiences sayings its really bad, I went into this thinking ""Oh no people hate this I'm going to hate Tobey now"" but came out of it doing the street dance people hate it because venom was off and 'cringe dances' that come from a nerdy kid with high confidence.<br/><br/>

","When Marvel Studios were finally allowed some control over their most bankable character Spider-Man with just enough time to fit him into Captain America: Civil War, even the most die-hard superhero obsessives had grown tired of the adventures of Peter Parker and his red-suited alter-ego. When Tom Holland's definitive incarnation eventually graced the screen in a glorious extended cameo, it suddenly all made sense. Sony, who still held onto the rights but agreed to share with Marvel and allow him into their universe, simply didn't know what to do with him. They were on a roll with Sam Raimi's horror-inflected vision, which placed character above action and made Parker an underdog you could really root for. But the studio wanted more, and forced Raimi to shoe-horn in a fan-favourite villain at the expense of what was so great about this series. The worst part is that they did it again just seven years later with their Andrew Garfield-led reboot.<br/><br/>The villain the studio demanded was Venom, the razor-toothed, lizard-tongued alien symbiote who attaches itself to Spider-Man and improves his powers, while turning him into a dancing, floppy-haired douchebag at the same time. But Venom isn't the only Spidey foe appearing, for we also have a new Green Goblin, played by a returning James Franco, and Flint Marko, aka the Sandman, played by an incredibly bored-looking Thomas Haden Church. The evolution of Franco's Harry Obsorn has been set up from the very start, so his emergence as his father's successor to don the goblin mask and wreak havoc for our friendly neighbourhood web-spinner should feel natural and well-timed, until he is hit on the head and develops amnesia. With so much already going on, it feels like both an unnecessary step back in the story and sheer lazy writing. We are also given Marko's backstory, and it turns out the lug-headed escaped con was the man really responsible for Uncle Ben's death, which paves the way for more of Tobey Maguire's constipation face during his quiet time with Aunt May (Rosemary Harris).<br/><br/>There's simply too much going on, and when the film allows the pace to slow enough to spend some quality time with its central character, it turns out that Peter has turned into such an insufferable narcissist that we can't wait to get away from him. But, if you've seen the film, you'll know that's not the worst of it. The black alien goo arrives from space without explanation, and just so happens to land nearest to Peter Parker. The posters teased the darker side of Spider-Man, but what we got was spontaneous dancing, winking at girls in the street, and not listening to Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) acting career troubles. I remember hiding behind my hands back in 2007 during the now-infamous dance sequence, and it hasn't improved with age. I've never uttered the words ""I just want it to stop"" out loud during a movie before, not until I saw Spider-Man 3 for the second time anyway. But it doesn't stop, not for what feels like another two hours, squeezing in Eddie Brock's (Topher Grace) transformation from slimy, unethical photographer into the vengeful Venom, and forging alliances that come out of nothing. As the wasted Kirsten Dunst screams as she hangs from an alien web at the climax, you'll be thinking that everybody involved is so much better than this, and they were, just three years earlier."
"jimbo-53-186511","2","2","3","1 August 2017"," What the bloody hell was this????
","After an excellent first Spider-man film and a reasonable follow-up it's hard to believe that this third film in the franchise could possibly be as bad as this. I mean seriously what were Raimi & co thinking here??? <br/><br/>In the first two films, Spider-man had some decency and likability about him and despite the fact that I still felt that he originally donned the costume out of guilt for what happened to his uncle I could always find myself rooting for him and cheering him on, but not so here...<br/><br/>For unknown reasons, some black gunky substance has arrived on Planet Earth. Where did it come from? How did it arrive? Nobody knows as it's never explained. This gunky black matter then wraps itself round Peter Parker after stalking him for quite some time and alters his personality; we get some lame hypothesis stating that it alters one's personality and makes them more aggressive, but how does it do this exactly?? <br/><br/>I'm aware that different plot elements will be introduced into franchises from time to time, but in order for these additional elements to sit well with an audience we need to have an understanding of why said elements are introduced? The fact that we have no understanding of what this black gunky matter is, Who sent it and where it came from meant that it was just there to reignite Parker's identity crisis and to give him another reason to fall out with Mary Jane.. Only this time he is much more cruel and even hits her at one point... Seriously, this is a guy that we're supposed to continue to root for??<br/><br/>Other nonsensical elements come later in the film when the black gunky matter moves from Peter Parker onto Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and he now finds his personality altered, but worse than that when he is encased in this black gunky stuff he is also able to create webs?? How does that work? Wouldn't he have needed to have been bitten by a spider to create webs?<br/><br/>In this third film, we're introduced to Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) a man whom escapes from prison and goes on the run. Whilst escaping from the police, he climbs a fence (surely a top secret facility would have a fence that was either alarmed or electrified??) and ends up in a secret research facility which in the dead of night has no security lights, no guards, no cameras and nothing preventing you from falling down a giant hole into some kind of particle testing device. As a result of this, Marko ends up fusing with the sand at the bottom of the hole and becomes The Sandman; the idea that he becomes The Sandman as a result of a series of unlikely contrivances is merely the tip of the iceberg and it turns out that Marko was actually the guy that killed Peter Parker's uncle giving Parker additional motivation to bring The Sandman down..<br/><br/>Then finally we have Harry Osborn who is still ticked off that Spider-man killed his dad and out of nowhere he gets hold of his dad's surfboard and starts chasing Spider-man all over the place until Harry bangs his head and gets amnesia and doesn't remember what happened prior to his accident? Quite why the narrative was written in this manner is a mystery to me as from this point on till much later in the film Osborn just wonders round being nice to everyone and genuinely not doing much till he inevitably regains his memory... it's just a waste of screen time!!!<br/><br/>I gave up trying to understand all the ridiculous narrative choices that were made in this over-plotted and overwritten mess and just waited for it to end. The fact that nothing is explained and that things seem to happen for no apparent reason just goes to show that the filmmakers had made enough money from the first two films and stopped caring what the public wanted. It's painfully dull with none of the likability or fun that it's predecessors offered - in fact the only thing that was better about this film than the previous offerings were the special effects.<br/><br/>The one bright spot in this film was JK Simmons who was consistently good in all 3 films and that's the reason that this film is getting 2 stars rather than 1."
"zkonedog","9","2","3","12 March 2017"," The Best Of The Bunch
","While watching the first two Spiderman films, I was impressed by a few things but also turned off by some as well. I loved the action scenes and the sly little references to the Peter Parker/Spiderman duel identity, but was never really drawn into the Parker-Mary Jane romance or the development (or lack thereof of villains Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus).<br/><br/>Thus, in stark contrast to most reviewers, I considered Spiderman 3 to be the best of the bunch due to a focus on even more action, plus better acting by Tobey Maguire as Parker/Spidey. While still progressing the Peter/MJ relationship that screenwriters Miles Millar and Al Gough pretty much ruined in the second film, those scenes take a back seat to Spidey's struggles to fend off three new villains: Hob-Goblin, Sandman, and Venom.<br/><br/>With the exception of Parker's friend Harry's Hob-Goblin, which got the short shrift of screen time, I considered both the other villains to be much more interesting than any previous ones. Sandman actually had some character development that made him a true enemy of Parker, while Venom is probably the most interesting element of the entire Spiderman cannon.<br/><br/>Besides that focus on action, though, was a much better performance by Maguire. Likely do to the very interesting changes he undergoes while battling with Venom, Maguire is able to emote much more wildly/effectively than in the previous movies (where a wide-eyed stare was about all that ever happened). I especially the scene in which Parker, under the full control of Venom, takes a night out on the town...hilarious!<br/><br/>Thus, since I was never really drawn into the relationships/drama of the Spiderman franchise in the first place, I rate this film a cut above the rest for its focus on more action/fight scenes. I can say with confidence that it did NOT kill the film franchise as many other reviewers are suggesting."

","As a 28 year old man I watched the Spider-Man franchise in full for the first time. Never having seen Spider-Man 3 at all, and hearing what I heard, I wasn't optimistic. There were accurate comments, and others who were unrealistic with their reviews. This movie had a fantastic base plot. Topher Grace is a huge pussy but, hey, so is Toby Maguire. So if you can get past the worst dance in movie history, this was a valid addition to the trilogy. Some of the CGI was questionable, I blame the saturation of characters. Too many people with too much maintenance, leaving major story arcs left most untouched. I just got a major feeling of deja vu from seeing the Batman franchise crash and burn after Batman & Robin. With Spider-Man 3 being far less of an atrocity there was still plenty of room for a Spider-Man 4. Now with Spidey joining the cinematic universe hopefully they can finally get it right."

Personally I would say that spiderman 3 is the best spiderman of all and even with the release of a new film out recently, although not having seen it I would still say spiderman 3 will always been the best it is a true masterpiece and had me from giggles to tears and even to the edge of my seat. Another character I was moved by was the acting from his aunt which really made me feel for the character and the loss of her husband. This movie is one of the classics and Toby McGuire is the future of acting, although he now has some competition with actors such as joe lo Trujillo. Venom wasn't a very good addition but I'm sure many other fans such as myself enjoyed sandmans role within spiderman though it wasn't shown much, I'm hoping they make a prequel or a new film about sandman."

It felt as if the storyboard writers wanted to make a mockery of a superhero so why not the nerdy, insecure male character. Without a doubt, awful. There are some good parts and some characters evolve in this film, but overall don't bother watching unless you're going to do a Science Mystery Theater night with friends.

I'll address the hate geared towards this movie, right now.<br/><br/>1. Venom.<br/><br/>With all the hype geared towards this movie because of Venom, Spidey fans looked forward to it immensely. But for some reason, they only hated this movie because of VENOM. Venom got enough screen time for an amazing final battle, and it fit in with the GREAT plot for this movie. Topher Grace worked out for ten months to play Venom, and made a great Eddie Brock. He was small?! Venom was the villain that almost killed Spiderman in the trilogy. Venom was more realistic than a full CG Venom would have.BAM!!! Ignorance.... HEADSHOT!!!<br/><br/>2. The EMO PETE Sequence.<br/><br/>Seriously?!!

New Goblin.<br/><br/>OK. Final hate reason. The New Goblin was Harry Osborne, as you know. And WHY is the COSTUME a reason to hate the New Goblin? The old costume would have looked corny as hell in this movie. He looked COOL. And just like Venom, the whole amnesia thing fit in with the plot brilliantly. BAOOOM!!!! IGNORANCE HEADSHOT!!!!!<br/><br/>In short, Spiderman 3 isn't as good as the first two, but it's a great special effects masterpiece. Truly enjoyable."

","The movie was amazing, I loved every bit of this movie, the actions, the special effects, the romance, what else isn't there to make an amazing film for billions of viewers? I mean right when Eddie was taken over by the creature(black web stuff)I was so scared when he lifted his head off the floor that I nearly fainted. But the villains were so amazing and the effects and costumes on them had really fit their images and personality within this film.<br/><br/>But when that stuff(black web)had taken over Peter's personality I knew that he was going to start doing crimes or something really bad in this film but I didn't know he would've hit Mary Jane the one he truly loved and was really close to, I mean come on Peter loves her why couldn't he just tell her that and kissed her for that?<br/><br/>But when Eddie/Venom was fighting off Spider-man I figured that he would die right then and there but thank goodness that Harry(new goblin and peter's best friend)came in to save the day but I cried when he had sacrificed himself to save his friend but I hate that he had died right there in front of his friends who cared about him and loved him. <br/><br/>Overall best action film of this year I hope that there will be a sequel not a reboot, those are always bad for the public who love Spider-man due to the lack of special-effects in the film."

","Spider-Man 3 is a very good film but not as good as the first two. This film became less action but more of a romance movie. There is still plenty of action and extravagant special effects but there was more romance in here than my liking. But the villains make up for the that fact.<br/><br/>Peter parker returns again as Spidey and he is forced to face a few more villains then he expected. He has to deal with Venom, the Sandman, Harry, and even himself.<br/><br/>The acting is decent once again. I think this is Tobey's best movie. He really proved himself this time. Kirsten is still great to look at. I wish that James Cromwell had more screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good film but one step down than its predecessors. I rate this film 9/10."
"lucianomarzo92","6","2","3","16 October 2009"," Pretty Good
","I have seen this movie three times. Once in theaters, once while home alone, and once in English. Spiderman 3 is very entertaining, but is also a very good movie overall. It think it is better than the 2nd and almost as good as the first. I enjoyed both of the first two Spiderman movies. But, I find this one to be the better somehow, because it is more developed, and has more memorable characters. Let's face it though, sequels often go in completely different directions from the original. They sometimes are so different, that they have lost the charm the first one(s) had. I think this is true with Shrek 2, and the new Indiana Jones movie. Spiderman 3 does go in a much different direction from the first two, but it does so skillfully.<br/><br/>In Spiderman 3, Pete is taken over by an evil substance. This substance turns turns his Spiderman suit black. It also changes Pete. It makes Pete more agile than he was before. Whenever he wears the suit, he is taken over by the same evil that compels his enemies. These are the enemies that he has risked his life, and his identity, to ward off. However, Pete embraces this new personality that the suit gives him. It makes him ""feel good"". He realizes it has taken over him though, and in a few times in the movie tries to fights it off. This suit gives Pete the perspective of his enemies. It's as if he is now in their shoes.<br/><br/>This is all very plausible, as Spiderman is human. This movie is a reminder of that: Superheroes may have supernatural powers, but they still go through the same things humans do. Pete has a lot on his mind, besides the fact that the safety of the town is in his hands. He has to go to school, he has a job to go to, and he has a girlfriend. He experiences problems much like those of the audience. (How many of you have to jump in the air to save a crashing airplane once a week?) I actually like what I have seen of Superman, but the Spiderman movies have more emotional depth.<br/><br/>There is also a greater distinction between Peter Parker, and Spiderman, than the two characters in any other superhero movie (like Clark Kent and Superman). Superman doesn't wear a mask, so when he flies around, everyone can see his face. He turns into superman, by taking off his glasses and clothes, exposing the superman suit. How come no one ever makes the connection? There is not only more of a distinction in appearance, in Spiderman, but also in personality. Spiderman is wild, graceful, and glorious. Peter is awkward and nerdy. They are really opposites, and it's easy to see why no one would make the connection.<br/><br/>One thing I have always liked about Spiderman is that it doesn't dwell on its genre. The plot of the average superhero movie revolves around the conflicts between the Superhero and the villain he/she is fighting. In this Spiderman, much of the conflict lies within Peter Parker, and the conflicts between him and his best friend, Harry. In Spiderman one, Pete is forced to fight Harry's dad, the Green Goblin. The Green Goblin ends up dying, and Harry is led to believe Spiderman did it. He then wants to kill Spiderman. Harry does not know Pete's true identity though. So he still loves Pete, but hates Spiderman. When Harry finds out that Pete is really Spiderman, he is shocked. In Spiderman 3, he decides that he wants to kill Spiderman, even if it means killing his friend. All of these concepts deal with Trust, Loyalty, Betrayal, and Friendship. It is the rare superhero movie that possesses these, which is what makes the Spiderman movies so special. I would recommend Spiderman 3 to any superhero fan. It proves to be a worthy sequel."
"zurnderrick","8","2","3","30 September 2009"," Venom at last!
","Spider-Man 3 is the worst Spider-Man film as of right now, but it's not all entirely too bad. I thought it was better than other super-hero films like Hulk, Daredevil, and that vile Batman and Robin, but the pace of the film and the many plots makes it out to be the black sheep of the series.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed the special effects,particularly the scene where Flint Marko becomes the Sandman, and the end battle between Spider-Man, New Goblin, Sandman and Venom was the highlight of the film. Also, Spider-Man gets coded in a black alien, causing him to lash out in evil. I wish they would have come up with the proper design for the black costume, instead of making it his classic costume in black.<br/><br/>Venom makes his villainous debut in this film, and despite him having very little screen time, he was pretty cool. Topher Grace did a great job portraying the character of Eddie Brock. I also enjoyed James Franco as Harry Osbourne, or the New Goblin. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman was also okay, but I was one of them people that thought that he shouldn't have been in the film. Also, how does he cry? In the end, Spider-Man is an awesome movie, but I wasn't as good as the first 2, and Spider-Man didn't seem to have all the spotlight anymore, for most of it went to the villains. But I can't wait to see what Spider-Man 4 will give us, keep on bringing the sequels Raimi!"
"gigan-92","6","2","3","24 September 2009"," All Good Things Must Come To An End
","Why must all good things come to an end? After two very successful films, Sam Raimi obviously goes for a third, but the result is a little less than expected. Normally in this kind of situation, the trilogy situation, it is a new director that changes the film so much the third seems like a piece of trash compared to the first two. However, it is the same director for all three, so I guess Raimi just lost his touch. One thing I want to say right off the bat is the lack of Danny Elfman is unacceptable! I don't give a &*^% who Christopher Young is, he doesn't even come close to Elfman's greatness! What a poor choice, but is merely one among many. Another failed aspect of the film is its sorrowly failed attempt to become much darker. There is simply too many cheesy moments and humor for that to have worked unfortunately. Topher Grace and Thomas Hayden Church are excellent additions to the cast, but the story is too rushed to even enjoy it.<br/><br/>I feel James Franco's A-list acting was put to bad use here. He finally becomes the second Green Goblin and I actually enjoy the suit (but not the flying snowboard though). However, he spends most of the film in a pathetic amnesia. We do see a bit of his father's dark qualities once he does regain his memory, but like everything else in this film it isn't drawn to its full potential.<br/><br/>Sandman's creation is not even thirty minutes into the film and is so poorly executed it looks a modern version of a 50s sci-fi thriller. He just happens to a hop a fence and land in a zany ""molecular rotator"" or whatever it was called. Very unbelievable, too much for most I assume. I did enjoy the action but the villains just aren't built up enough here. The first two films had a single villain, allowing a lot of time for the audiences to ""connect"" with them so to speak. Sam Raimi tried to do overdo it honestly, but it could've worked. But instead of extending the run time, we get a movie that just isn't long enough to have all these new characters. It barely runs over two hours. One of my biggest issues with ""Spider-Man 3"" is Venom. The characters is my personal favorite and no less among fans. His screen time was pathetic to say the least. The best villain had no time to go deep into his character. He doesn't even mention his name!! They could've done so much more, certainly at the climax. It felt like it was just all big effects and an attempt to sell merchandise to the kids.<br/><br/>Well, I don't know if there should be a fourth or not, but Sam Raimi needs to get his ^&&* together!!"

","a great and underrated movie that's got too much hate for whiny and prissy fan boys. what they fail to understand is that this was (before it made super-serious bank at the BO) gonna be the last spider-man movie, so things needed to be tied up nice and neatly in the end. though, as good as it is, thats not to say it's perfect. wait for the DC of it.Either there's whining about how much Spider-Man 3 sucked, how much Sam Raimi sucks, how much Venom and Carnage rule, how ugly Kirsten is,how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, reboot, reboot, reboot etc...GET OVER IT. Topher Was a great choice for Eddie/Venom, a slimy character, Thomas Haden Church was great as the sympathetic sandman/Flint,and Tobey/James/Kirsten all reprise there roles better then ever. As For The Music, it was amazing. Young adapted Elfman's themes very well (remind me again WHY THERE Couldn't BE A SCORE SOUNDTRACK ALBUM WITH YOUNG'S MUSIC???). Although, I will admit, there is some unnecessary things, but what movie doesn't have that? I eagerly await part four. 10/10"
"hitchcockthelegend","7","2","3","31 March 2009"," With trilogies comes great responsibility.
","Peter Parker is very happy, he's in love with the sensual Mary Jane Watson, his studies are going great, and America loves his alter ego, Spider-Man. But his world is quickly turned upside down as he comes under attack from Sandman, Goblin Jr and an alien substance that transforms Peter into something far darker than his super hero better self.<br/><br/>There is a school of thought that says that sequels are always the tricky films for directors to take on, that may be so in most genres, but for comic book adaptations, all films are tricky. By the time of director Sam Raimi releasing Spider-Man 3, he had not only shown the world that he clearly loved the Spider-Man characters, he showed that he also knew how to better the franchise with the second instalment. So really, if we are all honest here, it was going to take a monumental effort to not just only better parts one and two, but to merely make a film to sit alongside those finely crafted pictures as well! That he managed neither is no great surprise when watching it now after the dust has settled a few years later. In his over eagerness to entertain us the fans, and with studio interference that Raimi to date refuses to over elaborate on (Venom-AKA Eddie Brock-it was-ahem-requested he find room for), Raimi lost sight of the less is more policy that made the first two Spidey movies great.<br/><br/>When I first came out of the cinema after my original viewing, my head was chocked full of villains, not only that, but also Peter's love life struggles, it is in short, way too much for one movie. I had enjoyed myself for sure, hell! Raimi knows how to give his fans a good time, but when you break it own there are so many missed opportunities it grates substantially on the discerning movie watching fan. Thomas Haden Church is a fine actor, but as Marko he has little to do, so come the excellent transformation into Sandman, Church is a forgotten prop. Then there is the almost unforgivable act of losing James Franco {Goblin Jr} in amongst the collage of goings on, his Harry Osborn has a neat complexity to him and more attention to detail with this character arc would have provided great rewards I'm sure. Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane but appears to be regressing in acting ability, is she bored I wonder? Or is she just not that very good an actress? The less said about Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom the better, tho in fairness Raimi never wanted the character in the film, so it's hardly surprising that the best thing about the character is the entertaining effects as Venom snarls and snaps. Bryce Dallas Howard is sparky as Gwen Stacy, and J.K. Simmons as usual owns every scene he is in.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of my grievances, after my HD revisit to the film I find myself warming to the Raimi franchise misfire. Clever themes such as power and its devilish off shoots are fleshed out, while the humour here is possibly the best of the three films thus far. The romantic angle between MJ and Peter is given serious thought and dare I say it, an adult make over. Whilst Tobey Maguire really has improved as an actor with each subsequent film, not withstanding an ill advised Saturday Night Fever sequence, Parker's venture to the dark side is excellently realised by Maguire. But ultimately it's with the action sequences that many younger viewers judge a Spider-Man film by, and part three is not found wanting, with a double team ultimate smack down raising the bar in gloriously over the top enjoyment. 7/10<br/><br/>At the time of writing the above Raimi had agreed to do Spider-Man 4, I feel sure that lessons would have been learned, as it is now, both Raimi and Maguire have left the franchise. The head honcho executives have other ideas for the next instalment......."

"RNMorton","9","2","3","17 January 2009"," Enuff already with the sympathetic villains
","I have to admit I watch this because my kids like the action scenes. So I've seen the action scenes 50 times and some of the plot stuff zero. Bryce Howard (Ron's daughter) is a very very appealing and talented Gwen Stacy, the rest of the cast is spot on as in all the Marvel productions. And the action scenes are well done, I find Venom a little tough to stomach but the Sandman stuff is spectacular. Now to the complaints - Sandman can't do all this evil stuff and have a heart of gold (like Doc Ock). I'm sorry, I'm just not buying it, it kills what credibility is left in these things. If they're going to do that they can't make the bad guys so evil when they're on their rampage, they have to choose. Plus they already used the killed-Peter's-uncle-theme in Spiderman 1, their attempt to recycle that one with Sandman is so painful, and by the way hasn't MJ been the hostage in every Spiderman movie climax? Isn't somebody supervising the story or script ?! On the plus side Franco does a really nice job with Greenie Jr, so good that saying goodbye to him has to be a mistake. So the characters and acting are good, the fights are good, but some of the plot stuff is just plain LAME even for this genre."
"kurciasbezdalas","10","2","3","10 January 2009"," My favorite Spider-man's part
","I can't understand why do other people didn't like this part, because this one was my favorite. First of all because this time Spider-man has to fight three villains. The action was great, though there were less of it but it was still very enjoyable and maybe even better than in second part (or maybe not). But the best thing about this film was, that not like in previous parts, in this part Peter's and Mary Jane's dialog scenes weren't boring. Actually this time it seemed that I'm watching more Peter Parker's movie, than Spiderman's movie. This time Peter showed the dark side of his and actually I felt sorry for those who he was hurting, even for Sandman. I liked Mary Jane's and also Harry's position in this film. There also was some comical moments. J.K. Simmons (which to me is better known as Vernon Schillinger from Oz) with his character were hilarious in this part."

","When I first saw this film in the cinema I was disappointed as were many fans, the latest instalment of the Spider-Man films just didn't live up to the two previous ones, and that was saying something as I didn't even like the 2nd film! But I watched this again last night, over a year from when I saw it originally and have to say - it's a pretty darn good film! All the faults I found with it initially seemed to vanish - the 'emo bad boy Peter' scene was cringe worthy, but made me laugh out loud rather than hang my head with embarrassment. There were too many bad guys in this film, but the Sandman was no longer a boring side plot leading up to the fight with Venom that was all that most fans seemed interested in - it was an interesting story in it's own right (though still with it's plot-holes - how did the locket survive when everything else was obliterated?!). Happy Peter Parker at the beginning too wasn't just a weird turn in the story either - it made sense, fit in with the rest of the plot, with MJ and Peter's arguments, it all linked in together and was for the greater good of the story. Overall, it was such an improvement it felt like an entirely different film, though of course it wasn't - my expectations were just a lot lower.<br/><br/>I've always thought the chemistry between the main three friends, MJ, Harry and Peter, was fantastic when they were all together. James Franco (Harry Osborn) and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane Watson) especially seem to have a genuine chemistry which shines through the screen. However, scenes alone between Dunst and Maguire felt awkward and forced - I'm not sure whether it was purely in this film that this has happened or whether it was the same in previous films but I just hadn't noticed, but considering they are the main couple of the films it is surprising and definitely something to work on for future Spider-Man productions.<br/><br/>Finally, the last 40 minutes or so of the films - the final battle - is probably one of my favourite movie endings ever - I won't say anything that may spoil it but it's definite eye candy and will have you on the edge of your seat, even if like me you've already seen it once before."

"maxfan-3","7","2","3","16 June 2008"," Spiderman trilogy = Evil Dead trilogy
","Well, many comments I've read here are either wrong or just missed the point!! First this is a spider-man movie which means it is made to be fun and not so much serious. This is (if you are familiar with Sam Raimi's work) an excellent comedy!!!It's a pure trash movie (just like Army of Darness)it is made with enormous budget and this movie just shows how Sam Raimi is crazy director with a lot of sense of humor and likes to play around with money, lots of money!! Some scenes in this movie shows how much is this in fact made to entertain people with film knowledge and amaze those without it and those people who are not amazed or do not have clear film knowledge are just those kind of people who do not understand Ed Wood's work, in other words soulless people. If you watched Evil Dead trilogy you will see countless similarities in story and or action between two. Just as an example notice how Ash changes during these films and then compare it to Peter changes in this trilogy, in my eyes those changes are almost exactly the same. One of the reasons I'm so impressed with this film is scene at the end of the movie where you see spidey running in front of an America flag as if he does not look like a person wrapped in American flag already. Hilarious!!!And comments of the TV reporters at the climax are absolutely amazing and funny. One thing you can also notice is when Peter as an emo darker enters jazz bar where his girl works you can actually see if not Willem Dafoe then his very convincing lookalike (man behind them when he and his new girl sit at the table) and that was funny. There are a lot of scenes like these in the movie but I don't want to spoil the fun and excitement when you see them because this movie is all about that; funny ester eggs which tells us that Sam Raimi is in fact joking and having a great time doing this movie.

"I_Love_Spielberg","8","2","3","13 May 2008"," Not the film for the die-hard Spider-Man fan
","Personally, I like this film. I think that it had a good story and that it had a great message about how we all have a choice and what we do with those choices can affect other people. But, this is not the movie for the die-hard Spider-Man fan, especially as far as Venom goes. I have to admit, they could've done a better job with him in this movie. But that's just me, and it's probably a lot of people's opinion as well.<br/><br/>But all in all, it's a good movie. Not the best I've seen, and probably the weakest of the trilogy, but it's still good. I did like Bruce Campbell's cameo as a french maitre'd'. He was hilarious!"
"tim-otten-1","8","2","3","5 May 2008"," This is a great movie, it really is.
","I recently watched the third instalment of the Spiderman franchise and I have to say that I rather enjoyed it. When I looked up some reviews on the internet about this movie, I was amazed about the large amount of negative reviews this movie had gotten. Some of them didn't even labelled this as an average movie, but named it as ""a complete let-down"". This was the total opposite of what I was thinking. Spiderman 3 continues the story were 2 stopped. Peter parker (again brilliantly played by Toby Maguire) still takes on the world of crime as his alter ego Spiderman. Things are going rather well for Peter, since he now found a perfect balance between his social-life and his superhero-life. He has the girl, which is off course Mary-Jane, he wants and his grades are once again far above average. However things are soon starting to go downhill after a new invincible villain shows up, an unknown yet very aggressive virus plants itself in the Spiderman suit, his best friend still wants revenge on him for killing his dad and last but not least, girl troubles. Way to go, Spidey. Let's start by pointing out the biggest flaw of this movie: there are way too many things happening at the same time. It seems like the directors wanted to go all out with the last Spiderman movie they made and that didn't really turned out for the best. Let me get one thing straight, it's not like all these story's make the movie hard to understand. However, if you look up the other Spiderman movies, you can understand what I mean. In part 1 there were two story's: becoming Spiderman and one villain. Number 2 also had two story's: The inner struggle of wanting to be Spiderman and one villain. This movie has 4 story lines: Trouble with his friend who's planning his revenge, Trouble with his girlfriend who can't handle Spiderman's star status and TWO villains. What do you get if you fit twice the amount of content in one movie? Right, story lines that aren't as deep as they should have been. That's really a bummer, because the villains, sandman and venom, just scream for more background story. They give sandman a vague storyline, but there isn't a real conclusion for him. Venom is a cool character, but we only see him in his true form (and in the way we know him) in the last 20 minutes of the movie and that hurts, because he could have been the greatest super villain to hit the white screen by far. At least the other two story's (The troubles with his friend and his girlfriend) are decent, but the background story for those were created in the first two movies. A lot of reviewers claim that this movie doesn't stick to the original comic books. Well I can imagine why someone could find that annoying, but it doesn't concern me since I haven't read every Spiderman comic book there is and I'm sure that at least 80% of the people who see this movie haven't. So for most people this little thing wouldn't even matter. So, you know a few bad things about this movie, but let's be positive now. One thing everyone has to agree with are the quality of the visual effects. They are stunning. It's amazing how intense the directors could have made the battles without making it too unrealistic. No wonder they won the Oscar for best special effects with Spiderman 2. With all these special effects you are happy that there are more villains, cause this whole movie is eye candy. The action in this movie is very good, it's really how a superhero movie should be. If I'm honest then I can say that Spiderman is my favourite superhero (better then overpowered Superman and no powered Batman) and that's all thanks to the Spiderman movies. The great thing about this movie is that it knows that it's a superhero movie based on a comic and for this reason doesn't take itself too serious. It's a feel good action movie and one of the best in its genre if you ask me. After Peter's suit getting infected by the aggressive virus, Peter turns a little bit more to the dark side. However he doesn't turn in the cool, aggressive darker version of Peter Parker that you might picture him to become. Instead he starts wearing fashionable black clothing, hangs around with girls more and picks fights with people on bars. Criticisers say that this doesn't suit Peter at all and he doesn't act really like a bad guy at all. I think they might be missing the point. As I stated before, this movie doesn't take itself too serious. Spiderman becoming a complete bad guy would be a little too serious and the movie would lose a little bit of comedy the series always had. Dark Peter is quite hilarious, it had my laughing at a couple of scenes. Don't think that they messed up Dark Spiderman completely, because when he puts on his suit he is quite the vicious one. I admit that there are a lot of things to point out as bad in this movie, but I'm the kind of person that watches a movie to enjoy myself and not to find as many flaws as possible. Spiderman 3 is a very enjoyable movie, it's not an must-see, but the action, special effects and the cast makes this movie worth watching."
"tickyj45","7","2","3","23 April 2008"," Easily The Best One
","Don't listen to people say ""Oh this looked good but it was actually the worst one. Well that's not true. Spiderman 3 is easily the best one.<br/><br/>On IMDb.com the 2nd and worst Spiderman got the highest ratings.<br/><br/>GAG! Anyway, the villains are better, the conclusion is a good setup for a fourth and this Spiderman Rocks. If you haven't seen it go check it out. I'm positive you'll LOVE it. I did. So if you're just kind of considering it due to the mediocre based writers that have also commented on this title I'd only bother looking at the ones 7 stars and up because those are all the one that make sense. The movie is gold and you won't be disappointed. There is also a lot more feeling in this movie. And youu get to see the villain's background a little better."
"dunit013-2","8","2","3","20 April 2008"," Disappointing, but good
","Spider-Man 1&2 were amazing. So of course I was expecting a lot from Spider-Man 3. In many ways, it lived up to my expectations. Like good acting and great special effects. In other ways though, it failed. Like how there was too much Peter Parker and not enough Spider-Man. And the unnecessary addition of Gwen Stacy. Not to mention the whole emo Peter Parker dance montage. I mean, there's nothing more evil than black eye liner. And how Venom doesn't show up until the last twenty minutes and how Peter and M.J.'s relationship goes nowhere. But, the fight scenes were great. And Harry's death at the end was sad. And Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace were excellent as Venom and Sandman. So I liked it. Just not as much as the first two."
"asim34522-1","10","2","3","23 March 2008"," very good
","for starters this movie is much funnier than the first two, second it has strong fantasy violence which is the best part. I loved the battles in it and the best one was Spider-Man vs. Venom, good God did spidey take a beating from Venom. I mean in the first one he got a beating from Green Goblin but my God, Venom beat the crap out of him. The one flaw in the movie was that Venom was introduced at the end and Sand-man was a bad guy trying to be good. What's the point of that? I loved this movie but the game was absolutely rubbish-the storyline only lasted for half of the game. Watch the movie, don't play the game in my opinion. 9/10 is my rating for this movie"
"cwilsont90","8","2","3","20 February 2008"," I don't care what anyone says! I LOVED IT!
","Before seeing this movie I had low expectations. There were so many mixed reviews. But those questions were answered with a slap at my face! This movie comes together so nicely.<br/><br/>This is the most underrated, under-appreciated movie I can remember from the past 2 years. For all the people that said there was too much were right for the wrong reasons. Yes there was a lot going on, but that's what you would expect after blockbuster hits from the previous 2 movies. It has to raise expectations from the last 2. The Return of the King was better than the other two because it was the last, had the most action, and a lot of stuff was going on. This movie does that and then some. How Venom became Venom, and how spiderman is having trouble with everything from friends to his girlfriend and how sandman was fit into the plot(can't tell!) all fits together nicely.<br/><br/>The acting was good except when peter was trying to act cool. I don't know but it just made me feel awkward.....<br/><br/>The action scenes were just as good as the 2nd movie. It didn't really blow me away but it did keep my eyes locked on the scree.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a must see even if you're not a big fan!"
"paulo20","2","2","3","29 December 2007"," Spider-Man jumps the shark
","This is a bad film and, by association, if nothing else, the other two have become sullied. I have to wonder if any of these films were ever any good. Maybe I've just been fooling myself.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is little to say in defense of THIS film and whether or not the other two are any good, this 3rd film has put me off watching them ever again. Because Sam Raimi has clearly lost the plot, if he ever had it.<br/><br/>The film is a complete mess. There are at least four story lines going on here, and they are rather clumsily intertwined.<br/><br/>First we have a look at Mary Jane's attempt at a singing career and why it fails. Of course, I was under the impression that she wanted to be an ACTOR, not a singer and that she seemed as if she would do OK as the former. It's an obvious contrivance but it's not the only one. BTW, this is the character at her utmost unlikable (and about as far from the original vivacious comic book character as possible).<br/><br/>Then you have Harry Osborne becoming the next Goblin. He sneaks up on Peter Parker while he's on his bike (btw, what happened to his Spider-Sense? It's entirely missing in this film) then starts wailing the tar out of him, until Peter finally turns the tables and knocks Harry out cold. After a brief scare that he might be dead, it turns out he's OK, except for partial amnesia (another weak plot point).<br/><br/>Then you've got the Sandman, yet another sympathetic villain (and one who comes by his powers for no other reason than that the plot requires it). In the comic, he was a thug (except for one short period) who's fairly powerful and menacing. Here, he's a caring father who pulled off a heist to get money to save his dying daughter (well cry me a river, why don't you?) and not very effective or menacing (and Thomas Haden Church, the actor portraying him, seems to concede most of the characters' screen time to a series of roaring and groaning special effects). During this heist, he accidentally shoots and kills Peter Parker's uncle Ben. The purpose of this otherwise purposeless alteration of the Spider-Man origin story is to present some sappy message of forgiveness at the end. YAWN! Why can't we just have villains that are jerks?<br/><br/>Oh wait, we do, in the form of Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who's attempting to land a staff job at the Daily Bugle. But if not for the major plot point of the squishy black glob from space, I'd say he comes off as little more than an after-thought. And his alliance with Sandman is never explained and never convincing. Add to that a rather poor performance by Topher Grace. That's not to knock Grace, though; I think he could have done better if there were time to focus on Brock/Venom.<br/><br/>Somewhat intertwined with this storyline is Peter Parker's turn to the dark side. The squishy blob envelopes him, giving him a black costume and he becomes Dark Spider-Man, one who acts without inhibition or remorse when dealing with his enemies or even his friends. We witness a campily embarrassing scene parodying Saturday Night Fever and another where he attempts to humiliate Mary Jane by interrupting her jazz number with his own (btw, it was never established, to my knowledge, that Parker played the piano).<br/><br/>Then, there's Gwen Stacy, a significant character in the comics, but here she's just reduced to nothing more than a weak plot device. (Also, in an ironic bit of casting, the actress's natural hair color is red, as is Mary Jane's, while Dunst's natural hair is blonde, just like Stacy's). Actually, she serves as a reminder of how the filmmakers dropped the ball from the very beginning. They failed to feature Gwen in the first movie and create a significant story out of it and now they're reduced to presenting the character as a cypher. Better not to have used her at all, I think(I've always wondered about wanton changes to comic book stories when they're adapted to film. I mean, these things are already STORYBOARDED and at least some of them are GOOD STORIES).<br/><br/>Added to this convoluted mess is the suggestion of a sort of ""The Cult of Spider-Man."" Footage of him shows up on giant screens; he's invited to and shows up at a ceremony to receive the keys to the city and get kissed by Gwen Stacy (part of another weak plot device); plus the final battle scene involving the Sandman, Venom, the Goblin and Spider-Man; and all the while you've got hordes of idiots screaming ""Spider-Man! Spider-Man!"" as well as a female and (for some reason) British reporter portentously describing the events of the battle. It is as embarrassing as described and it struck me that it was not unlike this in the other films, though those films were infinitely more watchable, if nothing else.<br/><br/>What's basically happened here is that at least a year's worth of comic story lines (Harry Osborne, black costume, Venom) is being ham-handedly smooshed into a story that already features the ""touchy-feely"" Sandman storyline and some angst-ridden crap about MJ. The final results aren't pretty. The movie should have focused more on Brock/Venom and left Sandman out of it. There was already enough to go on with Harry and Peter for another plot thread. The movie also could have, nay should have, done without Mary Jane's ordeals. And I think we've seen, and heard, enough of her being dangled off of something and screaming her stupid, red-dyed head off."
"gorkilll","8","2","3","24 December 2007"," Spiderman 3- Good but not Great.
","Spiderman 3 was released 3 years after Spiderman 2. Those past 3 years went by, with all fans wondering what will happen next. Once Spiderman 3 was announced, the hype built up. Every day went by, and fans knew that every day going by was one day closer to the release date of the movie. I was one of those fans, and I admit that I had some pretty high expectations for the movie. But the movie came out, I saw it the opening day, and I was disappointed. The movie seemed to rush into everything, especially at the end, and some of the things were way out of whack. A couple of flaw the movie had were... -Sandman- This guy was useless, when there was already a good enough plot behind Uncle Ben's death, they just had to change it around by adding him. He provided no real use, since it was just about Spidey going after him, and him caring for his sick daughter. POINTLESS! POINTLESS! -Harry's Butler- Suddenly becomes a physician, somehow, able to clean people's wounds and keeping the truth of Norman's death from Harry the whole time. -Venom- Not enough screen time, not big enough, not dark enough, not good enough for fans. -Peter going Emo- NO! NO! NO! He is not some emo punk once he gets the suit, sure it may enhance his darker qualities, but it doesn't need to give his hair and clothes a black punk style. It was the wrong way to go. -Harry- He was good at most parts, but I was mainly just disappointed in his look. Sure, the director may have wanted something unique, but he looks nothing like a Goblin. He looks more like some Super-Spy-Kid dude flying around on a hovering stick. And his father already left him the cool glider, but he still didn't take it. -Symbiote- No! It doesn't just come down onto the Earth Randomly, that is very inaccurate. -Spiderman jumping in front of the American Flag- That was just overall ridiculous and pointless. <br/><br/>There were some good things in the movie, such as the catchy jazz and it still managed to maintain it's humor from the last two, such as from Bruce Campbell or J.K. Simmons. The movie's effects were bad and good, for they looked fake, but they were the latest, and you have to give Sam some credit, since he waited for the Special Effects team for quite some time. Also they manage to make some of the things flow, and I thought the love story was well done, even though it may have had some pointless parts to it, but still, it managed to maintain goodness. I also think that there were some moments in the movie that made the audience have that cheerful moments, like when Peter saved someone, or when Peter holds up the old Spiderman suit again, or when Harry shows up to help Peter. I think the acting was nailed well also, I was surprised how well Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace portrayed their villains, when I thought, at first, that those two actors were not good at all for the spot. The movie did have good things, but it all doesn't seem to come together, but I think that it was our expectations that really killed this movie. I don't think the director realized how good the other two really were, so he decided to make something just for money, when we expected him to make it for an accurate good story, like the last two. But he probably didn't know that.<br/><br/>Overall I give the movie a 7/10. Sure it may have had some flaws, but once again, I think it was our expectations that killed the movie."

"baz-howard2","8","2","3","18 November 2007"," Anyone who cant handle 3 Villains in one film, maybe shouldn't attempt a comic book either...
","WELL...I just seem to disagree with the entire world, as per usual, but I'm gonna go ahead and bust this review out anyway!!...<br/><br/>I've just watched Spiderman 3, and I've got to emphasise how radically I differ with Hal Ragland's views. Its not just this particular reviewer, in fairness- there are several people here whinging about 3 Villains being 'Too Much' to deal with. Are we suddenly reduced to the attention span of a four year-old due to excessive dumbing down over the past recent years? How on earth did these people cope with X-Men...did they have to take notes??<br/><br/>And those who complain about there not being enough ""time generated to allow us to see Harry's transformation into the Goblin' were perhaps buying popcorn or just ""out to lunch"" in the preceding two films...<br/><br/>This is, by far, the BEST out of the trilogy. For me - it really consolidated entirely what the Peter Parker ideology was starting to become in the first film, and was first conceived by this classic of all comic stories. It is one manifested by the everyday insecurities, passions and jealousies that we can all empathise with. In this, Toby Maguire perfectly embodies the ambiguity that would arise from being at first vulnerable, and then suddenly imbued with great strength and ability.<br/><br/>I don't even have to mention the CGI and general effects...they speak for themselves in their slickness and excellence. What I found more compelling about this film was the fact that the characters weren't so basically aligned towards either Good or Bad - black hats and white hats. It opens up the idea that not every story is the cut and dried truth, and that not everyone who engages in foul play does it merely for their own ends. This allowed for some brilliant performances between the characters played- combined with Sam Raimi's uncanny sense of timing (doubtless honed from his early years). He always keeps you looking over your shoulder, no matter how peaceful and serene a particular scene is at any one time.<br/><br/>My only last testimonial is that I even enjoyed Kirsten Dunce in it...and, usually I just CANT stand her!!<br/><br/>Enough said."

","First of all,I should have written this review 6 months ago. This movie could have been the best movie in the last decade,but it can't.I'm gonna name some reasons why SM3 is great and I'm also gonna name some of the flaws of this movie.Let's start with the flaws.<br/><br/>1.Bryce Dallas Howard's bad performance as Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>2.Tobey Maguire's awful performance when Spider-Man whore the black symbiote.3.Venom's physical appearance,I mean come on!!!;he is almost shorter than Spidey,also he isn't buff as hell;he is supposed to be as big as Bobby Lashley.And of course his tongue,I mean come on!!!,his tongue is supposed to be like 2 to 3 feet long.4.Venom comes out too late in the movie.5.Sam Raimi tried put too much in a 2hr.20 min.movie. 6.Venom dies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;I mean what the FU*K was that,Venom never dies in the Comic Books!!!<br/><br/>Now to the good things about why SM3 is worth 2hr.20 min.of your life. 1.James Franco amazing performance as Harry Osburne/The New Goblin;there ain't now that could say that he didn't steal the show in this movie.2.J.K.Simmons great performance as J.Jonah.Jameson.3.Thomas Haden Church's great performance as Sandman.4.Topher Grace's great performance as Eddie Brock/Venom.5.The special effects are arguably the third best in movie history.6.The battle sequences are awesome including the New Goblin and Spider-Man vs.Sandman and Venom battle which is the best, which lasts the entire last 29 minutes of the movie.7.Tobey Maguire's very good performance with the red suit.Kirsten Dunst's great performance as Mary Jan Watson.8.Harry's sacrificing of his life to save Peter from getting killed by Venom with Harry's own glider. All in all this movie the bomb.It was hands down the best superhero movie of the summer.And the best trilogy movie of the year.I mean this was better than Pirates of the Caribbean,it was better than Shrek,it was definitely better than Rush Hour.And it also was the best movie of the summer and the year.If you don't see this movie,you have your head screwed in wrong because this is as good as it gets people.So this movie gets a 9.5/10 in my opinion.Just like the movie says'Its the choices we make that make us who were are',meaning that if you choose not to see this movie you are missing out on the best Spider-Man movie,as well as the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>**So see it,please**"

Yet it's greatest asset is also it's biggest weakness. The fact is 2 hours + ain't enough for 3 villains as the previous entries were similar in length yet had only 1 villain. While the villains are awesome in themselves and the storyline behind there inception is quite good it just feels like the movie deals with three separate stories until the end when it comes together. Also Venom, by favorite one doesn't get enough screen time.<br/><br/>But overall, I found it to be a really great experience."

","I've recently purchased the 2-disc special edition of Spider-Man 3 this evening. This is by far one of the best blockbuster films this Summer. Staying true to the comic book series, this film has it all. Maguire, Dunst, Franco, and Simmons reprise their roles as well as guest appearances by Willem Dafoe and the co-creator Stan Lee himself. Sam Raimi isn't just one of the greatest film directors in the motion picture industry... but also a great screenwriter. Action, comedy, suspense and awesome visual effects make this picture a must-have for all Marvel comic book fans.<br/><br/>If you get the 2-disc set or Blu-ray disc, you'll get to see more visual effects, on-location settings and more. If you get the stand alone DVD, shame on you. Overall, I rate Spider-Man 3 on DVD an amazing 9 out of 10! EXCELSIOR!!!"
"greenheadjawsuniversal","7","2","3","5 November 2007"," Spidey Has A Dark Side
","The first ""Spider-Man,"" was enjoyable. It had a colorful look, with spirit and energy. Then came ""Spider-Man 2,"" the best sequel, and the best superhero film, about a troubled hero choosing between life as Spider-Man or as Peter Parker. Walking out of ""Spider-Man 2"" left me fulfilled and with a smile on my face and I immediately started counting the days until the release of ""Spider-Man 3,"" and couldn't wait until May 4th arrived. Finally, Friday May 4th, 12:00am. <br/><br/>In line for two hours pumped and excited, watched through it, and was it worth it? Yes, but not what I expected. There were some good and some bad. The great part about the film was obviously the jaw-dropping action sequences, which gave me goose bumps just watching Spidey go into action, saving Mary Jane and fighting the villains, especially the final battle scene where it was a two on two battle with Spidey and Harry, and Venom and Sandman. The visual effects were put to great use, and should earn an Academy Award nomination. The CGI and stunt folks do such a brilliant job of creating monsters and smashing buildings and crashing cars that we almost take it for granted. The symbiote looked fabulous, it was a puddle of goo into something aggressive. One thing that impressed me the most was how Alvin Sargent's script was able to juggle so many characters and make them relevant, ""Batman Forever"" this is not! <br/><br/>However there are some cons. There was no point of Gwen Stacy. She just comes and goes. There are some very cheesy moments in the film. Maguire tries hard, but Peter's boyish enthusiasm seems more like annoying dork with just a better suit at this point - and when Spidey goes dark, there's none of the menace or inner turmoil of, say, Christian Bale's Batman. At one point Peter Parker undergoes a personality and style makeover that makes him look and act like he's the unknown third brother from ""A Night at the Roxbury,"" making a scene at the jazz club, and for a second, I forgot what I was watching. Did I mention Kirsten Dunst singing more than once? There are far too many sluggish scenes of Peter and Mary Jane and don't even get me started on Harry's butler, who makes a speech late in the film that could have saved a lot of people a lot of trouble if he had just said something earlier! Thomas Haden Church gives an excellent portrayal as Sandman. In this film the script gives Sandman a real great story and should have been the main antagonist along with Harry. I was enormously disappointed with Venom, and yes, I am a fan of the character. Topher Grace gave a right performance, but there was no point to Venom in the film. He just comes and goes; such a waste of a character. Venom's design looked awesome and cool with the webbing's and just the way how his appearance was, but he and Spidey didn't go one on one, they just fought very briefly, and plus Venom didn't have much dialog. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Spider-Man 3"" doesn't entirely flatten the franchise. I walked out partly satisfied, but kinda disappointed. It's a fun candy-eye popcorn adventure comic book flick, ""3"" doesn't live up to the first two films, however it's worth the price and there's plenty to enjoy, and comfortable to sit through. 7/10."

","This third installment was the best out of all of them. It was incredible in every way. It started off well and finished well. A story of wrong doing and redemption.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire expands his acting role and shows his talent as an actor in Spider man 3. The villains in the role of the Sandman and Venom were well portrayed and well acted. The film actually took two villains and showed them each doing the opposite; the sandman reconciling and being forgiven by Peter, and Venom who can't resist the power of evil, and dives back into the black ""thing"" and dies when the bomb near it explodes.<br/><br/>I love the forgiveness shown by Peter to the Sandman, when the Sandman explains what exactly happened , the night Uncle Ben was shot. I also was very appreciative of the way they portrayed Peter diving into the dark side of his costume, and being taken over by it.<br/><br/>The emotions in this film are deep, as are the principles of wrong, right, self pity, forgiveness and redemption. I was impressed by some of the themes communicated by some of the scenes through out the movie. the action scenes are well done and entertaining.

"santo105","10","2","3","10 September 2007"," Grief and sorrow is what unites people
","I think people are wrong when saying that this movie is bad. I will give it a 10, simply for the deep messages it has, at least when you consider the age group at which this movie is directed to, which is mainly teenagers, and old fans that read the comics when the spider came out.<br/><br/>I think it has a bit of everything and it looks at things in a very psychological way. It starts out with both being celebrities, not knowing themselves, and it undergoes a series of transformations that couldn't have been handled differently for the final purpose of the movie. Grief is what unites people is only one of the many messages of the movie, the others being learning to be humble and respectful and all the connotations with it. I remember reading a book a couple of years ago about WWII, and why the world ended up being what it is now. The main idea was that the tremendous life loss, atrocities without equal in the history of mankind, prompted people to stick together, love each other, and the force of love after grief had to be so great, that now you see the French and the German standing together for the same beliefs, otherwise we would have been doomed to a sort of eternal recurrence of wars and revenges. The power of forgiveness ties in to this as well, and this becomes obvious with Peter Parker and the Goblin as well as the other main characters in the movie.<br/><br/>I think the only bad thing about this movie is that it's actually too short for the things that is trying to convey. It should have been a two part movie.<br/><br/>In any case I loved it, and I'll give it a 10, and this comes from someone who loved and understood movies like Fight Club, Jacob's Ladder or Revolver who are very underrated precisely because their messages are hidden in layers of understanding and people have a hard time untangling the ideas. Here however they're much more obvious but a little rushed in and not fully developed, but like I said for the audience it targets, its a great movie, and for us who are past or a little past our teen years, I would still say a great enjoyable movie for any occasion."
"doctor100","10","2","3","26 August 2007"," Excellent movie!
","I felt that this was the best of the trilogies, despite what the critics say. Everything in the movie was watchable from start to finish. It had action, drama, everything. It had something that the 1st and 2nd didn't have. But that doesn't mean that the other 2 were terrible, in fact all 3 movies were great. I just liked this one the most,because it just blew my mind away, while the other two were enjoyable, but in a mediocre way. The villains were amazing, especially venom(the best villain ever). Harry was fantastic as the new goblin, and sandman blew us all away. I give it 10 out of 10 stars for Spiderman 3 being the most action-packed and darkest movie ever."

","All three Spider-Man films have been disappointing.<br/><br/>Main Problems: Tobey Maguire.....wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, badly wrong!!! why was he playing Peter Parker as mentally handicapped (all that was missing was the dribble on his chin)? Charisma free bag of mouldy poo best describes his performance. With the money he makes out of these films you'd think he could buy some screen presence from actual actors. Anyone else really wanna pummel his head every time he does that stupid vacant stare expression?? Love storyline...... WOW, first film was nerdy kid has crush on popular girl who see's him as friend and then starts dating his cooler friend before she realises she actually likes the dork/retarded kid. Second film was the same fxxxing storyline, the same storyline we have seen a hundred times and I hoped had died back in the eighties. Now in the third film she turns into a complete bitch cos she can't act (in film and real life) and he goes off with some random pointless character and then they both real.................. sorry I'm getting bored just recapping this drivvle.<br/><br/>Green Goblin Costume (first film)...... Power Rangers court case pending.<br/><br/>But this third one went well beyond incompetent and turned into a farce. It is sloppily written, painfully embarrassing and unbelievably boring (even the action scenes..wow, spider-man swings through some more streets, how utterly riveting).<br/><br/>Maguire is still doing his Rain Man impression until he puts the black suit on and suddenly turns into a goth kiddie fiddler, I thought Peter Parker couldn't get any nerdier but my god they tried and pulled it off. I could literally feel the whole audience cringe during the ""aren't I cool scenes"".<br/><br/>The story lines were all over the place and most of them totally irrelevant, I think the extent of the editing done on this movie was to take all the footage shot, stick it in a bag and shake it up, then put it back together in no particular order.<br/><br/>The ending went beyond stupid and came back with a big bag of idiotic for everyone.<br/><br/>All in all this was a very poor film with no redeeming features (sure the effects were adequate but so what, I was just as bored during the ""action scenes I was through the rest of it).<br/><br/>I could go on and on (especially about the whole butler thing, write yourself into a corner did we???) but I just can't be bothered, see it if you want but if you enjoy then take my word for it........<br/><br/>YOUR AN IDIOT!!!!!"

"gokucg3","10","2","3","8 July 2007"," The Best of the Spider-Man movies so far..
","Spider-Man 3 is one the best films to come out all year. Based on 4 of the best story lines and a lame one. Spider-Man 3 contains great actors and actresses like Tobey Maguire, Topher Grace, Kirsten Dunst, Bryce Dallas Howard and more. Brings in Characters that Spider-Man fans will Recognize, and is loaded with action. Spider-Man 3 is obviously darker the Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man. The ending is the only near disappointment. And for Spider-Man fans the ending, the way the black costume (and the film's 3rd baddie looks) will probably be a little disappointing. So far this year Spider-Man 3 appears to the most memorable movie. Other Memorable movies so far: Ghost Rider, GrindHouse, Hot Fuzz, Live Free or Die Hard, Transformers and most likely the Simpsons movie."
"fung0","9","2","3","17 June 2007"," Excellent (despite what critics have said)
","Having heard many of the lukewarm (to put it kindly) reviews, I went to see this film with no expectations whatsoever. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be absolutely the equal of the other two in every way.<br/><br/>I still find the criticism incomprehensible, other than as some sort of 'pack' phenomenon. Perhaps, feeling they've over-praised installments one and two, people feel the need to balance the scales by trashing number three. I simply don't know.<br/><br/>What I do know is that on any meaningful basis, this is a great movie. It's more reminiscent of it's immediate predecessor, in that it strikes a - very marginally - better balance of action and drama than the original, and in that the CGI effects do a better job of humanizing the Spider-Man figure.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's all the same good stuff. Raimi's genius in this series lies in realizing what made the original comic (i.e. the first 38 Ditko/Lee issues, as opposed to the several hundred issues of filler that followed) so wonderful: this is a story about Peter Parker, troubled, geeky teenager... NOT about Spider-Man, omnipotent super-hero. Raimi never lets you forget that. (The one negative consequence is a propensity for tearing off Spider-Man's mask... If it ripped that easily, the whole secret-identity thing would be a total loss right from the start.)<br/><br/>Yes, like many other fans, when I heard that this film would have no less than three villains - 'Son of Goblin,' Venom and Sandman - I was concerned. No need. Raimi balances the three effortlessly, weaving them in and out of a single storyline, which remains relentlessly focused on Peter Parker. Raimi uses each villain (plus the competing newspaper photographer, and of course MJ) to counterpoint a different aspect of Parker's psyche. The action scenes flow from this, and hence each has real meaning, never degenerating into mere CGI slug-fest for its own sake.<br/><br/>The dialog, the characterizations... they're just what they should be. This IS a comic book, and one of the more wacky and surreal ones to come from Marvel in its glory days. This movie mixes moments of excitement, humor and tragedy in just the right Marvel proportions, and on just the right slightly-larger-than-life scale. (Soap opera? Heck, yeah! Did it really take forty years for anyone to notice?)<br/><br/>I have only three real quibbles. One, the endless Stan Lee cameo; fifteen seconds with his ego is like an eon in purgatory. (Hats off to the brilliant, irascible Steve Ditko for not even wanting his name in the credits.) Second, the giant-sized version of Sandman; it's unnecessary, and really only weakens the emotional impact of Sandman as a human-scale threat. And third, Peter Parker's big line at the end of the climactic fight; it's more awkward than it could have been. But these are minor points, and none of them diminishes my admiration and affection for this film.<br/><br/>Some might say there's a fourth point: Peter Parker's ego-tripping in the middle part of the movie is SO well done, it does get painful to watch. I'm sure this is deliberate, and it's certainly not unfaithful to certain aspects of the comic. Raimi does a great job of depicting a guy who's making a TOTAL jerk of himself. That's kind of the whole point. These episodes create a contrast for the nobler side of Parker, which of course must come through if he's to pull things together in the end. I think we can all see ourselves in this. (Aside, maybe, from a few of us who really ARE total jerks, and have yet to discover that they even have a nobler side.)<br/><br/>As I said, I have no idea what people found lacking in Spider-Man 3. It may be significant that many of the loudest criticisms are non-specific, of the ""this was utter crap"" variety. Maybe what we're hearing is the vague disappointment of fans who came late to the party and got hooked on later, 'cooler' versions of Peter Parker, and can't abide the notion that their hero could even HAVE a geeky, awkward side...<br/><br/>Who knows? My advice: take a chance and check out Spider-Man 3 for yourself, with an open mind. I, for one, saw a great movie here. Maybe you'll get lucky and see it too."
"photographicmichelle","1","2","3","17 June 2007"," Terrible
","After 2005's epic Batman Begins there is no excuse for a comic book movie this bad that one wonders if Raimi was watching Batman & Robin or Superman 4 while trying to get ideas for this trash.<br/><br/>I honestly liked the film when I first saw it in the theaters, but quickly the novelty wore off and the flaws became very evident. First off, the story is very weak. The majority of subplots (Peter's relationship with Mary Jane, anything with Sandman, Peter's relationship with Harry, etc.) were completely unnecessary and only made the film feel long and pointless. And while we are on the subject of Peter Parker, the scenes where he is becoming more arrogant and obnoxious not only dragged on too long, but they also felt incredibly cheesy. A good hour of the film could have been cut out and quite a few problems could have been solved.<br/><br/>But when you start to really dig at it, you realize the problems were not just story, but also with the acting. Topher Grace may have been a good choice to play Eddie Brock\Venom, but Tobey Maguire, James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst overacted so bad that it was actually quite funny. Gwen Stacy and Curt Connors also served very little purpose in this movie and could have been cut out.<br/><br/>Minor problems include the ridiculous TV news inter cuts in the fight sequences, Eddie Brock being introduced way too late into the story, and other minor moments of cheese where you seriously wondered how much Batman & Robin had influenced this trash.<br/><br/>I believe if this would have been cut by an hour and also would have been the second film in the series as opposed to the third, it would have worked better. Normally in trilogies a film where so many bad things happen is the second one which leads into the resolution in the third film. But these changes still probably would not have saved this film from being awful.<br/><br/>I am dreading the thought of another Spider-Man film unless they make some radical changes and would avoid this movie like the plague."
"EUyeshima","4","2","3","10 June 2007"," What a Tangled Web Raimi Weaves...
","The epic hubris displayed by director Sam Raimi in this latest (and one would hope final) installment of his phenomenally successful Spider-Man series is what frustrates me the most about this overlong, CGI-saturated 2007 movie. It feels like he was given free reign to do whatever he wanted without the intrusion of common sense. The result is a megalomaniacal failure leavened by scattered moments of levity. Written by Raimi, along with his brother Ivan and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the story begins promisingly with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, regaling in his celebrity status and mustering up enough courage up to propose to longtime love Mary-Jane Watson, who is incredibly making her Broadway musical debut.<br/><br/>The film wastes little time in establishing that Peter's ego has run amok - obviously an ironic parallel to Raimi's situation - and that he will be forced to face a crisis of conscience amid the shenanigans of not one but three villains. Spelling out the motivations of each of these characters takes time, as does the resuscitation of the love triangle between Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn and Peter's guilt over how he responded to his Uncle Ben's murder. Consequently, the movie feels overstuffed by the multiple story lines that only coalesce through pat plot conventions executed toward the end in order for the movie to have an acceptable running time. Moreover, the novelty of the special effects has tangibly worn out since the initial outing, and there is a surprising technical laziness found in some of the action sequences, especially with the overuse of nighttime shots to camouflage some of the battles.<br/><br/>A key problem also lies in the divergent yet predictable ways the villains have been developed. The resuscitated Green Goblin represents the result of revenge, while Flint Marko is a petty criminal caught in a radiation field that turns him into Sandman, a burgeoning creature made of sand (probably the film's best CGI sequence). The most skimpily developed villain is Venom, a gloopy, fast-moving black parasite that takes hold of Peter first before it takes control of professional rival Eddie Brock. If this was not enough, the story also introduces another key female character, model Gwen Stacy who happens to be the daughter of the police chief and Mary-Jane's competition for Peter's affections. All these detours serve to bring Peter to his original sensibilities about being Spider-Man and of course, to the big climactic battle. This is perhaps the most disappointing portion of the movie as at least two far-fetched plot points undermine the dramatic tension and seem to emphasize the silliness of the entire venture.<br/><br/>In keeping with its comic book origins, Raimi infuses the movie with a sense of humor, but the resulting variability in tone threatens to submerge the movie into camp. The principal actors - Tobey Maguire as Peter, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane and James Franco as Harry - are back but give us little additional depth or texture to their characters. Broadway luminary Rosemary Harris is also back lending sage advice as Aunt May, as are J.K. Simmons as blowhard editor J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Banks as saucy Miss Brant and Dylan Baker as the all-knowing Dr. Connors. Thomas Haden Church plays Marko stoically, while Topher Grace is simply irritating as the obnoxious Brock. Bryce Dallas Howard lends the right vacuity to air-headed Gwen, while Theresa Russell is wasted in a cameo as Marko's defeated wife. This is one dismal blockbuster worth skipping."
"robnels2000","6","2","3","29 May 2007"," Too much action not enough plot
","Too much action not enough plot I was really looking forward to this movie I really loved the first two. But when it comes down to it they totally blew it. They had lots of great CGI but you had no plot development to many bad guys and not enough story behind most of them. Add to that the sub story of the relationship problems between Peter and Mary Jane there was just too much going on in one movie to tell any kind of a good story.<br/><br/>All through this movie I got the impression that they were planning on more movies but something happened and they won't be able to make them. So instead of throwing away the stories they decided to cram them all in to one colossal disappointment. They totally sold out the great work of the first two movies."
"staceyisu","9","2","3","28 May 2007"," Good film. What else is there to say?
","I try to view every movie I want to see without reading the reviews or other's reactions. I tend to think art is a very individual taste kind of medium. I loved Spiderman 3. While it at times did feel rushed, I was not confused or lost and while the ending did tear at my heart strings, it was rather appropriate and well done. The lines were great. J Jonah Jameson always makes me laugh and I loved Bruce Campbell as the French maitre'd. Tobey Maguire does a great job, along with Kirsten Dunst. They were able to take their few scenes together and let the audience get more out of it. Bravo to James Franco who had to go from bad to good to bad, etc and each time made it believable and still likable. What I especially loved was how the film was able to explore choices, the dark side of humanity, and forgiveness in well written ways. So BRAVO Spiderman! I only wish Pirates 3 had taken a page out of your book."
"Fury_Fighter","4","2","3","28 May 2007"," The Biggest Letdown Ever
","Finally my favorite part of the whole Spiderman story was made into a movie. I was always a fan of the black suit story and Venom, but this time around Stan Lee should be extremely mad.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 was the worst Spiderman movie out of the three. The dialog this time around was severely cheesy and sometimes stupid. The scene where Parker is dancing in the street made me wonder why they bothered finishing this poorly made film. And finally, Venom is introduced...for a total of ten minutes. That was the biggest disappointment of the movie, Venom is a key Spiderman villain and to give the lead villain role to Sandman was not the right choice. Plus, Venom is suppose to big this huge buff nightmare, but they just made him a little more evil than Spiderman. Topher Grace is not the ideal Venom, in fact he is horrible. Personally I never thought Tobey was never a good Spiderman, he's way too odd to say the least.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie is the action sequences, they were amazing, I loved them, well except for the last one where Venom is killed, that was stupid because Venom never really dies in the comic. The scene where Sandman first becomes Sandman after the nuclear test or whatever was amazing as well, I thought that was the coolest part of this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, they need to leave the Spiderman franchise alone, because if they continue making this garbage, fan boys will rebel. Supposedly Tobey Maguire is not going to return if they decide to make a fourth one, thank god at least he realized the Spiderman franchise didn't receive any justice for this movie.<br/><br/>You can safely leave this Spiderman alone and let this franchise die in peace."
"nick_freeman","3","2","3","28 May 2007"," Everything balances out...
","Well I knew it was too good to be true that the third movie would come close to living up to the first two in this trilogy. I'm going to state briefly that all good trilogies have a sub par movie in them, but this one really feel far from cinematic greatness. With the multiple villains and over-worked dramatic scenes between MJ(Kirsten Dunst) and Spidey(Tobey McGuire) continuing with the alter ego that was just ridiculous, the movie was just too busy. It was clear the director, writer, and characters just didn't know how to run this third installment. If you must see it, rent it. The Tobey McGuire crying scenes are enough to make me want to fast forward SEVERAL TIMES in this movie. On the positive, the action scenes were excellent as always..."
"Smokeybear18","10","2","3","26 May 2007"," Great finish, left many questions about next villains.
","I was rather shocked on a Sunday morning to see Ebert and Roper give this movie two thumbs down. Sure, there were a few random scenes(the butler), but it still played out as a great action-packed movie. I think the movie was made with much missing, because it keeps you wondering who the next villain. Doctor Connors, who has been in each movie and whose part has steadily grown larger, could be Doc Croc. Venom, who some say was killed by the bomb, could still be alive. (I personally liked Topher Grace's performance for all you who whined about it.) Also, if you noticed Harry was the ""New Goblin"", so the hobgoblin has yet to be made. This movie has just made me want to see the fourth one even worse."
"Darrell89","1","2","3","25 May 2007"," WOW just WOW
","Well for those of you who haven't seen this movie, do your best to make sure it stays that way. What an awful, boring waste of time. I still can't believe I paid for this. I found myself having to come up with reasons not to leave every 10 mins. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I found spider 1 and 2 very watchable and some entertaining so I can't for the life of me figure how the studio could mess this up so badly. I felt no emotion towards the characters what so ever(except maybe hate). The ending was pretty uneventful and only served to compile more anger towards what had just transpired on the screen. Maybe a breakdown of the flaws may help you understand exactly what was lacking. Plot- awful(1) Vilans- lame(3) hero- weak(4) ending-bad(2) value for money - I hate myself right now(-57). lasting effects- hope not(-6)"
"bigmacsflyingcircus","2","2","3","23 May 2007"," And they call this a super hero movie?
","To be perfectly honest and frank, I'm not the biggest fan of super hero movies, I tend to find them nothing but 2 hour action extravaganza's (I hope I spelled that right), they tend to have little plot, bad dialog and weak plots, however one movie changed all this, and this was Spiderman. Now with a 3rd movie under the belt, is it doing anything for the franchise, the answer is no.<br/><br/>Many films this year are suffering from threequilitis, Pirates 3, Shrek the Third, and Spiderman 3 has got a really bad dose of it.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a bang, a really great action sequence involving Spiderman and Harry through the alleys of New York city. But after the first half hour the film starts to become ridiculous.<br/><br/>The first major problem is the amount of Villains in the film, 4! The main one, Sandman played by Thomas Hayden Church seemed to do nothing but be used as a desperate attempt to fill up the middle segment of the film. When the policeman in charge of the Ben Parker murder case announces to Aunt May, ""This is your husbands real killer."" Holding up a picture of the Sandman, it all goes downhill. With the hundreds of Spiderman comics around, why did they have to choose such a cheesy and clichéd character as one of the villains. Topher Grace plays Venom, the second man villain, on a vendetta against spiderman after he humiliates him by stealing his girlfriend. Now this villain would have been fine, if he hadn't turned up 10 minutes towards the end of the movie as if it was just to add more confusion to the weak and pointless plot. As for the other two villains, James Franco as the new goblin does a great job for the start of the movie, but loses this when he's clonked on the head by a beam. And as for the other villain it's Spiderman himself, which makes the plot even more ridiculous.<br/><br/>This leads me to the next Major problem with this film, Spiderman's emotional development, He spends more time crying in the film than fighting bad guys. When he's black spiderman, it's even worse, he try's to pick up chicks and be a macho man, I didn't know whether or not it was meant to be serious or for comic relief. Did anyone remember to remove his comb over when he was chatting up chicks?<br/><br/>The worst part of the film was the dreadful jazz bar scene reminiscent to the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. Taking ideas for a serious film off a pathetic and immature comedy has to be the worst decision made by a writer I have ever seen.<br/><br/>By now you are probably bored of reading my criticism of such a mediocre film, but I have to admit the last battle was very cool indeed with amazing digital effects. The action was brilliant until Harry gets killed. Then somehow Spiderman kills Venom with the most pathetic plot coincidence in movie history. You'll have to watch it to find out, it is too dreadful to explain.<br/><br/>Then suddenly Sandman goes from being bad to good and pours his heart out to Spiderman. They talk about how they've done bad things in their lives and need to be open about them and move on. Whats next, a superheroes anonymous meeting in Spiderman 4 (Which will undoubtedly be made, the producers would not be stupid enough to not cash in on the success of the franchise without making another one). <br/><br/>As for the middle section of the film, well nothing really happens, which was another huge disappointment, this doesn't actually feel like a super hero film, it's more about Praker's personal development.<br/><br/>To sum up, I had reasonably high expectations when seeing this film after the hype of it from friends, but I was very disappointed. There were some very good parts, such as the end credits, to the film, but not enough for the value of a $10 movie ticket."
"Kzgirl91","9","2","3","21 May 2007"," Wow................(moderate movie scenes, nothing to ruin the movie though.)
","I'd heard all of the bad reviews before I saw this movie but still wanted to see it for myself. I though it was great! Everyone said that Tobey Maguire is terrible at crying but really he didn't cry that bad. For me, the only disappointment was Peter in the black suit. He puts it on and flips down his bangs and turns emo. Personally the worst is a pathetic scene were he's dancing down the street and I swear they could have added disco music, it was sad. Just don't depend on the comic story. It's barely similar to the movie. I'll give it a 9/10. Would be a 10/10 but the black suit peter, booo! Watch it it's not nearly as bad as it's made out to be."
"Zumbs","8","2","3","21 May 2007"," What a Marvel!
","Again the power of the characters and stories of Marvel Comics return to the silver screen to dazzle all who dare to behold! Tobey Maguire return as the Peter Parker, and give another touching performance as the human, torn between the woman he loves, the hero, and real life. This time, however, it seems to be working out. He's ready to propose to the love of his life, Mary Jane (great performance by Kirsten Dunst, btw), when the movie starts.<br/><br/>Then a storm of different problems come into his life - getting attacked by his former best friend, and new information on the murder of his uncle (enter Sandman) just to mention a few - which causes him to loose sight of what really matters. The performance by all actors range between good and great, but one really steal the picture: Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, a small time crook turned robber to get money for his little daughters operation (socialized medicine, anyone?), busts out of jail to get the money for the operation.<br/><br/>And again we see Sam Raimi follow in the footstep of some of the greatest of Marvels writers: Creating truly complex and believable characters - heroes aren't always perfect, villain aren't always evil. And not only that: The story allow the actors to show off their acting prowess. So a big thumbs up to the writers and director.<br/><br/>Only disappointment in Spiderman 3 is the addition of Venom. I never liked him - in the comic it felt like he was being added to sell more comics (""omg Venom rox"") than to create a believable villain or move the story forward. Unfortunately, he'll probably be featured in Spiderman 4. Having said that, Sam Raimi actually manage to make Venom much more interesting than in the comic books. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a worthy addition to the Spiderman-saga. On some points it's the best, as it moved on from the ""Peter Parker torn between love and Spiderman"", and showed a Peter Parker older and more at peace with himself. It's definitely the darkest of the three, and that's not in everybodies taste. But I loved it! Hope you will to ..."

Sandman and The ""new"" Goblin should have been in the 3rd and Venom be the only villain in #4, maybe have lizard in it as well. The black costume was coll, but the dancing part going on for 10 minutes was too much, but when the black spider-man fought Sandman in the subway, was awesome. I though that James Franco played Harry Osborn very well, Bryce Dallas Howard was good as Gwen Stacy but i don't think they used her good enough, and J.K. Simmons is always good as J. Jonah Jameson. Kirsten Dunst was OK as Mary Jane. I thought that Topher Grace was awesome at playing Eddie Brock and Venom."

Sony will probably put thousands of special features in it. so people will buy it. anyway since the movie had so may villains the time that it took to progress the villains wasn't enough. Venom didn't have enough screen time. His costume was freakin awesome, but i still hope that venom will somehow reappear in the 4th film. the sandman's story was kinda sad but still they could've let us know what will happen next."
"tmckenna_TheCandidate_09","8","2","3","16 May 2007"," Definitely Worthwhile
","Let me say this right off the bat: In truth, while Spider Man 3 probably is the worst of the three, it's by the slimmest of margins. If the first two were 9s out of 10, then this is an 8.5. I am not going to talk about the plot, because I don't want to spoil such a fun movie experience for you. In short, this movie has something for everybody.<br/><br/>But let me put it this way: it is by far the most ambitious superhero movie I have ever seen, and probably will ever see. Bar none. Were the first two Spidey films better movies? Probably. Were the first two Spidey films more enjoyable movies? Definitely. But, for some reason, I don't have nearly the respect for those movies as I do for Number 3. While the first two films were just mindless action movies (albeit very skilled and very cool ones), Spider Man 3 is a drama first, and an action movie second. Although the action sequences are dazzling and well choreographed, in the end these scenes are overshadowed by the great acting, dialogue, story arc, and charm this film has been so flawlessly infused with. The relationships between the entire ensemble, and the way it affects each character's life, seems much more like Crash than Spider Man 2.<br/><br/>The movie is the quintessential guideline for how a movie of its ilk should be made. Its themes of respect, responsibility, forgiveness, and the ability facing oneself are handled so well that they don't seem to belong in a movie of this nature. And in the end, I think that's what turned a lot of viewers off. People will always have an involuntary urge toward complacency. When confronted with something different and more ""out-there"", such as a movie like Spider Man 3, the initial reaction will always be to criticize it, most of the time without exploring the film or their reasons for their dislike of it. And that's a shame. Because, while most of these people are looking for reasons to hate the film, a very good film was blaring right in front of them."

"grove-93","1","2","3","16 May 2007"," Worst movie of the last ten years!
","Worst movie of the last ten years! I never thought it would happened but it didI have finely seen a movie worse then "" The NoteBook"" and that movie is Spider Man 3. I hated everything about this movie. From beginning to end the film left me waiting for it to get interesting. The whole cast was terrible especially Kirsten Dunst who's acting was equally annoying to Mary Jan's nagging/singing. Everyone in the movie cries even Venom and the Sandman. The Special effects were pretty cool, but I'm not able to turn my brain off to the bad plot and the bad acting. The movie is about 2.5 hours to long, 2.5 hours of my life that'll I'll never have back. Unless you are a 12 year old boy you will not like this movie."

","Spiderman 3 was generally a fun movie to sit through for almost 2 ½ hours, but like a bad diet soda, it left a foul aftertaste. It's sad, because the prequels set the stage for this movie to be a classic vintage wine. The franchise has fallen back to the overcrowded pack of visually stunning but unfulfilling superhero movies, but as I will discuss later, the series has not yet been killed.<br/><br/>As for the present feature, there is obviously too much going on to compel any viewers to deeply care about the characters this time around. This is really ashamed because with more time to develop, the arc of Harry's story, ending with his death as he fights to save Peter's life, would have carried a real emotional punch. Unfortunately, Harry was so up and down emotionally, and in and out of the story, that we never connected with him or his evolving relationship with Peter. In addition, Venom deserved far better than the scant screen time and lack of malice provided by the screenplay and Topher Grace's portrayal. The past Spidey villains were so effective because they were egotistical, maniacal, and brilliant  guys at the top of their game that still weren't satisfied and WERE insane. Spidey 3's Eddie Brock was an admitted loser, so pathetic that he couldn't even get a job as a staff photographer without cheating  not exactly the pedigree of villains we deserve and Spiderman expects to battle.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church was completely squandered as The Sandman non-villain. The character was utterly useless. It's another unfortunate waste because Church would have been a GREAT true villain, with his chiseled face and dry, diabolical sense of humor (Scorpion or Rhino come to mind). Sandman should have been left out and his (along with Doc Connors) minutes used for Harry, Venom, and a more cohesive storyline that relied less on random events to make things work out (i.e. the black goo just falling from outer space, Brock just happening to be at the church where Peter jettisons the black suit). A better costume and vehicle for Harry would have been nice, too. The hover-board looked like something from a Back-to-the-Future fire sale.<br/><br/>All was not bad: The fight scenes, other than the over-the-top finale, were great. The acting was good, and I still like the characters. The funny parts were funny, meant to be tongue-in-cheek and I enjoyed them. I took Peter's morph into a Travolta-struttin' emo as the black suit turning him insane. It worked because everyone in the movie, not just the audience, thought he looked ridiculous.<br/><br/>Moving forward, Spiderman 4 could rejuvenate the franchise but it would take some awfully clever writing. There is a huge financial incentive. There are enough good actors and Spiderman villains to get that part of the story right. A little MJ/Gwen Stacy competition would spice things up. Maybe even a return of Venom, albeit with a different, move malevolent host.<br/><br/>I guess in the end, Spidey 3 WAS fun but could have been SO MUCH more. We shouldn't feel too sad. It's been a great ride, and two out of three ain't bad!"
"ivanivanparra","6","2","3","14 May 2007"," Well whats good or bad in this movie.
","Hi I'm a 12 year old kid and it was my birthday on may 3. The Spiderman 3 movie came out on May 4 and i was dying to see it. There was a time that was worldwide at midnight! My parents took me there for my birthday. After waiting in line for 50 minutes then sitting for 2.20 minutes on a seat i came out of the the place and was frustrated. My dad asked how the movie was and i smiled and lied ""the best of the year"" What i was really thinking was this is the worst movie and how come my birthday comes once a year and i choose this movie.Now its 10 days after it came out. This movie was a waste of my time and i made a list of bad and good things. Here we go! The Good: Great Effects. (The Giant Sandman at end of movie) Great Action. (Venom and Spidey fighting) Great Story ( The Whole movie) Great Villains ( Venom) Great Comedy ( J. Jonah Jameson) The Bad: Costumes ( They don't look really cool such as Spider-man. its just a suit but nothing else special, seeing Brock's face in a costume is stupid, Harrys costume is not so cool ) Mary Jane ( Mary Jane obviously ruins the whole movie. Why is everything about Mary Jane. 3/4 Of the movie is about her. For God Sake ever since Spider-man 1 started he starts talking about Mary-Jane) Time Limit for Venom ( When Venom appeared the movie was almost over and he was only in it for 15 minutes.Then he explodes with the suit. How Ridicoulous) Ideas: ( Whos stupid idea was to have venom and Harry The Bridge Scene ( God how embarrassing for Tobey Maguire to have him and his fake crying act) WE WILL NEVER FORGET.<br/><br/>Explanation ( Since when does some strange liquid come from a meteor) Emo ( Stupid Idea of Peter going emu) As you can see there are positive and negative for this movie. This movie is worth a rental. If you are curious enough to see it do yourself a favor and wait till the DVD comes out and rent it. I only think this movie is worth watching in theaters if you like a good romance story with a little bit of action. For decent fans planning to use 16.00 or 5 bucks more for IMAX then just wait for the rental. Thanks for reading"
"The-Kusabi","1","2","3","12 May 2007"," Waste of time
","This movie was such a disappointment. I liked the first one, the second one was alright but this movie if you can call it that sucked. Now I don't know much about the comic, I've never read it but I do know some things. First off that Venom isn't just a costume that Peter can lock in a closet. It's a living being with it's own thoughts and agendas. They show it as just a black costume which is retarded. Another thing I'd like to say about the movie is what the heck is up with the Jazz scene? OK Peter Parker is a bad ass in the suit I get that but the way they show it is dumb. Walking down the street dancing to Jazz music snapping and pointing at passing by girls? Yeah that's real bad ass. Next is the way the movie is advertised and everything your made to think Venom has a huge part in the movie. Venom, not Spiderman in the black costume. Venom as is Eddie Brock and the symbiote together. He's in the movie for what 15 mins? come on. The only thing this movie made me do is want to read the real comics to find out the real storyline. I'm just glad I didn't pay money to see this.<br/><br/>2/10 Oh and by the way Spiderman makes the webbing, it doesn't just shoot out of his arms. He had to create the web-shooters from his own knowledge."
"jeigan","5","2","3","12 May 2007"," A decent movie with nothing to do with Spiderman...
","So, this is the third Spiderman movie. Which is kind of funny since there is nothing about Spiderman. OK, there's a guy in a red-and-blue costume who hurls webs and climbs buildings, but that is NOT Spiderman. Perhaps this is a spoof...<br/><br/>The story is all about this symbiote which randomly falls near Peter Parker and colors his spider suit black. Oh, and it also turns him into a dancing goth. Meanwhile, his girlfriend is depressed, his best friend is nuts, and two villains arrive in town.<br/><br/>However, in this movie Spiderman has lost his spider sense, his sarcasm, his charisma, and his personality, being only able to do Tarzan in Manhattan and stare at MJ with his idiotic smile. In fact, Maguire manages to wipe that stupid smirk off his face even twice. When he turns goth (BTW, what has that to do with the symbiote?) he's even dumber, dancing in the streets with all the girls either walking away or ignoring him. WTF~? MJ, too, isn't herself, acting depressed all along, and even managing to depress Spidey himself. And the audience, of course. It felt definitely better when she was slapped to the ground. On to the enemies now -- the first one, from being a small-time nobody in the comics, is now at the center of the story...not to mention Raimi even altered the events of the first Spiderman. The second one, however, from being one of Spidey's fiercest foes, is now a wuss who only appears for 10 minutes...not to mention he is quite different from his comics counterpart: - no muscles - much shorter - no ""we"" speech - pika-cries a la pokémon<br/><br/>Also, there are some very stupid scenes, like Harry's butler (seriously, what were they smoking?) and the appearance of Gwen Stacy. Who is even depicted as a brain-free chick.<br/><br/>To be honest, the movie isn't that bad (hence the ""decent""), since it features exciting (yet absurd) fights and managed not to bore me despite its length. If you're a fan of Spidey, however, be warned: you'll curse A LOT."
"dfle3","5","2","3","11 May 2007"," Okay at best, embarrassing and cringe-worthy at worst
","Even though I don't particularly remember the previous movies, I'd have to say that this movie is the worst of the lot. I'd say that the original was the best.<br/><br/>In this movie, new dynamics are added when goo from outer space lands on Earth, and affects Spider-man, amongst others, giving them variations to their power, which complicates their relations to others.<br/><br/>A new villain with super powers is also created due to an accident.<br/><br/>Of course, the special effects are excellent and one of the newly created super-villains is particularly spectacular.<br/><br/>However, what makes the movie so disappointing is the fact that it seems written by small boys, for small boys. The most cringe-worthy parts are when Spider-man is affected by the space-goo, and his alter-ego too, Peter Parker. The scene where Peter Parker does a variation of Tony Manero (from Saturday Night Fever) is cringe-worthy. Other parts of the movie, where loose ends are tied up are also boy-like in execution.<br/><br/>I know I may be too old for this kind of stuff...I just wish that the script was more sophisticated as well as the way the plot plays out.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst, as Parker/Spider-man's girlfriend, has some perhaps ironic new dimensions to her relationship with Parker. I can sympathise with what the makers of the movie were trying to achieve, but I do think they could have done it better.<br/><br/>In the same way that the second Matrix movie SHOULD have warned me off bothering to see the third in the series, this movie MAY signal that the makers are flogging a dead horse now.<br/><br/>The embarrassing parts of the movie are what I take away from it, mostly. But yeah, the special effects are really good."
"donmcvey-1","4","2","3","10 May 2007"," What was the point?
","I can't believe that after 2 great movies Sam Raimi got it so wrong. I'll be brief as I'm sure there will be a thousand reviews picking this movie apart. I just have a few points I have to get across.<br/><br/>What was the point in the Sandman? I liked the actor, I liked the effects, I liked the fight scenes but what was the bigger point? The Uncle Ben story? Rubbish. The whole revenge thing could have been dealt with in a way better way than this lazy effort.<br/><br/>The real story of this movie was completely ignored. Harry Ozborne becoming the Goblin. 2 seconds of him walking out a green mist! This is surely the story that's been building for the first 2 movies. We've been waiting to see the new Goblin and Spidey go at it big time. All we got were a few crappy dark, out of focus action scenes. If they'd taken The Sandman completely out of this movie, it could have been great.<br/><br/>Never mind, let's look forward to more rubbish when Spiderman 4 comes out. Maybe they should just forget the movie and concentrate on the thing they're really good at; selling merchandise."
"luis-pinto-1","2","2","3","9 May 2007"," What can i say?
","I have just one simple thing to say.. I hope Chris Nolan directs the fourth one and title it ""Spider Man Begins"", because this one is plain bad, this said by a guy who loved the 2nd one. Let's not forget that Sam Raimi is the producer and sometimes director of the cheesy series Hercules and Xena, and this one has a little extra cheese.. so much i got sick in the end, maybe the extra cheese makes us forget this and move along. Tobey is also awful, i keep thinking that they sucked on their job on purpose because they didn't want to comeback (alike Keanu in Revolutions). The excess of villains cluttered the whole movie and destroyed what could be an excellent story. I felt no sympathy whatsoever for peter, and after the strange flirting and dancing moves (bad mode) i regret not going to a more expensive restaurant before the session and stay there for 3 hours.. <br/><br/>Note to director, you got lucky with one rushed sequel (2) .. but another rushed sequel (3), you were asking for it! Go back to Hercules and Xena, and stop putting your unsympathetic brother in your movies.."
"dmacman-1","6","2","3","9 May 2007"," Mr. Raimi goes to film school.
","I am a huge Spider-Man fan and really enjoyed the first two movies, so Spider-Man 3 was a must see for me. Much to my disappointment, it did not live up to my expectations. With all the resources of Marvel Comics and Sony at his command, why couldn't Director Sam Raimi just tell a good cohesive story? This movie truly suffered from Hollywood excess, big on budget and special effects, light on real content. Apparently the powers that be tried to cram in as much of Spider-Man's 40+ year history using the cut and paste method, without understanding any of its significance. The formula for the movie seemed to go something like this: Take villains from different eras of Spider-Man comics, Peter Parker's original first love Gwen Stacey, the black Spidey costume, mix together with themes of revenge, angst, pathos, redemption, multiple love triangles, sprinkle with minimal dialog to explain anything if at all and plenty of action to move it along.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi should have known better, having proclaimed how much of a fan he has been since childhood and producing two successful Spider-Man movies with clear linear story telling. Trying to resolve every storyline from the first two movies and introducing three new villains, plus a new love interest was just too much for a 2½ hour film. As a result, all character development was given short shrift in favor of moving on to the action scenes.<br/><br/>The introduction of the alien symbiotic organism that will become Venom was truly laughable. Crashing to earth inside a meteorite that barely makes a sound, conveniently landing near Peter Parker and Mary Jane who are relaxing in a giant web and don't even notice. Raimi could have had the perfect back story to use here, instead of the B- Movie coincidence that we are given. Having already established John Jameson, J. Jonah's Son, from the second movie as an astronaut, the symbiont could have been brought back from a space mission tying in the previous storyline.<br/><br/>In the next scene Harry Osborn swoops down on an unsuspecting Peter Parker to avenge his Father Norman's death, dressed as the New Goblin. This is definitely a highlight of the film featuring a knock down, drag out fight showing off the New Goblin's technology and Peter's ingenuity on the fly to defeat a superiorly armed foe. More exposition would have helped characterization in this regard; in fact Raimi could have used this scene as a springboard to explore all the relationships in the movie and created a Father/Son bookend format for the trilogy. He had access to decades of Spider-Man/Green Goblin stories to draw from but alas, only the basics were incorporated.<br/><br/>We are then ""treated"" to the origin of Flint Marco alias The Sandman, with alterations from his comic book roots of course. Not just a common criminal who gets turned into living sand by a science experiment, now he is also the man behind the gun that killed Peter's Uncle Ben. Did the writers and director watch Tim Burton's first Batman movie one too many times? I made you! No! You made me! The poignancy of Uncle Ben's death is that Peter, through his inaction, does not stop the man that later shoots his Uncle, which he blames himself for the rest of his life. Retroactively changing this story point was totally unnecessary and undercut the emotional impact of the first movie. I would go so far as to say that even having Sandman in this movie just convoluted things and the character could have been left out altogether. <br/><br/>Peter Parker's possession by the alien symbiont is technically very well done and appropriately creepy, looking like oozing animated black oil. Once again however, deviating from the original comic book source material, it forms a new costume that affects Spider-Man only when he wears it instead of becoming part of his body. What is strange about this is that later in the film that is exactly what happens to the character of Eddie Brock who becomes Venom. He is directly bonded with the symbiont; not just his clothing is affected. Maybe this could be explained away by the fact that Brock willingly accepted the creature whereas Parker fought against its influence. In any case we are never really given a reason. The visuals for the Venom character were excellent and spot on to the comic book version.<br/><br/>Lest we not forget the soap opera elements of Spider-Man 3. Peter loves Mary Jane, Mary Jane loves herself, Harry has unrequited love for MJ, Eddie Brock loves himself but dates Gwen Stacey, Gwen Stacey takes a liking to Spider-Man/Peter Parker but dumps him after one date when he acts like a jerk in his ""altered"" state and finally Peter and MJ are reunited at the end of the film. This is literally the amount of depth presented on screen, a few lines of dialog to show each relationship and very little time to show it. Aunt May is back to give advice to Peter and be the voice of reason and wisdom, a bright spot in all of these movies.<br/><br/>Overall I would rate Spider-Man 3 the least enjoyable of the series but of course it will brake records and make unheard of amounts of money anyways due to the popularity of the character. My suggestion to Marvel and Sony would be to get a new Director and cast for the inevitable Spider-Man 4. I think this particular crew has done what they could do with the material, time to give others a chance to make a truly great Spider-Man film."
"shellys_98","4","2","3","6 May 2007"," SO disappointed
","We went to see this yesterday with really high expectations having absolutely loved the first 2 movies, but ended up being SO disappointed this time. We felt that the script just flat out dragged and there was little to no character development, for example who was Eddie Brock and where did he come from and why/how did he become venom? There are way too many loose ends in this sequel and parts of it were just so slow. How sad is it to actually check your watch to see how much longer you have to sit there? The special effects were really good, especially in regards to the Sandman, but honestly, that's really the only good thing I can say about this movie. As we were leaving, we overheard people making remarks like ""can I get my $11 back?"" and ""can I get that 2 hours back?"". Oh, and little kids that just LOVE the Spiderman movies were really scared during this one. We were in line behind a guy with his little boy around 5 or 6 years old, and the little guy had watched 1 and 2 before coming to the movie and he was really upset when we were leaving. Dad said he thinks the little guy will have nightmares because of this one."

The film looks absolutely beautiful and Tobeys stunts probably took hours and hours. Both the action and the music score are great, in my opinion perfectly in balance with the dialog scenes.<br/><br/>I found the symbiont rather cool, and peter parker fighting with his inner self led to some quite funny moments. The only point of criticism are the relatively weak dialogs, and the touching scenes were more funny than touching<br/><br/>all by all a nice spring blockbuster which is worth watching<br/><br/>7,5/10"

"JC_Ride","6","1","1","22 May 2020"," An enjoyable mess!
","This movie is undoubtedly the Achilles heel of the trilogy and has a lot of bad things going for it. The romance is dumb, and it paints both MJ and especially Peter as jerks (Peter even before he got the symbiote, he literally kisses a woman in front of his girlfriend and is like *oh that was spiderman not me*. And he was even the one who suggested that they kiss!). The dialogue is still cheesy and the script is mediocre. As most point out, this movies biggest flaw is the overabundance of plot points and villains. Peter is having relationship troubles with MJ, Sandman does bad stuff do find money for his daughter, Harry has plot injur.. i mean amnesia (and just so happens to forget somehting that happened a while back and undoubtedly shook him to his core), sandman is retconed into uncle Bens death to connect him to Spiderman and make things personal (honestly it wouldnt be bad if Raimi gave us ONE villain that doesn't have a connection to Peter), Harry, Peter and MJ have a love triangle AND if those weren't enough the symbiote takes over Peter and Peter destroys Eddie Brocks life cause he's a (bigger) douchebag now. Apparently Raimi didn't want to include Venom but was forced from Sony due to his popularity, so he had to make a new script to include the whole symbiote arc, and it shows. Also Venoms suit and voice are bad. That being said the movie is still very employable. The actors are great, Sandman is a great villain and so is Harry thanks to Raimi building him up since the first movie, the visuals are by far the best in the trilogy (that sandman scene is amazing) and most importantly, the action is in my opinion great and tons of fun! So, despite the movie being a total mess, it still is tons of fun thanks to the 2 previous movies and the great action it offers. So I'll just pretend the emo Peter dance scene never existed and give this a 6/10"

"HotToastyRag","10","1","1","25 February 2020"," Best comic book movie ever
","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.<br/><br/>This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.<br/><br/>Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.<br/><br/>With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.<br/><br/>Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

The story is pretty interesting, the characters go through good arcs, and the action is still really fun. Plus, it has some really beautiful music. The only major problem is the inclusion of Venom. We all know he was forced in by some studio executives or whatever and so that's how he feels. However, before Eddie turns into Venom, he gives a pretty good performance.

Some scenes felt odd, like Peter Parker gping aroind being symbiote infected, but I thought it was funnty. I understand that not everyone like Topher Grace's Venom, but I thought it was okay. He had that Venom attitude. I don't know how everyone can be complain about to many villains, but not complain about other movies like infinity war and Civil war not having to mant heroes. I thought Venom was pulled of well, and him being the climatic final battle was really cool. Sandman was also pulled of well to! What's REALLY disappointing, is that they cancelled Spiderman 4, as that was going to have Vulture and finally have Dr. Conners turn into Lizard."

","Spider-Man 3 would prove to be the final film in Sam Raimi's series despite plans for further films down the line. The film was one of the most expensive ever made at the time and there was high hope that it would continue to bring the success that the previous films had. It is well known that Raimi and the producers clashed, with the Venom aspects forced upon him due to fan popularity and it resulting in a host of characters vying for screen time. What we get is a strange turn of events. The film is cluttered in its writing and has a constantly wandering tone, but it's also the most enjoyable from a purely entertainment view and visually thrilling of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Story: Peter has to balance both his lives out after a vengeful Harry suffers from amnesia and his relationship with Mary Jane begins to fall apart due to his commitments as Spider-Man. Alongside these issues Peter also has to deal with a criminal named Flint Marko linked to his uncles death who can manipulate sand, a photographer vying for his job and a mysterious symbiote that changes his personality. It's plain for everyone to see that there is way too much going on here. In a film just over two hours there has to be time for the relationship woes, Harry's personality, Sandman's development, Brock's development, the symbiote changing Peter, Aunt May, the Uncle Been revelation and even a slight romance with Gwen Stacy. For me the whole venom and symbiote aspects could have been dropped, mainly because there's not enough time to do them justice.<br/><br/>Hero: Tobey Maguire is solid as Peter, he's so comfortable in the role by this point while he still brings a lot of charm and emotion to the character. However I don't think he handles the personality change that well, the stuff with 'emo Peter' is cringe-worthy and feels so forced.<br/><br/>Villains: James Franco does a decent job as a more ruthless Harry, even though the characters motivations are muddled at times. Thomas Haden Church is excellent as Sandman despite his limited time. He adds real physicality having clearly bulked up and nails some really tender moments. Topher Grace is okay as Brock but suffers from a lack of development. The character is a little too annoying and forced in but Grace manages to get down the slimy aspects. <br/><br/>Support: Kirsten Dunst continues to do a good job, yet Mary Jane is bordering on unlikeable at times. All she does is complain about Peter's responsibilities and it wears thin quickly. J. K. Simmons continues to steal every scene he's in and is as hilarious as ever here, his rapid delivery and sardonic attitude make him great fun to watch. Rosemary Harris is still a very warm and motherly Aunt May. Bryce Dallas Howard is good as Gwen and makes the character charming, it's just a shame she isn't featured more. A shout out to Bruce Campbell in his third and best cameo so far as a French head waiter.<br/><br/>Action: The action in the film is spectacular. All of it contains dazzling effects and plenty of energy, making every blow or movement look fantastic. The first fights with Harry and Sandman are simply superb, both effortlessly thrilling thanks some excellent directing and flowing action. The climax at a construction site is one of the best set-pieces of the trilogy and makes for a brilliant final battle.<br/><br/>Music: Christopher Young's score keeps a similar tone as the previous films and is very enjoyable. There's a lot of energetic pieces for the villains and fight scenes, but the mellower compositions really standout and add a touch of splendour to the film.<br/><br/>Production: The films visuals are a highlight. It looks sleek and stylish in equal measure. Once again there are many shots that look like they came right out of a comic book and the vast city is captured perfectly. The CGI is superb and holds up well, most of the fight scenes incorporate it and it blends in without notice. The birth of the Sandman is simply beautiful. Just as with the previous two films, most of the issues come from the writing. As said there is far too much going on here for a start, but a lot of the character motivations are convoluted. An example being Mary Jane breaking up with Peter after Harry blackmails her, she knows he's Spider-Man so why doesn't she just tell him? The same goes for Harry being told the truth about his father's death, why wasn't that revealed to him sooner? Its things like that which hurt the film. With that said I do think the plot line of Sandman's sick daughter and his involvement with Uncle Ben's death is handled expertly. I also have to mention the tonal issues. The film constantly hops between pure fun, melancholy, funny and reflective, often in the same sequence. When you go straight from Peter's inner turmoil to him strutting down the street, it's just bizarre. The previous films did have tonal shifts, but never to this degree.<br/><br/>Conclusion: When it's all said and done, I actually enjoy Spider-Man 3 despite all of its problems. I truly think the first 2/3rd's are very good and the tonal as well as the writing issues only really come into play in the final 1/3rd. It's probably the most enjoyable of the series in a basic sense. The issues arise because it's trying to cram too much in. Cut out most of the Venom related pieces and you actually have a lot of good material. I think both the Sandman and Harry stuff is great, and could have been even better with more time devoted to it. What we get is a film that is unbalanced and often muddled, but one that is still a visual and emotional feast that can still be enjoyed on a number of levels."
"GusF","Null","1","1","17 April 2016"," A rather good film but it is not on the same level as the first two
","The only Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" film that I did not see in the cinema, this is a rather good film but it is not on the same level as the first two. There are many good ideas to be found in the script by Sam Raimi, his elder brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent and it is quite well written but it is overstuffed. The film is surprisingly well paced considering its somewhat sprawling storyline and the fact that it is the longest of the trilogy. It is well directed by Sam Raimi but the action scenes are generally not the equal of the second film's. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is again very strong as Peter Parker, who seems to have finally achieved the balance in his life that eluded him for most of the second film. In spite of J. Jonah Jameson's best efforts over the years, the people of New York City have embraced Spider-Man as their hero. When it comes to his personal life, Peter is living the dream as he has been dating Mary Jane Watson for some time and he is planning to propose to her as soon as possible. Kirsten Dunst is good in the role but the material lets her down a bit. Mary Jane is having less success given that her career as a Broadway star died a quick death when she was fired. She thinks that Peter does not understand how she feels and that he tries to make everything about him as he often turns the conversation to his career as Spider-Man. The situation is not helped by the fact that Mary Jane is jealous of him re-enacting their upside down kiss with Gwen Stacy, a young woman whom he recently rescued as Spidey who just so happens to his lab partner as Peter. After a meteorite crashes to Earth, an alien symbiote bonds itself to Peter, amplifying his negative attributes. As the newly black suited Spider-Man, he goes from being a public hero to a public menace. He becomes callous and manipulative and is prone to outbursts of anger and violence. He also changes his image and begins to strut around the streets of New York trying to impress the ladies. These scenes were not really necessary but it was for the best that they were played for laughs. I am far less certain that this was the case when it came to his dancing in the jazz bar, one of the silliest scenes that I have seen in a film of this kind. Whether or not I was supposed to laugh, I did.<br/><br/>In the case of the three villains, the one in which I had the most vested interest was Harry Osborn, who discovered his late father Norman's cache of Green Goblin weapons and gadgets and has taken on the mantle of the New Goblin. Much like Dunst, James Franco is good but would have benefited from stronger material. Armed with the knowledge that Peter is Spider-Man, Harry vows to destroy his erstwhile best friend in revenge for the supposed murder of his father. To that end, he attacks Peter in the skies above New York using his glider but falls from a great height and suffers a convenient loss of memory. In the process, he forgets all about Peter's secret life and they resume their friendship, after a fashion. Things go a bit pear-shaped, however, when his memories reassert themselves and he forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter in order to save her boyfriend's life. <br/><br/>In contrast to all of the other major villains in the trilogy, I was unfamiliar with Flint Marko / Sandman before I saw the film. Thomas Haden Church is perfectly fine in the role but the character is fairly uninteresting, particularly the clichéd sob story concerning his critically ill daughter. I thought that it was a serious mistake and ultimately rather pointless to retcon Uncle Ben's death so that Marko and not his carjacker accomplice was the culprit. To a certain extent, it detracted from the first film's storyline in a way that a sequel never should. Topher Grace is likewise fine but he does not have much to do as the obnoxious, sleazy and dishonest freelance photographer Eddie Brock who bonds with the symbiote after Peter frees himself from it, becoming Venom. I was pretty disappointed that Venom only had a few major scenes as he was always my favourite villain from the 1990s animated series. I would have been perfectly happy if they had saved Venom for a later installment and jettisoned Sandman altogether so that that the film would have involved a one- on-one confrontation between Peter and Harry, which the end of the second film seemed to be hinting at. I liked the redemption story arc towards the end but more of it would have been nice.<br/><br/>As in the previous films, I was very impressed by J.K. Simmons as Jameson and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Although his appearance as Uncle Ben is disappointingly brief, the film is notable as being Cliff Robertson's final acting role before his death in 2011. Willem Dafoe's cameo as Norman Osborn was even more evocative of ""Hamlet"" than in the second film, considering that he uses the phrase ""Remember me"" as did the Ghost of Hamlet's Father. Had ""Spider-Man 4"" been produced, I assume that Bryce Dallas Howard would have reprised her role as Gwen Stacy and the character would have been killed off, in line with the comics. James Cromwell was wasted in his brief appearances as her father Captain George Stacy but they probably had plans for him too. As the maître d', Bruce Campbell actually got to be a nice guy to Peter Parker for the only film in the series.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an enjoyable film in spite of its flaws but it could have been so much better"
"LeonLouisRicci","10","1","1","13 March 2016"," Darker and More Extravagant
","This is, Arguably, the Highlight of the Series. Many uppity Film-Critics and jaded Fanboys have Weighed in on the Weight of the Thing, but that's the Thing. This End to the Trilogy is a Darkly Heavy Conclusion and it is a Spectacular Spider-Man to say the Least.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi and the State of the Art SFX Team, and the Returning Cast are in Full Throttle for this Last Entry in Their Series. It's like in the Early Years of its Silver Age Comics when the Monthly Titles were 12 cents and then there was that anticipated OverSized Annual, Costing a Whopping 25 cents. Excelsior!<br/><br/>This is Oversized and it Cost More to make. While that can Signal Trouble, Not So for this Power-Packed Picture. It is Edgier too. A Tale from a Director who Knows Dark and Edgy and Sam Raimi Lets Fly with All He's Got. Spidey. Goblin, Venom, and Sandman have Battle Scenes that are so Fantastic that they Literally Set the Bar for this Type of Thing.<br/><br/>The Movie Exudes Excellence from the Get-Go. It's a Non-Stop array of Births, Transformations, and shifting Personas and Allegiances that are Bizarre, Befitting its Comic-Book Roots. This one is more Gritty than the Previous Films, with some Horrific Undertones. But also Included is some Black Comedy that Lightens the Mood, but Not for Long.<br/><br/>Other returning Characters are here for Continuity. Of Course there's Mary Jane who provides a Love Triangle with Tragic Consequences and a Twist, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and this jam Packed Extravaganza also Introduces Gwen Stacey.<br/><br/>There's as much here and More than anyone Could Expect and this Extraordinary Movie is Bursting with Bravado, and Sentimentality. An Underrated Comic-Book Movie that is Exceptional Entertainment and perhaps Over Time when this First Wave of Super-Hero Movies are Not Taken so much For Granted, its Reputation and Radiance will become more Appreciated. Nuff Said."
"QuinnFreak","7","1","1","25 April 2014"," Pretty Good, but Ultimately Disappointing
","Spider-Man 3 (2007) - The first time I saw this movie (The Midnight Premiere ) it was my favorite movie yet. Which is a part of the reason I still like it today. Don't get me wrong, this movie has it's flaws. LOTS. The movie starts off with Peter going to see one of Mary Jane's plays, Harry also shows up but does not confront Peter because he's still mad at Peter. After the show Pete and MJ go to watch the stars and start to make out. While they were making out a meteorite falls from the sky. This meteor contains the symbiote, the symbiote latches on to Petes bike, and Pete and MJ leave. Later on Pete goes to see his aunt. This scene probably has the most heartfelt (and best written ) lines in the movie. Pete tells May he wants to marry MJ, and Aunt May gives Pete her wedding ring. Pete leaves and out of the blue a masked villain attacks him. He takes off the mask and it turns out to be Harry. Harry ends up getting hit in the head, and loses his memory. Harry, Pete, and MJ are all friends, meanwhile Sandman was created. Later on in the city a crane loses control and swings into a building, this building happens to have Gwen Stacy in it. The blow from the crane sends Gwen falling. This scene is one of the best scenes in the movie, because it's classic spidey. The CG looks great, and the Color Saturation Beautiful. The rest is pretty much filler at best, with an exception of a few scenes, like the one where Pete hits MJ, That was pretty heavy. Overall the movie had a good idea, weighed down by to many characters, and a few questionable dance scenes. The directing is done beautifully as to be expected by Sam Raimi. I realize the film has issues, bu I will always love it to some degree, because it was my first premier. 7/10"
"grintemcstinger","8","1","1","7 April 2014"," Flawed in some regards, but great nonetheless
","*spoilers ahead* <br/><br/>When I first saw Spider-Man 3, I had a very a good feeling about it. It definitely had some parts that didn't quite work for me, but they never seemed that much of a deal because the good parts outweigh them by a good portion. I was well entertained. At that time I would've never guessed that the movie would get so much of a mixed reception that it, in the end, obviously got.<br/><br/>In hindsight: Yes, evil Parker was annoying and portrayed wrong. Yes, the dancing scene was cringe-worthy and Venom didn't get a proper movie-transition. Even the origin of the symbiont seemed stupid and out of place to me - it literally dropped from the sky and that's all you get to know about it in this movie. The scenes with aunt May boarded on kitsch, didn't have as much heart or relevance as they did in the previous installments and how Harry got to know about the truth of his fathers death made little to no sense.<br/><br/>With all that said, I still think people emphasis these things too much as they are just bits of the movie and didn't have that much of an impact on the whole experience it brought me. Where the it shines the most for me is Sand-man. To me he is the heart of this movie. He isn't portrayed as the stereo-type generic super-villain as his intentions are good, but very misguided and misunderstood. From his first scene to the end, I absolutely loved this character because his ""human"" side was portrayed well and I, to a certain degree, could relate to him. The actor Thomas Haden Church did a terrific job with the role. Also notable: the scene after his transformation where he realizes what he has become, was superbly done.<br/><br/>One other thing I love about this movie is, naturally, the action. These days, and even back then when I first saw Spider-Man 3, I barely get excited with the action of most superhero movies. But this movie is somewhat of an exception. The fights are much fun to watch, mainly because of the many ideas that are in them. It also helps a lot that you can tell what's going on. They are well thought-out and polished. The mix between CGI and the real thing is pulled off great. Sand-man brings a lot to it, even though others are fun too like the first fight with Green Goblin Jr. The hype the movie builds up towards the grand-finale when I was watching it for the first time, was something special to me and I rarely come across that in any kind of movie.<br/><br/>And the ending... I really loved the ending of Spider-Man 3. It's probably my favorite ending of any movie in this genre. It felt just right, was satisfying and ultimately a well-worthy conclusion to the Sam Raimi trilogy. It got a little bit emotional and bittersweet and I absolutely would've loved to see where things would go from there... but we all know what became of that...<br/><br/>While the movie seemed to be overburdened with characters and had too much going on - in the end I think it worked out well for such an huge undertaking. Granted, there undoubtedly are some lose ends and some characters such as Venom or Gwen Stacy didn't by far get the attention or development they deserve, but nonetheless the movie tells an entertaining story from start to finish and the main core of it is still intact and comprehensive. It still has it's underlying messages about life like in the previous Spider-Man movies, even though to a quite lesser degree, but it's still nice. One could only imagine how great this movie could've been if Raimi had freedom with it and wasn't forced by the studio to use this or that, but in my opinion he did the best he could do and that he managed to balance it all out the way he did, is impressive.<br/><br/>In conclusion: what it all boils down to is how much tolerance you have for the flaws mentioned above, because they sure are there. But the movie has also plenty of good things going on and it still retains the same charm as the previous ones. To me it was very much the best Spidey movie when I first saw it and still kinda is (because I see them all more as one big movie) and I don't think there's anything wrong with that."
"mariuskleppe","9","1","1","20 January 2014"," A magnificent movie that's fun and full of action, as well as dramatic and full of emotion.
","I'm a big fan of the Sam Raimi Spidey-trilogy, including this 3rd one (that have split fans a bit). Many people claim it's a bit to much, but I think it's an epic ending to an epic trilogy. Tobeys performance as Peter/Spidey is incredible, the story is good and the visual effects are beautiful. I can understand why many people think it's too much though, cause after all there are three villains, love conflicts and black suit all mixed up, but I think it works. There are so much good things here. It really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster for over two hours. It got something that many big movies misses, it got heart and soul. I've watched this movie (as well as the first two) a lot of times, and I always get so sucked up in it, that I almost forget I'm back in the real world again after watching it. You can feel the lust for revenge, the heartache and the responsibility of being Spider-Man while you watch it. It simply rocks big time. At least almost as good as the two first."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","1","23 March 2012"," Undeserving of the hate
","""Great"" as in very entertaining, fun, but flawed definitely. I only saw this back when it came out, but now I see that Raimi certainly tried to do a lot more with this film. Part of its flaws comes from the way it all comes together, maybe in part due to it feeling way too rushed. Also, some of the dialogue is pretty bad. But overall, it definitely doesn't deserve all of hate it got when it came out, like at all. Yes, it's more messy, but damn it tries so many things that one can't blame it too much. Not to mention, there are a lot of great individual moments that are probably some of the best in the trilogy. It's incredibly funny as well, and Raimi infuses it with even more camp than before. Maguire and Franco are easily weaker here than in the first two though, and maybe it's because of the more dramatic material but they drag down some of the scenes. Dunst, on the other hand, stands out more than before. Here, because she also has more to work with, she manages to be the MVP of the cast, and it's not until this film that one can truly see how much she was needed in this franchise. Overall, a very good film, if not a great but flawed one/"
"maximvit","Null","1","1","4 September 2011"," Visually stunning, stylized, underrated superhero movie
","There is probably going to be lots of disagreement here, but I think this is the best Spider-Man movie out of Sam Raimi's trilogy.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 picks off where Spider-man 2 ended: with Peter Parker and MJ dating, growth of popularity as Spiderman, but of course, there are some problems. A strange black sludge starts to posses Spiderman, a new villain named Sandman appears and Peter's best friend, Harry gets the Green Goblin's gadgets and becomes the New Goblin in order to avenge his father.<br/><br/>This is probably something where we will agree: visually, it is the best. The stunning birth of Sandman, the intense mid-air fight between Spiderman and the New Goblin, the creepy black sludge and the spectacular ending fight scene are all amazing and would have deserved an Visual-effects Oscar more then Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>But not just in technicals, I think this movie is better then Spiderman and Spiderman 2. The storyline is well great, even tough there are basically three villains, it is still well put together to go with the relationship between MJ and Peter and the murder of Peter's uncle. The actors all do just as good, (and that is very good) job like in the first two movies and this is probably the funniest movie out of the three as well."
"star_guitar28","5","1","1","11 October 2007"," Too many bad guys spoil the broth
","First of all I will say that I loved the first two Spider man movies I thought they where extremely enjoyable. But this third installment for me failed in many levels to the previous two, first of all the length of the movie was unbelievably long, secondly there where too many bad guys where as the other two movies mainly had one. There was far too much going on for any of the villains characters to develop jumping from the Sandman to Goblin Jr to Venom and of course the Enemy within i.e the Black suit. The previous movies worked with single villains that developed through the movie like the Goblin in the first movie and Doc Ock in the second. This would have been a much better movie if it had focused on just one villain which I would have liked to have been more of the Venom.<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences were impressive but there comes a point when CGI goes into overdrive and you eventually cant make out whats going on.<br/><br/>Also when I saw this in the movies the scene where Peter Parker dances down the street under the influence of the black suit was very cringing and I saw a couple actually walk out...<br/><br/>I would probably recommend this to fans of Spider man but even then this is definitely the weaker of the trilogy."
"banebatman","3","1","1","4 September 2007"," They had great power...what about responsibility
","The movie had great potential with its established cast and budget. It had a great story to lean on...but for some reason Sam Raimi used a bunch of coincidences...why? For instance, you got so many space orientated organizations, but nobody did see the meteors landing. And its so happens that Parker is the only guy there at the time. O and what the hell happened to the Sandman's daughter. Did she die or what. To many loose ends. Maybe the studio had its way or somebody else, but the bottom line is that Spider-Man gives a bad name to its predecessors. If you are going to see it because of the special effects, do so. But if you want to see a great story watch something else."

","I've never been impressed with Spiderman, to be perfectly honest. I thought he was all well and good until the movie came out, which sowed doubt in my mind about the whole license. If Spiderman is being true to the source material then I have been utterly tricked. Out and out, Spiderman is the biggest pansy ever committed to the silver screen.<br/><br/>While I hate to tarnish 75 years of tradition (or however long Spiderman has been in circulation), I feel that it has to be said that Spiderman has no edge. He takes one in this film but it's funny how this plays out. He acts like an evil emo hipster who does evil things like expose rival photographer's unethical photoshopping techniques (MY GOD PARKER, HOW COULD YOU), and then obsesses about how Sandman's gun went off in Uncle Ben's belly but for Parker to wish for his death is totally unbecoming. Especially amusing is the way that Parker snaps at the landlord who caustically reminds Parker that the rent is due - ""You'll get your rent when you fix your door!"" As if it was morally questionable in any sense to demand what you are promised, or set wrongs right, or god forbid, wish for someone's death every now and then (you know you have similar thoughts about someone at work). I understand Parker is a pure character... and yet the pragmatist in me utterly condemns him. Here he is, blessed with incredible superpowers, and he can barely support himself, let alone his aunt/surrogate mother.<br/><br/>Maybe I was an antifan from the start, I just never knew it."
"tfrizzell","Null","1","1","28 May 2007"," Spider Bites.
","Third and by far the weakest in the famed ""Spider-Man"" trilogy falls way short due to characters that have apparently run their depth course, hully-gully direction by co-writer Sam Raimi, and a running time that goes way beyond the outer limits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to have everything going his way. His girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst) now knows he truly is the titled character and they are about to be wed. Plus her aspirations as a serious stage actress seem to be becoming reality while his college career continues to take flight. However, there are evil forces that loom in seemingly every direction. James Franco is back and still seeking revenge on his father's death which occurred at the conclusion of the original. An escaped convict (Thomas Haden Church), who might have had something to do with Maguire's uncle's death, has become some strange sort of super-villain after a strange accident that gives the character human/sand-like powers. Then we have an upstart cameraman (Topher Grace) who wants to steal Maguire's spotlight at work, and finally a strange cosmic black substance that attaches itself to entities of rage. Still with me? ""Spider-Man 3"" comes with too much baggage. The first two were heavy enough as they were, but this one is way too cute and smart for its own good. Too many side-stories, too many black and white characteristics of the major players and too many special effects-laden sequences that dull rather than excite cause this movie to be a gigantic bore of near epic proportions. It is saying a lot when B-movie ham Bruce Campbell, with his typical cameo, ends up being the most interesting and intriguing part of the whole flimsy production. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"PWNYCNY","6","1","1","11 May 2007"," Shallow comic book story
","What can one say about a movie that is entirely devoid of intellectual content? Such a movie defies review because there is nothing substantive to review. All the talent, all the time, all the money and all the other creative resources that were expended to make this movie are ultimately wasted, all for nothing. Spiderman and his enemies are comic-book characters and no amount of special effects can change that fact. The characters are insipidly shallow, but what else is to be expected from a comic book story brought to the screen? That does not mean that movie can't be a moneymaker because it is a commercial product, but even compared to Superman or Batman, the movie does not contain enough intellectual content to sustain any drama. But if this is the kind of escapist fare that sells, then more power to the market place.<br/><br/>There is one exception to the above comments.

","I love the first 2 spider man films. The simple fact that they are popular with geeks and non geeks alike is amazing. Rami has done a fantastic job with bringing Ditko's comic to life so far. The films have been griping in everyway...emotionaly...special fx....action....drama...character...cheesy comedy..etc.<br/><br/>Now, about the third film. I found it EXTREMELY entertaining. The action and effects were awesome. The way they presented the characters were interesting and unique. Venom is done really well as is dark spidey, mj, harry, and sandman. However its all a bit too much to be in one movie. The film rides on its action and fx, and sacrifices the tender character stories that made spidey 1 and 2 fantastic. There is just too much going on. There is like 5 main subplots...and im still trying to figure out the journey peter was trying to make. I honestly didn't feel there was enough duality in peter vs dark spidey....plus Venom doesn't have nearly enough screen time and Sandman has way too much. The mj/peter subplot that was so amazing in the other films is almost gone completely...its touched on for a bit but your left wanting so much more it hurts to have the movie be over. However, it was REALLY fun to watch and very pretty to look at.<br/><br/>Basically, i think SPIDER MAN 3 succeeds as a fun film with lots of rewatch value...but it just has too much going on to let you become involved in the story and what they do focus on are the wrong plot points.<br/><br/>just my opinion.....ITS TOTALLY WORTH SEEING THOUGH.<br/><br/>PS.

I guess cramming 2 and a half villains (""New"" Goblin doesn't count as a whole villain of course) in a feature-length film would require a bit of choppiness to the flow, which was what happened. A sad event to a character here, anger there. <br/><br/>And what was with spidey in the symbiote suit? He looked like an emo kid. Ahh... isn't darkness and anger metal's realm? I may be nit-piking but emo kids usually spend a lot of the time tear-dropping, and not kicking all sorts of ass and being belligerent. Am I really that out of touch with kids these days? *sigh*<br/><br/>By the way, Tobey McGuire did a fantastic job of acting out the anger and in-your-face attitude that comes with Evil Spidey. Well played, indeed. Whoever painted his face up and combed his hair and picked out his clothes should be shot. Repeatedly. <br/><br/>I guess I'm just disappointed that the movie doesn't capture that same feeling of the human condition the first one did, and to a lesser extent, the second. I remember having feelings like parker did all the time when I was younger, dealing with all this crap at once. <br/><br/>Now it appears that on top of all that he has an alien suit and a sandman to deal with. And, of course, what would a Spider-Man Movie be without a bunch of Mary Jane drama. What a load.<br/><br/>The effects were pretty decent, I had the pleasure of not watching it in the theater (this strips movies of their ""shock"" value of the effects). Without 200 decibel, bass-heavy sounds you can really pay attention to the overall feel of the effects. Hooray for higher poly counts. Great. Whatever. The sand looks like sand. And, in many places, moves a lot like it. Whoopity-doo. Venom's spaztic and evil movements were pretty neat in my opinion, I'd like to attribute that to art directors and story board artists, and Todd McFarlane of course.<br/><br/>Overall, comic book movies are reverting to the bland, cheesy, boring, cardboard crap the 80s vomited forth. Where's Dolph Lundgren? I can't wait for Transformers from Michael Bay, it might just be the knife in the coffin that sends the comic book movies back into hibernation just as the punishers and supermans did in the 80s. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan, we need you now!"
"theshadow908","7","1","1","7 May 2007"," An amazing end to the trilogy.
","When Spider-Man 3 begins, everything is going great for Peter Parker. New York finally loves and supports Spider-Man, he's doing great in school, and his relationship with Mary Jane couldn't be better. In fact, he's going to pop the question. Unfortunately, things start happening that get in the way of Peter's plans. Harry Osborn returns as the New Goblin and tries to kill him, he finds out that a new villain called the Sandman is his uncle's actual killer, and a strange alien creature takes the form of a black costume and tries to possess him. The alien begins to make Peter more aggressive as his new found fame goes to his head, making him cocky. Finally, Peter realizes that something is wrong, and he gets rid of the strange substance. Unfortunately, the creature attaches itself to Eddie Brock, a man who has lost everything to Peter Parker, and a new villain is formed. Quite possibly the most evil and deadliest villain Spider-Man has ever faced. Though this movie isn't as good as the first two in the series, it's still amazing and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>What I liked about the first two movies was that they had a formula to them that allowed for plenty of personal drama for the characters as well as plenty of action. In this movie, Sam Raimi tries to squeeze in tons of personal drama between Peter and Mary Jane as well as Peter and Harry, and Peter and Eddie Brock, and Sandman and his daughter, and the list goes on, while also having action scenes featuring New Goblin, Sandman, a malfunctioning crane, and eventually Venom. This made certain scenes seem rushed and pointless. I liked that they kept the movie both funny and serious, because the humour in this series has always been a high point for me. The twenty or so minutes where Peter becomes evil were so enjoyable and humorous to me that I just couldn't stop smiling. The plot isn't that bad because it covers all the points that needed to be covered, and by the end of the movie it ties everything up nicely, leaving no need for a 4th film though I'm sure that it will happen. The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The crane sequence was done really well and featured some of the best special effects yet. Also, the ways Spider-Man maneuvered in that scene were amazing. Both of Peter's fights with Harry were incredibly awesome. They were the most violent and intense fights in the whole series, and I loved them. As with the first two films there were a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe. Sam Lee's cameo in this film was his worst cameo to date. Now, what I really didn't like about this film was the characters of Sandman and Venom. The movie needed New Goblin because it was a continuation, but either Sandman or Venom should have been cut out. My reason is that Sandman was pretty much pointless to the rest of the story, and if he was gone, Venom could have had more screen time and development. If Venom was taken out, his character wouldn't have been destroyed the way it was. Venom had so little screen time that it literally annoyed me. And half the time he was on screen, he retracted his mask so it was just Eddie Brock with a black suit on. I really didn't like what Raimi did with the character, though I am happy I saw him in live action at all. I also didn't like that Mary Jane was whining about Peter being Spider-Man through the whole movie, and that by the time the movie ended, Peter still hadn't proposed.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is just as good as the other two. Tobey Maguire did a good job playing both the good and the evil Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst played Mary Jane well once again, though I didn't really like her character in this. James Franco did an amazing job as Harry in this movie, especially when he was insane. He gave his best performance in this movie. Thomas Haden Church was pretty good as Sandman, he looked the part, but he didn't really get to do a whole lot with his talent. Topher Grace was funny as Eddie Brock, and he was surprisingly good when he became Venom. He's no longer Eric Foreman to me.<br/><br/>Overall, the first two films are better, but Spider-Man 3 is an amazing ending to this trilogy, and if they decide to make a 4, 5, and 6, I hope they can be as epic and as interesting as these films were.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"chris-stanley-1","5","1","1","7 May 2007"," Weaving an alright web
","Last night I went with some friends to see the long awaited Spiderman 3. Being big Spidey fans, this was the movie we had waited 3 years for. As the Columbia logo appeared on screen and the Marvel Logo was playing, I started to get chills down my spine. The story goes that Peter is going to ask MJ to marry him. Yet at the same time Pete is being caught up in his own fame of being Spider-man. There are 3 villains this time around. We have Sand-man (Thomas Hayden Church); we see Harry as the New Goblin (James Franco) and my personal favourite Eddie Brock/ Venom (Topher Grace). I really didn't know what to think about the film as it tried to pack to much background stories into one movie. To be honest there should have been much more Spidey action. The third instalment is very dark and shows Peters dark side of Spider-man after he is hosted by an organism from outer space. The action and special effects were dazzling, with some great shots of New York. The film did not have that certain 'feel good' feeling like the previous two had. The Battle royal at the end of the film was an eye popper with great looking special effects and action sequences. Venom is just plain brutal towards Spider-man, witch I think is what his character is all about. All in all the movie was enjoyable with a very memorable cameo from Bruce Cambell, but just wish there was more of Spidey himself. Thanks for looking."
"urbansilverstar","6","1","1","6 May 2007"," not nearly as dark as they would have you believe
","After months of being treated with snippets of trailers I can say I was very much looking forward to this movie, but left the auditoria feeling a little let down.<br/><br/>As a whole the film is well balanced, but being a person who grew up with spidey I was somewhat disappointed. The return of the goblin in the first act was a good touch, but after that I found myself waiting for more action and(& the dark side) as I sat watching peter fumble away with his pointless relationship with the self absorbed Mary ""I'm an actress!"" Jane (she does finally give it up). The sandman I found an intriguing character, with a real sympathy to his struggle to accept what he has done, and you do find yourself forgiving him. J Jonah, editor at the bugle was fantastic, injecting the film with some excellently written comedy, and ""dark"" Pete, strutting down the street checking out talent in a Saturday night fever stride was priceless.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Gwen Stacy I thought was a little underplayed and Pete's promised downfall and journey to the dark side lasted only for a short part of the film, and not nearly as much as the trailers and poster made out. Venom I felt was under-used and only had what I would consider a cameo, Truly I would have had him as the villain in spider-man 4, it was like trying to jam too many socks in the draw. It could have been nicely edited to just over an hour and forty minutes if they had done that... plus have a hook setup for another money turning sequel.<br/><br/>I think the cruncher was the last 15 minutes which I loved and hated. The action and effects were great, but the spidey/Venom fight wasn't nearly the ""epic"" battle I was expecting, plus the cringe worthy American Patriotism in the big giant flag, and comments that somehow surfaced were terrible. The British reporter was pure cheese: ""what brutality"",...sure was!. plus the inclusion of Sam raimi's spawn with the truly awful lines: ""awesome"" & ""wicked cool"" made me shake my head in disbelief.<br/><br/>At the end of day though I found that the sum of the cheese dialogue didn't outweigh the overall performance, and will(not if), go and see the 4th instalment, because let's be honest, where's there's interest, there's money, and hopefully they'll iron out the cheddar."
"jdzlaw","5","1","1","6 May 2007"," Could have been better
","I agree with many of the posters here. The movie is too long, confusing, plot holes you could drive a truck through, how many times did Harry die and come back, what's with the musical numbers? I think there is a core of a good film here. Although it has been done already, the good side/bad side thing could really have been brought out more (Anakin Skywalker anyone?). With Spidey on the one side, trying to do good, fighting evil, but doing bad things; and with Flint on the other side, doing bad while trying to get money to save his daughter. Could have been an interesting comparison.<br/><br/>Anyway, not a terrible movie by any stretch, but could have used some tightening up"
"ryano2099","1","1","1","6 May 2007"," Good, but could have been amazing..
","This movie made the same mistake that X-Men 3 and Fantastic Four made is have a lot of crap in first 2/3 of the film and save everything for the big finish that isen't so big and is over before you know it. I think the pace was just wrong in this film. A lot of this film just felt like left over ideas that wern't used in the first 2 films. I found a lot of this movie to be WAYYYYY to cheezy. There is even a point in the film that I couldn't believe that it ended up in the final cut as it did. Eddy Brock has just become Venom and is swinging through looking for sandman to aid in him killing spiderman..sandman stops him as hes swinging, thinking its spiderman and venom looks up and screams at him, sandman obviously shocked, throws venom away from him at a wall which venom naturally lands on his feet.. so what does sandman do after seeing that horrible monster scream at him?? Starts walking away like nothing happened?? Does that happen often to this guy or what? Or was is just not THAT black suit spiderman guy he was looking for??? That scene alone says volumes about what went wrong in this film. Best part about this film? VENOM! period."
"shannon_potter","6","1","1","6 May 2007"," Good, not Great.
","The movie was good. Not great. Good. It was entertaining, but disappointing because it did not live up to the 2nd (which was an amazing film). I like Venom, I thought he looked very cool and I think Brock was good. The Church scene was great, just like the comics. Sandman just wasn't developed enough, I did not feel for him and his daughter story, nor did I really know what he wanted or much else about him. I really liked Harry. I thought he did a really good job acting and he was a pleasant surprise at the end. However, two thing REALLY bothered me: 1)The parts in the street with Peter dancing and flirting were so lame, I wish they were not in the film. We get that he's a ""bad ass"" as Venom already, they were unnecessary. Instead, they should have worked on developing Eddie Brock or Flint Marco more; 2) The American flag behind Spidey. Oh god! Did I ever want to puke! I mean come on!! Did the American government sponsor Spiderman??!! Just awful. Overall, it was a tad disappointing considering I'm a bid Spidey fan and I LOVED the 2nd one, but I enjoyed watching it and I plan on buying it."
"ToddWebb","6","1","1","6 May 2007"," Decent action flick, but the weakest of the trilogy. Wait for video.
","First let me say that I'm a big fan of the review written by this guy: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur15235922/comments I agree with every word he wrote. In fact, I liked his review better than I liked the movie.<br/><br/>I really *wanted* to enjoy this movie. You have to truly *want* to enjoy in order to like it at all. I left the theater feeling slightly entertained, but only because I strongly yearned for it.<br/><br/>The movie is weak from beginning to end. It has all the parts needed for a great action flick, but with no continuity. All the separate scenes felt disjointed and slopped together. The characters go through changes almost at random, every 5 minutes. Peter Parker's comic change in the middle of the movie was over the top, but it worked for me. It was meant to be comical and it was. The rest of his emotions were almost ridiculous. Every time he cried the opening-night audience around me laughed hysterically.<br/><br/>I won't ruin the ending. I don't need to. Just think, ""cliche"" and you already know the ending. The movie was drowning in sappy emotion towards the end. I can just imagine the writers of this script sitting around saying to each other, ""Everyone does movies with non-stop action til the end. Let's deliver a real message."" I choked on that message as it was crammed down my throat.<br/><br/>And in the end, they finished off with even more sappy emotion which left me totally unsatisfied. No uplifting joy at the end of this movie. Even as the credits rolled, it was a soft, slow, almost depressing music that played.<br/><br/>All around, just BLAH. Wait for the DVD rental."
"davorm","1","1","1","6 May 2007"," So much camp it should have come with a bag of marshmallows...
","I had high hopes for the 3rd part, the trailers were very deceiving. That is nothing new really, most horrible movies don't put any clips of scenes that are not good in trailers. Really movie editors should do a trailer first and if they like that edit the movie to that feel, and leave all the campy over the top crap on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The story was pretty weak but it had a lot of characters that felt flat because there was no time to develop them into anything worth while. For me that wasn't really the issue, I could have lived with a weak story as long as it was believable enough, and the movie had the action to fill up our entertainment cup. Luckily after reading reviews and getting a phone call from a friend letting me know that he walked out half way through, I let down my hype and was ready to get disappointed. And while watching the movie, there were little ""humorous"" scenes in and around that could be easily looked past, but then Peter got Emo... er taken over by the symbiot, and made a real fool out of himself. I really understand where the script was trying to go with this, but it was executed so badly. It would have worked for sure in a comic book or even as a cartoon, but live action? Do people not look at these scenes after they're shot and see what a mess it is? Not sure if it's the actor's fault (Toby just can't pull of some things, like not looking so stupid when he's crying) or the Director's. Ether way there is no excuse for that.<br/><br/>So that is what basically ruined the movie for me, taking that whole section out and if you haven't seen the movie you will know what it is when/if you see it, would make for a better film. Still weak, but at least not a 5 out of 10, at least a 7.<br/><br/>My suggestion to people seeing it for the first time, as soon as you see Emo-Peter walking on the street like a Greaser. Get up of your seat, go get a refill on your 2 liter cup of soda, take you're time in the washroom, make conversation with the staff and come back in about 10-15 minutes. It's definitely a better use of your time."
"brian090888","7","1","1","5 May 2007"," An Interesting Sequel
","Overall, Spiderman 3 was very good. It offered some more insight into the characters of Spiderman and Harry.<br/><br/>Yeah, there was a little bit of cliché. Harry not remembering how Spiderman killed his father for about half the movie and Harry forgiving Spidey for being a jerk and blowing off half his face...<br/><br/>There was also one scene that was supposed to be really poignant, when Harry was dying, where everyone in the theater laughed because Tobey Maguire couldn't conjure up the tears.<br/><br/>That being said, it found a way to regain some of its depth from the first film and had more refined action than the 2nd. People say it was too convoluted, but it was a rather simple story to follow if you have half a brain. I'm sick of people asking Hollywood to dumb down its films just because some people can't keep up.<br/><br/>Falling somewhere between the first two films, it was a satisfying sequel. I would give it a score of 7.7/10... but I can't vote that number and it just wasn't good enough for an 8."
"alexis_240","7","1","1","5 May 2007"," Very good but come on Mr. Raimi you can do better!
","It is very painful to admit that the eagerly awaited Spiderman 3 is only satisfactory and not great as we expected.<br/><br/>The three villain scheme works against the film and provides us with two shallow villains. Sandman is tied to the murder of Peter's uncle (Ben) in an attempt to give him a bit more of a background. Venom on the other hand is totally unnecessary and barely gets enough screen time.<br/><br/>What mostly disappointed me is that a director as talented as Sam Raimi chose to use such clichés. First and best being MJ as the person who is once again in danger near the end of the film. That woman just can't keep out of trouble. This is now the third time she is captured and used as bait. The typical girl-in-trouble-man-to-the-rescue recipe has been done a billion times and does not add any originality to this flawed movie. MJ's presence seems out of place. Apparently sandman and venom managed to miraculously guess what girl Parker is interested in and where she lives! Why not have them take hostages and challenge Spiderman to come and save them? MJ could then see the whole thing on TV and rush to the scene. Just because Kirsten Dunst is your leading lady Mr. Raimi that doesn't mean she is the one who's life has to be threatened every time.<br/><br/>Another cliché we are all familiar with is the classic death scene where one friend ""gets it"" for the other friend and then says something while laying down which usually re-establishes their friendship and is then allowed to die in peace. I'd love to know how can people prolong death till they have said their take care of this, I love you or any phrases film characters have said before they died. Fine obviously Peter and Harry had to reconcile but this cliché could have been avoided. They could exchange their best friend lines during the battle in a brief moment not in the far too familiar way.<br/><br/>Finally I've heard that this installment might be the last (even though there are rumors of a possible 4th film), if this is true then this movie is even more flawed. Neither Peter nor MJ come even within a mile of a character peak. They were together at the end of the second film and they are together again when this one ends. They could have introduced a year or a month gap after which Peter proposes to MJ hence embarking on the next chapter of his life which is marriage. This could have been a good closure point but instead we get to see them back where they started.<br/><br/>Just like X Men 3, this movie is perfectly passable in terms of satisfying action sequences and excitement but this is simply not good enough considering how good the first two installments are.<br/><br/>7/10 pretty good but a worthy sequel or a proper closing chapter Spiderman 3 is, I'm sorry to say, not."

"manitou-full-moon","7","1","1","5 May 2007"," A slight case of too many villains spoil the broth
","Spider-Man 3 has to be one of the most hyped movies in history - and with expectations high, I went into it expecting it to be the best of the Spider-Man films.<br/><br/>However, upon emerging from the cinema, while not totally disappointed, I wasn't completely satisfied either. There was something missing from this one that was missing from the other two.<br/><br/>The main reason behind this is that this being the most expensive and ambitious of the three, the writers thought they could shoehorn in a lot more plot into two and a bit hours than they really could.<br/><br/>The story takes inspiration from the alien symbiont plot of the comics, where Spider-Man's suit turns black after bonding with an alien life-form, giving him increased power, but also bringing out his aggressive side. He becomes a bit of a jerk (he doesn't do anything really dark, apart from trying to annoy MJ), decides he needs to get rid of the suit by tearing it off in a belltower, at which point it bonds with Eddie Brock, who becomes Venom.<br/><br/>Now this would make for enough of a movie on its own, but the Sandman is also introduced. It turns out he really killed Peter's Uncle Ben, and Spider-Man thus goes out for revenge. And talking about revenge, Harry Osborn becomes the New Goblin and tries to kill Peter.<br/><br/>This is the problem with the film: it tries to combine three stories that could make an entire film themselves into one. None of the villains feels as fleshed out as Doc Ock or the first Green Goblin were, and thus you don't really feel that involved with the story. The effects are spectacular, especially the final Spider-Man/Harry Osborn vs Sandman/Venom fight, but they don't make up for the fact that there are just too many things going on at one time. Drop either Venom or Sandman, and the film would have been better. You could still have room for the entire Harry/New Goblin thing, and do the remaining primary villain of the film justice.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is slightly disappointing, but does have some rather good moments typical of the others, such as Bruce Campbell's cheesy French stereotype waiter, or the rather daft but hilarious dance sequence in the jazz club.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is good, but could have been a lot better had one of the two primary villains been shunted over to the next one, where they could have been fleshed out more and made more interesting."
"spicy_crab","7","1","1","5 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 is a good film. Spiderman & Spiderman 2 were great films.
","In comparison to the previous films, especially Spiderman 2, this film takes a beating. It is still a good film, but everything passes so quickly its hard to take it whats really going on. Spiderman 2 succeeded in where it paced the film correctly. Each character (including villains) was given the proper amount of time to flesh them out and built perfectly for Spiderman 3, although the same success is nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>In this film, the main problem is that no characters are given adequate screen time, and you are just overloaded with too much characters and information, which somewhat stops your enjoyment at times. You don't really sympathise or get involved with the characters, which is the main part of what makes a good film. There seems to be no real villain in this film, since harry is evil, but then not. Sandman is just someone who is sorry for himself and so basically takes it out on others, no real evil intentions. The real villain was Venom and darker side of Parker, but then they were given so little time in the film it was disappointing, since they could have been so much more. Characters that shone and stood out in the second film return without their flare. Jonah Jameson in particular, in contrast to the second film is just boring, with no energy and humour like before, and there are points in the film where Harry seems to have returned to being a boy all over again instead of a man. Christopher Young does a horrible job with the music, which played a big part in Spiderman 2 adding liveliness and atmosphere, but in this film Elfman's score is broken here and there and fused with Young's own score, which was at times far too corny and cheesy, and loud and garish when it needn't be.<br/><br/>There were still glimpses of brilliance throughout the film though, Maguire plays out the darker side of Parker really well, and it was just such a shame for it to be over so quickly. The fight scenes and CGI were good as usual, but the final confrontation with Venom was lacking. In the end, the film is just a good film. Its not as bad as some people say, since they were expecting something spectacular since the first two films were amazing - as was I, but this film did fail to deliver. I expected this film to blow me away. Only it didn't. The tie ups to some of the characters plots were weak and leave you with something to be desired, as with the ending.<br/><br/>It is really a shame since this film could have been so much more. Its sad to know that Spiderman 3 is the last for Maguire and others of the cast, since Spiderman 4 would have been a great chance to patch things up, and because of the ending, there's not so much going on anymore allowing the storyline in Spiderman 4 to focus on a new villain and storyline. In conclusion, the trilogy ends by hitting the ground walking, when it should have been swinging and soaring."
"tmhoops34","7","1","1","5 May 2007"," A few great parts, but not enough.
","I felt a little let down at the end of SM 3. There were some really cool things about the movie, mainly the appearance of Venom, Spider Man's fight scene with the Sand Man, and the final fight scene, but there was a lot that I wasn't happy with. I was disappointed by the lack of times that Venom was on screen. They had Peter's interactions with Eddie Brock, but there wasn't enough fighting between Spider Man and Venom. If anything, Sand Man was the main villain in this movie. I also think they went for too much of a comic side when Peter was trying to make MJ jealous. They could have done a better job than having Peter dancing in a jazz club. I enjoyed the movie, but they could have made it so much better."

The first one had the best story and better action scenes. The second had the best action scenes and a better story. However this one had an equal balance of both. I liked it, even though it wasn't the best. I definitely think they should make a 4th and somehow bring venom back to life with carnage. That would be awesome.

"bachwiz18","9","1","1","5 May 2007"," Very good, but not the best
","There have been numerous negative reviews for Spider-Man 3 in the past few days, but I must say I disagree with most of them. People have argued that the plot was over-crowded, but I don't think that's the case. One of the villains, New Goblin (aka Harry), didn't need too much introduction, as his thread line has been woven throughout the series. Sandman (aka Flint Marko) was woven into the story's theme of revenge and forgiveness very well, because Peter's vengeful nature that is brought out with the symbiote causes a lot of his hatred toward Sandman. Marko's back story and character reminded me a lot of Doc Ock. As for Venom (aka Eddie Brock), his back story was good enough, and it also relates a lot with revenge, as Peter, again acting with the symbiote, causes Brock to lose his job, and Brock wants him dead.<br/><br/>Now for the story itself. (SPOILERS AHEAD.) I'll go over the key parts of the story... 1) Peter vs. Harry #1: Harry attacks Peter by surprise, and after a great battle, Harry crashes into something hard and loses his memory. He forgets that Peter is Spider-Man, and they become friends again. 2) MJ loses her job: MJ's play gets a bad review, and she is fired. She goes to Harry for comfort, because Peter is busy and doesn't have time for MJ at the moment. 3) Peter saves Gwen: After a freak crane accident many stories up, Peter saves Gwen Stacy, a friend of his, and while receiving a key to the city for it from Captain Stacy, he kisses Gwen upside-down, causing MJ to be very jealous. 4) Peter vs. Sandman #1: Peter and Sandman (Flint Marko, Uncle Ben's actual killer) fight for the first time. Peter is unable to stop Marko from robbing an armored car. 5) Symbiote attachs to Peter: A strange substance called symbiote from outer space gets onto Peter and causes his suit to change color to charcoal black. It also causes Peter to become very aggressive and cocky. 6) Peter vs. Sandman #2: Peter avenges his uncle's death by killing Sandman...or so it seems. We later find that Marko survives. 7) Peter meets Eddie Brock: Eddie Brock, a freelance photographer, takes pictures of Spidey in his black suit, which J. Jonah Jameson likes better that Peter's pictures. Peter later proves that Brock's pictures are fake, and Brock is fired. 8) Harry and Mr. Osborn: Harry gets his memory back, and decides to get revenge on Peter once more. 9) MJ rejects Peter: Harry forces MJ to reject Peter for good, and Harry then tells Peter that he is dating MJ now. 10) Peter vs. Harry #2: They fight at Harry's apartment in the secret room, and after the new black Spider-Man defeats Harry, Harry attempts to get Peter with a pumpkin bomb, but it ends up hitting Harry and disfiguring half of his face. 11) An angry Peter goes to MJ's jazz club with Gwen Stacy and does a seductive dance with her, still acting aggressively with the symbiote. MJ is angry, and Peter slaps her, and he later feels very guilty. 12) Bell Tower: While Eddie Brock is asking God to kill Peter Parker, Peter is two stories above him, ripping off the symbiote. It lands on Brock, causing him to turn into Venom, and he now knows that Peter is Spider-Man. 13) Sandman meets Venom: Sandman and Venom meet, and decide to set a trap for Spider-Man by kidnapping MJ and trapping her in Venom's black web about 80 stories up. 14) Peter confronts Harry: Peter asks Harry for his help against Venom and Sandman, but Harry is still angry at their last confrontation and rejects him. 15) Harry and Bernie: Harry's butler tells Harry that his father killed himself, not Spider-Man, and Harry realizes that Peter was right. 16) Spider-Man vs. Venom and Sandman: After an unsuccessful rescue, a horrified New York City watched as Spider-Man is held down by Venom and nearly killed by Sandman. 17) Spider-Man and New Goblin vs. Sandman and Venom: Harry saves Peter and they both fight to defeat the other two and also save MJ. 18) Peter vs. Brock: Venom is about to impale Spider-Man, but Harry rushes in and takes the blade for Peter, saving his life but then killing himself. Peter detaches Brock from the symbiote, and when he destroys it with a pumpkin bomb, Brock tries to stop it and also dies. 19) Peter forgives Marko: After hearing Marko's story, Peter forgives him for killing Uncle Ben, and Marko leaves to continue searching for a cure for his daughter. 20) MJ forgives Peter: Peter comes to MJ afterward, who forgives him for his behavior earlier.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie, but I think Spider-Man 2 was a little better. My only real complaint was that Venom came too late in the movie. Otherwise, I'd see it again any time!"

","Spider-man 3 was an enjoyable movie but as a big fan, probably my least favorite of the 3. I wish they had spent more time with a plot instead of just throwing villains in for the sake of having them. The special effects for Sandman were great but it definitely felt like there was no real reason to have him in the movie other than just getting a cool villain from the comics into the movie. The Venom / Spidey dynamic was good and I wished they had focused on that more, letting Peter delve a little more into his bad side. They could have definitely amped up Eddie Brock's character as well, playing into his rivalry with Peter more. They also focused too much on the relationship between Mary Jane and Peter. Obviously, that is a major part of the story, but it felt more like a romance movie / drama than an action movie at many times. Overall, it was good but not great."

","visually it was jaw dropping (i saw it in IMAX), Raimi captures the acrobatic nature of spider man that spiderman 1 did not do, and 2 pulled of but not as well as i could. the CG was great especially Sandman who was pulled of brilliantly...that being said there are some flaws the acting was sub par but Macguire and Dunst are good actors, i think the script limited them. Franco was great at some points, but completely killed all his important parts. One montage while Peter is being stylish and bad is way too long, and had some funny parts that got old very quickly and just interrupted the movie in general. All over it was entertaining, either because it was awesome, or extremely corny<br/><br/>Breakdown: Ups: AMAZING CG, great action, high octane with acrobatic style, cool story, generally entertaining, well directed Downs: corny at some parts, annoying montage"
"curtroo32","7","1","1","5 May 2007"," A solid movie, but not groundbreaking
","Spiderman 3 was worth the $7.50 that I paid for a matinée showing. I was not disappointed by the latest sequel, but I was not surprised by anything either. The special effects were just that, special. Amazing graphics were on display when any of the characters went into action. However, with the possible exception of the formation of the Sandman, unfortunately the movie did not create anything new with the graphics. The same intense web-slinging as the first two movies was here as well, but no sequence that was truly memorable. <br/><br/>The acting was much improved from Spiderman 1 and 2. Especially from Dunst. She almost ruined the first Spideys for me, but actually did a decent job in this flick. Franco also greatly improved his performance the third time around (enter catchy ""third time's a charm for Franco"" line here). Bryce Dallas Howard is a remarkable actress casted in an unremarkable role. Howard has stunning beauty, but she just is not the ""hot chick"" Gwen Stacy is supposed to be. For that role, they could have picked up any of the dozens of incredibly random amazingly hot chicks throughout the movie. Try to count them all if you can. The casting of Topher Grace for Venom just was not right. <br/><br/>The plot had glimpses of greatness (just the mention of Venom makes it a possibly great movie), but ultimately fell short. Too many villains, not enough time. Harry Osborn was the best villain, which is very sad when you consider the fact Venom was part of this movie. My biggest disappointment with this movie was the flow of the plot. While the plot was not obviously jaded, it did not completely come together as one story either. This is most likely the result of too many villains. Another letdown were the inconsistencies in the movie. There were too many unrealistic events that made me sit there and say to myself, ""That would not happen"" (and that is taking into account and accepting the comic book storyline).<br/><br/>There was way too much crying in this movie, and sometimes at very inappropriate times. Humor took more of a front seat in 3 than it did in 1 and 2, and was well placed throughout the movie. Overall, it was a movie worth going to, and probably one I will see again with a different set of friends, but I did not appreciate it as much as the first two."

","Don't get me wrong, Spidey 3 was great fun; it just isn't much better than the previous two.<br/><br/>The CGI sort of sticks out too much. Venom and Sandman are well done, but some of the background CGI(buildings and such)during the action scenes actually made me cringe. Its as if they didn't have the budget to properly do the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Plus you get a really wimpy Venom.<br/><br/>As for the action, well, its nothing we haven't seen before.

"jadzia98","7","1","1","4 May 2007"," A *little* overdone, but still a lot of fun to be had
","******MINOR SPOILERS****** I've greatly enjoyed the Spiderman movies thus far. Not just for the action sequences, but also for how they portray Peter Parker as a very...human...superhero. Spiderman 3, like its predecessors, presents a strong character story along with mind-boggling action sequences. It not only explores Peter's darker side (courtesy of black goop from outer space), but also his apparent shortcomings in his relationship with MJ. His spidey sense may help the City of New York time and again, but doesn't help dealing with members of the opposite sex.<br/><br/>Out of the three villains, Harry's Goblin Junior was the only one fully developed as a character. Venom doesn't appear in all of his evilness until the last half-hour of the movie, and Flint Marko (aka, The Sandman) is reduced from a semi-sympathetic small-time crook with a sick daughter to a...well...blowing pile of sand. Sam Raimi did a fairly decent juggling act with the three villains, but I think that *maybe* he should have held over either Sandman or Venom for the next movie. Three villains fighting for screen time *did* make the film feel slightly bloated.<br/><br/>With everything said, Spiderman 3 is still a crowd-pleaser and will not disappoint (except the die-hard Venom fans, who may be displeased with his lack of screen time). 7 out of 10 stars."

","Took my 7 year old to see this movie and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Spidey goes a little weird as he deals with more instability in his love life with MJ and friendship with Harry. Then there is the weird entity he bonds with that creates the 'black' spidey bringing out all his hidden aggressions and not so nice side. There is a real message in this movie about how difficult it can be making choices and making the right ones - you will see a couple of the central characters struggling in this aspect - things do take an odd turn the last third of the movie as you will see. Some fantastic actions scenes and special affects. I loved the casting and some good humour thrown in for the kids. A surprise ending and one which perhaps leaves space for a 4th movie?"

","These movie sequels always turn out pretty nice. I enjoyed the first spiderman just as well as the second. I recently saw the third addition to the sequel film. For the most part I honestly enjoyed this movie. Many parts seemed very rushed and just plain awkward. The character development needed A lot of work. The movie seemed slapped together as if no priliminary editings were done. I was a bit disappointed the failed to use many of the sweet trailer scenes. This movie was quite impressive, the fight scenes were elaborate and full of suspense. I suggest to all you doods who have yet to view this film; watch the trailer, if the trailer attracts you, go see this movie. Keep in mind I extremely enjoyed this movie, but at the same time had a ""meh"" outlook. Overall I had more likes than dislikes."

"The_Void","7","7","18","8 May 2007"," Spider-Man swings back in style!
","Well, I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I walked out of Spider-Man 2, and despite all the bad things I've heard about it - Spider-Man 3 certainly didn't disappoint! Sure, you could spend all day picking faults with the film if you really wanted to, but what's the point? The first two films set the bar very high for comic book movies, and this film is not a disappointment considering what went before it. I have to say that I'm not a 'Spiderman fanboy' and have, in fact, not even read the comics; but that is testament to the brilliance of Sam Raimi's vision as he has managed to turn Spider-Man into a franchise that is accessible to everyone. The plot this time around is far more complex than in the last two. Spider-Man's celebrity status has grown among the people of New York City. His private life is going well also. However, good things never last long; and Spider-Man is about to face a threat from his former best friend Harry Osborne who wants revenge for the death of his father, as well as a 'simian' life form from another planet and the return of his uncle's killer, this time in the guise of powerful new villain 'Sandman'.<br/><br/>The most outstanding thing about this film is definitely the special effects. The fight scenes are brilliantly realised, and Sam Raimi certainly knows how to put a thrilling compilation together. The Sandman provides Spider-Man 3 with its best visuals, as the Terminator 2-style villain switches between sand and flesh in style, and the director constantly makes good use of this set-up. The visuals are obviously important in a film like this, and the film contains many a memorable scene. The best of these sequences come in the form of the creation of the villains, and while it has to be said that the way they come about is a little convenient (Sandman stumbles upon a nuclear experiment with sand...), it's not too difficult to believe since the film takes place in a world where a human/spider hybrid fights criminals in New York City. Popular Spider-Man villain Venom makes an appearance also, albeit it a brief one. However, the way that his character is built up makes up for the lack of screen time that the resulting villain has.<br/><br/>One of the most common problems viewers have picked out with this film is the fact that there are a lot of different plot lines going on. It's true that the film does become more than a little bit complex and the new characters suffer as a result of that. But the Spider-Man Universe is obviously a vast one, and Sam Raimi had a lot on his plate when it came to writing a story that would please the fans, stay true to the comics and entertain the audience. He actually juggles the numerous plot threads very well, as most of the points get across and the impending plot holes aren't enough to spoil anyone's enjoyment. Sam Raimi's sense of humour is brilliant, it was obvious that the likes of J.K. Simmons and B-movie legend Bruce Campbell were going to provide comic relief (and they do), but the funniest thing about the film for me was Peter Parker's reaction to the black suit. In a sequence that seems to be rather widely disliked, Spidey goes from geeky physics student to a (sort of) suave lady-killer with hilarious results. The sequence shows a lot more imagination than many directors would have given the idea of a superhero turned 'dark'.<br/><br/>The acting is largely decent also. The returning characters all give performances that you would expect from there, while the new additions fit in well. Thomas Hayden Church pretty much sleepwalks through his role, but he's still an asset to the film as he completely looks and feels like he has come straight out of a comic book! Topher Grace is slimy and irritating as he should be, and the sequence immediately before he changes into Venom says a lot about his character. Overall, Spider-Man 3 is not exactly a perfect film - but it's certainly an entertaining one and I know for sure that I'll be seeing it again!"
"majd_selbi","4","5","12","2 May 2007"," Spider Man 3 SUCKS!!
","I don't mean to be rude or anything, actually I was really waiting for this one to come out, when I saw the 1st spider man, I thought it was cool, when I saw the 2nd part, I though it was really great and I really enjoyed it, the effects and the story line were just great. But then comes the 3rd one, a stupid mistake by Sam Raimi and the producers, god and how the different stories of different people are put together, it makes me wanna puke. Simply put, if it was a low budget cartoon show and the 3rd spider man is made as an episode in it, children would think that it is a very stupid episode filling a place. There are many directional flaws in the movie, but they can be lived with, but there are like a 100 flaws in the story, a weird creature falls from the sky onto earth, leaving all the places in the world and falling right beside Peter Parker (talk about irony), a convict that is running away falls in a testing pit for some corporation, turning him into some creature, and then nobody even notices that something went wrong (and then the guy seems to have history with Parker, again, talk about irony), and a cute girl that attends classes with Parker is saved by spider man, she is the daughter of the city's head of police, and the girlfriend of Parker's competitor at work (and again, talk about irony). and many many other stupid moves that cant be tolerated, no offense, but people started to leave the theater before the movie's end.<br/><br/>Simply put, Spider man 3 is an abomination"
"leo1586","10","5","12","1 May 2007"," the ultimate spider-man movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","In this spider-man, Parker taking on three villains at once will make him once and for all one of the true underdogs out of all the marvel comics superheros. In my opinion this third installment is where they personally make the movie JUSTICE. Especially when it comes the villain known as VENOM. Because honestly, thats who's everyone been wait for a very very long time one final battle between good and evil In meaning SPIDER-MAN VS. VENOM LIKE ON THE Saturday MORNING CARTOONS, you know ! It makes you wonder who's gonna win spider-man or venom Better question yet will spider-man live or die. Guess will all find out on May 4th in a movie theater near you SO YOU BETTER GET READY.And also I would like to point out that the Sandman wasn't Ben Parkers' real killer. For those of you who watched the Saturday morning series and are real Spider-Man Fans, everyone should know that Mysterio (The villain with the crystal ball for a head) was the real killer Mysterious' real identity was the same person that robbed the one who set up the wrestling tournament that Spider-man was in.Let's make the movie right people !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! COME ON !!!!!!!!!!"
"seandirector","5","4","9","8 May 2007"," Tremendously disappointing
","Before I get into how much of a letdown Spider Man 3 is, let's talk about the first two. Spider Man was a light, entertaining action film with likable characters that were fairly well developed. It was very well made, and though it had fantasy elements, it stayed grounded in reality. Spider Man 2 was even better. The characters were more fleshed out, the special effects and action scenes improved, and the writing was tremendous (probably thanks to Michael Chabon).<br/><br/>Then along came Spider Man 3 (no pun intended). This was the movie that I was most looking forward to this summer, and it was a huge letdown. There are numerous problems with the film: 1) Too many villains. While I'm sure many comic book fans (I'm not one of them) were enthused about the New Goblin, Venom, and Sandman being in the third film, it's just too much.<br/><br/>2) Too much fantasy. Like I mentioned before, the first two films had fantasy elements, but remained grounded in reality. But when Sandman becomes this enormous mass of sand (with tires and other debris thrown in) it just crosses the line and is, again, too much. In fact, too much could sum up the whole movie. It tries for so much and utterly fails.<br/><br/>3) Ridiculous plot elements. So a meteorite crashes, out comes this black goo, it latches onto Peter, and it makes him emo. Meteorite goo makes him emo. Does that make sense to anyone? 4) Lack of character development. Too much action (there we go again with ""too much"") and not enough character elements. Aunt May seemed to have a smaller part than usual, and the attempts by the writers to flesh out the new characters (like Sandman) just fall flat.<br/><br/>5) Plot holes. Why did the butler keep his mouth shut for so long? Why did Peter want Gwen to kiss him, when it is obvious it would make MJ jealous? Why didn't MJ tell Peter about the play? 6) It's not even fun to watch. The action gets tiring, and all the joy is sucked out.<br/><br/>Go see the movie as a continuation of the series, but go in with low expectations. If you're expecting a film on the level of Spider Man 2, you're going to be let down.<br/><br/>P.S. Bruce Campbell is the best thing about this film."
"TOMNEL","7","4","9","6 May 2007"," Despite having some problems, this was very entertaining.
","Stars: Tobey Maguire, Kirstin Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, Topher Grace, Rosemary Harris, James Cromwell, Bruce Campbell, Willam Dafoe, Cliff Robertson.<br/><br/>For me, this was probably the most entertaining Spiderman. Not the best however. In this Spiderman film, it seemed like the villains were there just to give the movie an actual bad guy. It focused a lot on Peter Parker's inner feelings, along with Mary Jane's. The bad guys in this were The Sandman (Church) and Venom (Grace). It felt weird to me having Topher Grace as Venom, or even including Venom at all. The character of Venom doesn't appear until late in the film, which felt weird passing him off as a main villain at the last minute. Topher Grace, however, was great as the photographer that became Venom. He played a small, but great role. Thomas Haden Church played a quieter villain with not much to say, but he has a screen presence that came across quite well. James Cromwell was in this for some reason, I have no idea why. As for the movie itself, it was very entertaining. Sometimes it would become too much of a comedy for it's own good, or too dramatic, but it still was fun to watch, so I can't say I was disappointed. One more added bonus to the film was a hilarious cameo that worked well by Bruce Campbell as a maitre'd.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 136 mins."

"insomniac_rod","8","4","9","5 May 2007"," Objective comments from a non hard core fan: f/x cannot handle an entire movie.
","First of all, I must admit that I was skeptical with the cast of Thomas Haden Church and Topper Grace. I thought they were out of place in a movie like ""Spider-Man 3"". Haden Church is better known recently for his amazing performance in ""Sideways"" which is a light dramatic feature with comedic overtones. Grace is better known for the hit sitcom ""That 70's Show"". So why would cast them as Sandman and Venom? Venom is supposedly a huge, bulk villain. But Mr. Raimi demonstrated that his casts are always perfect and that he sees always something special on his actors. This was no exception. Besides Maguire and Franco, Haden Church and Grace were the better cast members. Dunst shouldn't be allowed to sing again! And her performance was pale just like her skin.<br/><br/>The f/x are truly great and the action is non-stop. Raimi knows how to create spectacular action sequences. There shouldn't be any complain on that aspect. Also, the direction is flawless. The Sandman effects were really impressive and something I haven't seen in many movies. I expected more from the Venom character; probably he's more popular than Spidey himself in the comics world! I'm not a huge Spider-man fan but I have to admit that this movie was impressive for the wrong reasons. I mean, the visuals and sound effects were simply spectacular but I felt that the plot lacked of deep emotions and substance. The sub-plots were easy to forget (unfortunately, specially the one with the super sexy Gwen) and didn't add anything special to the movie. So the movie focuses on Spider's new ""evil"" personality and his confrontations with his deepest fears. But does he solve them? No. And the villains deserved more on-screen time. No supporting characters (except for MJ and maybe Harry) were truly important for the movie. They didn't get much respect.<br/><br/>The ending was beyond reason but had ""moving"" moments. I truly didn't expect a resolution between Spider-Man and Sandman. Heck, the villain didn't even solve his main problem/situation.<br/><br/>SO I guess this is the last hurrah for Spidey."

","Spider-Man 3 returns after a three year absence with director Sam Raimi along with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Rosemary Harris and James Franco returning with some new cast members along the way. Spider-Man is back with a new attitude this time!<br/><br/>In the first Spider-Man movie it was all about Peter Parker (Maguire) donning the gift of fighting crime without anyone noticing; in Spider-Man 2 (The best of the trilogy), Peter Parker can't seem to balance himself as an ordinary guy making money along with being a crime-fighter for which he loses his powers and his truth is revealed to Mary Jane (Dunst) and Harry (Franco); in this installment Parker shows off to the public and at the same time dons another power: the symbiont for which in the comic book it gave Spider-Man more abilities than he ever imagined along with hurting those people he cares for along the way including Mary Jane.<br/><br/>Like any superhero movie comes the villains. In this latest installment we have Flint Marko/The Sandman played with sympathy by Thomas Hayden Church after making an escape from prison to get money for his ailing daughter (Perla-Haney Jardine, Kill Bill 2) while duking it out with Spider-Man after being revealed to Capt. John Stacy (James Cromwell) that Flint killed Ben Parker. Topher Grace plays the desperate Eddie Brock Jr., who after being humiliated by Peter Parker in the office dons the gift of the symbiont where he becomes Venom towards the end. I'm not sure if Harry Osborn could be consider a villain despite that in the film he carries amnesia and doesn't remember who he is after trying to kill Spider-Man.<br/><br/>While we still have all the old characters from the first two movies from Aunt May (played by Rosemary Harris with such little time), J. Jameson (the talented J.K. Simmons) and so forth, the only other character introduced in the film is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who falls in love with both Spider-Man after a rush with death.<br/><br/>Does Spider-Man 3 promise to keep the audience entertained? You bet!<br/><br/>Is it better than Spider-Man 1? Yes! The two sequels ARE better than the original.<br/><br/>Is it better than part 2? No! Part 2 was its own movie with dazzling special effects, non-stop action sequences and more like the Empire Strikes Back with more drama and care for characters.<br/><br/>Will i get my money's worth?

One minute it is very dark and moody, the next its slap-stick and it just doesn't fit. Most things in this film are out of place.<br/><br/>The most stand out scenes. For me personally. Was the 'birth' of sandman, in a hugely impressive 5 minute CGI sequence when sandman is formed, and he comes to understand what he has become. It is emotional and powerful.<br/><br/>My second favorite scene of the film is the final words between harry and peter, as harry lay dying, they both explain how they will forever be friends, the music builds to a climax, its fantastic. It makes up for the 'not as good as you want it to be' end fight scene. <br/><br/>Few good action scenes. Not all amazing. A lot spent on the love story, which works well enough i suppose, but i went to see it cos it was called 'spiderman 3'.

","Let me start off by saying that Spiderman 1 was one of my favourite superhero movies, and Spiderman 2 was even better. Both these movies had very good acting, excellent writing, and great choreography and action. But what made both these movies so good was the fact that they were very well paced, had just one antagonist, and had a lot of drama.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 was my absolute ""must watch"" film for the year. However, after the first hour or so, I was getting more and more disappointed.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't fantastic. Good performances by most of the cast, but Tobey and Dunst (who happen to be the most important), weren't as good. The writing was done well, especially the comedy, but towards the end I thought there was just too much. You want to laugh a little, but you don't want Spiderman to turn out as a comic. That's where this movie fell flat for me.<br/><br/>The pacing was terrible. The build up as good, and the entire climax and all the post movie drama happen in no more than 15 minutes. It's as though the movie just suddenly races past, and then immediately stops. Just like this review.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I've seen the movie today. It was shown earlier in our country. The movie is really awesome. It's full of visual graphics and the fight scenes were really great. VENOM is the most vicious villain Spidey ever fought with. Topher Grace gave life to Venom's character. And to think, Spidey has to fight three villains. I never thought that Venom was to be in this movie. He kicked ass. And Harry Osbourne's glider was pretty cool. There are a lot of surprises in this movie. Like Harry joining forces with Spidey to help battle Venom and Sandman. A love triangle erupted between the two but it was resolved. But in the end, you'll want to want more. This $250 million movie was worth every penny."

","Other countries must be seething in jealousy.<br/><br/>The Philippines' celebration of Labor Day coincided with the showing of Spider-man 3. In cinemas nationwide, there were long lines literally snaking throughout the floor were the cinemas are located.<br/><br/>The movie both delivered and disappointed.<br/><br/>It delivered the nitty-gritty action and suspense, drama and comedy that we love in the first two Spider-man movies. It further reaffirms the action hero's iconic status over other superheroes.<br/><br/>It disappointed in a sense that the movie focused too much attention to one stage of Peter Parker's personality and his tendency to be too self-absorbed in his importance as a hero. In this aspect, the movie fails to give equal emphasis on the villains. There was little screen time to Venom. The movie could have provided a different level of excitement had Venom been given more screen time like Sandman (because in the cartoons/comics that I had watched/read, Venom is probably the most difficult villain that Spider-man faced, but in the movie, it was rather abridged). This is probably the dilemma with movies faced with two antagonists. Had there been only one, it could have provided more 'soul' to the movie like Spider-man 2 (which I believed is so much better because it focused only on a single antagonist).<br/><br/>But this minor flaw was circumvented towards the climax of the movie. Spider-man again returned to his element. And heck, it was one hell of a movie ride.....<br/><br/>And definitely, this is not the end of the franchise, based on how it ends.<br/><br/>http://life-rapture.blogspot.com/"
"Supersouleater","6","4","9","1 May 2007"," Amazing Joyride!
","As a fan of comic books, especially Spider-Man, this movie is a fulfillment to me - and it will be for all viewers. The action and those stunning effects can't get any better.<br/><br/>And as some already said: Raimi didn't just make an action-movie with superhuman powers, he also shows real-life human issues and weaknesses everyone can relate to - that's what made Spider-Man a character everybody loves.<br/><br/>And the origin of Sandman is already a highlight in movie-history.<br/><br/>I only gave it 8 out of 10 though, cause I felt a little disappointed by Ramis and Sonys try to deliver messages of patriotic, religious and human values that are too US-American dyed for people from other countries.<br/><br/>In Peter's and MJ's park bridge-scene Raimi and the actors accomplished to show real feeling, especially Maguire (I was blown away by his acting), though the final was the opposite, waaaay too sloppy for my kind of taste. But that's the problem when you want to please everybody - you only get 8 out of 10 stars ;) <br/><br/>Conclusion: ""Spider-Man 3"" marks the peak of this years movie-entertainment; it would be a crime if not."
"Brent_P","7","4","9","1 May 2007"," With the bar set so high, minor short comings were inevitable.
","Finally I got to see a premier movie on a premier release date, couldn't pick a better time to throw in review for the commercially driven Spider-Man 3. Let me get this out of the way first: I do not collect comic books and it has been probably a good ten years since I've read one. Having said that, I have a pretty decent knowledge of the Spider-Man mythology and have enjoyed the series on video games and such. Going into Spider-Man 3, I was stoked and little worried at the same time, as sequels tend to water down the original pieces.<br/><br/>S3 brings back all the major characters from the first one and even adds a few more. This time around Peter Parker commits to Mary Jane but unfortunately she has trouble dealing with his alter ego. Peter also finds out Ben's real killer, a poverty driven criminal turned scientific accident freak named ""Sandman."" Harry Osborn, who has figured out Peter's secret, decides to dabble in his father's legacy and is set on burying a few axes. Finally, the popular villain ""Venom"" makes his present felt along with the entire transformation. All of this coupled with a few love triangles, flashbacks and side stories. A bit much for a two hour film? You betcha.<br/><br/>This was what I was kinda afraid of. Comic books are filled with thousands of characters and character history. Alterations to a character's history on film I can deal with, as sometimes it is unfeasible. For example, in the comics, Spider-Man finds the symbiote in outer space. In the movie, it crash lands on Earth. Perfectly fine. What I do have a problem with is the attempt to jam every single hero/villain know to man (complete with origin) as a series progresses. A tactic which killed the Batman series (ok, Joel Schumacher, Kilmer and Clooney had some input.) Daredevil had the same problem tossing in Kingpin, Bullseye AND Elektra in the initial movie. This also almost killed the X-Men series adding in useless characters based solely on comic fan requests as they went on, but I give this one a slight pass because the X-Men realm is based on multiple characters.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the constant flip-flopping of the several story lines became annoying. Peter & MJ, Peter & Harry, Harry & MJ, Eddie Brock & Gwen Stacy...on and on and on. There was even a possible sequel injection adding Dr. Connors for the third time. The first two films were perfect focusing only one hero and one villain, giving you time to soak in all aspects of the plot and the characters.<br/><br/>Regardless of my nitpicking, this is still a good movie and a serious must see in theater. I recommend seeing this in a quality theater as the sound effects and editing were superb putting you practically in the middle of every battle scene. Speakng of which, the CGI was amazing and character animation made Sandman amazing to watch and Venom just straight vicious. The acting and screenplay was also pretty good that will stir up a few tears and laughs between combat scenes. It is an action film, and the film is full of it. In fact, the ending may make feel a little empty as the ending comes nearly immediately after the final battle sequence.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Go see it, as the theater experience itself is fantastic. Unfortunately I do not like the where the series is headed, and this one slightly inferior to the previous movies."

","I have just come back from watching the film, i am so happy with the end result, From the start of the film i was hooked, i couldn't take my eyes of the screen, it actually felt like if peters happy then I'm happy, oh and Mary Jane amazing part she had in this film. I don't really know what I'm trying to say....OK firstly <br/><br/>Venom......spot on, i didn't think that we would get to see his face so much but that we did, but not much character development for Eddie but I'm still happy, complete classic comic villain, but strange way to die! <br/><br/>Sandman....Awesome but what actually happens to him after he flies away at the end? and he's screwed if it rains, nicely done though and you do feel sorry for him after <br/><br/>Harry.....Really sad he's dead, awesome character, his glider rules and I'm happy his friendship with peter returned at the end....very happy, hes possibly the best thing in the movie in my opinion <br/><br/>MJ........Nice story, sexy and brilliant, you feel sorry for her a lot too <br/><br/>Peter....lol OK love the john travolta dance, Shocked when he hit MJ (was an accident)loved the dark suit and his dark behaviour but they ended it in time it wasn't overdone, otherwise u would hate him, loved the john travolta walk...lol brilliant!!!<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy........Kinda pointless really, its like they forgot about her near the middle and why she was there! but she was a nice addition to the film <br/><br/>Aunt may, only a small part but the usual, nice old lady but i kinda want her to know about him being spider-man now, i think its time! <br/><br/>4 way battle.............indescribable......except, the best thing ever!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>And the acting......it was amazing and fresh as if they really wanted to feel it this time. The plot was awesome, although like i said above venom and sandman don't really get much character development, but.....AMAZING!!!! <br/><br/>Overall........an easy 10/10 EASY!!! Bruce Campbell.....funny part too, really funny <br/><br/>1 thing, i cant believe its over though and i feel like I'm forgetting bits already cuz I'm too excited to know what is actually happening, now have to wait like 3 months till its out on DVD but i'l most likely go see it again next week! <br/><br/>Thanks for reading :)"

"CinematicGarbage","4","3","6","11 May 2019"," It didn't live up to the hype!
","The end of the Spider-Man trilogy! Hooray and NOT Hooray! This is one of the most disappointing movies of a franchise, a saga or a trilogy. It had gone really far and was a mess! There were no clues, no questions for the things we wanted to know. They just left the questions and left no clue for us to find out like when Peter got the symbiote suit, he said ""this is somethin' else"". He wasn't curious about it, he just took the suit without knowing the danger. This movie had made the fact that most third movies of a franchise is always a disappointment!<br/><br/>There were many disappointing moments and scenes. Why the hell would they add Gwen Stacy. That's just stupid! There's MJ, why Gwen. There's that character in The Amazing Spider-Man. She ruined most parts of the movie. This is INSANE! Without Gwen, the movie would get a big better. It's another reason that the third movie is really disappointing. Sandman is okay! He's fine, I liked his backstories. They were tragic and moving! But the WORST WORST WORST thing in here is that they casted Topher Grace in here. He's so terrible at being Venom. I would rather them casted Tom Hardy like Venom (2018) but then I thought Hardy was too young...Wait, no! He's older than Grace. Hardy suited Venom more. The project had gone too far. The problem was that Eddie Brock turned into Venom too fast, 5 seconds, just because they wanted Venom to be in the movie. Raimi was just like ""Fine! Okay! Just do it!"" in a boring tone. The really terrible scene was the bar scene, Spider-Man doesn't need a bar, just because the suit is trying to, you know... Scenes could be avoided because they didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Putting Venom and Sandman here was a bad idea. Like Chris Stuckmann, I agreed with his new plot of Spider-Man 3, making Harry Osborn the main villain. Many scenes were made tragic in the rain. It was like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2. So much scenes with dramatic music composed by Christopher Young who had replaced Danny Elfman. Why??? But I like the theme, it was better than the previous two but then....DRA-MA-TIC!!<br/><br/>The CGI were the best in here. The first two movies didn't use much, especially the first one. The action sequences were good, the battles were also good and other parts with CGI. They impressed me. I also liked the cinematography, they were really good, like an action paradise.<br/><br/>The movie was so disappointing that scenes and the plot had ruined the part 4. They were about to make the villain Carnage and then...CANCELLED! I don't hate much about the movie but it didn't live up to the hype.<br/><br/>Ratings: 6.6/10"

"TheMovieDoctorful","3","3","6","2 November 2018"," 11 Years Later And It's Still Bad
","Spider-Man 3 has become something of a cult classic in the comic book movie fandom. I won't pretend like all of this is entirely due to nostalgia, there are genuinely great aspects to this film and people have strong reasons for loving it. However, as a reviewer, I speak for my opinion and my opinion alone when I say that I still can't call it a good movie. It's a recipe of artisan ingredients assembled in a disastrous, messy recipe that fails to come even close to the sum of its parts. Its soaring highs only make its critical lows all the more disheartening.<br/><br/>The acting is actually quite good. I dare call it the best in the entire Raimi trilogy. Thomas Haden Church steals the show as Sandman, a villain you can't help but root for. Much like Michael Jai White as Spawn, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman brings such incredible tragedy to his role with some extremely three-dimensional facial acting and a truly tormented vocal delivery. Particularly effective is his scene of confession to Peter in the film's climax. If the film has a heart, it's in that scene, and Haden Church is an extraordinary emotional anchor. Tobey Maguire gets to showcase a more toxic, entitled, angsty and untamed take on Peter Parker. This is a Peter who has become consumed by ego, blind off of his own happiness, and Maguire does an incredible job giving him an extra level of dimension and depth that is both inspired and darkly relatable. Kristen Dunst finally gets more to do in these movies than play arm candy for Peter and does an excellent job conveying Mary Jane Watson's insecurities and increasing dissatisfaction with her career, her life and her various relationships. James Franco gets a lot of hate for his performance here, but even as a non-fan of the film, I can't for the life of me see why. He balances both the character's quirky comedic and deeply tragic sides wonderfully. Sure, he's not intimidating in the least, but I blame that on the poor characterization more than I do poor acting. As poorly as Eddie Brock is written in this film, even Topher Grace does a convincing job playing a one-note creep.<br/><br/>If ideas were all that mattered in filmmaking, than Spider-Man 3 would be the best Spider-Man film to date. Peter becoming more neglectful and emotionally abusive to Mary Jane due to intoxication from increasing popularity, fame and happiness? Brilliant. Harry dying to save Peter's life in the same manner his father died trying to kill him? Genius. The film ending on a solemn and reflective slow dance between Peter and Mary Jane rather than having them make up and get back together Hollywood style? Beautiful. The problem, however, lies in execution.<br/><br/>If there's one problem with the characterization in this film, it's that characters make choices based on plot convenience rather than consistent emotional logic. Take, for example, Mary Jane breaking up with Peter. In theory, this should be one of the best scenes in the film. Mary Jane has every reason to break up with Peter; he's flirted (And even kissed) other women, he's abandoned Mary Jane in her times of emotional need and not taken her needs seriously, he's ignored her pain to wallow in his own emotional heights; this is a brilliant setup. But, of course, Mary Jane can't break up with Peter for all of these very valid reasons. Instead, she breaks up with him because of a convoluted and stupid evil plan from Harry that's straight out of a Mexican Soap Opera. Or take Harry's sacrifice for example. You'd think he would have turned to save Peter out of a moment of personal acceptance and reflection. A moment where he can finally let the truth of Peter's words hit him. But, of course, Harry can't make amends with Peter for any reason of emotional logic. Instead, we get more soap opera nonsense with Harry's butler appearing out of nowhere to explain the truth to Harry. The truth that could have saved time, money and probably even lives. The entire movie is like this and characterizations that had potential due to great performances suffer greatly for it. You can have all the interesting characterization concepts you want in your screenplay, but if there's no emotional reasoning or consistency to the actions of characters, it doesn't matter; the film will still suffer greatly for them.<br/><br/>Eddie Brock's characterization in this film couldn't be worse. It's a childish hit piece meant to sabotage the integrity of a character Sam Raimi never liked. What made Brock such an interesting character in the comics was that he genuinely tried to do the right thing. He wasn't good at it, but he wasn't a monster either. Eddie always wanted to be the hero. Eddie in Spider-Man 3 is the kind of character who would beat up a prostitute. If Raimi merely wanted to re-imagine Venom as a Dark Mirror of Peter, fine. However, given that his original concept for Spider-Man 3 was for Peter to see the humanity in all of the villains he faced, this one-note ""evil for the sake of evil"" caricature doesn't blend well at all with the film's thematic intentions.<br/><br/>I understand that Spider-Man 3 has its devoted fans and followers. I'm glad that people are finally starting to enjoy it. However, I can't say I consider this a good film. It has good performances, good ideas...But it just doesn't all come together. And in a film that aims for narrative tragedy, that may be the greatest tragedy of them all."

","My first bet was to give this a vote of 1 (Awful). But to be fair there were some good points - right now they are escaping me - but I am sure they were there.<br/><br/>Here are some quotes I heard from my friends. ""Daddy - why are they dancing and where is the bad guy"" - 11 yr old - from the mouths of babes...<br/><br/>If you want to see a bad remake of Grease go see this movie. If instead you want to see a Spiderman movie with a decent plot line, unhurried delivery and excellent character development then please restrict your viewing to Spiderman and Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>I still had to consider if I wanted to complete my collection of movies by buying this when it is eventually released but on closer consideration - I have to say NO - like X-Men 3 - this will be one movie never to grace my shelves.<br/><br/>High points (well promising): Sandman - very promising character; Goblin - very promising in what he could do; Venom - how I wanted to see more of this guy<br/><br/>Low points: Sandman - no real quality time spent on him; except for introduction; Goblin - again no real time spent on his development or delivery; Venom - still waiting to see more Parker-Venom - haircut; dancing; reminded me of a spotty spoilt teenager. Spidey-Venom - well the photos looked great but where is he?<br/><br/>In summary this movie really should have been delivered in 2 parts. Part 1 - Sandman and Goblin - more than enough bad guy here. Part 3 - Venom - just imagine how Peter could have played this out - minus the dancing and singing of course - pitiful... Nice to see the Cure are making a comeback though."
"cmbstudio","10","3","6","21 May 2007"," stop bashing this great film
","*Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>I saw this film in IMAX twice and enjoyed equally both times I went. I thought Sam Raimi did a great job in providing the additional Characters for Comic Book Lovers.<br/><br/>Firstly, I like to say stop bashing this film. Get a grip people this a third installment. Another chapter in the Spiderman Franchise.<br/><br/>Tobey _ I can tell he had fun with the character and by far the most comfortable in this installment.<br/><br/>Villains - I enjoyed the multiple villains. It kept you on your toes, not knowing what will happened next. plus Sandman & Venom are not strong enough Characters to hold full movie for spidey. Harry Osborn Green Goblin is strong enough and Doc Ock as well. I wouldn't want to see a movie on just him fighting sandman or Venom. With Venom, it's like seeing two Spiderman's. Someone mention no build up to Harry becoming Green Goblin. HELLO! didn't you see the first two movies. The build up was provided. If it wasn't for the multiple villains we would have never had that great teaming battle scene.<br/><br/>Franco - was great as Harry Osborn showing the darkness and friendliness of the character. <br/><br/>I thought the scenes peter had with Gwen Stacey was great. The writers concluded that the Stacey's will play a bigger part in future films.<br/><br/>The action sequences were Great as well. Great effects on Sandman, my hat's off to Thomas Hayden church. I also like how it ended for this character as how he ends up in the Comic Book by reforming and the talking out scene of a misunderstanding to uncle Ben's death was something new and done well. Topher did well as Big shot Brock & Venom. Stop hating.<br/><br/>Comic relief _ Keep Bruce Campbell in these films. He is great. His character in the third chapter is the best. J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson was equally great. He did a fantastic job again as the loud mouth boss. Lady who played Betty Brant is Hot!! So was Gwen!!!<br/><br/>I also like the symbolics of the whole church scene. Spiderman basically there to repent on all the wrong he done and detaches himself from the costume. Brock actually there in humiliation on being a fraud.<br/><br/>I think people are not giving this movie it's just do. I thought it was by far the most entertaining and did not fade on you once. Go Spidey Go! Raimi your a winner to bring to life a character which I long loved."
"yeaimdaman73","1","3","6","17 May 2007"," The Worst Spiderman movie
","One of the worst Spiderman movies of ALL TIME! Since Spiderman 1 one of the worst Spidermans of all time. Now don't get me wrong,just because i call it the worst spiderman,does not neccassarly mean im calling it a bad movie. Because as a movie, it was alright. But as a Spiderman movie, IT WAS GARBAGE! Lets look at the first two shall we.<br/><br/>First off the first two had a great storyline with it. 1st one involved how Peter Parker became spiderman. Simple stuff there. In the second one Peter is having trouble wondering if he wants to continue being Spiderman. Thats awesome as well. The action scenes rocked and made sense. The acting was awesome the drama and comedy scenes were great and the endings made the movies perfect. Spiderman 1 and 2 were Awesome.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 did not possess any of what i said made Spiderman 1 and 2 awesome. First the story is cliché as hell. How Sandman got into the story was not creative at the slightest. And somehow Sand was able to go through into his skin and hit his nerve system and make him a Sandman. Add all of Venoms time in the movie and it prolly wont even add up to 10 minutes. And that was even worse cause hes 25% of the reason i wanted to see this movie. The comedy scenes were corny as hell. Like when Peter is strutting down an avenue. O god i don't ever wanna relive that. The action scenes weren't as exciting as the other 2. And the ending stunk as well.<br/><br/>Im not that surprised that Tobey doesn't wanna be in the fourth movie seeing as i wouldn't appear after that garbage. Same with Kirsten Dunst although she shouldve never have been Mary Jane since she doesn't look that attractive. If there ever is a fourth one im prolly not gonna see it till it comes out on DVD so i can rent it. Cause i saw Spiderman 3 in theaters with my friends and boy it was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>Whats even worse is my friends only loved it because of the action scenes. This movie just proves on so many levels why the sequels never live up to the originals.<br/><br/>My suggestion don't see this movie its def. a waste."
"Guy_Fieri","5","3","6","17 May 2007"," The flaws can be overlooked, it was a great film.
","Overall, I think Spider-Man 3 was a great film. There were many complaints about the film, and some of these complaints were reasonable, while some of them just weren't thought on enough. The CGI, for example. The computer graphics in this film are, like it's other two predecessors, amazing. We can't even lie about that, even though I hear so many people doing so. The graphics were great, and out of the flaws this movie truly did have, CGI had nothing to do with it. The acting. The acting wasn't as good as the first two (especially since the second movie's acting was awesome), but it wasn't bad either. Sure there were cheesy lines, but we laughed at them, which is what the writers intended. And a lot of people complained about Tobey's acting during the scene went Peter went ""bad."" A lot of you said you would laugh at him, or shake your heads. And you complained about this. Little do you realize, though, that's how you were supposed to react. You weren't supposed to say ""Wow, Peter is so cool. I wanna be just like him."" You were supposed to feel embarrassed, you were supposed to see that he wasn't ""bad"" at all. In fact, he was very bad at being ""bad"". But he was supposed to be! Peter was supposed to look like the little loser kid who tries to act cool but just makes himself look like even more of a loser than he was before. And that's exactly what he did. If that scene made you ""sad,"" good. It was supposed to. Another complaint was the crying, and I'll admit that there was a lot of crying in the movie. And most of the time, you did find yourself laughing while the actors were crying, and I don't think this was intended. There could have been less crying, and there should have been less crying. This is a reasonable complaint. However, every film has a weak point. The crying was Spider-Man 3's weak point, and it didn't stop the movie from being amazing. People complained a lot about how the film was very crammed. Everything seemed to be crammed into two and a half hours, which was expected, since the film is filled with so many different plot lines and events. Most of you said that the director didn't handle this well, though. A lot of people felt it could have been done better, because it was kind of confusing, rushed, and you always felt that it was crammed as well. If you felt that, then good. Think about it for a minute. Peter, throughout the movie, feels confused, as do the rest of the main cast. They feel at times pressured or annoyed, and depressed, and like I said before, very confused. The audience was supposed to feel the same way, and the audience may not have enjoyed it, but neither did the characters in the film. This was intended, though, because you almost felt like you were in the movie. And some of you found yourselves even shouting out at the characters, saying ""Don't do that!"" or ""Why did he/she just do that?"" which is good, because it meant you were 'involved' with the film. Overall, the movie was very good. I think it's up there with Spider-Man 2 as the best Spider-Man film in the trilogy. Though there were a few flaws, I think they can be overlooked, and it did good keeping up with it's amazing predecessors."

He dared to buck the current trend of ""wall-to-wall, non-stop action"" that today's Attention-Deficit-Disorder generation demands.

","I've given myself a week to cool off and look at the movie with a cold eye for this review, so here goes...but first, an intro.<br/><br/>Spider-man is a hero-my hero. being the comic-book freak that i am, i was and sorta still am a huge spider-fan. not only do i love the character, the movies, the comics, and the cartoon, but he represents a relatable character who's helped me through some rough times. The first one reminded me why the character and mythology and filmmakers were great, and made Sam Raimi one of my favorite directors. the movie is a big part of the reason i decided to become a filmmaker. The second one showed the world the things the first one showed me, but it showed us why we go to the movies. for three years i awaited the third film as if i was a prisoner, waiting for my 20-year sentence to be over. The trailers in conjunction with the images and leaked footage that was coming out got my so pumped my veins were bursting. when i saw 300 for the third time, i also saw the venom trailer for the third time. my friends grabbed my hands in anticipation, and to this day i remember the guys telling my they could feel my pulse racing with excitement like drums to a metal song. thats when the bad reviews started to come out. Thats when i started to worry, and when i fear that this movie might not break the third-movie curse, and might be on par with the other bad superhero films. ""what if a god can bleed?"" i thought.<br/><br/>Thursday night, may third. I'm wearing my spider-man 3 shirt, spider-man 3 baseball cap, and my spider-man mask, surrounded by other fan-boys, excited but concerned as hell for the third movie to start. we watch some funny trailers, and the Columbia logo comes up. we all clap until it says ""tobey Maguire."" Anyhow, the flick starts and the opening narration was iffy. i sighed and ignored the annoying dialog, simply trying to focus on how excited i was that the wait was over. the movie goes on, and other than a few bits of iffy dialog, i gotta say i was liking what i saw and heard, especially the music. But things started to go downhill. i think it was when James Franco keeps grinning and yelling awkwardly in the hospital scene that people started to laugh and i started to be reminded of the unintentional comedy ""The Wicker Man."" Harry in general was exceedingly goofy, and it didn't feel better. the dialog was getting worse, and the movie kept getting jumpier. I don't remember specifically the movie started to go downhill, but by the time MJ and Peter were breaking up, the theater is cracking up, and i realized what i was watching was a complete freaking soap oprea-y joke.<br/><br/>So, in summary, here's what worked, and what didn't.<br/><br/>WHAT WORKED: The special effects were excellent, the look of venom. Topher grace did wonderfully with what little they gave him, as did Thomas Hayden church. he music is half the reason i ever intentionally think of the movie. The scenes where peter had the symbiote were wonderfully done; You could see Tobey Maguire was having fun, they were funny as hell, and occasionally scary as hell. The one moment i truly thought the movie was doing what it was supposed to do and the director was giving me what i wanted were when peter confronted harry an Eddie. When peter confronts and tells harry ""no he didn't; you're father despised you."" or when he said ""youre trash, Brock."" were freaking gold. i also though the very end of the movie worked really well. i also liked the cameos and the scenes with Jameson.<br/><br/>WHAT Didn't WORK: Well, the movie (in part because of the script and in part because of the acting) is chock-full of unintentionally hilarious scenes that are inevitably going to be huge inside jokes on ytmnd or pop culture at large. (i've already made a face book group called ""Hows the pie"") The pacing was awful and at times reminded me of X-men the last stand with how poorly the story and characters developed. The movie can get corny as hell, IE the mask-esquire dancing scene at the jazz club. judging by the scene where harry and peter fight, i can tell that maybe the filmmakers obviously didn't take it very seriously or the editors could tell it was going to be garbage so they made it extremely goofy. he villains are really poorly done, and the movie is so jumpy its not even fair.<br/><br/>ALL-IN-ALL: if you can get past the trauma of this wonderful franchise and character being squashed like.well..a bug, then its a great flick to watch with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night. I can see where Sam raimi was going and i know he didn't want to disappoint us because he's the biggest spider-fan out there, but the movie is a general disappointment"
"HarvardSlacker","2","3","6","12 May 2007"," Terrible acting, worse plot, sometimes amusing it was so bad
","I am rarely disappointed by mindless action movies, but this one was quite poor. The whole theater laughed whenever Tobey Maguire tried to do any emoting, many of the plot developments were completely inane, and frankly the action scenes weren't even that imaginative. As a friend of mine described the script, it was as if they had written it straight through in one sitting and done no editing - each line of dialog was trite and predictable.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, perhaps the most significant problem with this movie was that it tried to include too many story lines, with three villains, Spider-man's love woes, etc. While each of these villains might have been worthwhile if they had time to develop, each was left seeming like a simple vehicle for more action sequences. I tend to think that the problem was not that too many villains led to a bad movie so much as that the writers were too uninspired to really come up with enough plot and dialog to flesh out any one character, so they just added more.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking -- ""Oh, I'll love it anyways! I love super hero movies!"" -- No. Trust me. You won't."
"bigtkeller","3","3","6","10 May 2007"," Not the worst movie of all time, but probably biggest let down in Movie History!
","I don't know if want I am about to say is a spoiler but I'll be safe and label it that way.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of comic book movies; especially the first two Spiderman movies and seeing as how Sam Raimi was directing and most of the cast was back including new additions such as Topher Grace, Thomas Hayden Church, and Bryce Dallas Howard, I did not think that this movie could go wrong. The trailers for this movie were also amazing and this was the movie I was looking forward to seeing the most; even more than Pirates of the Caribbean 3. Little did I know that this movie was going to be the biggest disappointment in film history.<br/><br/>There were many things that plagued this movie, but above all the thing that plagued it the most was the corniness. When Peter Parker/Spiderman turned into Black Spiderman the movie went downhill. The writers completely screwed up Black Spiderman. Black Spiderman is meant to be a dark and somewhat evil version of Peter Parker. Instead we get a goofy, loser, asshole version of Peter Parker that was painful to watch. This element alone almost completely ruined the whole movie, however there were a lot more things though that downgraded this movie. The ending I thought was corny as well. A whole crowd watching on with news reporters commentating on the whole thing was very corny I thought. And the cherry on top was when Harry's Butler just came out of nowhere saying that there was no doubt in his mind that his father died from his own hand. Why did the butler never come out and say this before? Many people say the dialog in the Star Wars films are very corny. Okay, I'll admit that the love scenes dialog in Star Wars are kind of corny, but this entire screenplay was down right corny and this screenplay is missing the quality writing that the first two films had.<br/><br/>The CGI which was so good in the previous two movies was really bad in this movie. The first scene where Green Goblin 2 and Spiderman are going at it was painful to watch because the cinematography and special effects were awful. Go back and watch the first 2 Spiderman films and you will see how much more quality there was in the CGI and cinematography. The Sandman effects were also not too good because because they made Sandman become a huge blob of sand. The Sandman is not meant to be this massive creature and he is also not meant to fly.<br/><br/>I also agree with most of the critics out there that they tried too hard to cram in 3 villains. Before watching this movie I did not think that it would be that big of a deal, but after watching this movie I think 3 was too many. Two villains would not have been bad. I think they should have saved Venom for a later installment, but instead they had to cram all three in there and Venom, who is Spiderman's biggest villain in the comics, only got about 15 minutes of screen time. Overall I think Sam Raimi did not care about putting much effort into this film, because he already made millions on the first two and I believe that like the Batman saga, this saga needs a reboot. I gave it 3 stars because there were some entertaining moments, but still this movie in my opinion is the biggest disappointment in film history."
"tim-fletcher","6","3","6","9 May 2007"," If you like Cheese, you'll love this baby!
","My main gripe was that the film oozes cheese, real cheese served up the American way. I'd go as far to say that this film has more cheese than Switzerland. Especially the part near the end, where Spidey swings in to save the day and conveniently lands right next to a huge American flag  patriotic crap. Please spare me the American patriotic crap. And I think the film could also have benefited from the omitting of certain corny and needless pieces of dialogue. The cries of 'Awesome' etc from the watching crowds made me want to vomit. The story is pretty straightforward, as you would expect, and does enough to keep you entertained; although not enough to make you want to see the film again. In my opinion, Spiderman 2 is the best of the trilogy but this is worth seeing just for the sake of keeping up with the saga. The villains are OK, especially Venom. The parts where Venom consumes Parker were probably my favourite parts. For me, the film was too digitally enhanced, e.g. the parts where Spidey is seen swinging through the streets look too good to be true, so in my opinion, makes them look a tad fake. But on the whole, apart from the cheese and the overdone effects, it's not a bad flick, I suppose."
"freaky_dave","6","3","6","8 May 2007"," Compared to 2, this sequel was weak
","Yeah I know. Some people are going to say that this is the best Spiderman yet. I know for certain it will beat out the first two films at the box office, but that still doesn't make it as good as Spiderman 2, and it's not quite on the same par as the first film either.<br/><br/>The problem this time around is that there are entirely too many sub-plots and villains. The last two films dealt with only one villain, and that made it possible for character development. Doc Ock was still the best villain, but with this film we have three separate villains, and in a movie that was 2 and a half hours long, that still wasn't enough time to make them interesting.<br/><br/>The main stars suffer a little bit here as well. The performance by Tobey Maquire wasn't as strong, and both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were simply one note. I could tell that their performances were strained, and that only proves that the rumors may be true about the main stars not returning for part 4 if there is one.<br/><br/>However, I must give kudos to the special effects. They were by far some of the best yet, and with a budget at over 250 million dollars, I can see why. But special effects alone do not make good movies. Character development and interesting story lines will always beat them out, and that is the part of the movie that rings a little hollow. <br/><br/>There were also some nice action scenes, but even then there was nothing that really jumped out at you. Some of the scenes in Spiderman 3 were reminiscent of part 1 and 2. There was nothing original, and there were no wow scenes like the way Spiderman stopped the speeding train in part 2, or how he seemed to almost fly down the street on his web lines trying to catch the man who was thought to have killed his uncle in part 1.<br/><br/>Sadly, Spidermen 3 doesn't quite make the grade, but I have no doubt it will still break box office records once its theater run is over."
"jaina_solo_fel","4","3","6","8 May 2007"," It Had Its Moments
","The fact of the matter is, Spiderman always gives something to its fans. Thats why people keep coming back. I know I do. This movie was not better than Spiderman 2 far from it. And hell I can't really say it was better than Spiderman 1 either. It had its moments some people are fixated on the crying thing. He's human for god sakes i think the guy can cry. His best friend died of course he cried. While the movie was good I can only name two scenes that were my favourites. When you first see Flint Marko became Sandman that is the most magnificent piece of art i have ever seen. I also liked apart from Topher Grace being killed I liked the whole Spiderman vs Venom thing that was exciting. Also I think its crappy that they killed Harry and apart from having him have amnesia for half the film was just plain stupid. And yes I am a Spiderman comic book fan. so apart from a handful of scenes i give this movie a 4 out of 10. it was good but it won't go down in my books as the best movie ever."
"lobster1071","5","3","6","8 May 2007"," Classic, recent Hollywoodall special effects, no heart
","*Spoliers* <br/><br/>I have to say, many of the reviews I have read, both ""professional"" and user, seem to hit the nail on the head. Many are saying this movie is way too long, and they are correct in a way. How can anyone put a time limit on a movie? If it is interesting, a 4 hour movie could seem like 2 hours, and keep us wanting more. The old adage of ""time flies when you are having fun"" more than applies here, but unfortunately this movie embraces the opposite effect. This movie drags on with uninteresting characters, and a very unremarkable plot.<br/><br/>Yes, as others have said, they should have stuck with one, MAYBE two villains, but with three villains and no interesting stories for them, the viewer simply doesn't care. <br/><br/>The Sandman is totally unnecessary. We find out that he is (possibly) the real killer of Uncle Ben, but then, lo and behold, it wasn't really him anyway, it was the partner to begin with, although he was involved, but feels sorry for what he did, etc etc. The whole reason for Spiderman becoming Spiderman is tampered with, and leaves you with mixed feelings about the whole event.<br/><br/>The same story with Harryhis butler tells him, well, it wasn't really Spiderman who killed his fatherit was his father himself. Well, let's just throw that whole interesting plot out the window of how Harry becomes the new Goblin. Harry now befriends Spidey and helps him save the day.<br/><br/>The symbiont (Venom) shows itself briefly in the beginning, then it seems like an eternity (maybe half of the movie) before it shows itself again. I can live with the mystery of not knowing where it came from and what its purpose is, but please, give it something more interesting to do than make Peter ""strut"" down the street making googly eyes at woman. I will say it was fairly interesting watching Peter's darker side some out in a couple scenes though (especially the bar fight scene).<br/><br/>I don't understand people who say that you shouldn't compare this movie to the other two. How can you NOT compare them? It's supposed to be a sequel to the previous movies, right? It begs to be compared. Let's compare the endings, shall we?<br/><br/>The ending of Spiderman - MJ, Harry, and Peter share a moving scene at the cemetery. Peter answers the question he poses to himself at the beginning of the movie""Who am I? I'm Spiderman"". It concludes with a thrilling sequence of him swinging through the city.<br/><br/>The ending of Spiderman2 - Harry throws a dagger through the mirror, discovers Gobby's secret hideout (packed with all the pumpkin gadgets). MJ states ""Go get um Tiger"", then gives a slight look of concern presumably about the future.<br/><br/>The ending of Spderman3  MJ and Peter holding hands in a jazz club?!?!<br/><br/>Where is the ""money shot"" that keeps us wanting more? No suspense, no thrilling finish, no touching scene with even semi-interesting dialogue. <br/><br/>This movie had an ""ending"" shot more times than was needed (although none of them really interesting). It seems like no one could decide what the final scene should be, so they said ""Let's lump them all in"". Personally I thought, if there is to be no sequel, the ending of Mary Jane and Peter kneeling over Harry's body with the sunset in the back round was the winning shot, but no, it drags on a couple more scenes.<br/><br/>If there is to be another sequelwhere is the cliffhanger? If this is the end (which I highly doubt), what a way to go out with a fizzle.<br/><br/>However there probably will be another sequel. They will throw gobs of money at the actors again. All they would have to do is show up for their ""blue screen"" shots. The special effects department can do the rest. Heck, who am I kidding? With this franchise, they could show a hamster in a red and blue outfit, running around on an exercise wheel for two hours, and it would break all previous box office records because it had the title of Spiderman4."
"jake-hamilton1","5","3","6","8 May 2007"," The Greatest Battle Lies Within...a huge disappointment.
","Spider-Man 3, the one we were all waiting for. Venom. One of the greatest Spider-Man villains of all time (not as good as the Green Goblin, of course), will be making an appearance on the big screen. This is it. The big one. Or should I say, the worst one? Yes, I think I will. Although I can't argue that Spidey 3 has the best CGI of all three films (it is amazing), and an alright script, I can argue that the filmmakers totally ruined two very classic and famous villains. Take Venom, as our first example. Venom, in the comic books, was a vigilante. An anti-hero. Not exactly a villain. He saved people, for crying out loud! He was, as he put it, the ""protector of the innocent"". In Spidey 3? He was a total freak! He was way too evil, put civilians' lives at risk, and seemed to not care about killing random people in his quest for killing Spider-Man. No, no, no, no, NO! That is NOT VENOM! And as for the New Goblin, who the hell designed that costume? A skater's outfit, complete with a surfboard glider. S*&t. Talk about an absolute s*&t costume. Now, I must admit that Sam Raimi did improvise and definitely improve the Sandman, but come on, Raimi, I thought you were a fan of the comics? Obviously not, as you totally RUINED Venom and the Green Goblin II. Apart from the total ruining of two great villains, along with a tedious and sometimes boring plot, it seems that the hot Spanish dance scene with Peter P. and Gwen Stacey is the only thing that saves the film. Trust me, if you are a fan of the original comics, and read them, see this film at your own risk of a huge disappointment."
"mmilaiko","4","3","6","8 May 2007"," Very Disappointing
","**May contain slight Spoilers** Well, after eagerly awaiting and anticipating the arrival of Spiderman 3, I found myself to be incredibly unhappy and disappointed with the movie that Sam Raimi and Marvel put forth. The storyline with the symbiote in its original comics form was butchered to the point of absurdity. Maguire while excellent in the first two films as spiderman, could not pull off the transitions required by the symbiote. He to me seemed like little more than an arrogant emo high school kid. Kirsten Dunst as MJ, was totally flat and unbelievable. The chemistry that existed in the first two films between she and Tobey simply was not there. Thomas Haden Church, was good in his part, but the role of Sandman was also butchered from its comics origin. Sandman in the comics did not kill Ben Parker, why did they feel the need to do such with the film, it added nothing to the flat storyline. Not to mention Sandamn in the comics was not the tragic villain simply searching for a cure for his kid, he was a petty thug, there was no tragedy or Shakespearean aura to his character. Now this brings me to Venom played woefully and tedious by Topher Grace, or as most of us will forever know him as Eric Foreman the skinny kid from that 70' show. Grace spent his whole on screen time trying to be comical and nonchalant, to me it just seemed like skinny kid with a symbiote. Raimi then proceeds to kill the Symbiote and Brock after a cheesy showdown with Spiderman. Indeed Brock is no longer Venom in the MArvel Universe, and is dying with Cancer, but the symbiote is never destroyed, it later Bonds with Mac Gargan better known as The Scorpion, becoming an even more powerful entity. JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson was perfect in his part, but the role is not large enough to save the film. Out of the main cast, JAmes Franco as Harry Osborn gave the best performance. His transition from evil to good was done very well, and he was by far the character that you could honestly sympathize with and identify with. In short the performances overall were lousy, especially the villains, none of them really had any oomph or character like we experienced with Alfred Molina as Doc Ock. And none could even come close to Willem Dafoe's demonic and chillingly insane portrayal of Norman Osborn. If you were a fan of the first two films, this one certainly does not live up to expectations, it seems to being going the way of the original Batman movies.......ridiculous."
"lanmon28","5","3","6","8 May 2007"," To Swing Or Not To Swing
","""Spoiler Warning""<br/><br/>This will be a difficult review to write. I have highly anticipated the release of Spiderman 3 since the end of Spiderman 2 and it pains me greatly to express my feelings here about it. I respect Sam Raimi and his directing ability, especially his character development. His movies ARE entertaining. I want to make that clear because my Spiderman 3 review is not a positive review.<br/><br/>This movie has many problems. The first and most important problem is the lack of character development. Sam Raimi put a lot of time and effort in the first 2 films to make sure we knew and empathized with the characters. It takes a lot of talent to make us sympathize with a Villain to the point that we almost hate to see them go at the end. That's good movie making. Spiderman 3 just didn't have those qualities. Not only did it lack insight into getting to know the NEW characters, it also made the ones we have grown to love in the last 2 movies seem like we didn't know them at all. They just didn't behave like the same characters.And that's even BEFORE the oozie goop took hold of Peter. As far as the NEW cast, the only new character we got ANY background at all about was Sandman. He has an unhappy wife and a daughter dying of a terrible sickness. We are supposed to understand here that it's his daughter's sickness that motivates him to rob banks and NOT the fact that he's a bad guy. But yet, he smashed police cars and armored trucks like it's a day at the office. Yeah, maybe no one got hurt because it was a PG movie but flying police cars DO injure and sometimes kill people in the real world. :) Then after the destruction of a city block, he'd turn to spidey and say ""I don't want to hurt you."" or ""I'm not a bad guy."" Did anyone get the feeling he seemed to be a bit wishy washy? It seemed like the screenwriters (or Sam) couldn't decide WHAT kind of person they wanted Sandman to be. And then of course there's Eddie Brock and Venom. Where do I start? I'll try to give Sam the benefit of the doubt here because he has stated that he doesn't like Venom. With that in mind, I'm sure his heart just wasn't in it. That probably began the demise of Eddie from the first scene with him in it. He just comes across as a womanizing jerk that likes to take pictures and doesn't mind faking them. And, that's pretty much all we get. Where did he come from? Did he have family? And the biggest question. WAS he REALLY dating Gwen Stacy? Although he tells Capt Stacy he is, other than the ONE conversation between Gwen and Brock in which she pretty much blew him off, there's nothing to support that. The film never says for sure. I'm guessing they weren't. So, this makes it EVER so strange that he'd be in a church praying for the death of Peter Parker over something he didn't really loose. Based on what we saw...I just didn't see anything happening to Brock that was terrible enough to be praying for God's help in ending someone's life. It was only a job that he JUST got the day before. How bad could it be? Not to mention he DID fake photos. How's that REALLY Pete's fault? Anyway, back to Sam. I understand that even though he didn't really want to do Venom, he wanted to give the screaming fans (me included) something. So,we got 15 minutes of a barely seen, barely speaking, undeveloped character that seemed to have no believable motivation for hating Peter. And this was pretty much just so we Venomites would close our traps about it. I might have wanted to see Venom, but not so much that I wanted to sacrifice story and character development for it. Not to mention Venom should be one of those ""entire movie"" Villains like GG and Doc Ock. They got a whole movie and Venom got 15 minutes? Again, Sam doesn't like Venom, I guess I can understand and forgive his lack of dedication to the character. But, can we forgive the Gwen Stacy oops? A major character in the world of Spiderman. At least in the comics. But, in this movie she was reduced to being nothing more than a character contrived to make Mary Jane jealous? Are you kidding? That would almost be like making the Black Cat a waitress in the French restaurant where Peter was going to propose to MJ. A very wasted character. The obvious problem with this movie is that it just has WAY to much going on to take time for that character development stuff. So, we end up with a detached story and empty faceless characters without a real purpose. Even the romance between Peter and MJ seemed awkward. It didn't flow as well as it did in the previous films. It almost seemed like Sam was TRYING to force some romance into a plot packed movie in between all the action scenes. I wouldn't say I left the theater thinking it was a bad movie, it was just very disheartening. This will in no way affect my future viewing of other Sam Raimi movies...but let me just say this to Sam. Sam, in the future, if you're not committed to a character or idea, don't do it. Only stick with the ones you have a passion for. I miss the old Spidey cast and it's magic."
"rhys-andrews","9","3","6","8 May 2007"," Brilliant, despite critique reviews
","Reading some of the reviews a few hours before I went to see the movie, I thought people weren't looking hard enough into some of the cheesiness and strange mix of scenes that the movie indeed held.<br/><br/>The movie was an emotional roller-coaster. I was almost in tears in some parts (MJ forced to breakup with Peter), really shocked in others (Emo-Peter slapping MJ), and really excited in most (VENOM!!). In the end, the strange order of all the scenes and how everything is introduced so quickly, though can easily be disregarded as poor directing, has a meaning beneath it - it was to make us feel the stress and insanity Peter gains from all these events.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to start with a huge scattering of events... they were flying everywhere, it was hard to get a hold on what the hell was going on. Then, during the last half of the movie, all the events very neatly came back into order - the way things were solved was very interesting. Harry's head-injury, his way of realizing his memories again, and his death was very well thought out.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacey, Venom, and Symbiote Spidey were very well tied in together. The way Venom collected the symbiote off SpiderMan, the way Gwen Stacey became another 'love' of Peter, and the whole story of Eddie Brock really gave another dimension.<br/><br/>There are such mixed opinions in this film I can only suggest you go and watch it for yourself - don't let any reviews disappoint you nor excite you. I watched this movie with an open mind, and wasn't just there for the action... And I truly think this was a really well-developed movie, despite the fact that many superhero movies like this are rarely 'masterpieces'.<br/><br/>-Rhys"
"stevenp-5","6","3","6","7 May 2007"," The Worst Hype:Crappy Movie ratio ever witnessed
","Okay. First I'd like to start by saying, I gave this movie a 6/10 only because the action sequences were good, sometimes even great. Secondly, the story and acting get a 0/10.<br/><br/>Okay. First things first, the action. The action was extremely good even though sometimes it seemed like graphically it wasn't as well done as the second movie. The only problem about the action sequences is how scarce they were. The movie was like 30 mins of nothing, 5 mins of action, 40 mins of nothing, 6 mins of action, you get the idea.<br/><br/>Second things second, the acting in this movie was just terrible. I blame most of it on the directing and writers though. Since when does Peter Parker turn into an emo kiddie when he gets the symbiote? Since when is Eddie Brock some 130lbs guy? He's supposed to be built, 2-3x more then spiderman in fact. It's too bad though, because Topher did a pretty good job on the acting side of things. Especially in comparison with other actors in the movie like Dunst(who was terrible) and Tobie Maguire (who spent most of the movie crying). As stated above, bad writing and even worse directing. Never once heard the name ""Venom"" in the movie either. No character ""venom"" was ever really established, and he died. (Since when is venom a character Spider kills moments after meeting?). So good job to the writers for killing off one of spidermans biggest arch enemies. Why did it need endless dialogue of bs with Gwen Stacey and such? What was the point of Gwen Stacey? She was supposed to be Peters first girl friend, so why even go down that road? And also, knowing full well MJ was there, why would peter have kissed Gwen Stacey? Especially considering he was NOT under control of the symbiote yet, not even close to. <br/><br/>Beefs with the movie:<br/><br/>1) Venoms death 2) Sandman lives 3) Emo movie in general 4) Mostly dialogue, no action 5) Dialogue wasn't even good, so may as well have put nonstop action 6) Green Goblin befriends Spidey? WTF 7) Green Goblin dies like a pussy, as spidermans friend. 8) The cheesy way they tried to end the 3rd movie like the 1st 9) Dunsts acting got progressively worse with each movie 10) The way you could CLEARLY tell it wasn't Kirsten Dunsts voice when she was singing. (Obviously it wasn't, but come on. It was pretty obvious, the singers voice sounded nothing like her) 11) Beef with the fact that there are so many beefs I forgot some of them.<br/><br/>Either way, this movie is not worth going to see in theaters. If your a spiderman fan, you have to see it. But just rent it, no need to spend good hard earned money at the theaters for this dud."
"Eddy_Salazar","3","3","6","7 May 2007"," Campy, unoriginal, and disappointing
","Being a huge fan of the first two Spider-man movies, I tried to really like this film, but it was a huge let down. It seemed as if director Sam Raimi knew what he needed to accomplish but didn't know how to get there, and that's where the film fails miserably.<br/><br/>The first example comes with Harry Osborne. His character is as cartoony as any character ever in the Spider-man universe. He has this anger towards Spider-man with no depth whatsoever. His anger is understandable but completely disregard the fact that he and Peter Parker were best friends for a really long time. Their confrontations seem more like two soap opera characters feuding. And in order to push Harry aside to introduce the other characters is mind-blowingly ridiculous! There are tons of other ways to get rid of a character rather than the way Raimi and his team chose to do it. Bringing him back includes one of the sappiest moments in superhero film history.<br/><br/>You would think the black Spider-man plot would be dark and dramatic, but on the contrary; it's turned into a comedic subplot. You wouldn't know if you're watching The Mask or Spider-man during a big chunk of the movie, and I'm not even exaggerating. The whole symbiote idea seems uninspired. It's poorly introduced, which is very disappointing considering how they set up J.J's son coming back from space during the second film.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy is also uninteresting. She's the typical cliché of the damsel in distress with a character that seems like it came straight out of the movie Crash, having some sort of connection to quite a few characters in the film.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is probably Sandman. You just can't understand that character. He's played out to be this nice guy who steals as a means to save his daughter, but ends up causing more destruction than any other foe in any Spider-man movie. It just doesn't make sense. The ends definitely don't justify the means.<br/><br/>While Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is the best inclusion in this movie, he's still not anything worthwhile. He's another character whose ends don't justify the means. He has a reason to be upset at Peter Parker, but is it really enough to want to kill him? The film has it's good points, because it HAS to. It's a Spider-man movie. There's always going to be some enjoyment in that, but overall the film is sappy, unoriginal, campy, goofy, and disappointing."
"JonTMarin816","5","3","6","7 May 2007"," Spider Man 3 is definitely the weakest link
","I am a fan of the previous Spider Man films, so it's safe to say that I was hyped up for the latest installment. May 4th was marked in my calendar for months leading up to the actual day. I watched Spider Man 3 on opening night and was left somewhat baffled. I liked the action, visually the film was stunning, but something didn't feel right. I was so disappointed. Although I was hyped up about the film, I also didn't go into it expecting the greatest film ever. But it was things like character development, story, and the overall theme of the film that dragged it. To describe this film in one word would be campy. This was definitely the campiest of all the films. In a film that was advertised as the darkest of the trilogy, instead we got too much comedy and a montage that was dragged on for too long. I couldn't help but cringe at these moments and wonder where did the magic, that was very evident in the previous films, go? As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but wonder what direction this franchise would go? These are questions that never crossed my mind after watching the previous films. Now Sony plans to include three more installments and I'm not even that excited anymore. To sum up everything, this film has its ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" but at the end it still proves to be one big disappointment.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 - ** out of ****"

","I went to watch this with high hopes. I loved the first two films i love the 90s cartoon series with a passion. the trailers looked great and i was happy that it was 2hrs 30 mins long, until i started watching. I like a long film but when it drags on this much i was just getting bored and annoyed.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film was the CGI, it was pretty amazing especially the transformation of sandman. But the fight scenes were very fast (couldn't hardly see what was happening in the first battle) followed by very very slow story telling. Some of the dialogue and acting was horrible in places and just OK for the rest of the film. An emotional scene on the bridge where peter starts crying was laughable (as can be heard from the hundreds laughing in the cinema) The news reporter at the end was horrible, pretty much most of the story telling was just laughable. You could tell people in the cinema weren't happy with this film.<br/><br/>There were points in this film where i couldn't take it any more and was thinking of walking out, and where the hell had his spidey sense gone, he was useless.<br/><br/>I even went to see it again the next day to get another view on it and i was even more bored. Not a lot happens in the 2 1/2 hours and i left feeling very disappointed. The only reason im giving it a six is because its spiderman and the effects were brilliant, everything else below average."
"slayerman_2000_211","6","3","6","7 May 2007"," Spider-Man is Back... Kind Of.
","I loved the first two Spider-Man movies. They were thrilling, fun, action-packed and the CGI was candy for the eyes... but the reason I loved them was they had solid stories with characters who weren't perfect, but you couldn't help but root for them anyway. That is what is lacking in Spider-Man 3 - the central story is extremely weak. It's like director Sam Raimi was throwing ideas at the wall and, if something stuck, he'd use it whether it helped move the narrative along or not.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there were plot lines that had a lot of potential. I think The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) could have been a great tragic anti-hero, along the lines of The Green Goblin and Doc Ock, if he had been given the proper treatment. He had an intriguing back-story, unfortunately that was abandoned early in the film to make way for snazzy effects. Granted, the scene where he is resurrected as a creature of sand is heartfelt, moving and the effects are breath-taking. The rest of the time he's in his sand form he's flying around New York City looking like a second cousin to the smoke monster on Lost. Ultimately, The Sandman is very one-dimensional because there isn't time to develop his character.<br/><br/>I admit I was not a fan of Spider-Man before the movies. I've never read the comic book and most of my Spidey knowledge was obtained through wikipedia.com. But from what I understand, Venom is like The Joker in the Spider-Man universe. With that said, I'm surprised how one-note the writers, director Raimi and his brother Ivan, made the character. While The Sandman had a little bit of complexity and heart, Vemon was nasty just for the sake of being nasty. He had no redeeming qualities. Topher Grace was clearly having a great time shedding his ""good boy"" image, which made the character far more interesting than he deserved to be. In the hands of a less capable actor Venom would have fallen completely flat.<br/><br/>As for the main characters in the film, I felt like I was watching the same actors playing totally different people. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) was rude, vain and arrogant. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was solemn, mopey and secretive. In the first two movies I could see the mutual attraction they had for each other. I felt the spark. At the end of the Spider-Man 2, when Mary Jane tells Peter to, ""go get 'em, tiger""... it was all the proof I needed that these two were meant for each other. In Spider-Man 3 it seemed they didn't even like each other. Peter deliberately hurt Mary Jane by upside-down kissing newcomer Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) in front of hundreds of supporters (including MJ), and Mary Jane opened her heart to Harry Osbourne (brilliantly played by James Franco) without even considering Peter. I could see flashes of their original personalities towards the end of the film, but by then it was almost too late. Other characters (Aunt May - played by Rosemary Harris - and the previously mentioned Gwen Stacey) served little to no point in the movie and should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The main plot was intriguing and would have been fantastic if it had been executed correctly. It wasn't. According to press releases and commercials we were going to see Peter's ""dark side"" after he comes into contact with a black, gooey substance from outer space that brings out a person's more aggressive qualities. I'm not sure we saw Peter's dark side as much as we saw his emo side. I was expecting Angelus (from season 2 of Buffy) and what I got was a skinny nerd with really bad hair strutting down the street, pointing at pretty girls, and dancing in a jazz club. I could tell Maguire was having a lot of fun, but Peter certainly didn't come off as mean or menacing. Again, I blame that on having too many pots on the stove. The climax of the movie (which puts Mary Jane in danger... again) was so ridiculous I felt like I was watching a big-screen version of that old video game, Rampage. And a deus ex machina near the end of the film was so contrived I'm amazed the characters didn't just speak directly to the audience. Toss in about 10 interesting but abandoned sub-plots (and a soap opera twist!) and you have a general idea of what to expect.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is basically two movies being smashed into one final product. And since it was just announced that there will be at least 3 more installments to the franchise I don't understand why Raimi felt the need to pack so much into 2 hours and 19 minutes. He should have held off on the dark Peter/Venom storyline and saved it for a later movie. He still had more than enough material for the third movie and he could have made it a character study worthy of it's predecessors.<br/><br/>This isn't to say I had a horrible time or that the movie is a total disappointment. The special effects were dazzling, I laughed out loud more than once (courtsey of the hilarious J. K. Simmons and J. Jonah Jameson), there was plenty of ""edge-of-your-seat"" action and a few sequences were beautiful (especially at the end). Still, Spider-Man 3 could have been so much more than it was. But even with this small hiccup I hope the creative team (Raimi, Maguire and Dunst) return for the next three movies or the franchise will truly fall into ""Batman: The Schumacher Era"" territory. And that would be a shame. I draw the line at spider nipples!"
"spandexx","2","3","6","7 May 2007"," Embarrassing
","This film is just embarrassing. The casting was never brilliant; Maguire is too weedy and pathetic (I know this is Parker's persona but Maguire is feeble) and Dunst is plain, bordering on ugly, but this time round the story is also an entire mess, the lead actors a waste of screen time and the conclusion weak, clichéd and slothful. And when Parker gets some 'balls' it is nauseatingly odious. This is the worst sort of sequel, a marketing and endorsement exercise with no respect for the source material. When will the studios realise that a film of this ilk can have mass market appeal and a decent narrative? The most expensive film ever made? I thought the point of fast food, manufactured, sugar-coated rubbish was that it was cheap. What a hateful waste of money. Avoid."
"jaredmw","4","3","6","7 May 2007"," Idea: Use success of previous two movies to carry rushed, horribly storyboarded, bad acted movie.
","I LOVED the first and second movies so I drove 45 miles across town, in what little time I have, and watched what I thought would be an extremely good movie with my favorite comic book character ever, Venom. Only to find that it's a movie where they never even call Venom Venom.<br/><br/>Venom was in the last part of movie and in only one fight scene. Are you kidding me? And then Venom disappears forever while Spiderman squirts around with the Sandman. All while the worst acting news crew assembled narrates it? What a joke. There were more than several problems with this movie.<br/><br/>I hated being dragged back into the story line involving Peter trying to ask MJ to marry him. Of course that never comes full circle. Then it was how Peter's uncle was shot, or wasn't the way you would think.If I had to re-live that flashback over one more time was going to bolt.<br/><br/>Oh and yes, let us not forget Peter doing his impression of Saturday Night Fever(I left to go to the bathroom and I didn't have to).<br/><br/>And finally, one of the most fervent themes throughout the movie being turned upside down by some butler (who I've seen for about a total of three minutes screen time); this butler, he speaks and is able to turn a chemically altered psycho back into a cheese ball.<br/><br/>I can usually put up with cheese ball acting just as long as there are good fight scenes but, come on. Fight scenes were few and far between and I lost almost all interest halfway through this thing. Only to be then interested in the black suited thing showing up but then that was short lived and stupid. So now I guess the flying grenades go from disfiguring people to vaporizing alien simians and human beings in one fail swoop.<br/><br/>I'll tell yea, watching Topher Grace and especially Thomas Hayden Church act was like watching dog crap harden. It looked liked the studio released this movie way too early. The acting was not good at all. ABOVE ALL THOUGH: Whoever storyboarded this needs to be taken out into the street and beaten."
"arkirk","5","3","6","7 May 2007"," less would have been more
","After an average 1st outing and a pretty good 2nd film Spiderman returns for a 3rd time. I have never been a massive fan of the films but loved the comics and wanted to see Venom on the big screen sadly I should have waited for the film to rent the film.<br/><br/>The 3rd movie can be tricky in a series: X men 3 was in too much of a rush to finish, Batman Forever too light weight but sometimes they can be good with the last crusade being better than temple of doom and giving raiders a run for its money. But sadly this film is too cramped with villains and pointless characters and too many ideas for it's still too long running time to cope.<br/><br/>The Sandman with his back story linking him to Peter and powers, Venom with his powers and menace could have both had their own Spiderman film to fully explore their characters. Alas they are forced into this film which still focuses on the Green Goblin now Harry. As a result none of the villains are developed enough with Venom suffering most. In the comics he was a complex villain: Eddie Brock is what Peter might have been yet in this he just a bog standard villain. He may look cool but shows little of what made him such a popular character in the first place. This is probably due to his little screen time.<br/><br/>Thomas Hayden Church struggles to play Sandman's motivation in this film which calls for him to be a villain one minute and a misunderstood hero the next. His effects at times brilliant at other times they felt like footage from the Mummy.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi after cutting loose his bag of camera tricks in the 2nd film plays it safe here. One or two style moments but most of the time it is standard. Until an action scene comes along and the camera spins around in such a way that you cannot make head or tails of what is going one.<br/><br/>I have always liked the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter and he once again carries the movie with a good performance. His rage over Uncle Ben's killer is particularly well done. The trouble is his fall from grace by the symbiote is played too tongue in cheek by Raimi never really emotionally engaging the audience. James Franco's complex and charismatic turn makes Harry into Spidey's most interesting villain in the film. Kirsten Dunst struggles with the script that does no favours for Mary Jane. It starts well but then the plot asks her too lose her fire and spark making her once again scream for her life.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the characters in many cases it is the same problem with too much going on meaning some are wasted. Bryce Dallas Howard's Gwen Stacy is hot adds nothing more than eye candy for the movie. Bruce Campbell and J. K. Simmons steal all their scenes while James Cromwell is wasted as Gwen's father getting nothing to do.<br/><br/>In the end Spiderman has its moments but should have gone with less is more way of movie-making."
"cooleronas","3","3","6","7 May 2007"," Disappointment
","I like spiderman comic and animation series. As for movies - I really liked the first part of the saga, and thought, that second was even better. Maybe because i never have high expectations when i'm going to see a ""popcorn movie"". But the third installment made me wonder either i'm actually watching ""SpiderMan 3"" or some parody/comedy movie on it.. :/ OK, some CGI and especially sound editing are brilliant. But OMG this is one BAD script. Do me a favor - if you haven't seen this movie and planning to see it soon, please count how many times you'll see someone crying or wet-eyed on screen. For god sake i've counted 7 during last 20 minutes. So i guess producers spent more money on tears than they did on CGI... Tobey Maguire was awful. I never liked him actually, but i always thought that ""at least he's good as spiderman"". I was wrong. What's that thing with emo hairstyle when he's poisoned by venom? I wish i had an ever-changing hairstyle depending on my mood :) Anyway, it's pretty valuable as a demo DVD for your audio/video hardware, especially the skyscraper scene, but as a movie it just plain sucks."
"the_rhodus","4","3","6","6 May 2007"," Disappointing
","I've never been a fan of comic books, and so I was surprised to find that the first Spiderman film was charming, entertaining and very watchable. I found the second Spiderman film to be not only better on every level than the first, but also a very fine film in its own right.<br/><br/>The third film premiered here in Japan and, having enjoyed the first two installments, I was reasonably excited about getting my advance ticket and waiting to see it. Unfortunately, after the screening, the strongest feeling I had was that of disappointment. It seems that this film is plagued with numerous, and more to the point *noticeable*, problems.<br/><br/>It appears that these problems all stem from two root problems. Namely, there is too much happening for just one screenplay and, the quality of writing is low.<br/><br/>As there is too much happening for just one screenplay, we have to keep track of multiple villains and civilians, each of whom has had only the bare minimum of introduction. This severely affects the action scenes because we don't know the characters well enough to get emotionally involved in the scene. In short, we don't even *care* about the characters. Another side-effect of this crowded screenplay is that we get a lot of very short scenes. Even the more dramatic scenes cut almost as soon as they've started. All of this makes for a very confusing, disjointed and dizzying experience.<br/><br/>The quality of writing is low. This means we have to suffer such lines as ""Wicked cool!"" from a young boy in awe of Spiderman. Do young boys say ""Wicked cool!"" nowadays? Actually, have young boys *ever* said ""Wicked cool!""? The screenplay has clearly been rushed. The screenplay possibly explains why we get some sub-par acting from most actors involved. The scenes with the male and female news reporters are embarrassingly awful. Even the stars are unaffected. Verily, Tobey Maquire's ""lip quiver"" will go down in cinema history.<br/><br/>There are, of course, some saving graces. The first half of the film provides more than a few genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud moments (although a lot of the humour in the second half feels out of place). Also, because of the quick cuts, you're never very far away from an action scene - if that's what you're looking for.<br/><br/>This is certainly not the worst film ever made, but it is easily one of the most disappointing."
"douga-4","6","3","6","6 May 2007"," WOW -- What a disappointment
","I can't tell you how disappointed I am with Spider-Man 3. I've been waiting since the beginning of the year (ever since they started promoting it in movie theaters) and, not only did it NOT live up to the hype and my expectations, from the reactions in movie theater, I could tell it didn't live up to anyone else's either.<br/><br/>First, the good news: the ONLY reason to see this movie is for the special effects. I saw it in an IMAX theater, and now I'm ruined on regular movies forever. You know how people say, ""See this movie in the theater"" because it plays better on big screens? See this one at an IMAX theater if you can. The only other good news: Kirsten Dunst's nipples make another appearance (briefly).<br/><br/>Now the bad news. First, there are AT LEAST NINE SUBPLOTS!! On the way home from the movie, my girlfriend and I counted them!! And those were just the ones we could remember! NINE SUBPLOTS! Are you kidding me? I'm amazed the movie was only two hours and twenty minutes! Second, the acting is horrible. Not just bad, horrible. There are parts of this movie where the dialog is so syrupy-sweet that I needed an insulin shot. <br/><br/>Third, apparently, everyone in Manhattan is a model. Every single shot of extras ""reacting"" is populated with some of the most beautiful people I've ever seen. There are no ugly people watching Spidey do his thang. Fourth, everyone is this movie (including the extras in the background) are just so unbelievably aware of themselves that it detracts from the realism of the movie. Finally, there are times in this movie during a couple of fight scenes, where there are so many fast camera cuts that you just can't tell what the hell is going on. That is unbelievably annoying. As good as the special effects are, you want to see them, not have them go by you before your brain can register what you saw.<br/><br/>Now, having said all that -- GO SEE THIS MOVIE for the special effects. DO NOT miss it in the theater. But, lower your expectations on the content. It just isn't there -- or maybe it's that there's WAY too much content. I can't tell. Turn your brain off and turn your eyes on. You'll have more fun."
"jaaaaason","4","3","6","6 May 2007"," May as well skip it.
","Spider-man 3 has a lot of things going for it. A terrific cast, a great director, and the biggest budget of any action movie I have ever seen. But still, despite all of this, the movie fell quite short.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was the plot. It was just way too chaotic. It seemed like Raimi had this idea for an epic movie with all these villains and new characters and would somehow manage to tie it up in a nice little package to leave the viewing audience satisfied with this supposed ending to the Spider-man franchise. But it didn't work. The only new character that was really given any depth was Thomas Hayden Church's Sandman. But sadly, it was all wasted. He should have been more of the focus of the film rather focusing on the build-up of Eddie Brock's transformation into Venom--who I think should not have even been in the movie at all. The whole movie just seemed really rushed despite its 2 hour and 20 minute run time. There was just way too much going on at once.<br/><br/>But the film did have a few redeeming qualities. The humor was great. It wasn't too overdone and made the film really enjoyable. Especially Bruce Campbell's best cameo yet. I was in stitches.<br/><br/>The action sequences were also quite a spectacle. Raimi has a great skill for handling these fast paced action scenes involving Spider-man and manage to make them chaotic enough to be exciting, but coherent enough to be able to know what is going on.<br/><br/>If it weren't for these two redeeming aspects, I would have out right hated Spider-man 3. So I would say that it is best to skip this chapter. You'll save yourself headache."
"harlequin133003","4","3","6","6 May 2007"," Too bad
","I was pleasantly surprised with Spiderman 2: it actually had gorgeous fight scenes and a decent plot line. This movie, however, has retained the CGI but not the plot. Is it really that difficult to stay on track with the story? The fight scenes and the CGI are some of the most beautiful I've seen, especially the explosions and the creation of Sandman. But Peter's character shift once he starts wearing the symbiont constantly is ludicrous and pathetic, not to mention scary in a sleazy stalker way. The story also loses focus between the three different villains that each have their own sob story to explain their descent into crime. There are also some nice references to the comic, but they're haphazard and inconsistent. (WARNING: SPOILERS) Sure, it is a bad moment when Peter hits MJ by accident, but it's really a problem since her father was abusive. Gwen Stacy is the focus of a major tragic arc, but here she's just another blonde. <br/><br/>I don't know why Spiderman follows the tradition of Xmen 3 (throw in a bunch of comic characters out of context, flood the screen with villains), but it's a pity that such gorgeous fight scenes have nothing to support them. Go see it for the CGI, not the plot and stay away if you can't stomach cheesy characters/story."

I know it is hard to do anything with web crawling, MJ was tiresome although she is pretty, her storyline dragged, and I liked venom, and JJJ did not have screen time at all, I came out of the cinema disappointed, like I did when I watched Phantom Menace and King Kong, and Terminator 3, went in expecting greatness and came out feeling disappointed and even can I say cheated"

","The first two Spider-Man films were textbook examples on how to bring a comic book to the screen. The third...however, is something of a disaster. Although it's not in the realm of Batman And Robin, it's vastly inferior to the two films that came before it.<br/><br/>The main problem it would seem is the attempt to use two quite major villains (in the comic books) leaving both with little time to make much of an impact. In addition, Sam Raimi seems set on turning the franchise into a straight forward comedy with the poor decision to include scenes such as Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man of course) dirty dancing in a disco. Yes, that's right - we spend several minutes of the film being forced to watch Peter Parker dancing as though he's in Saturday Night Fever.<br/><br/>Added to this is poor writing. At one point a character whom we'd never met in the previous two films suddenly appears and spouts several minutes of dialogue relating to a key scene in the first movie. Imagine, if you will, that upon watching Return Of The Jedi, an old man suddenly shuffles up to Luke Skywalker and says 'I was hiding behind a pillar when Darth Vader told you he was your dad. Don't worry - he's a good guy. Just believe in him and everything will be alright....' Yes, it's that bad.<br/><br/>If you've never read the Marvel comics, you might possibly enjoy this and dismiss it as 'okay'. You'll be amazed by some of the action sequences, laugh at the cameo by Bruce Campbell as a French waiter and wonder why people bother reading comics if they're written like this. If you've actually ever had any affinity for the character of Spider-Man, you'll be angered and confused by some of the decisions made here (especially those involving Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy).<br/><br/>Disappointed."

","3 is a tricky number. So many franchises (The Godfather series, the X-Men Series) have fizzled in their third act. It takes a talented cast and crew and a boatload of great material to create a ""part III"" that rises above the first tow, or at least matches it. It's not impossible (see the Star Wars series and the Mission Impossible series), but it's incredibly difficult. However, I had faith in my friendly neighborhood Spider-Man cast and crew. After all, how often does a sequel surpass the original film by leaps and bounds? Since the Spider-Man series practically invented the new concept of the popcorn-film-with-heart, I had no reason to believe that director Sam Raimi and his talented ensemble would fail me. After all, with Stan Lee's brilliant comic books, there was no way that this film could run out of material. Ironically enough, that's exactly what brings down 'Spider-Man 3"". This film suffers from the horrible ""more is better"" philosophy that I hoped and prayed was above Raimi and Co. Three villains! A new love interest! More action! More pointless web-swinging set to that ubiquitous Danny Elfman theme. More, more, more! But more is not better, as the audience quickly discovers. Sure, the cast is reliable, as usual (Bruce Campbell deserves special mention in a hysterical cameo). But what 'Spider-Man 3' lacks is the witty, wondrous script that carried the first two films. Raimi, a brilliant director, decides to try his hand at screen writing this time around, and boy, does he blow it. Villains are given huge, lengthy set-up scenes, and then pushed aside until they are needed for the balls-to-the wall finale. The love scenes feel bland and bloated. And the heart of the story-Peter's battle with his own dark desires-plays out more like Jim Carrey's 'The Mask' than a serious drama. Even the action scenes suffer under Raimi's pen-the finale, with Spidey trying to save MJ, who dangles precariously off the edge of a building in a taxicab, is blatantly ripped of from part 1's climactic battle. But the worst atrocity of this film is the dialogue. Sample line? ""I like being bad. It makes me happy."" 'Nuff said. If this summer of threequels continues in the vein of 'Spider Man 3', then it will be a very disappointing summer, indeed."

The story goes very deep on the problems a superhero has, when combining a relationship and a carrier, and that's good. And the action is very well done. I'm a little negative about how the new characters are introduced, it's kind a bit shallow. But the good story and action will fill up this gap. Now the about the villains. Venom looks great on screen... But his appearance is a little to short. Sandman is so totally awesome, it surprised me that his part of the film turned the first one his head, but i liked it, it was a good surprise.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 because it is the best comic book film ever!!

","I went to see this film with low expectations after seeing Spiderman 2 (which was OKish). One of the worst things about this shockingly bad film is the fact that you cringe while watching it, often feeling embarrassed because of the poor dialog, bad acting or just generally shaky storyline.<br/><br/>The story kicks off right where Spiderman 2. I think I would have preferred these films to be separate from each other. With a sort of continuing story line, but not much of one. This film clocks in at around 2 and half hours. A very large majority of this is awful storyline between MJ, Peter and Harry.<br/><br/>The most cringe worthy part of this movie is where Peter Parker becomes an emo kid once he has been latched onto by the symbiot gunk. He wears eye liner and has an emo hair style. Obviously this is some crude ploy to try and communicate with the 'youtube generation'. Quite obviously it didn't work at all. It just lowered the picture.<br/><br/>I really don't understand how a very large majority of people on IMDb gave this film 10. Even the fan boys shouldn't really be giving this film a 10 as it changes classic storyline elements. For the sake of story they change the plot so the Sandman originally killed Peter's father, Ben. Also original Spiderman fans, i guess, would hate the idea of making peter Parker an emo kid. Also any film fan with any sense would realise this film was an awful cash in.<br/><br/>The only redeeming part of the film was the dinner scene with Bruce Campbell playing a French waiter. This had the cinema laughing.<br/><br/>So yeah. 2/10. Truly awful film.<br/><br/>Spiderman 1 was quite good. Maybe because of the novelty of it Spiderman 2 was pretty average, not the greatest.

","Here's an easy analogy: Spider-Man 3 is the Spider-Man 1 and 2 as Batman Forever is to Batman and Batman Returns. The third film in both series takes an entirely different approach towards entertainment than the first two did. Rather than sticking to the proved formula that made both Spider-Man 1 and 2 such well-critiqued superhero movies, Sam Raimi has turned Spider-Man 3 into a movie that has no idea what it wants to be.<br/><br/>It tries too hard to be melodramatic, with some of the most clichéd, expected, and cringingly bad dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. The first two Spidey films had a few moments like this, but the third in the series is almost full non-stop with these scenes that make you want to change the channel and find something better on.<br/><br/>When the movie isn't being too melodramatic, however, it's trying to be freakishly campy. The first two films managed to include quite a bit of camp without completely suspending reality, but Spidey 3 takes the small amount of camp from the first two films and extends it to what felt like at least 30 minutes of material that I'll refer to as ""puke"". If any of you remember the ""raindrops keep fallin' on my head"" semi-music-video scene from Spider-Man 2, be prepared to see no less than two scenes that are even worse.<br/><br/>There is, literally, a dance number during the movie, which is a great example of how the filmmakers seem to have completely forgotten what kind of movie they were trying to make. Because despite having a horribly unfitting and annoying dance, the scene suddenly ends with another of those disgusting melodramatic dialogue sequences.<br/><br/>What Raimi did with this film is he tried to do too many things with it. The storyline itself wasn't the problem, however, and despite having so many side story lines and such, the film actually does a surprisingly good job of connecting and resolving them all. However, Raimi seems to have felt the need to add numerous unnecessary scenes and bits of dialogue throughout the film that really drag it down.<br/><br/>To be honest, unlike the case for most action-type movies, I was constantly waiting for the action sequences. I just wanted the melodrama and the dance scenes to end so that the movie could get to the decisive moments and close. I've never left a theatre during a movie, but this was the first case in which I considered it.<br/><br/>The movie has one saving grace: Bruce Campbell's much-expected cameo. It was one of the few moments during the movie that was truly entertaining, and I can only hope that once this movie starts playing on network TV, I'll remember to make sure and see that brief scene again before finding something better to watch.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I feel that Raimi's biggest mistake with this movie is that he tried to make it into something different. As a sequel to two surprisingly good movies, one would hope to see a movie that is similar to those two in terms of action, comedy, and drama. But Raimi tried to do something very different with this one, and unfortunately, it's completely ruined the series for me."
"psychomidget411","2","3","6","6 May 2007"," I want my money back!!
","DOES CONTAIN QUITE A FEW SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>I'm going to start off by saying, I am a very big fan of both the spider man comics, and the movies, but the third instalment of the spider man series, well.... just what a waste of money. <br/><br/>1. The CGI is absolutely terrible. Not only on the swinging scenes, but on venom and pretty much everything else. Venom basically looks like a character from the new TMNT movies its just awful.<br/><br/>2. Total overacting. This is done by most of the characters in the movie to be honest. Topher was good in ""That 70s Show"", but when it comes to big screen hits, he sucks to be blunt. He's average when he is first introduced, but then his cockiness and arrogance just becomes annoying, and it gets even worse when venom shows up. Bryce Dallas Howard just acted terribly throughout pretty much. The crying scene at the end was just laughable, I wasn't the only one in the theatre laughing at it.<br/><br/>3. Too many villains for 1 movie. So within the first few minutes, green goblin shows up again, and gets beat again. 15mins later, Sandman appears, spidey gets his butt kicked. Then the symbiote appears in a really crap scene. Black spidey beats sandman, sandman returns. venom appears, venom and sandman team up for some stupid reason. and they both get beat by harry (green goblin the former villain?) and spidey. then sandman apologises. to fit all of that into 1 hour and 40minutes movie is just stupid.<br/><br/>4. Way, way, way too much dialogue. There was about a 30 minute break, where absolutely nothing happened.<br/><br/>5. The only redeemable scene of this movie was in the restaurant with Bruce Cambell as the french waiter. So, so funny. This was actually the only reason why I rated this movie 2 rather than 1.<br/><br/>6. For half the movie, Spidey turned into some cocky arrogant emo guy, who strutted like a muppet doing stupid little dances. I think they were trying to go for funny, ended up being low budget slap stick humour, which really isn't funny at all.<br/><br/>7. Venom, one of the greatest characters EVER created in the Spider Man universe was in the movie for about 15 minutes. It was just pathetic. Sandman, one of the smaller villains has the entire movie, while venom, one of spidermans biggest enemies has the final 15minutes. And the CGI on his head, was just plain awful. Looked they they hired some novice from a kids animation movie to do the work.<br/><br/>There are some more criticisms, but to be honest, this movie isn't even worth posting about. I just thought people need to be warned not to waste their cash on a movie like this. If you really want to see it, just wait till its on TV, there are way better movies out at the cinema to watch that this heap."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","6","5 May 2007"," Clever screenplay  do not forget that this is comic book stuff after all
","I have heard criticisms about the script of this movie being incoherent, juvenile, preaching, unconvincing, and so on. But things should be put in proper perspective: we must not lose sight of the fact that this is an adaptation from a comic book, not Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The assertion in my summary line rests mainly on the handling of the villains because after everything has been said and done about the ""human stories"", a comic book yarn is really about pitching heroes against villains. The latter, we have three-and-a-half here. There is good old Goblin in a new guise, his son Harry played capably by superbly handsome James Franco (never understand why MJ didn't choose him). There is Sandman (a very different Thomas Haden Church from the one you love in ""Sideways"") who is in essence a disembodied spirit that materializes out of a pile of sand, into beings of all shapes and sizes, ordinary and grotesque, and dematerializes with equal ease and grace. The mind-boggling special effect here alone is almost worth your admission. Then there is the creepy crawling thing that reminds me of the good old days when we had something called cassette tapes, when the worst frustration is to have it jammed in a cassette player, coming out in a hopelessly entangled mess of black ribbons. Now this alien substance manifests itself in two human forms, the ultimate villain Venom (Peter Parker's rival photographer played by Topher Grace) and in one half of Spiderman, the evil half which had hitherto been hidden (sort of Freud's id). The cleverness of the script is in handling the interaction of these villains, among themselves and with the hero. While you will surely see it coming, the culminating two-on-two duel is still fantastic.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, there are ""human stories"" in abundance, but these are not what I buy my admission ticket for. If they turn out fine, I am happy, but not elated. If they are banal cliché, I am forgiving. After all, I don't look for GCI in ""The painted veil"" or even ""Miss Potter"".<br/><br/>The only other thing I'll mention, in addition to the completely satisfactory special effects, is the delightful supporting cast, even in a cameo nature, particularly the father-daughter pair: beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard (M. Night Shyamalan's delightful discover) and James Cromwell who appears in just about very other movie you see, but most memorable lately as Prince Philip."
"babiesgod","9","3","6","5 May 2007"," Big grins
","I really liked this film. I had read a lot of bad reviews, and had prepared for the dancing and singing (which was weird), but I was very pleasantly surprised. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job with his duel role, and Kirstin Dunst didn't annoy me nearly as much as usual. Both the villains were great, too. The sequences with Sandman were amazing. I am NOT a reader of the comics, though, so i came into this movie totally unaware of the characters, which may be why I liked this so much. <br/><br/>There were two things about this movie that i didn't like. I didn't understand the black junk, though. Whatever the stuff is that makes Spiderman black. I wish the movie had explained more about that. Where did it come from? Why doesn't it like sound vibrations? How does it affect people? Why was it attracted to Peter Parker? Also, I didn't think the character of Venom was developed very well. Topher Grace did a great job, and I would have liked to see more of him. Two big thumbs up. :)"
"mandylion11","9","3","6","5 May 2007"," Overall, it's a great movie.
","Overall, it's a great movie.<br/><br/>The Sandman's storyline could have been more explored, as with the other story lines.<br/><br/>The dialog between Harry and Peter *during* the fight sequence was kind of cheesy, so was the scene with Brock speaking in the cathedral--really wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>I hated the news channel narration. And, although I found the scene with Peter dancing and pointing to the girls he passed by kind of funny, I'd prefer his darker side being...I don't know...darker, more evil? It should have been omitted, in my opinion.<br/><br/>It was splendidly complex--the characters of Peter, Harry, and Mary-Jane develop as the trilogy continues. A lot of things happen as the movie goes on, and, it was really nice to watch a complex movie for once after FF:AC. I enjoyed the movie."
"Tight0","2","3","6","5 May 2007"," Worst thing ever conceived
","Sitting through the two and a half hours of Spiderman 3 was like watching a friend smash himself in the face with bricks until losing consciousness. It goes from painful to funny, then back to painful, and then it rests somewhere in the middle. Imagine witnessing that for what feels like an eternity.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, I did not know what to say. I was flabbergasted. While this certainly had some entertaining portions, such as the comic relief scenes or the numerous clichés it stumbles into; laughable pseudo-melodrama could not redeem this gargantuan turd.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 has no heart. It's empty. It's all such a big to-do over nothing. It will surely go on to make billions of dollars, though, since it is Spiderman 3. That was most likely the rationale employed by the makers of the film when they decided to create this overly-long monster. A ""why the hell not?"" attitude. It feels like they spent three days editing it as the film's progression is both sluggish and extremely uneven. Example: The forty minute Peter-Parker-as-Emo-Man dance montage. What was that about? The action is not nearly good enough to justify Tobey Macquire pelvic thrusting his way through New York and subsequently rehearsing moves from Westside Story.<br/><br/>This does not produce any kind of emotional catharsis whatsoever and I am left with no feelings of closure until they make a real sequel to Spiderman 2. Do not, I repeat, do not, give up hours of your life to see this."

But, and this is a big one, 20 minutes in the middle was a big piece of Pooh. Peter Parker goes from nice kid, to cocky, to goth all in that 20 minutes which was really bad, like come on dancing, down the street, to disco music, for 15 minutes, that made me wanna cry, but right after that scene the miracle of spider-man was reborn and left me walking out of theater happy! And venom, was of coarse my favorite villain even though i didn't see a lot of him. Go see it, even if you fear it might be bad just go see it."
"ferguson-6","5","3","6","4 May 2007"," Mr. Sandman, Bring Me a Dream
","Greetings again from the darkness. Being a fan of the first one and disappointed in the second, I had high hopes for this one ... especially knowing Venom and Sandman would be battling Spidey! Director Sam Raimi (responsible for all three and possibly a fourth Spider-Man movie) turns this one into every bit the mess that Sandman is as he is washed out through the sewer system. Too bad the movie can't resurrect itself. Three good things: the black suit, the first few scenes of Sandman and the great Bruce Campbell. The bad things: pretty much everything else ... except a couple of scenes with Elizabeth Banks and an almost unrecognizable Theresa Russell (as Sandman's wife).<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire just doesn't have the chops to pull off ""tough guy"" Spider-Man. Raimi knew this and tried to instill much slapstick. Instead, we just get a failed SNL skit. Maguire has the nerdy Peter Parker down, but his Wes Bentley look flops big time. Kirsten Dunst continues to flaunt the worst hair of any female movie star and is in jeopardy of having her potentially huge career as a real actress pass her right by. James Franco is his usual bland ""little Goblin"".<br/><br/>New bad guys include Thomas Haden Church (""Sideways"") as Sandman and Topher Grace (""That 70's Show"") as Venom. Church is very good, Grace is horrible. Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard is one of several excesses in the film, but it is nice to catch a quick glimpse of Willem Dafoe and an actual speaking role for creator Stan Lee.<br/><br/>By far the funniest part of the film is Bruce Campbell as the French Maitre d' trying so hard to make the evening romantic for Parker and Mary Jane. The best special effects are the first few scenes of Sandman. Most of the other special effects are way over the top and lose their effectiveness.<br/><br/>My absolute biggest complaint is the fact that every major character weeps like a baby at some point. Super heroes and villains shouldn't be weeping!! The amount of emotional junk included in the script is boring, poorly written and horribly executed. This gives the film a dragged out feeling and easily adds 25 unnecessary minutes to the film. Is it fun to watch? The action scenes definitely are. Is it a classic. Absolutely not. Please, Mr. Raimi, let the franchise rest in peace."
"sebasproskater","9","3","6","4 May 2007"," It is not what I expected but it was good
","Spidey 3 I take it better than I did the first 2 all the cool scenes where he is trying to get the ring, when he is fighting sandman it was awesome Sam did a great job with it and Venom ohhh it was wicked the way Sam created him, however I would have liked to see him even more and in a better fight scene just him and spidey like a really good fight scene like with doc. ock in the second one but still I could live with that because the final battle was really cool. Bryce Dallas Howard was also one of the things that made me like this movie even more than the first two she looked incredible as stacey. However I feel that Sam should try to make the next spidey (if their is one) with only one villain not try to put so many villains in one movie especially the cool ones like venom. Even with all the flaws I liked it, it was good, entertaining and cool I give it an 8"
"congletonh","8","3","6","4 May 2007"," Ignore the crap, you'll enjoy the good
","I thought the first movie was a step in the right direction, and the second was a break- through and definitely one of the best super-hero movies ever made. The third? That's tricky, but let me start off by saying it was good.<br/><br/>Much of the movie was very emotional, which I thought brought the movie down a few notches. The movie was packed and no one got emotional or even quiet during the sad or ""touching"" moments. Every one was too busy laughing at the actors' most bizarre and hilarious facial expressions. It just didn't feel necessary to have so many scenes where the actors cry and look like chipmunks. The waterworks just wasn't doing it for me.<br/><br/>That aside, there was a good arch pattern to the plot. You'll enjoy the new web swinging and the camera movements with it, and you'll be blown away by the action sequences. Maguire wasn't his usual self and the same goes for James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst was the usual ""I'm pretty, but also pretty helpless"" character but still good. Thomas Haden Church (Sandman) fit the part well in my opinion even though the character wasn't too exciting. Watching a man made of dirt fight spider-man probably won't go down as a classic moment in cinema history. I was doubtful that Topher Grace would make a good Venom, but I was impressed with the dark sarcasm and the egotistical persona that he brought to the character. He and Maguire had good chemistry, and portrayed the Eddie Brock and Peter Parker rivalry well. Speaking of Venom, he kind of freaked me out. Props to the CGI guys that made him.<br/><br/>If you're looking for the best spider-man yet, you may be disappointed. If you just want to see Spidey kick some bad-guy ass, you're in for a hoot. Enjoy!<br/><br/>PS: Once you watch it, you'll understand why Tobey doesn't want to do any more of these movies."
"YouGotSlayed","9","3","6","4 May 2007"," Not for everyone, but absolutely great if right for you
","I loved this movie, all the way from Peter dancing to Venom knocking his face in. It was great. It had that Sam Raimi humor that that I love so much and was missing from the first two(even Bruce Cambell!) but it also was serious and dramatic when necessary. Some have complained about the editing, too many villains, his emo haircut, the dancing and so-on but if you let any of these things ruin the movie for you I think you may need help because you shouldn't have went to see this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>The editing was great in my opinion, fast but you were easily able to keep up. The dancing and such was all for fun and laughs and was pulled off perfectly. And as for the other stuff, well... it didn't bother me and I believe that if you keep an open mind it won't ruin the movie for you either. Even if you hate all of the things I mentioned their are still some very good visuals and fight scenes to look forward to, so don't miss out because of a few haters, have fun!"
"Oliver-50","4","3","6","4 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3
","When Spider-Man came out I was pleased to see that Sam Raimi handled the superhero story competently and delivered one of the better superhero films. Then he went above and beyond and gave us Spider-Man 2 which is a good candidate for the best superhero movie ever. The first Spider-Man gave us the line 'with great power, comes great responsibility' which was a good foundation for what the film was about. Spider-Man 2 had some much better and more thought-out themes - what is important in life, ambition, suffering. Sam Raimi had set the bar pretty high for anyone who wished to make a superhero movie. Apparently the bar was too high for even Raimi.<br/><br/>Everything that was special about the first two Spider-Man's seems to have been taken for granted in Spider-Man 3. I loved some of the humorous border-line gags that were present; they did a wonderful job of showing Spidey's pain and dedication and they certainly helped relieve some the dramatic tensions. But here, Raimi doesn't even take the characters seriously to begin with. Nearly every scene has some kind of cheap joke or reference that has you scratching your head. When Peter Parkers starts becoming more aggressive from the black goo Raimi never scares us or makes Peter even remotely threatening. Instead, it's a joke. We see Peter strutting down the street, acting cocky with a swagger that looks more pathetic than tempting. I understand that whole 'it's good to be bad' dynamic that Raimi is going for, but have some respect for the audience, geez. I would have been excited to see an angry, menacing Peter Parker for a few minutes and that would have made it all the more dramatic when he bounces back as a good-guy. Instead it leaves you groaning.<br/><br/>The script has managed to make every single character as one-note as possible. We've seen all these actors before, and they have had impressive roles, but here they are hollow. Dunst gets to be mopey and whiny, Franco gets to be a grinning doofus, Howard is pretty and nice. Part of that is Raimi's fault for reducing every scene to it's basics. You know you're in trouble when James Cromwell gives a poor performance. Maguire is passable as Spidey, but he too has very little to work with. The theme of revenge is there, but it's never touched upon in a convincing manner and so Maguire manages to pout, and cry and get angry - but never to any effect.<br/><br/>And that is what leads me to Spider-Man 3's biggest downfall. The Sandman. Ugh. Nothing against Thomas Haden Church - it's a good performance considering what little he had to work with. But there is nothing to the character. There is so little in fact that story elements from the first film are re-introduced just to give us something more about him. Other than that this guy is robbing banks to get money for his sick daughter...that's it. Considering that Spider-man was up against Harry and Venom, did we really need this extra stuff? The effects are some of the best I have ever seen in, but that doesn't make up for the feeling that this character is just filler.<br/><br/>Then we get to the good stuff; Venom. After watching an hour and a half of obnoxious characters and poor writing Raimi delivers a knockout scene in a church where we are introduced to Venom. It's a dark, violent scene and it's what Spider-Man 3 needed. Sadly it only lasts a bit and we're back to the standard damsel in distress/take on the villains finale that is so overblown and hokey - it's painful to watch.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 makes it very clear that everyone in the world loves Spidey. It is shoved down our throats so much - complete with a Spider-Man parade and a shot of Spider-Man oh-so patriotic in front of the flag - that the contrast would have been very effective. It would have taken some skill (and balls) to pull off a dangerous, evil Spider-Man and make us root for him still. But Raimi is never up to the task and as a result Spider-Man 3 is full of jokes...making it one big mediocre joke.<br/><br/>Raimi never has his eye on what matters. He is more interested in noisy/chaotic action scenes and poorly conceived attempts at humor than he is at developing characters and themes. I would have loved to have Sandman eliminated entirely from the film and just have Peter Parker explore his inner demons - and give more screen time to Venom. He manages to under-use every good thing about the Spider-Man 3, and give us way too much of everything that is filler.<br/><br/>It would be a shame to end the series on this low-point. Here's to hoping that Raimi acknowledges his mistakes and gives us a better (not bigger) Spider-Man 4."

I was right. Although interesting, this film doesn't compare to it's predecessors. Sloppy plot work, terrible character development and the ending was just plain poor. Now i'm not being pessimistic the action scenes were amazing and how they introduced Sandman was very good but everything else was just.....bad.<br/><br/>OK let's take for example the new character Eddie, i get what they tried to do, make him out to be like Peter but the evil version but i mean photographer, trying to date an upcoming model, also looks quite geeky?

That's right. In this third installment of the Spider Man series, he pretty much creates a farce of the last two spidey movies, comic books, and action movies in general. <br/><br/>And it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>He uses blatant iconography fitting to the genre, and then makes fun of it every time he gets the chance. He created a comedy with beautiful effects and powerful drama, even if it was making fun of most other drama we see in movies. <br/><br/>Didn't like the movie? Chances are, you were looking at it the wrong way."

I may be wrong about Wat i am saying i am not that informed about it, and if i am wrong correct me but judging from Raimi's work on previous movies it makes me sincerely doubt and wonder.<br/><br/>This movie has extremely cheesy scenes (extra cheesy really), and very fast pacing in telling incomplete mini plots introducing the characters. Something he took some time in previous movies. Sincerely with that plot and scenes it would suck if it wasn't Raimi directing. I can sincerely say from my opinion that Raimi saved this movie.I just wish Raimi had made this in two movies instead of one and took some time telling some compelling stories like in previous movies,just because venom was my favorite villain, he was the dark side of spider man,like an equal who took a different path,like obi wan and Darth Vader, the two sides of a story.<br/><br/>And one more thing my ""review"" is plot-wise, i am analyzing the plot, the time frame of the sequences,the credibility witch Raimi tried to strengthen in the previous movies and the comparison of the characters from the movie with the comic characters in terms of substance.<br/><br/>I still recommend it, but if you know the characters and found the previous movies good or acceptable don't keep your expectations too high."
"missanthropy19","6","3","6","3 May 2007"," This was disappointing (Spoilers galore)
","I went into Spiderman 3 wanting to love it. I loved Spiderman and I loved Spiderman 2 even more. The problem with Spiderman 3 was that they tried too hard to fit too many stories into the one film, tried too hard to take what was great about the first (the awesome action and special effects and the cool concept of a 'nerdy' guy that suddenly gets powers and has to struggle with what he does about it) and what was great about the second (the interesting character exploration of Spiderman - something very very rare in comic book films) and make it work in this film - but unfortunately, it failed to deliver either.<br/><br/>Peter Parker/Spiderman starts out by being the guy he was before he became Spiderman - kind of goofy and clumsy and adoring(in a very annoying way) and then suddenly become arrogant and smug... then some goo comes down from outer space and he's suddenly a bloody thirsty jazz piano playing jerk? It would have worked together if Maguire was a more believable jerk, but ended up looking more like the lead singer of AFI.<br/><br/>The special effects were pretty tame in comparison to the first and second film and the camera angles were often clumsy and annoying.<br/><br/>The plot was poorly paced, with the writers flimsily piecing together elements from the comic book without helping us understand any of them. The holes in the symbiote plot line were gaping - for example, if the symbiote simply replicates or exaggerates characteristics of the host - how come Venom/Eddie Brock took on characters of Spiderman? Shouldn't he have taken on the characteristics of Eddie Brock? The way Sandman got his powers was also a little ridiculous (he falls into some machine that is left WIDE OPEN in the woods and suddenly is 'demolecularised' to become sand?). Generally, I can suspend a lot of belief but that really pushed it for me.<br/><br/>The most disappointing part of the film was the resolution of the conflict existing between Harry Osbourne and Spider-man. This plot line has been developing for two films and very little of the film focused on it. Harry Osbourne's amnesia seemed to be a lazy plot device to move the film along until suddenly Harry remembers, turns bad and tried to kill Peter again (but not before destroying his relationship with MJ). Then suddenly his butler decides to tell him that Peter didn't kill his father, and everything was okay again. Oh, and now he's dead. This was the most interesting part of the first two films and this movie failed to deliver a good resolution.<br/><br/>There were some humorous moments but overall this film did not live up to its' potential. They should have focused more on resolving the tension between Harry and Peter and perhaps introduced the idea of Venom for the next movie. None of the villains in the film had much depth and were of little interest to me."

There were two reasons I went to see this new film: 1) Because I'm a Bryce Dallas Howard fan, and 2) Venom. While this movie *does* have its flaws, I still thought it was the best of the three. Things that made me dislike the first two films weren't present this time around. No more lame villains, thank god! Topher Grace did an excellent job of playing Eddie Brock/Venom. He was one of the main highlights of this film (and, unlike the Green Goblin of the first film, he didn't look like he was wearing a reject Halloween costume).<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire really gave this film his all. Yes, he cries multiple times throughout, but for good reasons (heck, EVERYONE seems to cry in this movie - Peter, MJ, Harry, Aunt May, the Sandman). While a lot of what we see of ""Dark Peter/Spidey"" is quite comedic, he does in fact have some genuinely dark moments (like when he battles Harry for the second time in the movie). When he walks away from someone who once was his friend, and who could very well have been dead, it really shows to what depths Peter has sunk under the influence of the symbiote that binds itself with him earlier on.<br/><br/>Pretty much everyone gets a chance to shine. Old characters aren't forgotten and the new ones, while being given limited screen time, still manage to make an impression. The only person I had very little sympathy for throughout this film was MJ. I've never found Kirsten Dunst to be ""outstanding"" in the role, and she pretty much comes off as selfish/self-involved and just plain petty in this film. It's not good when one half of the relationship (that the films have been based around) is an unsympathetic character. Much more likable is the character of Gwen Stacy (Howard). Though she kind of just ends up being another damsel in distress and is used to make MJ jealous, at least she doesn't come off as a bitch. She's actually very likable. The dance routine at the jazz club between her and Peter is a memorable one.<br/><br/>James Franco does an admirable job in the movie. It's certainly his best performance of the three (and I actually felt for his character by the end). Thomas Hayden Church brings humanity to his character - which is pretty hard to do, given all the CGI that's involved with bringing the Sandman to life. The standout villain, however, has got to be Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom. He's only given a limited amount of screen time, but he's easily the best Spider-Man villain to date (and this was even *before* he succumbed to the symbiote). Grace manages to make Brock hilarious, but at the same time a formidable adversary for Peter (I even felt a twinge of sympathy for Eddie up to a certain point).<br/><br/>The effects, as you would expect in a film such as this, are mind-boggling. The first fight between Peter and Harry - while certainly exciting - was a bit hard to follow. I didn't particularly think much of the fights involving Sandman. The two best action sequences, I thought, were the one involving Spidey saving Gwen (from a crane that's run amok) and the final battle. The scene involving the Sandman taking form for the first time is also really well-done (the music helps). There are certainly some stand-out moments in this film.<br/><br/>Like most final films in trilogies tend to do, this one leaves the book open for if another film were ever to be made, but also puts a lot of story lines to rest. The ending is left pretty much open-ended. While this film may not make me any more a fan of the first two, I definitely enjoyed this one."
"akioussop","2","11","35","6 May 2007"," The worst Spidey film
","I just came back from watching the film and I just had to write a review to warn off potential viewers. It is awful.<br/><br/>I grew up with comics and although Spidey has never been my favorite (I am a Wolverine Fan)I always appreciated the complexities of the character both as spider-man and as Peter Parker.<br/><br/>I think that the main flaw of this film has to be the director and the screenwriters. In both the previous films I thought that Tobey Maguire was quite a good choice for Spidey, but in this film he just constantly got on my nerves. He just comes across as way too geeky and his dark persona just too cheesy rather than dark. All during the film the whole of the cinema was laughing but not with the film but at the film.<br/><br/>On the plus side: Venom...good, Sandmand...good, fights...decent but not spectacular.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it was a waste of money. Spidey 1 & 2 are in my DVD collection, but No. 3 will not be."

"moviegeek310","8","5","13","12 May 2007"," Possibly the best!
","Well folks, summer is now officially here! The first summer blockbuster has been released, and it has broken six box office records. And rightly so, ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the most entertaining, if not the best of trilogy. It is darker, more action-packed, and funnier than either of the first two. Though I thought it was the best, I still have way more quibbles with this one than the first two Spidey's combined. I will get to that later, but first, I will gush about it. <br/><br/>First off, there isn't just one villain, or even two, there are four villains in ""Spider-Man 3"". Some may say it's overwhelming, I say it was flippin' awesome. In the last battle sequence, Spider-Man battles all of them in one of the coolest super-hero fight scenes ever made, a major geek-out for fans. And the actors who play the villains are equally great. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman does very well, though sometimes his performance seems a bit stiff and forced. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom was perfectly cast; he does brilliantly as a cocky reporter, then amazingly creepy as Venom. I will also say this, the way director Sam Raimi portrayed Venom was right on, since he is my favorite villain, I would know. He will definitely send chills down your spine. James Franco returns as the New Goblin/Harry Osborn and does very well as a comic relief for some of the film, and a troubled, downright evil villain the rest of it. <br/><br/>All the other original cast members are back, with Tobey Maguire doing spectacular showing a darker side of Spider-Man. And once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. Kirsten Dunst is nothing special, in two scenes she sings and it is the worst lip synching I've ever seen. There is no expression in her eyes, most of the time she seems wooden. Of course J.K. Simmons as Peter Parker's boss, J. Jonah Jameson, is hilarious as always. A new addition to the cast, one I really enjoyed, was Bryce Dallas Howard as Peter's new love interest, Gwen Stacy. One addition I didn't enjoy was a random butler for Harry Osborn, who just popped out of nowhere, like he'd been there all along. OK, now to get down to the nitty gritty.<br/><br/>The CG was absolutely spectacular. A reported 258 million dollars was spent on this film, a record high for a movie, which means, great CG. The score was not as great as the other two, since Danny Elfman opted to do ""Charlotte's Web"" instead. The music did its job though, and moved the film along. My major nitpick for this film is the scriptwriting. One too many scenes felt like a soap opera as almost every character cried at least once. Another problem was the corny dialogue, which never was a problem in the first two ""Spider-Man's"". It's one of those things where you sit there and think, ""Just give me a pen and paper, and I'll write that scene a million times better, please!"" The runtime is another minor quibble, the film clocks in at 150 minutes, the longest ""Spider-Man"" yet. <br/><br/>Still, as I said before, it is such an entertaining film. You will laugh, cry, jump out of your seat, and all that fun stuff that always accompany blockbusters. So just be prepared to have a good time, and not expect some deep, emotionally moving, thought-provoking film, because you'd be sorely disappointed. You will have fun, I guarantee it."
"peloquin11","5","5","13","1 May 2007"," entertaining spectacle, but low point of the trilogy
","Just saw an early show in Japan.<br/><br/>I really liked 1. I loved 2. 3, however, is the weakest movie. It is entertaining and has many strong elements, but it has a fair share of weaknesses, some forgivable and some not.<br/><br/>My biggest issue was with the villains. They are all interesting and all deserve a whole movie to themselves. Instead they battle for time, and in the end neither the Sandman nor Venom come out very developed. Venom especially feels like an afterthought, tacked on to the story at the last minute. How tacked on? Well, I'll just say that the movie doesn't even spend enough time with the character to let us know that he goes by the name ""Venom."" My second issue was with the ending (which I won't spoil). I'll just say some things are wrapped up too nicely and other things left hanging in such a way that I didn't feel satisfied.<br/><br/>Still, it was well acted and directed. The action sequences are fantastic. It's funny when it wants to be (another great part by Bruce Campbell). I recommend it despite being disappointed."

In roughly 2 and a half hours, I never watched at the clock, it felt like I have hold my breath for the entire time.<br/><br/>Being a Spidey Comic Fan, I love this movie... the characters are very deep and you can always feel like they feel in the movie. And I must admit it: I love Gwen Stacy ;) Being a fan of intense stories and drama, this movie ranks very high. Some of the dialogues were a bit cheesy, but nevertheless I loved it.<br/><br/>Being a big fan of spider-Man 2, I am a bit disappointed. Spider-Man 2 is better, but Spider-Man 3 is still one of the best movies out there and most probably the best movie in 2007."

There wasn't really any plot holes and there was a lot of things to love about this film.<br/><br/>Others might not like it but everyone has there own opinions.

Even the fight scenes, the only semi-redeemable part of the movie, were so dumb that the audience was laughing. The entire theater was having a great laugh at the movie, not because it was supposed to be funny but because it was so ridiculous. Even the supposed dramatic scenes had a laugh. The plot was weak and there were scenes that took up time but didn't really further the plot at all. If I had been watching it at home I would have turned it off about half way through. Don't watch it, and if you absolutely HAVE to see it, save your money and wait for the rental."
"lastliberal","6","4","10","4 May 2007"," I almost walked out
","Yes, I will admit it. There was a point after an hour and a half that I was ready to call it quits. I'm glad I stayed, but it was a struggle.<br/><br/>To start off, the Title was stunning. I really felt that was one of the very best I've seen. Too bad I can't identify who did the opening.<br/><br/>Not to take away from Tobey Maguire, but Kirsten Dunst is critical to my enjoyment of the movie. I thought the idea of having her sing was terrible. She is just above Celine Dion, who rates just above a screeching blackboard to me. No more singing, Kirsten. Please.<br/><br/>Who is Topher Grace? Get him out of here! Thomas Haden Church was good. Two demons is good. New Goblin and Sandman - OK. Venom was too much.<br/><br/>Needless to say the visual effects and sound and music were exceptional. Fight sequences were way too long.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard and Elizabeth Banks - Hot! I liked seeing more of Mageina Tovah. She has a quaint cuteness about her and matches perfectly with Peter parker.<br/><br/>It sure seemed longer than the listed 140 minutes."
"trantor2nd","7","4","10","2 May 2007"," Spiderman 1 with updated special effects
","This movie is loaded with state-of-the-art CGI special effects. The action sequences are ingenious and even better than their comic-book counterparts. Even with painstaking detail given to the characters' background stories, the overall impact is less than that of Spiderman 2. Expectations just went too high. With all 3 movies being directed by Sam Raimi, I had thought there would be a steady improvement. Maybe giving the Director story-writing control was not such a good idea. Here in my country, supermalls with 12 theaters are all simultaneously showing Spiderman 3. Comic-book fans will also not be impressed by the simplified translations. I prefer the comic book versions of Venom and Harry Osborne. Sandman may have been improved but not to the extent of Dr. Octopus in the second installment."
"jemps918","7","4","10","1 May 2007"," Not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks
","Attended the sunrise screening of Spidey 3 in Alabang and the place was buzzing with excitement. It was most fortunate to premiere the film open on a holiday (May 1) because it was pretty packed.<br/><br/>The verdict: not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks, but it's recommended viewing anyway just so you can form your own opinion on it.<br/><br/>True Spiderman comic fans might be disappointed to see that a lot of what's in the main comicbook story lines and characterizations were not dutifully translated on screen. The movie also runs on too long, but nevertheless, the special effects are amazing.<br/><br/>We also get to see a more human side of Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) developing a split personality: Plain vs. Mod Peter Parker/Spidey. In this installment, Spidey's fame inexplicably gets to his head, much to his girlfriend MJ (Kirsten Dunst)'s dismay. He comes across an alien symbiote that attaches itself to him and feeds his darker, more aggressive side.<br/><br/>We get a few laughs when Peter embraces this more vengeful side of him, and his style suddenly gets more mod: dark eyeliner, dark skinny suits, sleek parted hair. He looks like he belongs in an alternative/punk/rock band, complete with the attitude.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the villains were pretty impressive: Goblin Jr. (James Franco) battles it out with Spidey to avenge his father's death. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) plays the powerful, indestructible and ever elusive Sandman, while Topher Grace (That 70s Show, In Good Company) plays Parker's nemesis Eddie Brock/Venom. However, there are quite a number of plot holes (like, how come Peter can control the symbiote as a suit but on Eddie it attaches itself fully and gives him really bad teeth?).<br/><br/>The movie entertained the kids in some parts, but the natives grew increasingly restless as the movie culminates to a flat close. It was as if director Sam Raimi just wanted to throw everything in there. Nonetheless, this movie is pretty sure to rake in the big bucks just with all the hype alone."
"Lise85","1","21","89","2 May 2007"," How tragic for the Spidey franchise
","A big fan of the first two movies, I had been looking forward to this one for months. However, after finally watching Spiderman 3 last night at the premiere in Holland, I have been left in a state of utter shock and disbelief. This movie was a complete embarrassment not only to the Spiderman franchise, but to cinema itself. It is truly difficult to point out the worst bit (and simply impossible to find just a tiny decent one), but the one thing that really hurt me all through this piece of celluloid junk, was how much of an insult to fans of the first movies this was. I have rarely felt like walking out on a movie, but last night I had to force myself to stay put. The director and writers obviously think that audiences are brainwashed creatures who will swallow anything as long as it has Spiderman in the title. Not so - I have never heard such consistent booing in a cinema as I did last night. Piece of advice: If you don't want this absolutely horrendous crap to ruin the brilliant Spiderman 1 and 2, DON'T WATCH IT. If you do anyway, be warned - you'll cringe like you've never cringed before."

"arod_fhornqueen","3","3","7","6 May 2007"," Wha' happened?!?
","I went into the movie theater on a double date, anxious to see the third Spiderman movie. The previews had my eyes sparkling and my jaw dropped. It looked as if this was to be the best of the three Spiderman movies.<br/><br/>After 2 and a half hours, I left the theater holding my boyfriend's hand, thinking, ""Wha' happened?!??!?"" The movie was very sloppily done. Even the CGI was lackluster. Fight scenes were scarce and I felt like I was watching some horrible chick-flick instead of a Spiderman movie. I love Tobey Maguire as Spiderman, but at several times during the movie, I wanted to haul back and slug him in the face. Between him acting like an ignorant, oblivious, self-centered jerk and weeping (rather unconvincingly) at the drop of a hat, his acting was less like a tortured superhero and more like an emo teenager.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst as an actress can be summed up simply: she not only has the acting skills of a 2x4, but she also has the figure of one. Not a single one of her outfits were flattering to her figure. I don't care if she's skinny, just put her in something that makes her look good. Her acting in this movie was enough to make me gag. None of her emotions were believable and I felt no sympathy for her at all. I think the best scene she was in was when Peter accidentally hit her. I don't condone violence towards women, but acting that bad deserves a smack to the face.<br/><br/>It would have been nice if they stuck with one villain, two villains tops. They didn't do justice to Venom at all. He not only got way too little screen time, but in my opinion, Topher Grace was the wrong guy to be cast as Venom. Sandman was pretty sappy, but his story was the most realistic. My heart goes out to James Franco. The poor guy got his butt kicked left and right all through the movie. An explosion that was able to eliminate both Venom AND Eddie Brock with no remains left from the blast somehow only managed to make him a Phantom of the Opera lookalike. And in the end, after surviving all that abuse, he's killed off, shishkabobbed by his own glider. Like father, like son.<br/><br/>And oh my God! The patriotism! Did Spiderman REALLY have to leap in front of a gigantic American flag?!?!? Why didn't we just have a scene at the end where Spiderman says ""Spiderman supports the troops. Do YOU?!?!??"" while we were at it?!?<br/><br/>A movie that had so much potential has sadly fallen into the same trap many other movies have nowadays and ended up a sad disappointment. Several good actors were put to shame by poor film making. I laughed at the funny parts, but it was obvious the humor was forced. After all, what's NOT funny about a complete and utter dork with a bad haircut strutting around John Travolta style while women give him the ""Are you KIDDING ME?!?"" look, or playing piano and dancing at a jazz club? If another Spiderman movie comes out, I will NOT watch it in the movie theater. If it's another disappointment like this one, I'd rather only be out of a couple of hours instead of a couple of hours AND nine bucks.<br/><br/>At least Sam Raimi couldn't screw up J. Jonah Jameson or Bruce Campbell. Oh, and I gotta give Tobey some credit for this line: ""What's the matter Goblin Jr.? Gonna cry?!?"" <br/><br/>Beautiful."
"dwclarkpw","6","3","7","5 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 fails to carry the depth of first two films
","Lacking the originality and simple character-driven story arcs that made the first two Spiderman films such brilliant works of movie-making, Sam Raimi has chosen instead to over-populate his film in the Schumaker Batman franchise style with a cornucopia of overlapping ideas that fail to make us care for anyone.<br/><br/>The film introduces to a strong set of characters, each with the ability of taking the Spiderman series to new heights of emotional and visual depth possibly never seen in this type of film. The battle sequences between Harry and Peter are brilliant works of tragedy, filled with betrayals and heart-breaking moments. The Sandman's story is in many ways a strong attempt to bring Valjean's plight to the 21st Century. And in the final villain(s), we have the greatest foe anyone could possibly face. Pure evil, fueled by unwarranted revenge, with savagery and monstrosity that is unstoppable and undestroyable. These worlds were set-up in this film, but never deliver. The convoluted plot is only strong when it revolves around Peter Parker trying to exist in the world (a point that is also true of the other two films), and here we are given the chance for things to turn truly ugly as the Black costume alters Peter's view of the world. We are given one truly dark moment as a result of the costume, which instantly opens our heroes mind. No turmoil, no real battle within. To make matters worse, we don't even get to see the black suit in action except for one battle sequence.<br/><br/>Spiderman's greatest foe is a side note, a boring character with no real drive who does nothing actually evil. Shoved in as a last thought, Raimi and his writers chose to ignore the possibility of creating a New York afraid of Spiderman as Venom is mistaken for our webbed hero. Brock's love interest opens more dark possibilities for truly terrible things to happen that never do. There are no struggles, no gains, no real battles in this film."
"GradysGhost","4","3","7","5 May 2007"," Not without its moments...
","Though Spider-man 3 has a handful of moments that are successfully executed, they are far outweighed by scenes that feel more like torture.<br/><br/>I assumed before going into the theater that Bruce Campbell would make his cameo and that I would laugh when I saw it, and probably be the only one who did. I assumed that scenes in the Daily Bugle's main office would make me chuckle. I assumed that Spider-man 3 would improve on its predecessor the way Spider-man 2 improved on the original. My first two assumptions were correct. The last was wrong.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw this movie has - and believe me, it's unignorably huge - is the melodrama. I'm all for drama. I'm all for romance. If you want to infuse these elements into a summer blockbuster superhero comic book flick, by all means, please do. It'd be a nice change of pace. To be nice, I'll say that I've seen less melodrama in certain soap operas than I saw today in Spider-man 3. Some parts were downright laughable. The quivering lips, for example. I thought that Tobey Maguire's lips and Kirsten Dunst's lips were turning into caterpillars, were, in fact, going to crawl straight off their faces.<br/><br/>There are also a few parts that just don't make sense. To avoid spoiling the movie for anybody (as if it needs any help), I'll say that a particular character is present while an explosion with flames at LEAST fifteen from the blast point goes off less than a foot from said character's head. The character survives. About a third of his face has some mild scarring.<br/><br/>The character development is top-notch for our tarantulan hero, as well as for Mary Jane and Harry. The two villains introduced here must split their screen time and so get less development. I didn't really understand Venom's plight, but was forced to accept it anyway. If he were a real human being (and I accept that he's not), he would have seen that HE was the one in the wrong and moved on with life.<br/><br/>The special effects are great for the most part. The sandman, on the small scale, is nothing short of amazing. As an eight-foot-tall monster, he reminds me of The Mummy Returns, with The Rock's face and body wrapped about a digital scorpion.<br/><br/>The end result is a $250 million movie that would probably have been better suited for a straight-to-DVD release. Don't waste your time seeing this in theaters unless you'll enjoy watching a superhero version of Titanic - poor, flat acting; mostly good eye candy; bad pacing; and a truly laughable attempt at tugging at the audience's heartstrings."

","Spiderman 3 is a very decent movie. Much like its predecessors, it is rich in story and is an adequate comic adaption. Sam Raimi definitely knows his stuff when it comes to making movies like these.<br/><br/>Most critics and viewers will talk about how this movie is the weakest of the three, or the best of the three. This movie is neither. It is entertaining, keeping you on your seat during the fights and blends it with story and character development. It also has its flaws.<br/><br/>Most Spidey fans will see this movie because of the villains, this one stars Venom, Sandman, and the second green goblin(Harry Osborn). True fans of the comic will not like how much screen time is given to Venom. He is very underused and for good reason. Sam Raimi was coerced to include this character into the movie, making it seem convoluted with too many things going on.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire seems out of his comfort zone when he dons the black suit and changes his entire personality. It doesn't fit well with the he is portrayed. The characters who are Peter's friends, often do quirky things and dance and sing, which some people dislike.<br/><br/>Not being a cinematic masterpiece, it it still worth seeing, either going to the theatre or waiting for the DVD release.

"John_Wayne_00","2","3","7","5 May 2007"," Simply terrible
","First off, I am not a Spider-Man-fan. I didn't like the story of the first two parts, but after watching the trailer of this one, I was sure it was worth watching. Well, I got disappointed. Badly. <br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 was most definitely the worst movie I watched during the last months, mainly because of the following reasons: The movie is loaded with different parts of a fairly complex story that are supposed to intertwine and intersect towards the end, but that just fails. There is way too much to be told, and most of it is simply unnecessary. There are some good parts though, like the character changes due to the alien stuff and the different levels the movie is trying to access then (""everybody CAN make the right choices""), but that's it. <br/><br/>The acting really is bad. Tobey Maguire is acting like a dork throughout the whole movie, and while it fits during his ""good-guy-scenes"" it becomes unintentionally hilarious when he changes into a goth kid trying to impress all kinds of women on the streets. This leads me to the next point: The behavior of most characters is beyond my comprehension. MJ is acting incredibly stupid, not being able to decide between Peter and Harry and jumping back and forth without having any reasons for actions. Peter at least has the excuse to be partly influenced by that alien stuff, but still, his behavior is absolutely not understandable. Harry tries to kill Peter and then all of a sudden he decides that they are still friends, just because his butler tells him that his dad actually was a bad guy. Oh wow, of course, than the guy who ruined his face must be his friend; right. Especially towards the end everybody's sorry again, forgetting everything that happened before, just because Spider-Man needs a happy ending and there were obviously only five minutes left to finish the whole story off. Finally, the 2 second scene where Spider-Man lands in front of a screen-size American flag should clarify the level of this movie... <br/><br/>I'm sorry, I tried to get into it, but it definitely didn't work out... Horrible movie, that's all I can say."

","With the first two ""Spider-Man"" films, director Sam Raimi took on the thankless job of transferring one of the most popular comic book superheroes of all time to the big screen and managed the trick with grace, energy and aplomb.<br/><br/>As depicted in those films, young newspaper photographer Peter Parker was a lovable nerd, his alter-ego Spider-Man was a saucy and valiant altruist, his sweetheart Mary Jane Watson was a sweet but somewhat broken flower, his best buddy Harry Osborn was a happy dope crippled with Oedipal neuroses, and his nemeses -- the diabolically warped scientists Doctor Octopus and the Green Goblin -- were suitably juicy, fiendish and larger than life.<br/><br/>The two ""Spider-Man"" movies were rivaled only by Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films in bringing the paneled page to the big screen -- and they constituted a second fine series from Raimi, who made his name with the ""Evil Dead"" movies.<br/><br/>But somewhere there exists a well where filmmakers go to dredge up the creative magic required for films like these. The producers of the ""Batman"" movies found that well dry after Burton was replaced by Joel Schumacher, who made two awful films.<br/><br/>Now Raimi's latest effort, ""Spider-Man 3,"" is here, and while it's nowhere near as catastrophic as, say, ""Batman & Robin,"" it's long, wan and tired in the vein of ""Superman Returns."" There's still a lightness of touch -- Raimi can reliably punctuate a film of this scale with skewed humor -- but the verve, the thrill, the razzle and the dazzle are all but gone. And I suspect people who love Spider-Man from the comic books will be more disappointed with it than people whose chief connection to him is through the movies.<br/><br/>Raimi has all his stars back: Tobey Maguire in the title role, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. They're joined by two new faces: Thomas Haden Church as career criminal Flint Marko who transforms into the Sandman, and Topher Grace, as Parker's career rival, Eddie Brock, who becomes the anti-Spider-Man known as Venom.<br/><br/>They're all perfectly suited to their tasks: the strengths of Maguire, Dunst, Franco and Harris have been steady throughout the series; Church and Grace fit their roles nicely; and such stalwarts as J. K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks and, especially, Bruce Campbell provide swell comic moments.<br/><br/>But the comedy is surrounded by a lot of melodramatic storytelling, little of which truly compels: In addition to a romantic crisis with Mary Jane and a protracted effort to reconcile with Harry, Parker's host to an alien parasite that changes his personality, he learns that Marko is the real killer of his Uncle Ben, and he accidentally creates -- and then must vanquish -- Venom. And the action scenes, so impressive in the previous films, bring nothing new or especially memorable.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" is a likable film -- Maguire's personality, or Raimi's channeled through him, is genuinely charming. But the tenor of the film is too often too muted, melancholy and enervated for something of its size. When Parker first figured out how to swoop through the city on his webs in the first film, it imparted a rush. But nothing here quite ever catches so big a breeze; far too often, it feels grounded, dutiful, dull. At the end, Parker is ambivalent about both his romance and his crime-fighting career. And I suspect that audiences might feel similarly uncertain about further Spider-Man adventures."
"LazySod","4","3","7","5 May 2007"," Bottom of the well - time to end the series
","Spider-Man is back. This time he's about to marry his girlfriend, and also about to find one of his worst enemies. Wait? Is this new? It sounds so much like the story of the first film, and the one of the second film. Anyway, there we have it. Spider-Man comes to tangle with yet another enemy, in a tale that is yet much the same as the others.<br/><br/>In the first part of the film I was slightly irritated by the characters and the way they got completely pulled out of context by the ridiculous way they were played. Then I more or less accepted that that was the shallow way the series was written in the first place and that's where it got slightly better. But only slightly. Next part was eye-candy. Special effects to the max, albeit bad special effects. For a film of this caliber and budget I was expecting much better. Then comes the continuation of the story and I can't say that was entirely appealing either. To be brutally honest, I found it an insult toward the comic series and an insult to the previous two films.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a film I didn't expect much from, but one that still managed to give me even less. Complete and utter waste of tape.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 spiders tangled in their own web of shallowness."
"dbtwin28","4","3","7","5 May 2007"," Severely Disappointed
","In a nutshell, this movie is ALL OVER THE PLACE. That's as plain as I can put it. It was an all out action flick, then it was an over done drama, oh wait now it's a really campy comedy, but NO, it's a musical too.<br/><br/>Spider-man 3 has a lot of action scenes that just come out of nowhere, really long action sequences, that are really had to follow. Remember the fight between DOC OC and Spidey in 2. It was fast paced and you could follow the action, no so in this film. Even when a fight seen is ran in slow motion a.k.a. bullet time the action still isn't clear.<br/><br/>On top of that, character don't look realistic while fighting. Spider man looks like rubber during fights, and a lot of the time the New Goblin looks like a bad matte.<br/><br/>It seems much of the money spent on this movie went into the action sequences, and the story severely suffers. I think word of mouth will kill this movie. This was supposed to be this summer's first blockbuster, I'm not impressed. After seeing Spider-Man 3, I'm REALLY excited for TRANSFORMERS. I really can't see TRANSFORMERS being worst than Spider-Man 3."
"dpask-2","2","3","7","5 May 2007"," Brutal
","This installation of the popular comic was unbelievably bad.<br/><br/>As with many other action movies in the past they tried to up the plot and downplay the action in hopes of creating a sequel that can be seen as something of substance. Basically what you're left with in this case is about 2 hours of soap opera grade acting and around a half hour of combined action.<br/><br/>Not only that but many guy on guy crying scenes, pretty much everyone in the movie cries at least once, peter parker at least 8 times and with really odd contorted faces during the crying which only leaves the audience laughing. Then there's this whole part where peter embraces his 'dark side' unfortunately it seems his dark side is from the 70's and john Travolta, so you ask yourself, what does he do when he turns to the dark side; hit the bottle, maybe a little killing...nope...strutting down the new York streets Saturday Night Fever style, shooting from the hip and air humping...oh yahhh. Oh and lets not forget the eyeliner, fyi, Toby Maguire Emo, not so great.<br/><br/>All together it was massively horrible, the entire theater continuously laughed at how bad it actually was. For the first hour, nothing happened at all till the green goblin jr made an appearance on what looked to be a badly done up snowboard with rockets and cpu fans attached to it.<br/><br/>Seriously...save yourself the money, I saw this movie at 11:30 at night after a half dozen beers and it still wasn't' good. This is a DVD kinda movie and even then, it may not even be worth it. And oh joy, they're apparently making a fourth."
"bowser05","9","3","7","5 May 2007"," A Superhero Movie That is actually GOOD?
","I will admit that though I love to watch superhero movies, they do not normally make good movies overall. The Spider-Man films have tried hard to break that mold and have slowly been doing so, and this tops it off. Spider-Man 3 has a great conflict and plenty of action, along with romance and comedy. Nothing ever feels like too much and the only thing preventing this from being really good is the lack of screen time for Venom and the seemingly rushed end. They could have left Venom out and left him for the next movie so that the story just revolved around the other villains. Nonetheless this is one superhero sequel you WON'T want to miss."
"pujapatankar","5","3","7","5 May 2007"," Wouldn't see it again, wouldn't recommend it
","I am ardent fan of comic book movies and always thought that Spiderman 1 & 2 were couple of the best made movies of that genre. Obviously, I went to see the movie with great expectations. I had some reservations as to how they were going to fit so many characters in the movie, and sadly my fears were not baseless.<br/><br/>At no point does the movie catch a tempo and maintain it. Its one hour too long and there are too many characters. Too many friends and too many foes!! Not to account for the multiple personalities Spidey goes through himself! There are really long periods of the film where absolutely nothing is happening...just some sappy love triangle brewing. And whats the deal with Uncle Ben. The guy's dead for crying out loud. Is there no other interesting angle in Spidey's life?!! All in all the movie is average. Terribly disappointing for fans especially after Spiderman-2. My advice is, if you have to watch the movie, don't have any expectations. 90 minutes into the movie you could take a restroom break, hell you could take a shower and come and you wouldn't miss anything. Best of luck!"
"johnjajm","2","3","7","4 May 2007"," Monumental disappointment
","What the hell happened? Even their attempts at comedy were pitiful. I suspect they knew this movie was a stinker because of the over done, over acted, overly dramatic and just plain over the top crowd scenes near the end where everyone was just so in awe of Spidey. And then the scene where he swings in front of the American flag to demonstrate to the audience that he is a hero and we are supposed to like him? Why should we when he has become an egocentric, clueless, crybaby? And MJ has become manipulative and narcissistic; unable to make up her mind which nut she wants to be with. Harry, as it turns out, is the only likable character and the only one with any depth. I haven't walked out of a movie since Uncle Buck. I didn't walk out of this one, but I seriously thought about it. Stan Lee and Sam Raimi should be ashamed of themselves."
"dr_foreman","5","3","7","4 May 2007"," Spidey on autopilot
","I had fun watching Spider-Man 3, but I can't deny that it's a mess.<br/><br/>What the critics are saying is true; this is a stale movie, packed with too many villains and too many supporting characters who are completely wasted. Thomas Hayden Church has a few great scenes as the Sandman, but he disappears for huge chunks of the film, and his storyline never quite comes together. Bryce Dallas Howard has even less to do as Gwen Stacey, and James Cromwell, playing her dad, barely features at all. And Venom - the most famous Spider-Man villain of the 1980s and 1990s - has what amounts to a glorified cameo.<br/><br/>Why on earth is this film so overstuffed, so overwrought, so sloppy? Who thought it was a good idea to include three villains? And who actually believed that the tedious soap opera scenes between Mary Jane and Peter worked? I'm sad to say that they produced groans and derisory laughter in my local theater.<br/><br/>The worst problem with the film is that Spidey isn't even properly characterized. I've been sort of a Spider-Man fan for twenty years now, and I understand the character. He is supposed to be *funny* - witty, sarcastic, charming. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is none of these things. He's just a depressed, charmless drag. A total social misfit. He's nowhere near charismatic enough to be Spider-Man, as I envision the character.<br/><br/>So, saddled with a drippy Spidey and a messed-up plot, this movie can only be so good. Even the much-vaunted special effects aren't so great; they look like a super-advanced computer game or cartoon. Frankly, I'm sick of CGI, and I'm ready for a new special effects revolution. I want more real stunts and more ""physical"" special effects in my blockbusters. For goodness' sake, I actually think the action scenes from 1950s war movies eclipse Spider-Man 3 in the excitement stakes, and that's bad! <br/><br/>I also had major problems with two important plot points. Point one: the symbiote is never properly explained. Point two: some random butler character comes out of nowhere and resolves the most important conflict in the film. Good grief, why?<br/><br/>Despite having all these flaws, Spider-Man 3 delivered about two stars' worth of entertainment for me; I give credit to James Franco, who rises above the material and gives a likable performance. But I still think this movie might kill the now uber-expensive Spidey franchise, or at least blunt public enthusiasm. Audience members in my theater seemed disappointed and lacking in energy. And who can blame them?"
"palmat","3","3","7","4 May 2007"," Jumping the shark
","I am not sure whether this film jumped the shark at the scene with Parker dancing in the jazz club or Spiderman running heroically in front of the stars and stripes. The franchise after being praised for being fresh and different, now seems to have reached the dizzy height of 'Batman and Robin'. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two films and feel very disappointed by this next episode. It is a shame that they have taken a complex villain like Venom and turned him into what is essentially a pantomime villain. 'Where is Venom, he's behind you'. Bruce Campbell was easily the most memorable thing in the whole film, apart from maybe all the quivering lips at the end!"
"saintly_lolly_pop","5","3","7","4 May 2007"," Not impressed and neither was most of the audience *SPOILERS*
","I saw it at the 11:59 pm Thursday May 3rd showing at a local cinema. I have been waiting for this film for years and was psyched about Venom and seeing them explore Spidey's dark side. However, the more I think about it, the more I was let down.<br/><br/>Spider-man 2 blew my socks off. I went back and saw it several times in the cinema. The latest installment however...<br/><br/>What worked for S2-character driven plot-line. While S3 was too somewhat, I didn't care for them this time around. Had they focused solely on Venom or Sandman it would have been much better. We saw Doc Ock as a man who was in love, someone you could be friends with. We saw the tragic death of his wife and his slow decent into 'madness'. They tried to do that with Marko but failed. So when he creeps up into the little girl's room I was thinking 'oh god, not in a kid's room, are you crazy?' Then he looks at her. He could be a pedophile for all I know. Only later do we learn he is her father. If we had been shown some time he spent in jail, reading letters from her, humanising him more, maybe then I would have felt bad for him and sympathised. All we see of Marko is him for 2 minutes as a man, the rest of the time he is a pile of sand. Yay. How am I supposed to feel anything for some sand?<br/><br/>Now Venom... love Venom, great bad guy. Visually I think they did a great job, but there wasn't enough time spent showing him vs. Spidey. Venom's powers are at least twice that of Spider-mans, but we never get to see that. We're never really told or shown how his webbing is stronger, that HE is stronger. They really should have spent more time showing the evolution of Brock and his build-up of animosity towards Parker. Instead, what do we see? He begs Peter not to ruin his career then two seconds later he's at the church asking God to kill him. <br/><br/>Oh, and don't even get me started on Black Spidey. OK, I totally get what they were trying to do with Peter's new hair, but somehow it was uncomfortable. So much so that whenever he would appear on screen with that hair, half the cinema audience would laugh. It just didn't work. And in the beginning, we immediately see Peter not as we knew him, but self- absorbed. Where's the Peter we knew from the last movie? That's the Peter I wanted to see and didn't see until the very end where he forgives Marko. They should have kept him like that until he first learned of Marko killing Ben, then let his dark side emerge, not before. Before that moment there was no reason for the symbiote to be attracted to him, because it's attracted to aggression. When it latched onto Pete's bike in the park, there was no aggression there!<br/><br/>All in all, there was just too much going on. Too many plot lines, too many subplots. They did well with Harry and Jameson of course. Bruce Campbell's part was fantastic as always. Mary Jane wasn't bad either. Will I buy it when it comes out on DVD? Probably, but I doubt I'll pay $8 to see in in the theatre again."
"ombart","5","3","7","4 May 2007"," Why is the rating so high? Corny, inconsistent, and irrelevant.
","Recently I am very puzzled about IMDb ratings - here is north of 8 for a very thin story with a lot of holes (Spidey+Ugly Duckling not realising a meteor hitting earth withing 10 metres from them?) and several completely fishy twists (who killed or else or not Old Ben?), several occurrances of embarrassing corniness (highest cringe factor: Spidey plus Flag) and blatant repetitiveness (yet another finale saving Ugly Duckling from the baddie) spiced up with impressive but by now too well known SFX. Ah well, I guess I am a proof to the case that the movie earned its right to exist by milking the crowd for a few more dollars with the same brand. Still gave it a five, as Toby's ""grease"" scenes were a good laugh at least."
"simonparker1990","7","3","7","4 May 2007"," Not so amazing Spiderman
","Spiderman 3 has possibly been one of the most over hyped, over PR'd movie in cinema history. In fact by the time I was sitting comfortably in my seat about to watch the movie I felt I had seen way too much of the movie already, and was actually pretty sick of seeing numerous Spiderman posters dotted around all over the place. However, despite ignoring my slight hesitations, despite realising it was never going to live up to hype over the movie, the ultimate disappointment of this movie is the fact it left me feeling empty. For a two and a half movie boasting three villains, two romances, numerous fight sequences and lots of crying its quite an achievement. In fact the movie seems to be lacking a lot of things. It never seems ambitious, in fact at times it feels like its running in circles rather than movie the story forward. And the only time the story seems to movie forward it eventually goes backwards yet again. I suppose where the movies goes wrong is the fact is decides to introduce three villains, all three interesting enough, but then the director has decided to use them barely at all and just make them add to an already over packed movie. I will give the movie its due, it isn't bad. In fact had this not have been the big summer opening this might have scored a 7/10. However despite its cool action sequences, half decent performances and a final hour that does really work, it never feels as good as it could have been. Spiderman 1 was flawed but was still a well though out movie, Spiderman 2 was absolutely spectacular, but Spiderman 3 is a jumbled mess with moments of brilliance. In terms of sequels this seems to go firmly alongside X3, too much goes on in both of those movies.<br/><br/>Well lets first talk about the performances. First has to be Tobey Maguire as I am about to say something I never thought possible. I have finally excepted him as Spiderman. In the past two movies I found him annoying, here, despite when he decides to go emo on us (excruciatingly awful scenes there), he does a brilliant job. He seems to be well thought out here, his character conveying vast ranges of emotions. My only problem with him were in the ""evil-Spidey"" sequences, that were very bad in my eyes. Kirsten Dunst here seems sidelined, well not her character, but her performance. She has little to work with here, she seems more prop placement than a character in her own right. Topher Grace is pretty good as Venom and his alter-ego, but his character has far too little screen time so we never really get to see his purpose in the movie. As I've said many times Venom deserves a movie all to himself, not ten minutes of screen time! Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church perhaps frustrated me the most. Church is a superb actor, yet here he seems pointless. Sandman as a character is never explored, an unnecessary sub-plot about his daughter just adds layers to a story that is way too over packed. My view is that either Sandman or Venom had to be dropped for this movie to ever reach its full potential. Now James Franco does well, he's easily the best thing in the movie. His character is the most complicated and remains the most interesting. Gwen Stacey on the other hand, well lets not even go there. A waste of an opportunity if you ask me.<br/><br/>The action sequences of Spiderman 3 I suppose are its highlights, a shame there are huge gaps between the fights, and not a single one comes even slightly close to the greatness of the train scrap between Doc Ock and Spiderman in the first sequel. The fights here looks amazing, the CGI is very impressive, especially the stuff with Venom and Sandman. And the final fight sequence is something behold. Yet all the fights get a bit repetitive after a while, the stuff with Sandman is instantly forgettable. In fact its only the Goblin and Spiderman sequences that really stick firmly in memory, they're brilliantly edited and they have a power the other fight sequences really seem to lack. As I've said there's not too much action, the movie is padded out to 2 and half hours with annoying romance sequences and lots of crying. The romance goes nowhere once again and seems to be doing another lap of what we've seen before. It now just seems boring and I wish Raimi would get a backbone and give them something daring to deal with.<br/><br/>Overall Spiderman 3 comes out as passable entertainment. But for a movie hyped up to be the best film of the year it just manages to scrape above average. A plodding run time, too much going on and lots of other faults make it a forgettable experience. The action sequences and good performances make the movie do well, and if you're a Spiderman fan you're still likely to enjoy the movie. But don't expect anything amazing, as Spiderman 3 is anything but."

","I have been a pretty big spidy fan, but this movie was quite a disappointment. The acting was VERY corny. It almost felt like I was watching a blooper reel a lot of the time! I didn't mind when the 'revenge' suit made him become violent--even to his friends. But when he started dancing around on the sidewalk...I sunk into my chair in laughter. It was so corny! If you take out all the corny scenes of his bangs in his eyes, and making a fool of himself in the jazz club...it wasn't a complete disaster. The plot wasn't too bad, and the acting...could have been better, but I've definitely seen worse. The special effects were nicely done, and there were a couple parts where I actually cared about what was going on. But for a good bit of the time, I was trying my best not to laugh.<br/><br/>If you're loyal to the spider man movies...go see it. Wouldn't recommend it though! ... Disappointed"

I was expecting that since this was the last movie, I should give it the benefit of the doubt that this movie will go out kicking and screaming, but it failed to deliver. Since this was probably the last movie, the tried to end it with a bang, aside from the final fight scene, there wasn't much bang, in fact I almost fell asleep during the movie. There was one angle i thought they way over played, and that was when the symbiont took over parker. It gave him this attitude and swagger, I understand thats what it was suppose to do, but do you really need to spend so much movie time and useless scenes to show it, it was way over done. There was nothing really new to this movie, except they added 2 nice looking lady, one was the secretary and the was the blonde girl Gwen. Another thing that bothered me was too many villains in this movie. There wasn't any stop, one scene would be parker taking out the goblin, then to the sandman right away, made no sense. Or sandman to venom scene quick changing. But I expect it to be messy since they tried to fit 3 villains into this film.<br/><br/>I didn't like this film nor hated it. For spider fans, I think you should go see it, since this is probably the last spider movie. But don't expect too much from it you haven't seen already. And only 1 good fighting scene at the end."

Personally, i think they tried to copy Batman Begin's humane depiction of Batman but did a very poor job at that.<br/><br/>THe story was way too chaotic. Too many subplots and things back and forth. THe villains seemed a little formidable but come one, green goblin jr smiling away like a retard (not the joke likes)....real bad guy persona.<br/><br/>I would go see this with a large coke and small popcorn.

","It seems the writers did not stick to the same Spider-Man formula of the two previous films. That's fine and dandy, but something simply went wrong with this new spin on Spidey's web ...<br/><br/>The movie seemed too loose. There was really never enough time to learn more about the characters. So, it's not that there were ""too many story lines,"" there was just not enough time to develop them.<br/><br/>The worst aspect of the film is that I feel cheated. The fight between Spider-Man and Venom was far too short. <br/><br/>Plus, Venom is an awesome villain and one of Spider-Man's most dangerous adversaries, where an entire film could be spent on him. Why waste an entire character like they did? Again, Venom should have been the main villain in this movie, or they should have saved him for the next one. <br/><br/>Too much at once, which would not be a problem if the film satisfied the task. <br/><br/>Overall the film is really average in my opinion. At least $250 million dollars went into making this film. Why? <br/><br/>RATED: Mediocre"

","Im an avid moviegoer, save for the odd low-budget or independent film i watch only commercial cinema be it from any country, needless to say I was eager to watch this movie before anyone and since my friend is in movie distribution I was invited for the preview of the film.<br/><br/>I was really excited when i saw the previews and even though I was well aware of the demographic appeasement policy of the studios, i didn't scale my expectations down by too much, I'm easily satisfied no amount of material could take away the pleasure of watching such awe-inspiring special effects....<br/><br/>Or so I thought!!!<br/><br/>Heres the part where I justify the summary (guessing the demographics and their tastes take with a pinch of salt).<br/><br/>THE FANS - They will love the little details in this movie, cram enough facts and names in any comic movie and they will have an orgasm, any adherence to the comics will earn brownie points with them and from my research I've learned that movie has remained very true to the comic universe and even clear some plot holes from the earlier films.<br/><br/>BUT whatever happened to the secret identity at least few thousand people know by now who spider-man is, and by killing of so many characters (goblin for one) they are definitely going to lose some advantage.<br/><br/>STILL THIS IS WILL BE THE SECOND MOST SATISFIED DEMOGRAPHIC.<br/><br/>THE CRITICS - Satisfying them is even easier than the fans prerequisites are 1) The movie should be long (140 mins in this case) however exceptions are allowed for foreign language films which are all good.<br/><br/>2)There should be long boring parts with lots of conversations and deep emotional moments, crying is a must AND BOY IS THERE CRING SPIDERMAN IS CRYING, MJ IS CRYING, HARRY IS CRYING, AUNT IS CRYING, HELL EVEN THE DEAD UNCLE IS CRYING, all this is OK right how else do you please the drama lovers BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE...<br/><br/>NOW THE BLOODY Villains ARE CRYING MAN VENOM IS CRYING GOBLIN IS CRYING AND EVEN SANDMAN IS CRYING even apologising for gods sake.<br/><br/>ACTING WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CONSIDERED SUPERB IF THESE CRITERIA ARE MET.<br/><br/>BUT it is a big studio movie and with loads of action and special effects that distract from the interesting story of man torn between his 2 lives(sic) hence they wont give the super high rating.<br/><br/>Still this will be third happiest demographic.<br/><br/>THE ORDINARY MOVIEGOER (alomst me)- We don't really care about the details keep us interested for 105 mins and we are happy, add in some more special effects, some more twists, some more drama and some more eye candy and even 120 mins will do.<br/><br/>BUT this movie is 140+ mins there are long stretches of drama and only these many big action scenes and not to mention no eye candy (KIRSTEN LOOKS HIDEOUS).<br/><br/>This demographic will be satisfied for now BUT NOT FOR LONG.<br/><br/>THE OPINIONATED AND NOSTALAGIC COMMERCIAL MOVIEGOERS - We long for more movies of the kind we like (in my case the simple action movies of the yesteryear's the good guys were good, the bad guys were bad and bloodshed always followed, in between there was some drama, some hot chicks, and some sorrow but in the end the bad guy lost and there were celebrations), IN THIS CASE THIS MOVIE WILL NOT FIT INTO ANYONES IDEAL COMMERCIAL MOVIE.<br/><br/>BUT There are once again a fair number of awe-inspiring effects and 6-7 good scenes and we will never really find this movie bad (still gave the lower rating to discourage such movies and not raise expectations).<br/><br/>GREAT COMIC SCENE IN THE RESTAURANT.<br/><br/>We will be satisfied but have loads of opinions.<br/><br/>BLACKS WILL RAISE A CRY ABOUT THE LACK OF BLACK ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE (eventually).<br/><br/>AND NOW FOR THE MOST SATISFIED DEMOGRAPHIC.<br/><br/>THE CHICKS - If ever there was a chick flick that was parading as an action film this was one.. 1) All the men are sensitive (a less offensive word) and cry (read earlier) women will get MULTIPLE ORGASMS SEEING SUPERSTRONG SENSITIVE MEN. 2)The women are strong characters with loads of advise which turns out to be true, all of them are loved by their men, HELL THEY EVEN ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO THROW A CONCRETE BLOCK TO SAVE Their MAN. 3)There are more kisses, romantic, and tearful moments then the most romantic film ever made.<br/><br/>YAY SPIDERMAN IS DANCING.<br/><br/>BUT Some people died and they should have reformed and lived liked that other villain<br/><br/>Still women WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>Must stop rambling so heres the verdict.<br/><br/>If you will give in to the hype then PROCEED WITH CAUTION.<br/><br/>-s read above, CHICK FLICK, not enough satisfying action, too much demographic appeasement,LONG BORING STRETCHES.<br/><br/>+/-s CHICK FLICK, you could be in the right demographic.<br/><br/>+s decent acting,MIND BOGGLING SPECIAL EFFECTS, something for everyone.<br/><br/>total 4/10 (actually its more of a 5-6/10 movie but want to discourage such movies and pull down the hyper inflated rating, it met my highly lowered expectations)."

","Spider-man 3 had some fantastic fight scenes. Spider-man fights Venom on top of a taxi hanging 80 stories in the air! That is gold! Shoving Sandman's face into a subway train? Classy, classy stuff. Top marks for the sweet fight scenes. However, the action just wasn't enough to save the film from what were, in my mind, some of the cheesiest lines in history. You know, it's not even that they were cheesy. It's like they were pulled directly from the comic book, so if you don't mind that, then you'll love the movie. My point is that, when I heard lines such as ""Tell it to my father. Raise him from the dead."" or ""I'm not a bad person. I just have bad luck."", it was all I could do not to laugh. I don't know how the theater was when you went, but in mine, there was definite laughter at parts that were intended to be serious. It's not the actors' faults, I thought they were all incredible. The script just lacked realism, it didn't sound natural. However, that's not to say that there weren't some funny lines, including the funniest cameo I've seen in a while by Bruce Campbell. Plus, who doesn't love J. Jonah Jameson?"

They hit their parts perfectly and it works like classic Raimi.

"Tchigorin","6","3","7","4 May 2007"," Maudlin, Not Up to Par
","Mild Spoilers but not for anyone familiar with comics: While the fight scenes are fantastic and the special effects flawless, this film---which shows moments of promise---fails because of its triteness and excessive absurdity. Anyone who goes to a spider-man film expects the impossible to happen---but not in a manner so ridiculous and incongruous. Men do not just happen upon de-molecularizer rays in the middle of the New York suburbs. Bank robbers are generally not motivated by the need to find a cure for their child (who still seems alive and well enough in the film). <br/><br/>The ridiculous (not just improbable) incidents hurt this film. However, it is the trite appeals to sentimentality that damn it. The film begins on a childishly happy note, and just when one thinks that an interesting moral dilemma is about to appear---one that says something to adults---the film falls back into trite maxims. <br/><br/>See the film if you want to enjoy some action but don't expect it to live up to the earlier one's. This is, most certainly, a kid's film---unlike the others which had something to say to adults as well."

","Hi just saw this and a my comments contains some spoilers.<br/><br/>I won't go into the details too much, everyone else has done that, I just have a few comments on why this is a good movie and why its not a great movie.<br/><br/>Most of the action sequences were incredible, after seeing so much CGI action sometimes I think I can't possibly be impressed or surprised anymore, but I was, especially the initial fight between Spider-man and Harry.<br/><br/>All the interaction between Harry and Pete was great, James Franco was fantastic and produced the best acting in the movie.<br/><br/>The scenes to show how Pete changed when he wears the black costume are terrible, really over the top, unnecessary and stupid. Watching it I was wondering was Raimi thinking ""let me put some utter crap in this movie and see whether its still kicks ass at the box office"".<br/><br/>It also clearly showed how little he cared for Venom as a character, this again came across terrible. If a much loved character like Venom was to be treated this way, it would have been better him not being in the movie at all. Would have been better for Pete to loose the symbiote and we see at the end the symbiote finding a new host, getting us excited for a potential number 4.<br/><br/>I think with a smart edit, you could make this movie from good to great, for me from a 6 out of ten to an 8. Lots of people talked about fan edits with the release of the Phanton Menance and can see it happening with this one. Take out the over the top silliness, loose the dancing and singing, tighten up a few scenes and have a great 2 hr movie instead of a 2 and half hour so-so movie.<br/><br/>So talented fan editors get to work and show Raimi how to make a great Spider-man 3."
"redbat1","8","3","7","2 May 2007"," Not the best of the trilogy, but very strong
","This movie came out May 2nd, 2007 in China, because of the May Labor Holiday. As I happen to be in China now, I was able to see it a few days early.<br/><br/>Now, I went into this movie with the highest expectations possible. And for most of the picture, I was not disappointed. Unfortunately, being a 21 year old male from the US, I grew up watching the Spider-Man cartoons on fox and reading the comic books of the last ten years or so. Sam Raimi did not. He waxes nostalgic on a whole different era of villains. And it shows.<br/><br/>Basically, I can't complain that they didn't stick to the source. What they did or didn't follow isn't nearly as important in this film as the wasted potential of the characters he chose to use in the film. He chose good characters, made them extremely interesting, and then gave them so little screen time that when the end of the movie came, I couldn't help but feel like despite the length of the film, some of the characters were rushed through the motions of their parts of the plot so quickly that they probably shouldn't have been involved at all.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi said in an interview that one of the producers (or someone up there at Marvel, my memory isn't completely clear) told him that the fans were demanding Venom, and despite his lack of interest in the character, he needed to do the story. Well, what was done was barely a compromise. While the dark side of Peter is apparent from every trailer, they could have done that some other way and not wasted an opportunity with such an interesting villain. But Sam had to have his Sandman, obviously.<br/><br/>Not to say that Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace aren't high points of the movie. They are. They just don't get to be part of it that much.<br/><br/>Now, to the rest of the movie: It is fabulous, it is great. The acting is great, the special effects are great, the plot is interesting. The special effects are worth the price of admission. Tobey is worth the price of admission. And i think this is Kirsten's best performance yet as Mary Jane.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it does drag a bit. I didn't mind, but I was in a theatre with 99.5% Chinese people, and conversations could be heard in the crowd at several points where it was just SLOW for an uneccessary amount of time. This is an extreme example, in another country where they don't appreciate melodrama as much, but that was the main problem. Where the first two movies had action, had comedy, had drama, this movie has melodrama. It's just doesn't tug at the heart strings like the previous movies, a lot of the time. The speeches get preachy, the moments of realization too obvious. It's very much like a lot of Raimi's other works I can think of. Which, is not a bad thing, mind you. But where the other two movies were so perfect because they were Spider-Man movies with a touch of the Raimi flavor, this was more a Sam Raimi movie staring Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Now, I can tell you, that's not a bad thing to be. It's just not perfect."

","First of all: I prefer the first two movies (that I loved) but also the third chapter of the Spider-Man franchise is a very wonderful movie...Its lacks ? Maybe there are too many characters, and someone like the Sandman or Gwen Stacy; maybe a scene is not so right for Peter's personality (but it's really funny) and the end could leave a little bit of disappointment but there are great fighting scenes, a wonderful acting, especially from Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, a marvelous love story and some almost crying scene that couldn't leave you emotion-less... Sam Raimi, once again, proves that is the right director for the Spidey-movie. He has the sensibility, the knowledge and the love for the character that a movie like this one needs to have. So, do yourself a favor: see this movie and get another, wonderful, ultimate spin!!! Andrea Beschi, Italy"

For starters, Spiderman had a dilemma about revenge; Sandman was a good ""man"" and did all he did for a good cause; Venow was jilted and humiliated; New Goblin was confused and confused.<br/><br/>The direction was good and Sam Raimi managed to weave the sub-plots well. But the sub-plots were a bit weak.<br/><br/>The new Spiderman look with a black suit was cool. It will go down with the audience very well. CGI were fantastic.

Spiderman 1 was the best."
"Doylenf","7","4","11","10 May 2007"," Spidey still spins a mean web...but the romance is wearing thin...
","First of all, let me say that the romantic angle is played up more so in SPIDER-MAN 3 than it was in the other Spider-Man films, which is a distinct handicap for what is primarily an action film based on the famous comic book characters.<br/><br/>It seems to drag noticeably in all of the quietly played scenes between TOBEY MAGUIRE and KIRSTEN DUNST, as his girlfriend May Jane whose singing career is stung by bad reviews. Then too, the scenes with ROSEMARY HARRIS, a warm and engaging actress, add to the almost soap opera flavor of the script in dealing with Spidey's human side.<br/><br/>But fortunately, there are enough humorous moments to atone for some of the script's shortcomings in this regard. BRUCE CAMPBELL as a French Maitre d' has a wonderful bit at the restaurant where Spidey is preparing to meet and propose to Mary Jane with a ring. And even bigger bits of humor are provided by J. K. SIMMONS as J. Jonah Jameson, the harried boss of the Daily Bugle, notably in his wonderful office scene where a diligent secretary has a novel way of reminding him to take his blood pressure pills. He's a welcome scene-stealing presence in any scene.<br/><br/>There's plenty of villainy going on in the guise of three chaps bent on destroying Spider-Man, the best of which is THOMAS HADEN CHURCH as the ex-convict who gets caught up in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman creature that terrorizes New York City. His transformation scenes are brilliantly done with the CGI effects outdoing themselves. He has that tough guy persona that looks just right for the role.<br/><br/>But the best written part for one of the three villains belongs to JAMES FRANCO who is able to convey much more of what makes Goblin II tick. He switches from affable to intense hatred with the greatest of ease and gets a lot out of the character he's playing.<br/><br/>Not as well scripted, but easily among the best performers in the film, is TOPHER GRACE, arrogant rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, who does a fine job as a Spider-Man adversary when he turns into Venom. Unfortunately, this comes pretty late in the film (almost as an afterthought by the writers) and he doesn't get enough time on screen to flesh out the character which would have been one of the most interesting villains if time permitted.<br/><br/>As it is, it all runs well over two hours and stays on a pretty smooth course throughout, for such a long film. Except for the lulls whenever Spidey deals with his romantic complications, it's a pretty fast-moving story that has some eye-filling special effects whenever things get too dull in the storytelling department.<br/><br/>TOBEY MAGUIRE certainly gets a chance to stretch. When his darker side takes over (and he's wearing that black suit), he shows a side of his screen personality that's been hidden in all the other Spider-Man films, and his arrogance with dance moves--while staying in character with his nerdy side--are played for laughs which are intentional.<br/><br/>BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD makes a suitable cliff-hanging sort of heroine who can scream as well as Fay Wray (the Queen of Scream), and THERESA RUSSELL stands out in her one brief scene as Mrs. Marko.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it as a blockbuster movie designed to entertain and thrill as only these Spider-Man movies can. <br/><br/>The CGI is remarkable for the Sandman sequences, all the production values are first class and Christopher Young's background score is a decided asset. <br/><br/>But, personally, I still think I preferred the other two Spider-Man films over this one."

The focus on Peter's relationship with Harry following the previous films was executed perfectly. The focus on his relationship with MJ is a bit repetitive and sometimes a bit inconsistent. As for the Villains I really loved the Sandman and his motives for what he's doing. The casting in this movie was brilliant, especially with J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I also think the soundtrack is excellent and the fight scenes were top notch. Overall it doesn't live up to the first two movies in the series but it does offer more than The Amazing Spider-Man."

","This movie's action scenes were very good. This crew was good with the special effects, but some of the storyline did not do so great. Sam Raimi himself said it was not a good idea to just toss Venom, a character he didn't understand, into the movie. Also, this movie has had it's share of memes. Memes being made about a movie should not be a good thing. What should have been done was have Venom kept out. I agree too much with Raimi on how a character that the head of the film doesn't understand should be out. Also, Venom was poorly introduced. I mean, seriously, how come a tiny rock comes out of nowhere and magically lands next to Spider-Man? Plus Venom shouldn't have been thrown in for the last 20 minutes of the movie. If anything save him for a movie where he is Spider-Man's only villain. Great action, terrible storyline."

","What a stinker. A huge disappointment following the fantastic Spider-Man 2. This sequel had a checkered production with a lot of studio interference so I'll cut Sam Raimi some slack. However, I'm not sure his original idea for the movie would have been much better. There's way too much camp and comedy in this. Also, as is so sadly common with superhero movie sequels, they felt the need to tack on more new characters and villains. Like more villains really helped the '90s Batman franchise. Just stupid backwards corporate focus group logic.<br/><br/>Anyway, there isn't a positively memorable scene, line, or performance in this film. The only parts people remember are terrible, such as wall-eyed Topher Grace's embarrassing Venom. Thomas Haden Church is actually decent as Sandman, although the way he is shoehorned into the events of the first movie is insulting and offensive to me as a Spider-Man fan. Kirsten Dunst, who I've defended many times from her critics, is awful here. For some reason now, Mary Jane's not just an actress but a singer. Whatever. James Franco looks like he's ready for the movie to be over the whole time. Tobey Maguire is having a field day with the campy scenes he gets and I couldn't hate him more for it. I'm really disgusted with this movie. The direction is half-hearted, the script a mess, and the effects spotty. Sandman effects are okay but the Venom stuff is dreadful. Watch this only if you want to complete the series but be prepared for the worst."

All those fantastic things are happening, a man turns into a giant sand monster, a black goo arrives from outer-space and clings to Peter Parker, creating a new black Spidey suit for him, and NOBODY EVER QUESTIONS ANYTHING!

"Wuchakk","9","2","4","23 June 2011"," The best of the three?
","I think so. 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the most entertaining of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks. The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting on repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure! <br/><br/>This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films. <br/><br/>Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom. <br/><br/>On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume. <br/><br/>Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun. <br/><br/>The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition: <br/><br/><ul><li>Harry Osborn struggles with his hostility and rivalry toward Peter.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Themes of humble remorse, friendship, faithfulness and sacrifice are touched on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The universal conflict of flesh/spirit, id/super-ego is powerfully explored as Peter grapples with his dark side.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What at first appears to be a lame reinterpretation of Uncle Ben's murder becomes an awesome illustration of the power of honesty, repentance and forgiveness.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>On the surface Peter Parker appears to be the least likely person to be a hero, let a alone superhero. He's kind, meek and physically almost frail. There's absolutely zero machismo posturing with him (until he gives in to the flesh egged on by the alien parasite). And yet he has no qualms about turning on the daring power when required, and then switching it back off once it's no longer necessary. Simply put, Peter Parker is the quintessential male role-model, a gentle and noble evil-fighting warrior. </li></ul><br/><br/>You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong, other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own). <br/><br/>On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit. <br/><br/>My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION: ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth. It ranks with the top superhero films of all time. <br/><br/>GRADE: A"

Okay, maybe its not such a feast but those few are enough to completely ruin it for me. I was also drawn, by the lack of plot probably, to the fact that Toby Maguire simply can't act. I hadn't really noticed in the first two Spidermen (which incidentally I did like), but it becomes painfully obvious when Peter Piper loses his fiancé and has a slightly comical wry expression when he should be simply devastated. Why did they bother with this one, if they can't come up with a decent plot just leave it alone. And how did Toby Maguire ever get this gig? Surely there are actors who can actually act pouring into Hollywood on any given day, finding one with that combination of slightly geeky with his hair parted but bit of alright in a tight suit can't be too hard.

","One of the worst films ever made. Even the Tele Tubbies are more complex, have more depths, better story lines and actors. And I hate the Tele Tubbies. Rarely do you get to see more clichés added together and I wondered if anyone read the script before they started shooting the film. Who ever wrote that film should be banned from making another one for life. I would only watch this movie if I got paid - A LOT! If you want to have fun I suggest cleaning the toilet, going for a walk or looking at the wall - you'll have a much better time then watching this film. After seeing so many people giving the movie a 10 I seriously asked myself if they had seen the same film I had. I guess they are the reason Hollywood keeps making these no-brain blockbusters."
"p_jones92","1","2","4","26 September 2007"," Bad Spidey makes for a very bad Spiderman film
","OMG - awful, horrendous, stupid, confusing, pointless, all of these words spring to mind when watching this movie, I mean what in the hell were these people thinking?<br/><br/>Spiderman is a worthy movie franchise, but I can't for the life of me work out how this script got green-lighted, what the reported $300 million production budget got spent on, who choreographed the dismal fight scenes, and worst of all who thought it would be a good idea to have musical numbers in the movie?!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>From the intro, it's pretty weak, I mean I understand you're covering your bases with keeping people up to speed on what has happened to Peter Parker/Spiderman for those who missed the first 2 movies, but did have to be done in such a cheesy way, and include a song from MJ (Kirsten Dunst's characters) Broadway show? And then bang boom, we are into a fight scene with the new Goblin, which is so confusing to watch. I understand you want to inject pace into a fight scene, but the way it's been directed everything is just a blur, you don't know what's going on.<br/><br/>Finally, Goblin is defeated, and low and behold, suffers memory loss, so he doesn't remember his grievance with Spidey. OK, a weak plot point, but it's made all the worse by the fact that the writers seems to think loss of memory also means regressing the characters mental age to 7 years old? I mean the dialog/acting for Hary (Jame's Franco's) character is just pointless and awful, it's really painful to watch.<br/><br/>The introduction to Sandman is even worse, I mean can we develop the character just a little so we understand his point of view/role in the movie? Instead, it's a 30 second monologue between him and his ex-wife to explain he's escaped from prison and has come to see his daughter and then bam, he's on the run from the cops and falls into a scientific experiment which turns him into Sandman. Errrr, hello? What was the experiment in the first place? How did it change him into Sandman? If he's completely made of sand, why one minute does he look like sand, and the next have normal skin color and clothes? Oh, and if I'd just been turned into sand, I think I'd be pretty upset about it, maybe shout a little, cry out, ya know, just show some emotion but oh no, not this guy, we get some cheesy moment with a necklace and a photo of his kid, and then he just quietly accepts he's turned to sand?!!!!!!! (for a while I thought that because he was now, ya know, made completely of sand, he had in fact lost his power to speak - but later we find out he can speak fine, which makes his reaction to turning to sand all the more stoopid). And yeah, I know it's a superhero movie, but that doesn't mean you don't need to explain anything.<br/><br/>And bad spidey? It all comes about because some alien virus just happens to land right next to Peter Parker and then hop on the back of his bike without him noticing? How did it get from the bike into his apartment? And where did it come from? And why does Peter Parkers professor, when shown this extraterrestrial life form, not phone NASA or the FBI or something, let them know he's found an alien life form? I mean, you sit through this movie constantly asking questions about why things are happening, where did that come from, why don't they do this, what just happened? A good movie doesn't make you constantly ask why characters are doing things, you go with it because you believe it, and even though this is a superhero movie, they've just pushed the boundaries too much. Or so you'd think?<br/><br/>Somehow, amazingly,<br/><br/>they manage to completely top all the crap that's gone before with a bad spidey jazz/dance routine???? WTF!!!!!!! At this point, you're done, the joke is over and it ain't funny, and the rest of the movie is just painful to sit through, but you persevere because you've been waiting nearly 2 hours at this point in the hope it would redeem itself, so you might as well see it through but it is a BIG relief when it is finally over.<br/><br/>The only good thing in this movie is Topher Grace, but unfortunately he has minimal screen time, and even less character development than Sandman, so his fleeting moments are too few and far between utter trash.<br/><br/>I can't understand what the writer and director were thinking, they've tried to cram too much into one movie having 3 villains (4 if you count bad spidey), which leaves none of them with ample time to really develop their characters or allow us to feel any sense of fear of them, the chemistry between Toby and Kirsten is not existent, meaning you don't believe they love each other or want to marry, in fact I spent my time saying ""Don't marry him, you'll be divorced in less time than Britney!"", and as for the direction and production value, where did all that $300 million go? As an example, Matrix was in 1999, that's 8 years ago, so how can the effects in this movie not be as good as those from 8 years ago, but cost twice as much, how does that work?<br/><br/>This is the Batman & Robin of the Spiderman franchise. I remember when this movie was first released Toby and Kirsten were doing interviews saying it wasn't fun to make and they didn't want to do anymore. Now I can see what they were talking about. But, because of the box office, they're mentioning doing Spiderman 4. Based on this movie, why they'd want to do that is beyond me."
"denis888","4","2","4","3 June 2007"," Sorry, but this is boring!
","I was never a big fan of Spidey, but however, I have seen all 3 parts and must say that the 1 part was the best by all means, but then the Part Two was great thanks to Willem Defoe and great plot... This part is so tedious, so boring that you must rub your eyes all the time. 2 hours are absolutely unnecessary here, if you cut the film one hour short, that'd help a lot. There are some weak parts in this sequel. Sand Man is the weakest and the thinnest person here, his character is thin and badly depicted, the love line is boring and the part of the flat owner's daughter is seemingly silly. I felt tired, even video FXs did not help, and the bed was slow, bad and boring. Please, do not make part 4!"
"dlmiley","6","2","4","29 May 2007"," Your story has grown tiresome
","As Dieter of Saturday Night Live would say, ""Your story has grown tiresome"". That is how I feel about the Spider-Man series. How many times do we have to see the damsel in distress (Kirsten Dunst)? And as for Ms. Dunst, she has the unique ability to annoy both on and off the screen. On screen, I have never found her that attractive and there is just some thing about her that rubs me the wrong way. When her character was in danger of plummeting to a painful death, I kept hoping that she would. No such luck. Many other folks feel the same way. As for off screen, when she was interviewed about the potential for a Spider-Man 4, she said, ""well, no one will come to see another one with out me and Tobey"". Guess again, Kirsten, 76% of those polled could care less if you reappeared! Now, as to the movie itself, about 20-30 minutes would have been better left on the cutting room floor. No one cares about Kirsten's performance in some stupid musical (in fact, I kept trying to find the ""fast forward"" button on my seat). And Tobey's performance as ""the bad"" Spider-Man was torturous and unfunny (Tom Welling makes a much better ""bad"" super hero when he is affected by red Kryptonite).<br/><br/>As for the plot, it meanders around a lot before getting to some impressive special effects. I particularly liked the Sandman, despite the obvious logical problems (such as why is the sand solid one minute and then porous the nextbut hey, it is based on a comic book!). The Green Goblin II was pretty cool too. The other villain is somewhat of a surprise so I won't spoil it by revealing the identity of the last villain. My only problem with the villains is the writer's insistence on making them have a tragic back story that makes some of their villainy forgivable (they already did the same with Green Goblin I and Doc Ock). How about making the villain just be evil for evil's sake? So, to sum up my review, the movie is probably worth seeing on the big screen for the special effects and not much else. 6/10"
"borlley","1","2","4","28 May 2007"," awful, crazy
","these is bay far the worst film maid all times. note that i'm a fan of spider-man, since i was a boy, but only of the comics books. i know that spider when with the black suit ... But the film put's peter parker as a fool, as an idiot, his reaction is unbelievable, crazy, and what happen with the incredible jokes he tells every time hes in a fight. For these reasons the character of peter aka spider-man is not, at any kind of why, well done. And the story is very confusing, some who do not knows the story of spider is going to get confused. the film is for no one, its really bad. have to say to the persons involved in the film you really ruin Spider character."

","i went to see this film at the pictures and afterwards me and a friend wanted to be refunded our money...i would have to say that all though the action scenes were sum what entertaining, it was the worse of the 3 films, i feel the writers ruined the trilogy with this film.There was way too much romance way to many emotions overall although you do not want a film to be cold and heartless this just overpowered the film ,the villains weren't villains ,there was too much Peter Parker and not enough Spiderman which i felt ruined the ambiance of the film,the first film was very good and i applaud the writers and actors on this but this trilogy ended badly with this film, i feel that if they make a fourth they will need to use more of the ideas from the first film to cover the badness of this one. i am sure there will probably be some one out there who might like it."
"TwistedVanity","1","2","4","26 May 2007"," Not enough spiderman
","For a spiderman film you don't get to see much spiderman. The end fight scene is a gorgeous 5 or 10 minutes. The rest is more or less all about Peter Parker and his problems with Mary Jane. After all that hype you hardly see any Venom at all. The Mary Jane Peter Parker dynamics did endear the first spiderman film, but it was interspersed with regular spiderman action. It complimented that film, a kind of cute back plot. In Spiderman 3 they have forgotten that the film is about spiderman. They concentrate on the peter parker and Mary Jane relationship, and how it devolves and then develops. The Spiderman action becomes a back plot, which they kind of remember to slot in every now and again.<br/><br/>I went to see a film about spiderman, I expected it to be an action movie. But I didn't see either. Instead I watched a movie about relationships, and the pitfalls of taking your partner for granted. of not listening and becoming self involved. But not an action movie and certainly not a spiderman movie. Except for the odd 5 minutes here and there.<br/><br/>A RANT:- When are Hollywood going to learn, if your doing a comic book movie, its fans of the comic book that will provide the biggest custom, but what we want to see is our comic book heroes. It doesn't matter who plays the lead, so we don't need nor want to see the actors face all the time. We want the hero mask and all. We want the action. We want the fast pace adrenalin rush. Also In spiderman 2 and 3 you see peters face too often whilst in spiderman costume. I mean who in the city hasn't seen spidermans face whilst he's in full costume? Is there anyone left who actually doesn't know his secret after 2 and 3? You don't need to keep showing us the actors face, we didn't come to see Tobey Maguire, we wanted to see spiderman."
"imran-sayed","7","2","4","26 May 2007"," Not so good, not so bad
","We know expectations are built from past experiences, so I do not blame myself for having high expectations with this third installment of the Spiderman trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie was quite long and had three villains. It had its good moments. I loved the chase sequence of Peter Parker & Harry Osborne, who is our new Green Goblin. I absolutely admired the special effects during the formation of Sandman. My heart went for Topher Grace and his justification to embrace the suit of Venom. Wish Venom could have come much earlier rather than when the movie was approaching its climax. The cameo from Bruce Campbell as the French Maitre and Simmons' act as the fiery editor were both hilarious and adorable. I laughed out loud during the camera purchase scene between Simmons & a kid. I also laughed when Peter Parker gets an ""attitude"" and goes dancing through the street. And, Bryce Dallas Howard looked stunningly beautiful; very different from her past roles in the pathetic ""The Village"" and horrible ""Lady in the Water"".<br/><br/>Now about the moments that pricked me. I felt the movie rushed with its story and at times applied sudden brakes. I could not help but compare the emotional tunes between this one and the last two movies. This one falls flat on its face and I felt the emotion was shoved up purposely in the movie. The characters did not develop and just when something surprising should have happened; it did not. The memory loss and regain of Harry Osborne was very B-Gradish. There was way too much Mary Jane in this one. Kirsten Dunst looked beautiful, but I was there to see my comic book in action. I get all my emotional feed from other movies. They could have cut some of these scenes and put in the minutes for Venom & Sandman or even JJ Jameson! Sudden disappearance & reappearance of characters seemed liked fillers. Example, the chief, Eddie Brock, Gwen Stacy...the list goes on. Actually, all the characters disappeared and reappeared in irregular intervals. That is where the movie lost it. It did not have the flow.<br/><br/>The special effects win hands down in this movie. The rest of it was not so good, not so bad.<br/><br/>6/10."
"booey62","1","2","4","23 May 2007"," What were they thinking?
","Sam Raimi is an excellent director, it's too bad they let him write the movie. It felt as though it was written by a child. He has trouble following his own plot! I really don't know how any self respecting person could walk out of that movie with a positive feeling about it. It takes about 2 hours, at least that's what it felt like, before anything interesting starts to happen. The scene with the crane, Spiderman saves the girl, but neglects everyone else in danger (he doesn't actually save the guy whose inside a crane spinning out of control hundreds of meters above ground). I'm actually angry that I saw this movie."
"JupiterStorm","1","2","4","20 May 2007"," A let down
","I clutched the arm of my theater chair anxiously, I'd been waiting three years and the wait was finally over. Once the end credits rolled up on screen I confessed myself...disappointed. Yes, the trailers for this movie made it look like a master piece, full of action and wonderful story lines. The movie had very little of this. Yes, there is a lot of action, but it's so spaced out and drowned out with conversations that you feel the movie has the least action of them all. Most action sequences were far too short. The fight sequences between Spidey and Sandman last a little over a minute. Just as your were getting into the fight it ended.<br/><br/>We pick up with were the characters were left in the last film. But it goes no further than that. There is hardly any character development and any possible character development is overshadowed by the messy story lines. The film fails to tie each sub-plot together and any scenes trying to link them together are sloppy and easily thought up. For example, near the end Harry's butler tells Harry his father killed himself and convinces Harry his friends love him. I couldn't believe Raimi had done this. He obviously thought ""Hmm...how can Harry change his mind? I can't think of anything...oh well! We'll just introduce a very minor character in the previous films and make him do something huge!"" Honestly...Wouldn't a better idea be Harry arguing with his father in the mirror then deciding his father really was an evil man, and Peter had to stop him. He did the right thing? Wouldn't Harry admitting he was wrong truly show the strength of his character? It would mean Harry truly had found redemption.<br/><br/>The biggest let down of this film was definitely the portrayal of Peter's so called 'dark side'. To define it more accurately, it wasn't a dark side, it was a cocky arrogant side. He was hardly aggressive. Instead of a dark, aggressive, violent Peter we have a John Travolta wanna-be dancing down the street and hitting on women. I failed to take his 'dark'* side seriously. I wanted a violent, hateful, corrupted, aggressive Peter. It would have been a much better more interesting story. A word to the not-so-wise Raimi, if you're going to give a character a dark side, DO IT RIGHT. The tag-line 'The Greatest Battles Lies Within' is a huge overstatement. I hardly think trying not to hit on women is dealing with inner turmoil. Peter should have been truly corrupted to the point where he feels he might become a killer, not a high school bully. They could have written a great new story for Peter, but failed horribly. They didn't flesh out this story well enough. Another thing to add to the disaster of the black suit, they really didn't make it obvious to the audience that it enhanced Peter's powers, I found that anything he did with the black suit he most likely could've done without it. There was way too much humor in the movie. Any drama was usually overshadowed by this. I failed to take the movie seriously because of the over use of humor. It was often thrown in at the most inappropriate times that really broke your focus from most action sequences.<br/><br/>After having the black suit for 20 minutes it goes to Eddie. Eddie is hardly a character. I remember Raimi saying he didn't like Eddie because of his lack of humanity but loved him when Alvin wrote a back story and really developed the character. Where was this meat to Eddie's character? He is presented in a poor one-dimensional way. Venom has about 5 minutes of screen time. This was a huge disappointment. He wasn't strong or fast enough, and he didn't give Peter a beating, a few punches here and there were all we saw. Gwen Stacy was a great character, but seeing her more would've been fantastic. Props to Bryce Dallas Howard for her awesome portrayal. The actors did a good job, but probably weren't aware the material they were given was so poor. Sandman was given a great storyline and a lot of meat to his character, no complaints here.<br/><br/>To sum up, I was so hyped for this movie and so let down by it. They writers had a chance to give a great passage of literature but failed in so many ways. It's a pity they can't re-do the black suit storyline after completely destroying it. The movie wasn't terrible, it was okay, but had so much potential. To do this franchise justice they would have to make a fourth and really work their asses off. A fourth would be years away, and after this let-down I can't help but ask myself; will the wait be worth it?"
"tsemk","7","2","4","14 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 doesn't quite make the cut...
","This review is completely based on my bias that super-hero movies ought to follow their comic book background...<br/><br/>There are too many story arcs to follow in this movie to do justice to any of them. The Green Goblin Saga should not have played such a major role in the film. From the look of the previews, and even the marketing this film ought to have centered around the development of Venom / black costume (the alien symbiote) as an arch-nemesis to Spidey.<br/><br/>Venom only shows up in the last fews moments of the movie, and for fans (of the comic book like myself), doesn't delve too much into the reason why the symbiote and Brock mutually create Spidey's most powerfully enemy.<br/><br/>In addition, although the special effects were pretty cool, the story was just too mushy. Can we all say Chick-Flick together! I much rather had explore more of the dark side of Peter Parker and why he eventually had to rid himself of the symbiote.<br/><br/>NOt all is lost however, if you are not a fan of the comic book, and only watched the previous titles SM1 and SM2 then this movie does satisfy your Spidey fix, but is not by all means the best in the 3.<br/><br/>In my opinion SM2 is the best of the bunch as far as storyline and special effects.<br/><br/>Let's see how SM4 turns out, given they hint to The Lizard, and potentially Carnage."
"layamaheshwari","6","2","4","14 May 2007"," The web-slinger is off aim, squirts brilliance only in patches...
","If you consider it as a standalone, it is a fantastic movie. But then, taking all the hype, expectations and the success of the prequels into account, one has to admit that Spidey 3 had a LOT to live up to...<br/><br/>The main thing about the Spidey trilogy is that apart from the great battles and fantastic visuals, they focus more on the characters than other superhero flicks. Apart from saving lives and fighting powerful villains, Spiderman is still Peter Parker, a struggling man who finds it hard to make ends meet. This is what sets the Spidey franchise apart from others, like Superman and Hulk.<br/><br/>Spiderman 2 was highly successfully, both critically and commercially. It set up a sequel very well, with Harry Osborne (James Franco) finally learning his father's past and his destiny.<br/><br/>The story begins with an insight into Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) life, who is now happy and balanced between his duties as Spiderman and commitment to Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He has finally hit the high note in life and seems well settled.<br/><br/>A fugitive Marko Flint (Thomas Haden Church), the real killer of Ben Parker, gets involved with a test in a nuclear result facility and this gets structurally altered, and becomes the Sandman. When, Peter and MJ are talking to each other aboard a web, a strange blackish goo emerges from nowhere and attachés itself to Peter's vehicle, thereby going to his home.<br/><br/>Thus, he decides to propose to MJ and goes to his aunt for advice, who gives him her ring. But en route, he is attacked by Harry / The New Goblin and a fight ensues, wholly set in the sky with Spidey prevailing in the end.<br/><br/>Then, a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), Spidey encounters Sandman and they fight. After that, Peter is informed by Captain Stacy that Marko is the actual killer of Uncle Ben, and a vengeful Peter waits for his chance. Now, the black symbiont bonds with Spidey while he is asleep, giving him amplified powers and a new black suit.<br/><br/>Affected by the suit, Peter humiliates Edward Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) and gets him fired. Mary-Jane breaks away from Peter due to his changed character, and finds solace and love in Harry, who forces her to alienate herself from Peter. Thus MJ breaks off from Peter and he goes to Harry's House, where, aided by the suit Peter defeats Harry and damages his face.<br/><br/>But afterward, Peter realizes the folly of his ways and goes to a church bell tower to rid himself of the suit, which falls on Eddie Brock, who was praying for Peter's death. Eddie becomes Venom and joins forces with Sandman to destroy Spiderman forever. What ensues is a climactic battle with the good guys winning and the bad ones losing, as always.....<br/><br/>Well, lets take stock. The visuals are spectacular, so is the action, as is to be expected from a movie made with 258 million $. The acting is good, with Church being the best, and Franco and Maguire putting in good performances. There is a delightful Bruce Campbell cameo as well.<br/><br/>Now, the aspects which let the movie down are the direction - Sam Raimi just does not manage to recreate the magic of the first two films. Then, the script and screenplay. The story is far too complex with three villains, and does not give much room for character development. Then, the screenplay is absurd and makes most of the non-action scenes really boring. Also, the essence of the Spidey movies, the characters and their problems, challenges etc. are not portrayed as well as in the prequels.<br/><br/>All in all, I will conclude by noting that, though it is a good film, it could and should have been a lot more. Leaves you wanting more, practically and more literally......"
"carefulwiththataxe","6","2","4","13 May 2007"," Spiderman 3: Objective review
","An opinion of Spiderman 3 is hard to communicate without including spoilers, but this is an honest attempt. I actually am unsure if any of what I have written is without spoilers, completely, so I have marked it as containing them just in case.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first Spiderman. The second, in my opinion, was a bit worse in some parts, and I generally didn't find the casting choice in the part of Doc Oc to be the best it could have been, but what casting is these days? With that in mind, I felt Spiderman 3 was an obvious progression of the plot that had already materialized, with some exceptions.<br/><br/>It is quite obvious that the director's intentions were never to put Venom in this film at all. His inclusion, while it was a great concession to the Venom fans and an excellent portrayal of his aesthetic qualities, was quite limited and, honestly, the arc of Brock and Venom (referring to the alien entity as well as the villain) was fulfilled in such a manner that I have a very large aversion to watching the following entry in the series.<br/><br/>In similar fashion, Harry Osborne's character arc (technically an extension and a continuation of his father's, the Green Goblin's overall story) was scripted in such a way that I, as a reader of the Spiderman comics in my youth, was greatly disappointed.<br/><br/>Yet, these two complaints are the most glaring errors made in the direction of the third entry. Indeed, they are almost irrevocable affronts to many fans, the mainstream film audience, and its notions of continuity in the motion picture plot of ""Spiderman"", has been thought of first and foremost. It is a good film, overall, and contains many of the same scenes and sub-plots that cause some to cringe and others to merely yawn and wait for the plot to resume, as is typical in any film expected to gross a large amount in theaters.<br/><br/>In my final observations, however, I find myself unable to resign myself to the finale of the film, in regards to the second villain, The Sandman. I will say nothing of the events itself, only that I felt that the final minutes of the movie were contrived and telling of both the director's and Maguire's stated interest in, and favoritism toward, the ""Sandman"" character (compared to the apparent dislike of Venom, Carnage, and other such brutal villains). This is, of course, my opinion, and I will ask all to keep that in mind. I can only hope that speculation is true in the case of The Lizard taking a central role in the following installment, which I feel may very well breed interest in the film within myself (and, I suspect, many others), due to the general incomplete nature and unsatisfying conclusion of this entry in the Spiderman film canon."
"Victory_Over_Trolls","7","2","4","13 May 2007"," Not bad, but a bit of a mess.
","First and foremost, there is an allegory in this picture. The Venom-suit (that I recall, it was never referred to as such, but who cares?) enhances Spidey (Tobey Maguire)'s powers and gives him an attitude problem. It becomes an addiction he needs to learn how to kick.<br/><br/>Okay then, let's start with the black costume. From a visual standpoint, I wish they'd patterned it after the comics, but it works well enough here. Anyway, the costume comes from a meteor which just seems to hit while Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are laxing on a web-hammock in the woods. Nowhere does the screenplay address where it comes from, nor does it play to the idea that if this meteor fell from the sky to Earth, that might have intrigued people. It's just kind-of off-putting (even to many people who DO read comics) that it shows up as if symbiotic alien blobs of goo arriving on Earth is a day-to-day occurrence.<br/><br/>Then there's the costume's vulnerability to sound. The idea that Parker discovers its weakness by accident while banging on a Church bell is one thing. The fact that he's banging on it in the first place is a little too contrived. Prior to this, there were scenes of Parker talking to Doctor Conners about the properties of this alien thing... they had the opportunity to actually SAY it is effected by sound, and they blew it. As for Venom himself? Well I don't know whether to blame the actor (Topher Grace), the script, or both; but Eddie Brock/Venom comes off as a dandy.<br/><br/>So what is it exactly this ""costume"" does? Well, it wraps itself around Spider-Man's costume and it enhances his powers. Unfortunately, it also makes him more aggressive. Upon learning that a villain called the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) was the real killer of his Uncle, the suit increases his aggression to the point where he decides to murder Sandman once he finds him responsible for another crime. He kills him--or so he thinks.<br/><br/>It doesn't just effect Spider-Man's ability to be tough on crime. It also makes him more aggressive toward Mary Jane. He actually talks the other love interest, Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) into going with him to a jazz club, where MJ is employed as a waitress/singer. He (somehow) gets on stage to play piano while she's singing, then cuts a rug. Then, he gets in a fight with the manager and security of the club, and hits them (and MJ) before realizing he needs to ditch the suit.<br/><br/>Sounds like a lot going on? That's not all! There's also the matter of Peter's former friend, Harry Osborne (James Franco), whose father was the Green Goblin. Early on in the film, he attacks Peter (both literally and figuratively) out of the blue. The altercation between the two of them leaves Harry unconscious, and he looses his short-term memory. Because of this, he doesn't remember that he blames Peter/Spidey for the death of his father, or even that they're the same person. Eventually, he DOES get his memory back (through a borderline-absurd sequence of events) and threatens Mary Jane into leaving Peter, saying there's ""someone else."" He then tells Peter that he is the other guy and eventually lures him into fighting him. This ends with Harry lobbing a pumpkin-bomb at Peter, which Peter throws back at him.<br/><br/>When we see him again (Pete just casually shows up and asks for his help... no, really) it makes no sense, because anyone watching this would have thought he was killed in the blast. Oh, sure, this is a superhero movie, and we need suspension of disbelief, but they could have at least SHOWED US BEFORE HAND THAT HE LIVED. They could have had his manservant save him from a pile of rubble, or had a ""my face! My face!"" scene. A little common sense! He tells Peter to leave. Then his butler convinces him that Goblin Sr. did die by his own hand. And so while Spidey is battling Sandman and Venom once they finally team up, he appears to aid him and Mary Jane.<br/><br/>Howard's character is somewhat overused. They try to use her character as an anchor for a lot of things... and in some cases, it's not necessary. There really wasn't a need for her to be Brock's girlfriend. It didn't add that much to his character or hers. Did they really need her to be the damsel he saved and who kissed him?<br/><br/>And as usual, the humor becomes a tad stale after a while. There are some--as was true in the others--which fall into the dreaded ""camp"" category, such as the Jazz-club scene, or the scene where he walks down the street with his collar up (parodying Saturday NIGHT FEVER). A lot of this comes off as self-indulgent.<br/><br/>Okay, so with all the negativity I've lobbed, it may seem odd that I'm not giving it a low rating. Well, for starters, I can't review it without referencing SUPERMAN RETURNS: a far worse movie that gave us a flaky deadbeat dad and said, ""this is supposed to be SUPERMAN!!!"" But also, there is plenty of good in it.<br/><br/>For its untanglable web of a story, there are many worthwhile scenes. Having said that their brand of comic-relief does get old after a while, the Daily Bugle supporting cast (J.K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks, et. al.) are as good as ever, as is Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. And Spidey-newcomers Howard (daughter of the legendary Ron Howard) and Church bring their characters to life in a way that will please fans of Spider-Man (I mean, the three or four who haven't seen the film). They resemble their characters visually. Plus, Church is sympathetic, but tough; and Howard comes off as smart AND alluring. And while the special effects are still not perfect, the action sequences are mile-a-minute when they're there and certainly worth seeing."

","I saw Spider-Man 3 just a couple hours ago. And I was disappointed, most definitely. While I love the character the two proceeding movies, this one suffered from the great third syndrome.<br/><br/>Two things: Firstly, this movie splayed out at one end a romantic melodrama, on the other end, a serious metaphorical discussion of free will and good and evil, and yet on another a raucous slapstick comedy. And a runtime of 140 minutes, or 2 hours and 20 minutes is far too long for this movie. The scenes with the aunt, in my thinking, could have been all cut. She provided absolutely nothing to the movie, except cliché after idiotic cliché. It was half tedium to see her on the screen and half unintentional humor. When I was ten years old I bought the first six Venom Comics ""guest-starring Spider-Man"" and I thoroughly enjoyed that little series (Feb 1992  Jul 1992).<br/><br/>The second thing: the special effects will most likely get an Oscar nomination (even though it is very far from that time). The Sandman special effects were awesome, some of the best shots in the movie. However, to me, I thought most of these special effects while most likely supremely expensive and meticulously crafted were too video-game like. Almost everything looked slightly animated, just ever-so-slightly but enough that any average viewer would notice this. My favorite comic book superhero of all time is Superman, and always has been. If anyone has the DVD to the first two movies in 1978 & 1980 with Christopher Reeve (shot as one continuous movie), you can see what great special effects are like. This was before digital photography, and all of these special effects in the first two Superman movies were done optically with so much planning, designing and practicing. It proposed they could make you believe a man could fly and they did do that. The effects in Superman & Superman II have not dulled with time. Effects of this magnitude cannot really be seen these days, and it is probably mostly a budgetary and time issue. Superman paved the way for creating an Oscar category for special visual effects, because in its time it didn't exist. The Superman special effects artists were awarded with a special achievement Oscar instead. Now this is a serious category every year at the Academy Award ceremony.<br/><br/>Now I didn't hate Spider-Man 3, but it was nowhere near as great as Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. It suffered kind of like Superman III suffered. In Superman III there was a mix of comedy and ""serious issues"", which reviewers didn't like. And Superman turned evil for a little while as well. Batman Begins was not afraid to take a beloved superhero and explore his dark side with a fictionalized version Bob Kane's origin story of the Bat-Man. That is one of best superhero movies made in a long while."
"SithApprentice","6","2","4","13 May 2007"," The ""Batman Forever"" of the Spider-Man series...or, in other words: the most disastrous disappointment in quite a while
","Don't believe the hype - seldom has this saying been so true when looking at Spider-Man 3. Even I as a non-comic-book-fan enjoyed Spider-Man 1 & 2 and was looking forward to this one, but looks like Sam Raimi fooled us all...<br/><br/>For no apparent reason, director Sam Raimi overstuffed this installment of Spider-Man to an extent that one could think he cut two different films together, even though things start well enough with Peter Parker's life appearing to be just perfect as the beloved hero of NYC and with his love to MJ prospering.<br/><br/>However, once a comet carrying the much talked about symbiote conveniently lands on earth directly next to MJ and Peter in the park without the two even noticing, this movie turns into an unforgivable mess packed with half-hearted sub-stories and useless new characters. For example, shortly after the symbiote managed to make its way to Peter's apartment, we suddenly find out that the police finally found the supposed true murderer of Pete's uncle Ben in a tragic criminal named Flint Marko, who is committing crimes for the sake of his sick daughter. This Flint Marko, however, while being chased by police officers, ""conveniently"" stumbles over a testing ground for a particle accelerator, which transforms him into the Sandman, a terrifying and seemingly invincible new villain for Spidey to fight. And then there is Harry Osborn, Peter's former best friend who found out about Peter's alter ego and now blames him for the death of his father (as seen in part 1), seeking revenge by going the way of his father and hunting Spidey as the New Goblin. Oh, and then there is a new rival for Peter at the Daily Bugle named Eddie Brock, using dirty tricks in order to outclass Peter, with his girlfriend Gwen Stacey flirting with both Peter Parker and Spider-Man and making Mary Jane and Eddie jealous in the process...and last but not least, the symbiote itself seems to be a far greater threat to Pete than he could have possibly imagined, personified by...I think you can guess who is going to be affected by the symbiote apart from Spidey and will represent his completely dark side...<br/><br/>See what I mean? All these plot lines have been cramped into roughly two hours of screen time, and I did not even mention the useless bits showing Peter Parker as a mean a-hole due to the symbiote's influence that seem more ridiculous than anything else. But especially the last act of the movie, or roughly the last 30 minutes, seem so tacked-on and incoherent that one might assume that this part of the film was not even planned to be there to begin with, and it only drags the entire story down. Due to this overflow of plot lines, it is clear that the movie cannot do justice to each of them, hence the story as a whole seems half hearted and literally crumbles under the weight of so many characters and sub-stories as well as nonsensical and gaping plot-holes (like the sudden appearance of the symbiote or the creation of Sandman), with the last twenty minutes being reason enough for comic book fans to curse Sam Raimi, since not even the actors manage to save the story. Tobey Maguire remains shockingly stale and wooden as Peter Parker, and specifically his performance during the love scenes come off as unintentionally funny. I still can't understand what happened to Tobey, since he really did a great job in the first two, and I thought he would have grown even more into the role. Kirsten Dunst as MJ seems to be complete out of place in this movie, and even James Franco as Harry Osborn has a few embarrassing moments. Thomas Haden Church on the other hand plays the part of the tragic villain Flint Marko rather nicely, while Topher Grace as Eddie Brock rivals the wooden performance by Maguire. I guess part of the problem are the horrible dialogue lines (even for a comic book movie), and even the way George Lucas is writing his love scenes (I am a Lucas supporter, though) is infinitely superior to the tedious and painful exchanges between Dunst and Maguire. At least J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson as well as Bruce Campbell in a hilarious cameo as a French waiter manage to save the cast from being a complete disappointment.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of the movie, though, are its breathtaking action sequences - apart from the final confrontation, that is, which lacks any excitement whatsoever and comes off as a pale rehash of the first two. Not even the visual effects are perfect, in fact, they are even less believable than in the previous two, with some scenes making it painfully obvious that a lot has been done via CGI in some inappropriate places...John Dykstra's absence from Spider-Man 3 is rather apparent in that regard, unfortunately, even though the effects in general are still quite nice to look at (especially Sandman is a well done CG character, while not on par with General Grievous or Gollum), just not on the same level as Lord of the Rings or the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>In the end, Spider-Man 3 is a towering disappointment, a movie that does not live up to the enormous hype in the least bit and lacks all the strengths of its predecessors, and I am still at a loss of words - how could this have possibly gone so terribly wrong? What on earth was Sam Raimi, normally a great director, thinking? What happened to the usually solid cast? And why does the plot have to be too ambitious for its own good? It really is sad to see the Spider-Man going the way of the Batman franchise in the 90s - in fact, this IS the Batman Forever of the Spider-Man series. I for my part doubt that a fourth part could bring the series back on track."

","I truthfully feel like a neutral party in the debate of Spiderman 3. On one side, you have those saying how horrible it was; on the other are the optimistic, sunny, ""it was amazing"" fans. And truthfully, each team has valid arguments. However, this is one of those movies that you just can't label as plain good or plain bad, but have to look at in individual parts and then make judgments on each. <br/><br/>First off, I love the villains in this movie. True, having all three was a bit too much, but it actually came close to really working! The Sandman was really well played, and audiences get to truly understand his character to the point that they see all his layers. I felt like that was such a good story to incorporate and really emotional. As for Venom, his time probably was a bit short, but I did like how they portrayed the rivalry between Brock and Peter. The emotions Eddie Brock was feeling really came through, and though you hated him, there was understanding behind that hate. I loved how the church scene and how Eddie turned into Venom, as well as the mimic of this scene in the end when he was destroyed. And finally, who cannot love Harry as the New Goblin. There is so much history and charged energy there that any story line could carry. However, my only regret is that his enlightening felt a bit rushed; audiences were unable to rejoice in his return from evil and the rekindling of his friendship with Peter as the rest of his time in the film (and life for that matter) was mostly emotionless fight scenes. Give us a better reunion between these two best friends who were days ago trying to kill each other. <br/><br/>One thing that bugged me though was Peter's story. It kinda felt incomplete at times, as though he was being smacked in the face with a lesson but never realized it. The movie starts off with him as a pompous and self-absorbed jerk, continues to him becoming a emo idiot and then ends with him seemingly normal. There are no signs of maturing or a new found understanding within Peter Parker, and it definitely was noticeable. And just on a side note, the whole dancing, angry Peter was the most annoying thing I have ever seen. Only good thing to come out of it was from MJ's part. <br/><br/>I still don't know what to think of this movie. It is definitely the worst of the three, but they are certainly good aspects strewn throughout. As a whole, it was too much and too long, but it pulled this off better than most movies could. Somehow, things seemed to work, though you could tell that the boundaries were pushed to the extreme. SM4 is needed though, as the story as ended in this movie is no where near done."
"aura772","9","2","4","13 May 2007"," Different, but still the same Spiderman
","I saw Spider-Man 3 today, it's still fresh in my memory, so I think I might comment on it properly. It was definitely unexpected, with many mysterious items, you just have to pay attention to realize... I think it's totally different then the second and nothing like the first one, but it's the way the movie was supposed to be. Spider-Man was more experienced and Peter was more mature and he had to take the biggest battle of his life, the one with himself.<br/><br/>This movie is also much more dramatic then the first, I think it might get an Oscar nomination, we'll see this after a year. I think the character Harry was more important in this film then in the first two and also this time where more villains and more heroes. Mary Jane finally understands why Peter didn't wanted to be with her from the beginning and realized he was trying to protect her from everything and first of all, from himself.<br/><br/>The ending is the saddest, James Franco's performance in this movie was good, you can see how much he's grown as an actor and it's a pleasure to watch him. Toby Maguire on the other hand, his performance was't bad at all, but not extraordinary, maybe because his lines weren't too good, but this time, Harry Osbourne and Marko, Uncle Ben's killer did great job on keeping this movie on top.<br/><br/>My advice: watch it as soon as you can, specially if you're a Spiderman fan. Personally I am and wasn't disappointed."

","now, if i hadn't been even vaguely familiar with Marvel canon, hell, i'd say this was a good enough movie. As far as a Spiderman film goes though, it's also the worst. Not saying its bad, just that the first two were much better. There's and imbalance between focus on Peter and on Spiderman. Sometimes you wonder if its Peter Parker 3, as opposed to Spider-Man 3. But, aside from the drama being haphazardly done, the action sequences are the best yet. The real problem lies with trying to introduce two villains into one film, when one is such a prolific character in the Marvel universe, that he really needs an entire movie. Said villain is Venom. We get a 20 minute period with him, and that's it. At least they made him look good. My main beef with the film was that they were promising us Venom, and we got 20 minutes. And they killed him way to easily. Anyone with half a brain knows that Venom was pretty much Spider-Man's equal if not superior at times. Maybe i'm just too much of a comic geek to not be critical, but, if you're gonna introduce two villains in one movie, make sure the most popular, powerful, eviler one gets more than 20 minutes."

","The problem with Spiderman is that he is a solitary super hero in perfect agreement with the animal he is embodying. But that limits his adventures a lot to dangling and swinging at the end of a spider thread. So he needs to be presented with some companions who are going to be his preys, if possible, if necessary. To make things even better an extra-terrestrial organism falls onto the earth with some meteor and this organism is going to invade that poor Spiderman and make him turn black, aggressive, vindictive, vain. He will then cause a lot of suffering by doing bad things for the pleasure of dominating people and things. He will also relive the death of his uncle in the most vengeful way and try to capture the supposed and convicted though not quite proved killer who has just escaped from his narrow prison cell. Then he will get into some riffraff with his supposed best friend who in his turn becomes vengeful about his father who was supposedly killed by Spiderman, though it was never proved. Add to that a little bit of technological magic to turn the escapee into a sandstorm and you have three fourth of the drama. The last fourth is a photographer who wants to become a star in the press and who cheats in order to do it with a fake Spiderman picture. He will be exposed. But that drama will not turn tragic because of some circumstances that will make the best friend realize he was dumb, that will make Spiderman free of his ET invader, that will even liberate the second host of the ET black invader. Bells will be the solutions, church bells of course, and a lot of luck too, and final forgiveness. Then the city will go back to its absolutely boring peacefulness. Yet the film is funny and packed with action, even if that action is slightly grandiloquent.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

Also the story became ridiculous, real fast... and whenever the writers paint themselves into a corner they use clique technique to get themselves out.

When i spend 11 dollars on a movie and they spend 265 million to create a film; i am expecting a great movie, period. I don't care if the source material is a comic, novel or sheet music. If it's in the theater, i expected it to either be a Oscar worthy movie or an entertaining summer blockbuster; which i am sorry to say this movie is neither. I still can't believe this movie was made by the same people who made spider-man 2.<br/><br/>Now some people are going to like this movie, no matter what... and then their are people like myself who dislike this movie because we believe each movie in a franchise should either live up to the last one are elevate the series to new levels. with that in mind, if you don't care to see improvement in the series then you will probably enjoy this movie. however, if you wanted to see improvement, then i suggest you rent the DVD or better yet, wait till you catch it on your local television station.

"TimBoHannon","5","2","4","12 May 2007"," Another sad example of a trilogy gone bad
","It came to pass that in the age of comic books and film, no trilogy could be completed with the same directing team. Tim Burton gave way to Joel Schumacher, Richard Donner was replaced by Richard Lester who was replaced by Sidney J. Furie, and Brian Singer became a name of the past as Brett Ratner stepped into his chair. Then Sam Raimi swooped in to save the day with his Spider-Man movies. This unprecedented continuity should have made it the first superhero series to have a successful third film. It should have, but it did not.<br/><br/>Sure, it is and will continue to be a smashing success at the box office, but from an artistic standpoint, it fails. The principals that made the first two films so delightful are not present anymore. The Spider-Man films have gone from an uplifting and unique experience to an exercise in gorging sensationalism and sliding standards.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found the ideal balance between college, work and his responsibilities as the masked hero of the city. His grades are immaculate and he is ready to propose to his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Mary Jane has recently opened her career as a Broadway singer. He is about to receive the key to the city after rescuing Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the daughter of a police captain (James Cromwell). Life could not be better.<br/><br/>That must change, of course, and this time the problem is threefold. First, Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to follow his father's footsteps and become the New Goblin. The second comes from an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who is zapped by antimatter whilst fleeing from police, turning him into the Sandman. The third is a sticky mass of black spindles from outer space (CGI) that adheres to one of his Spider suits.<br/><br/>The black ""creature"" is an alien symbiote that amplifies anger and aggression in its host. Parker soon changes into a cruel, self-centered jerk. He wounds Mary Jane's soul deeply and repeatedly until he is at imminent risk of alienating her permanently.<br/><br/>The most conspicuous problem with this film is the inclusion of too many antagonists. As difficult as it is to compress two villains into a movie, not to mention the Man vs. Self conflict that occupies much of the film, it grows more convoluted when Venom (Topher Grace) finally shows his face.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus were complex, carefully-constructed characters and had a large share of the movie to themselves. It was not until midway through the films that they first fought with Spider-Man, and much time and effort had been invested into the characters by then. The three villains here are in constant conflict for more screen time and none of them are given a fair portrayal. Venom in particular is badly cheated. He is probably the most well known Spider-Man adversary after Doctor Octopus, but he is only minimally seen in the waning moments. Even then, the camera never focuses on his face long enough to let the audience drink in the impressive visual it is.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time with its first violent encounter, an aerial chase between Spider-Man and the New Goblin. It contains by far the movie's best action, but is hampered by problem number two; nobody dies once. We are teased and fooled too many times for the fabric of the film not to tear. Various characters are stabbed, drowned and blown up without fatal consequence. One character even hits his head with near decapitating force and falls to the unforgiving pavement yet survives. Perhaps they all received a gift from Wolverine.<br/><br/>Sandman is another mammoth blunder. He is completely invulnerable to damage and grows so big Godzilla would be proud. He is literally twenty stories tall at one point and missiles only cause giant sand splashes. Raimi also rips off The Mummy by granting him the ability to disintegrate into a sandstorm. The special effects are so spectacular the Academy can probably hand the movie the Oscar now, but Sandman was never meant to be Imhotep, and the problem is literally too huge to ignore.<br/><br/>The black Spider-Man segments go too far. We ended Spider-Man 2 elated that Mary Jane and Peter had finally discovered the true romance that had been growing for so long. Instead of a continuation of that element, the fledgling romance is systematically destroyed. The drama is undeniably good, but watching Mary Jane being shoved through the ringer over and over is extremely difficult to watch. The bridge scene is especially tough and had many in the opening night audience in tears, but this element is ill-timed and should have been put off for the fourth film.<br/><br/>Even the action is not right. Most of the time, the camera is zoomed in so closely and travels so quickly that we can hardly take in what is happening and the problem is exacerbated by a plethora of quick cuts. It is confusing.<br/><br/>Every such scene illustrates that Sam Raimi has changed his directing style. The Bond movies, for example, stand in contrast. Terence Young, Guy Hamilton, John Glen and Martin Campbell directed all of their films the same way. Only Lewis Gilbert changed, and the result was Moonraker and his ignominious end in the franchise.<br/><br/>Stalwart regulars as J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Harris) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) are underused, which further distances the movie from its two predecessors. The second film ended with a hanging storyline involving Jameson that held great promise, but it is abandoned. There are strong themes of redemption and forgiveness, which along with the fine acting, particularly from Dunst and Church, help elevate the film, but its mistakes are too critical and numerous for it to rate any higher than a five out of ten."

The problem is that it could and should have been so incredibly much better. <br/><br/>The biggest problem is that they piled three major villains upon each other. They should have stuck to only Sandman, Venom, or Goblin. NOT ALL THREE OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME!!! It simply became too much, and it totally killed the suspense and plot. Instead of a well thought through plot with a real character development like in the two first movies, everything seemed rushed and half finished. In my opinion they should have staid with Venom as the villain. He was the best of the three anyway.<br/><br/>And what in the world were they thinking when they made the Goblin one of the good guys? If memory doesn't serve me wrong, Harry became just as psychotic and evil as his father, once he became the Green Goblin. And I don't remember him die either, although I may be wrong there. <br/><br/>Well over to the stronger sides of the movie. The fight scenes were as always fantastic. Sandman was just the way i imagined, and so was Venom. And Mary Jane's failure as an actress, were like taken right out of the comic book, with her being too ashamed to tell Peter, and being jealous of the attention he is getting as Spiderman. Although both Mary Jane and Peter were characterized a bit too much goofy teenage like(i don't think Harry became Goblin until after MJ and Peter were married), Tobey and Kirsten did an overall good job catching the essence of MJ and Peter. But I will say that Tobey has a thing or two to learn from Kirsten when it comes to acting. I feel he did a better job in the first movies. His heart just didn't seem to be in it this time. <br/><br/>the filming and the soundtrack as always managed to bring me into the Marvel Universe, and the atmosphere of the movie were god.

The special effects are worse than the first film at times, the romance between Maguire and Dunst takes several steps back and is arguably again somewhere within the first story, there are THREE, yes THREE villains in this movie...<br/><br/>So, what happened? It almost seems like everyone involved either became complacent or bored. They know the movie will break the bank, as can be seen by its opening weekend, so are they just not putting forth the same effort? Spider-Man 2 was more than a comic book movie - it was a genuine film with ethos and pathos. Spider-Man 3 is computer schlock fest...two of the three villains are completely CGI 95% of the time. Where is the humanity? Where is the care factor? <br/><br/>The only things this movie has going for it are its humor and one emotional scene on a bridge. While funnier than the first two films combined, is humor a substitute for the brilliance of SM2? And the bridge scene between Maguire and Dunst almost redeemed their entire relationship in my eyes, but the intensity doesn't last and is almost forgotten toward the end of the movie. Honestly, I'd recommend waiting for the DVD, if you haven't already seen it in the theatre."

","Here's what was wrong with that movie: EVERYTHING. Number 1, Eddie Brock was a power lifting meat head in both the comics and the cartoon, he's played by a skinny, nerdy guy like Topher Grace.. Wow... Second, in no way, shape or form should Spiderman EVER team up with the Hobgoblin. That was the lamest crap I've ever seen. I almost got up and walked out of the movie right then and there, which just so happened to be the climax. Next movie he and Carnage should have a tea party, screw, then cuddle for two and a half hours... who knows, with all the Brokeback Mountain hype they may actually produce a better movie than this steaming pile."
"shinnsky","2","2","4","9 May 2007"," Very disappointing.
","First off I like to point out that I loved spiderman and spiderman 2. They two terrific films. This on the other is just not. It's very sub par. Although it was bad their were some alright moments. Here's a good break down.<br/><br/>Good Moments- All of the action sequences are very well done. Topher Grace does a terrific job as Eddie Brock. All the other actors are fine expect for Tobey. Here comes the bad.<br/><br/>Bad- The script, it goes everywhere with out going anywhere. By this I mean it touches a lot of subjects, such as introducing Venom, Sandman, Eddie Brock,and Gwen Stacy. It tries but, it fails to hit all the plot points well. Spiderman dancing was also pretty bad. It didn't feel like Spiderman, it felt like the filmmakers were making a joke of Spiderman with terrible dialog and cheesy scenes. Sandman wasn't that cool either. I don't want to ruinin it , but they try to show that he is good guy. It doesn't work. Tobey Maguire is bad in this movie. Not as the normal Read Suit Spiderman, but as the black suited Spiderman. He tries to act cool and still acts dorky. Score wasn't as good. <br/><br/>Overall: If you liked the other two than you will despise this. Okay you might like it, but it is by far the weakest in the series. <br/><br/>Please don't go see it. Rebel this awful film. I hate to say it, but is the most disappointing pre- summer movie and probably of 2007. <br/><br/>Overall 1/5"

Yes there were some parts that sucked but come on every movie has flaws, and Venom and the SandMan looked awesome just like in the comic books. I hope that you will not listen to the critics or the other comments just because they say it was bad. So bottom line if your a Spider Man fan and you wanna see a movie with great effects, great acting, or just a plain great movie then go see it.<br/><br/>My first review hope it was useful"
"bigmonster82","3","2","4","9 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3
","Spider-Man 3 was supposed to cap off the greatest comic book movie franchise in history. It was supposed to raise the bar for movies of this genre. It was supposed to give us characters that we could cheer for, villains we could root against, and relationships that culminate in trademark upside-down kisses. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 gives us none of these things. Peter Parker/Spider-Man, arguably the greatest and most intriguing superhero of the comic book world, is given the hack treatment by Sam Raimi and his collaborators. Instead of a fully realized portrait of a Superhero who deals not only with supervillains, but with relationship issues, family crises, and the unique moral nature of his position, we are given a contrived story in the same vein as the new installments of the Star Wars franchise. Bottom line: there's nothing there. In the first two Spider-Man films, Raimi created a world where the characters were likable, if not always well-portrayed, and at least attempted to create a story with some semblance of originality. With this latest film, he has substituted that originality with some of the most painful and awkward contrivances I've ever seen on film. Expository butlers, convenient cases of amnesia, and a ludicrous villainous alliance only scratch the surface of a badly flawed, poorly written, woefully underdeveloped film. The only character I ended up rooting for was Gwen Stacy. At least she brought a sense of excitement to the scenes she was in, something that can't be said for Mary Jane. And while many have said the film was saved by its ""amazing"" special effects, I can't help but disagree. While many of them were spectacular, in particular the origin sequence of Sandman, overall they seemed lackluster. There is a lot to be said about this film, mostly negative, but I'm running out of space. Sam Raimi, meet George Lucas, the other notorious destroyer of classic franchises. It's time you two got acquainted."
"csteiner-1","5","2","4","9 May 2007"," Could have been so much better
","OK, I waited a few days after seeing this movie to make my comments.<br/><br/>I thought it was going to be the best Spiderman movie based on the trailers. Especially, with the 8.1 rating here on IMDb (I see it has dropped significantly since). I was wrong. It reminded me a little bit (no quite as bad) as the piece of crap movie called Batman and Robin (or Xmen 3). There were just too many villains and the plot and story suffered. <br/><br/>Here are some of the things that bugged me.<br/><br/>1. The Sandman was able to fly <br/><br/>2. Venom did not work for me He was only in the movie for few minutes, then he dies, leaving no possible way for his return.<br/><br/>a. I found it retarded that the suit and Brock were completely incinerated when the bomb went off.<br/><br/>b. They kept showing Topher Grace's face popping out of the Venom's suit. <br/><br/>3. Harry suddenly has a scar on his face (I assume that the explosion happened a long time prior to the scene where we see him again). Maybe they could have did a little bit more with Venom's character during those weeks or months. <br/><br/>4. Story just didn't flow right. <br/><br/>5. I could can less about MJ's character, and I actually hoped that Spidey would go for Gwen Stacy (after all, he did in the comics).<br/><br/>6. Stupid ending...I actually waited till all the credits were over expecting something to help out. Of course, I was disappointed. <br/><br/>7. Action sequences were very hard to swallow, even with super powers. Especially the scenes where Harry is chasing Peter around on his Air board.<br/><br/>I think they should have just introduced Venom, and saved him for an entirely separate movie. Whoever decided that he needs to die with so little screen time, must have consulted with George Lucas (i.e. Darth Maul)<br/><br/>This movie seemed to be made to entertain smaller children. I found it somewhat entertaining at times, and that is the reason I give it a 5. Overall, I was rather disappointed, and I felt it is by far the weakest of the three Spiderman movies."
"cblakeJoey","4","2","4","9 May 2007"," Please no MORE
","This wasn't a horrible movie, but making another would be like beating dead horse. Riding on the success of the first 2 Spiderman movies, I think it's damn near impossible to do much better. Though I love Sam Raimi and typically back him on just about every project he does (pending good reason of course), he would be making a fool of himself trying to make anymore Spiderman films.<br/><br/>Episode 3 finds us with Spidy facing more personal issues and even more bad guys. I was thrilled with the fact that Raimi choose to have more than one bad guy for the film, in fact it's about time. I hated that he cast Topher Grace as Venom when there was a much more physically qualified actor playing Flash in the first one. That decision I will never understand. I was expecting worse from the story lines but they were actually okay. Bottom line, I pray that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst put their feet down about not making another Spiderman, they deserve better. But knowing the production companies, they will probably dangle a couple of juicy carrots in front of both of them to get them back. We shall see."
"frankscarangella","4","2","4","9 May 2007"," This Spidey Sequel Flat Out Stinks!!!
","As any observer of the insipid Batman sequels will tell you, too many characters make for messy sequels. In Spider-man 3, we are presented with a series of redundant villains that push Peter's soul to the brink of darkness. Compelling visuals and engaging fight sequences abound, but the detailed characterization that pervaded in the first two films is sadly absent. In its place we are presented with all the hallmarks of poor writing, which include an inordinate number of coincidences (funny how that alien symbiote manages to land just a few feet from Peter's scooter), sage advice coming from seemingly minor characters (the worst of which is uttered by Harry's butler near the film's conclusion), and an extremely convenient case of amnesia that turns on and off at the whims of the narrative. <br/><br/>Disappointingly, Peter's conversion to dark side is largely played for laughs. Donning a spiffy new black Spider-man costume, an ego-centric version of Peter Parker strolls about the city flashing retarded dance moves to the astonishment of countless New York City babes. The silliness reaches crisis point when Peter invades a jazz club where he makes Mary Jane jealous by thrusting his pelvis at her repeatedly.<br/><br/>Other bones of contention include: <br/><br/>1. Mary Jane and Harry doing ""the Twist."" <br/><br/>2. Peter's ""evil"" hairstyle. <br/><br/>3. Sandman willingly enters an alliance with Venom and proceeds to wreck havoc upon the city. Then, without reason, he changes his mind and delivers an out-of-left-field soliloquy that is meant to conjure our sympathy and simultaneously tie up all of the films loose ends. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a movie made for children, which is a shame given that the first two films were universally appealing."
"81Scorp","5","2","4","9 May 2007"," A step down, but not that bad
","In the third installment of the Spider-Man franchise our favorite web swinger has to tackle his old friend Harry Osborn turned super villain, Flint Marko, a thug turned into a sandy super villain and Eddie Brock, a photographer with low morale who later turns into something worse. And let's not forget fighting inner demons caused by a living costume/goo from outer space.<br/><br/>Sure, it could be better, but it could also be worse. The problem as I see it, is too many story lines. Besides the ones already mentioned there's the MJ story and the Gwen Stacy story. While some of the subplots were given time to grow, others weren't. It felt like they were thrown into a space too small for them to grow in the pace they needed. Guess Raimi got a little too eager in the big candy shop that is the Spider-Man-universe, and I can't blame him. <br/><br/>On the plus side: the action scenes are very good and Thomas Hayden Church's portrayal of an ordinary man with bad luck, turned thug, turned super villain is good, memorable and makes you feels sympathy for the poor guy. Agreed, it's not as good as Spider-Man 2, but not bad either. It's good enough to watch more than a couple of times."
"a-z-6","3","2","4","9 May 2007"," Disheartening
","In one part of the movie..Superman's mask is torn partly..and one of the eyes can be seen.. in the next scene peter is holding the mask and it was in good condition. One more thing why is it that Spiderman has shown his identity to every tom dick and harry contrary to the marvel comic hero Spiderman whose identity is only known by his aunt. The movie tends to get boring at times and it is not as gripping as I had expected it to be after all the hype of its release but the overall movie can be considered to be enjoyable.This is my personal view and people do not make your judgment about not watching this film because of the above comments. Well I expected more.... and the plot was not very good."
"dimondiman","3","2","4","9 May 2007"," The movie is not good
","These 3 series of SpiderMan were an embarrassment to great comics and cartoon series. The story of the 3rd Spidy develops too slow making the movie boring. The best acting came from Goblin and Sandman. Maguire couldn't show the character of Parker. Besides the guy is not fit to play the role - short and fat with stupid impressions on his face. Maguire is always the same in any movie. He impersonated Spiderman as sexually depressed cry-baby. Maguire wasn't meant to play a hero, but he did and spoiled the movie. If Brad Pitt was younger, he would be the best guy to play Parker. That's a shame and pity that Hollywood is so corrupted to allow Maguire to spoil an image of one of the greatest superheros. If you have nothing else to do and want to see a couple of OK CG battle scenes you can watch the movie, otherwise the Spider-Man 3 is a waste of time and money."
"baba44713","6","2","4","9 May 2007"," Rushed and half-baked
","This is what happens when you want to cram a bit too much of a plot in too little time.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 tries to get it all. A love triangle, a family drama, a dark alter-ego story and not one, not two, but THREE major villains. And all that in just over two hours.<br/><br/>Does it work? Well, yes and no. More no then yes, actually.<br/><br/>For me the whole movie seems rushed. Everything happens as quickly as possible to make room for some more things to happen. Relationships between characters change and re-change every five minutes, good guys go bad, bad guys go good... it's basically all a big mess. The action scenes are good, but I must say that by this time I am a bit dumbed down to spectacular CGI action sequences. Gone are the days when one minute of T-Rex roaring into camera made my day - now I want a good story to go with my jumping, exploding, punching and swinging stuff.<br/><br/>Peter Parker got it worst this time around. One minute he's happy, then depressed, then a bit too full of himself, angry, then cocky, then back to sad again... it's all bit irritating, really. Mary Jane is stripped down to a clichéd ""girlfriend who feels neglected"" character. The Green goblin story basically repeats itself. Sandman is neither here or there - this guy needs psychoteraphy, not superhero clashes. (Note to Sandman: make up your mind already!) And Venom is just tacked on - the black suit story should really have carried on to the next installment instead of getting a ham-fisted treatment.<br/><br/>Is the movie bad? Well, not entirely, you still get your proverbially entertaining Spidey action sequences, and some of the effects are really good. But it all seems.. lacking somehow. One of the true reasons Spiderman was so well accepted as a character was his human side, but the characters in this movie are not human in any aspect, and I'm not really talking about their superhero mutations. They are victims of a relentless plot, which throws them, twists them and turns and leaves them gasping for air. It's hard to sympathize with protagonists who aren't really sure themselves if they are heroes, villains or just plain confused.<br/><br/>And that's it. Just my 2 cents."
"phantomDD","5","2","4","9 May 2007"," Not worth waiting
","This movie really disappointing me. I thought 3 hours at the cinema will make me enjoy very much of my life. I think this movie will make me enjoy life, but no!!! This movie make me down for entire 1 years of waiting. The way Raimi tell the story is full of crap. I think part 2 is better than this one. I think the problem is Raimi. He always put his thought as primary thought for the film. Let me give an example. The 2 person that make 1,2 become dramatic is John Dykstra. The visual effect supervisor and Danny Elfman. The song composer from the 1,2 movie that had left away for the 3rd film. During of different creativity with Raimi. I think Dykstra has done a better job than Stokdyk about the effect thing and Elfman song is great. Better than Young do. How the movie tell the story is very simply complicated. It doesn't good at all. About the villain. I think Raimi choose only 1 person. Sandman or Venom? His choice. Avi Arad idea is great to have venom in the film but the creativity to put Venom and Sandman together is just doesn't great. If Raimi choose only Venom or even better. Put carnage in. The movie will become better. Or put Lizard and Sandman together. It just doesn't work. How the movie end? It's very bad. It disappointing me a lot. Why did Peter left Flint away? Does the punkin bomb can kill the symbiote or venom? Raimi really disappointing me on this one. I think 1 is better. Maybe because of the promotional. I think Raimi thought that ""Whoa!!! People are waiting for Spider-Man 3!! I should not do it great. I should not dedicate on this one"". I'm so sorry about Columbia Pictures. I think they waste 300,000,000$ to a people who doesn't give a think on what they do.<br/><br/>It's not worth waiting and really disappointing me.<br/><br/>PDD"
"decay-11","3","2","4","8 May 2007"," What a mess.
","So, amongst some of their great cinematic effects in which they spent millions upon millions, the producers seem to have forgotten to hire a director and actors or even bought a script. This is just a B movie with an extremely high budget, which left me very disappointed after watching it.<br/><br/>Although most of the action sequences can be enticing, the time spent waiting for them to happen is when you can see the rest of the audience checking their cellphones or doing their nails. All of the lead cast seem unable to act their way out of a paper bag and the script isn't helping them any. You can't go one minute in this movie without something horribly corny being said, a hole in the plot, or a complete waste of screen time on something completely irrelevant.<br/><br/>Tobey Macguire leaves much to be desired with his constant Keanu Reeves impressions and self-consciousness, whilst Kirsten Dunst and James Franco seem to do nothing but glaze over their lines without any emotion. Meanwhile Topher Grace was simply a bad choice for Venom, who - despite being Spider-Man's number one nemesis - comes off as a puppy dog. Thomas Haden Church's performance is admirable, though once again, he's another actor bogged down by the script. The only really good performances that rise above the script are that of J.K. Simmons and Elya Baskin who of course have tiny comedic roles, yet somehow became a cut above the rest of the more experienced actors. And apparently they just let the extras do whatever they wanted, because in every scene they stand around like idiots and fail to give any reality to their setting. If someone shoots a gun ten feet away - you would RUN.<br/><br/>As for the visuals, although breathtaking at times, even some of them leave the audience wondering how the production company expected people to take it as truth. One of the visuals reminded me of a low budget B movie made in the mid-90s with its bad computer graphics.<br/><br/>However, I do have to applaud the music. Although I swear one of the pieces is stolen from The Hulk movie (which, by the way, was far better than this garbage), every piece of the score is accurately put to the story and is very nice to listen to.<br/><br/>Rent this movie only if you're a Spider-Man freak, or just interested in being entertained for the ten minutes of great visuals. I'm still at a loss as to how the first two movies in this trilogy could be fairly good, and this one (with the same actors and director) completely bombs."
"durkin8104","Null","2","4","8 May 2007"," Spiderman 3...The mighty have fallen!!
","When I saw the first Spiderman movie, I was amazed. It's true that in my opinion, it lacked action, especially the final battle, but still, an iconic literary figure was brought to life on the big screen with respect, and creativity. The second one I really enjoyed. The action was insanely good, the personal story was touching, and I walked out of the theatre feeling quite good about what I just saw (as Dashboard Confessional played ""Vindicated"" during the credits). <br/><br/>Now Spidey 3 comes out and I'm totally disappointed again. For starters, There was WAY too much crammed in one movie, so it lacked sufficient depth with most of the sub-plots. As a matter of fact the only character I was remotely pleased with was in fact Harry, who had a great story, and was portrayed really well by James Franco. However, you have the Sandman who just happens upon a scientific experiment that turns him into Sand/Human Hybrid. I'll let that one go. Next you have Topher Grace cast in the role of Eddie Brock/Venom. In the comics he was a body builder, intimidating in his own right, terrifying when fused with the symboite. As much as I like Grace, he did not fit the bill. And there was SO much more that could have been done with Venom. So much. Fans wanted him, not Mud Man!! To make matters worse, Gwen Stacy was in it and served no purpose, neither did her father. The fights were over the top, but were poorly balanced against bad stories in the background (like Peter and MJ fighting over nonsense and him being to dumb to just say ""yes dear""). <br/><br/>The worst parts of the movie were: 1)Cool Guy Peter 2)The instant wrap-up of the Eddie Brock, not Venom, it was way too hasty. 3)The Butlers sudden wisdom 4)The terribly crappy fight in the end 5)The fact that Venom had like, zero screen time <br/><br/>I dunno what it is about Marvel Movies that they cant pull of good trilogies (Xmen and Blade both dropped the ball on number three). You'd think this would be a slam dunk, but it wasn't. It was bad. It reminded me of Hulk and Superman Returns, both potential to be classics but they failed because the directors tried to improve upon what was already good. You let me down Mr. Rami. You let me down."
"view_and_review","7","2","4","8 May 2007"," The Soap Opera Continues
","Spider Man is back for a 3rd go around and this time it is sappier than before. Petey and Mary sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g... bleh. I understand the writers establishing the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but we got enough of that in part 2. Now they are an item and they are having regular relationship problems, such as miscommunication, misunderstanding, misinterpretation, etc. The issues between Peter Parker and Mary Jane were so cliché that I thought I was watching a romantic comedy. It got so bad that someone in the audience yelled, ""Just break up with her!!"" <br/><br/>Besides the unnecessary soap opera with Pete and MJ, there was the addition of a villain who was just haphazardly thrown into the mix. Flint Marko aka the Sand Man was suddenly created and thrust into the plot, and they tried fruitlessly to tie him to Spidey via Peter Parker's murdered uncle. Why not let bygones be bygones? To introduce another version of Uncle Ben's death was pointless, especially when everyone had already moved on from that.<br/><br/>It wasn't all a bust though. We got to see venom, and Spider Man's struggle with the black alien substance that attached to him. We also got to see a decent battle between Spider Man and ""Goblin Junior"" aka Harry Oswald. Personally I wanted more of Venom. The trailers made it seem as though Venom was the key figure in this movie and that is why I saw this on opening day. But Venom's appearance and reign was very short lived.<br/><br/>Spider Man is loved because of his web slinging, spider senses, super strength, and ability to beat up the bad guy. More of that is good while more of the other stuff is bad. It's almost like Spider Man is growing up, and who wants Spider Man to grow up?"
"lpeart2006","2","2","4","8 May 2007"," Too Many Plot Lines
","I have come to the conclusion that comic book movie scripts should only be written by people who wrote for the comic book. This movie could have been so much better.<br/><br/>There are so many plot lines in this film that jumps back and forth between them to the point where I found the actual point of this movie unclear.<br/><br/>When Eddie Brock turned into Venom, he wasn't referred to as Venom and it all seemed rushed and added on. The Venom character should have been left out of this movie.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie was made up of the cluttered story lines and there were more tears than action scenes. I'm sure all the main characters cried at least once. Spiderman cried more times than fighting some one. Come on its a movie based on a comic book. Action is what we want Spidey should be kicking ass and taking names not spend most the movie unable to see behind his tears. And the Halmark moment between Spiderman and the Sandman was so cheesy."

The film is just plain bad, it's like an episode of Dawson's Creek and they just happened to put Spider-Man in a few shots. I had to turn to my brother at one point and ask when Spider-Man was going to pop up in the film. We spend so much time with Peter Parker, MJ, Harry and Gwen emoting that you forget this is a film about one of the most dynamic superheroes.<br/><br/>The script is lazy and when there are action scenes they just end in the middle of them. The crane scene, which is one of the highlights of the film, just seemed to stop when Spidey (and Sam Raimi for that matter) could have done so much more.<br/><br/>When Pete becomes Emo-Pete (you'll know it when it happens) the audience laughed out loud. In fact all the Emo-Pete scenes are just bad. It's not like Pete is evil, just a bit of a d!ckhead. I was expecting so much more after Spider-Man 2, but this was just plain bad. So bad people were leaving the cinema before the end. This film will do VERY well at the box office, but it'll be lucky to shift a dozen copies on DVD"

I wasn't insanely excited for Spiderman 3, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the first two, but there was so much hype and the previews were so well-done that I thought the movie was going to be rocking. Wow was I wrong. The writing was the worst I have ever seen from the Raimi brothers, the acting was a joke (save for Bruce Campbell), and the story lines were poorly developed. The action scenes were not good enough to save the movie. The movie tried to be a comedy too often and it completely lost all of it's emotion in the progress. The crowd had no idea what to feel at any moments and as such were clapping and booing at the wrong scenes. The dance scene at the jazz bar was so unbelievable to me that I thought I was going to wake up and realize I was dreaming and that I hadn't gone to see the movie yet.

"mcewenks","7","2","4","7 May 2007"," Both the best and worst of the trilogy
","In terms of action, music, sheer scope, and complexity of story, Spider-Man 3 just about blows it's predecessors out of the water. This film finally delivers some of the dark feel that moves the comic-book genre away from children. With these pros in mind, the cons really detracted from the film. We saw a departure from good script writing for broad story (as in X3, only not nearly as bad). Some of the scenes just got flat out ridiculous, but never really hurt the whole feel of the film, it just kinda shocked you out of engrossment. This movie is not as likely to please as the last two, which made the superhero genre a good measure better. I have a feeling that the studio pressured Sam Raimi into making the film as big in scope as it was, but Raimi still pulled all the loose ends together masterfully. Bravo. The only people who should be angry about this film are comic-book junkies (Some films change superhero story lines for the better, guys) and people who are fed up with the super-hero glut of films (the world would be a better place without the likes of Ghost Rider and Fantastic Four). Overall, it was very enjoyable and still stands as one of the better examples of what a superhero film should be."
"flyboysama","3","2","4","7 May 2007"," What a let down...
","Alright so I'm gonna keep this relatively short and sweet. I had heard it wasn't very good, but took the plunge anyway. But wow, people really weren't kidding! The script really felt like it was pulled together by a few 10 year old comic book fans. The inclusion of three villains (Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin) was just too much. Plus Blacksuit Spidey. All the stories sort of started and then just dropped off in a really unfulfilled and half-baked fashion. Raimi really should have just stuck to the Symbiote and the new Goblin (if he really wanted). The Sandman added nothing to the story. But the villain overload is something that has been discussed over and over.<br/><br/>What I'd love to mention is the obscenely stupid inclusion of Petere's little...emo phase. That was just dumb on so many levels. I don't know if that was supposed to be a joke or what, but it was a completely unwanted and unnecessary 10 minute interlude.<br/><br/>The romantic thing was muddled and annoying as well. I don't need to get into that as well as the fact that it's been discussed time and time again.<br/><br/>In short, the first two movies were not masterpieces, but enjoyable fun...this however was a disgrace. It was pulled together from the brains of a million little fanboys with no apparent oversight by someone wishing to pull together a coherent story. I really don't even think they tried. I was also really saddened to see that Sony doesn't learn it's lesson and has signed up for three more movies. Ugh. Sequels really are death."

I went there cause I wanted to see Venom. Black suit Spiderman and Venom. Venom was barely in the movie. I'd say he was in there for like 30 minutes tops. And they killed him. What the hell?

There were only a couple of parts in the movie that i didn't like and the first one was that the part of Eddie Brock/Venom was played by Topher Grace (I could care less if i spell his name wrong.). If you look back at the comic books Eddie Brock is a big, burly, tough guy. And Topher Grace is this little guy that could be snapped in half like a twig. The second thing is the ending. When Sandman confesses that he killed Peter Parker's uncle (By accident) Peter Parker says ""I forgive you."" Now, I'm not a psychologist but I'm sure that someone who was just beat up a few seconds before BY the guy who says that he killed his uncle, would probably be killed. But like i said, I'm not a psychologist. And then the Sandman just floats away. Venom's name was not mentioned in the movie, and he died far to easily. And there is no hope of Venom coming back because he was blown the hell up along with Eddie Brock.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was good and i would go see it again if i got the chance (Just to go and see the amazing effects that were put into the Sandman.)"

","Well the wait is over and Spidey is back on the big screen. Unfortunately my biggest fear was realized when I saw it. They tried too much. I have a feeling that it was mostly due to the fact that Sam Raimi had let on that he wasn't going to do another film. But everybody wanted to see Venom, even if he didn't seem to want him. Other than the specifics, which I'll mention in a sec, Venom just seemed like he was tacked on to keep everybody yammering for him happy.<br/><br/>The acting was very well done. Thomas Haden Church was just excellent as Sandman. There have been plenty of complaints on how his character was changed from the comic.<br/><br/>~spoiler~ He was a very deep and sympathetic character and not just the random thug whom gets super powers as in the comic.<br/><br/>Normally, in fact in just a minute, I would hate the major personality change in a character that has a lot of already established background. However, it fit in with the movie's theme of vengeance vs forgiveness. It also fit with Sam Raimi's style of having deep characters.<br/><br/>~Spoiler~Harry Osborn...Other than the obvious mention of the Butler near the end telling Harry exactly how his father died which did not make any sense. Maybe if sometime in Spidey 2 if he had mentioned it maybe...but...He was fine.<br/><br/>On the whole, Harry was much better, and much better acted. The face gear was ridiculous. It was all designed so that you could easily see James Franco's face which wouldn't have been possible with the old goblin-y mask. That seemed to be the trend with you constantly seeing Peter with out his mask, and Eddie(post symbiosis) revealing his face to the Sandman. We can't have our pretty young actors' faces covered at all times now can we.<br/><br/>On to Venom.<br/><br/>~spoiler~ If they had just had Peter get rid of the symbiont and it bonds to Eddie before Eddie runs away. Then leave Venom for the 4th movie. Everything else could have been left the same. But heaven forbid that anybody do something with what Raimi had already started. Not to mention that he was a bit more sane in the movie than he should have been. Also referring to himself as ""I"" and ""Me"" instead of ""Us"" and ""We"". But all of that could have been forgiven until ~BIG SPOILER~ THEY KILLED HIM. What?! Here's an idea, Eddie and the symbiont aren't completely in sync and when Spidey starts to separate them he escapes and you don't see him till Spider-man 4.<br/><br/>The majority of people upset with the movie will be overactive fan boys, the rest should be entertained by it. Just because they screwed up Venom doesn't mean that the movie was a total waste.<br/><br/>All in all, it wasn't enough to make the rest of the movie unwatchable, a la the way that the 3rd Matrix made the entire trilogy unwatchable. Every trilogy has a weak spot, and this is it. I just hope that everyone involved in it learns from their mistakes and decides to come back to do a 4th movie just to end the series on a true good note. Here's a suggestion, Spider-man 4 should be Mysterio and Elctro"

","Spiderman 3 is perhaps one the most disappointing films I've seen recently. Probably from high expectations, both considering the director, previous Spidermans, and the potential for greatness.<br/><br/>I sat for a good 15 minutes in the theater with my buddy and vented so this is gonna be difficult to structure, but I'll try.<br/><br/>Story: It's a convoluted junk heap that jams so much in you wonder if it ever saw the inside of an editing studio. The film completely loses it's arc, and the simplistic and proved three act narrative of a film which is all you need, transmogrifies into a stop-start cluster of story lines, false endings, and miss-edited cutaways to other characters, it's hard to keep from booing the screen. And everything is so unilaterally surmised with bull Aunt May sayings, Mary Jane whining, and Peter Parker overdub voice-overs, it feels like they made this movie as an after-school special. And they certainly didn't make it for the fans. Or for smart people.<br/><br/>The menage-a-junk of bad guys deprives any of having a decent representative back story or complexity. Sandman is a joke of inexplicable origins and non posed questions. Hayden Church does nothing but growl like Stay Puff the Marshmallow Man. His motive is classic-good guy-turned bad guy in that he just needs money for his crippled child. Yawn. And again, Sandman growls and bellows like some kind of Godzilla contemporary. He's a real man, why would he growl? The detailed explanation of Dr. Octopus's get-up and Green Goblin's hormone therapy or whatever are almost buy-able. But now Sandman can fly through the air? Really? Ummm, OK....<br/><br/>And Venom. Sigh...... What makes Spiderman so special? He's not the strongest or fastest or smartest. Actually, he's pretty smart, but whatever. Yet he has something no other character has - his Spidey Sense. The ability to know danger a few moments before hand. Remember the high school part from Spidey 1, which portrayed this beautifully? Yeah - the spider sense. Well, what makes Venom so freaking dangerous and so idiosyncratic is that Spidey can't detect him. Ever. It's the crux of all their battles. And Raimi took that concept, put it in a wastebasket, and kicked that sucker out the window. Venom, in all his richness, is Squandered in this movie. The Whole movie should have been about the symbiotic, the change Parker goes through, and his choices henceforth. Instead, it's an aside. Often paling in screen time to Green Goblin rehashing, Sandman, and relationship with women.<br/><br/>And how many Spidey movies do we need Kirsten Dunst tied up and in distress? Every single one apparently.<br/><br/>Acting: This thing degenerates into a Spanish soap opera and I guess they received direction that if you don't cry on screen, then therefore you are incapable of showing emotion. Count the tears, they add up quickly.<br/><br/>You can pretty much disregard James Cromwell in this. You paid for an actor of his caliber and basically wasted him. Good job Sony. He's barely in it, has no decent scene to express his talents, so why not get a no-name or less cultivated actor? Stupid casting.<br/><br/>Alfred Molina's absence is palpable. Topher Grace does nothing to impress me. I always hate this guy in everything. I would never cast him. And as Eddie Brock-Venom, the role of a lifetime, he threw it away.<br/><br/>Annnnnnnd of course, Bruce Campbell's cameo was good. Probably two days of work for him and he easily has the best scene. <br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is quite fetching. Her eyes just knock me over. Bleh. Not a good role for her to take, other than the paycheck.<br/><br/>Not a big deal, but the extras were horrible. Often looking different places where Spiderman should be. Sometimes disinterested, sometimes corny beyond belief.<br/><br/>Special effects guy John Dykstra, who won the Academy Award for visual effects for his work on Spider-Man 2, declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor. And Danny Elfman backed out too. Both are missed. The fight scenes are choreographed adequately but they look cartoon-like and the bodies aren't given enough ""weight"". They look flimsy, almost like magazine paper sometimes.<br/><br/>Directing: Again, I've said this earlier, but the whole thing seems rushed, not thought out, choppy and chunky. There's no finesse. It's a mangled junk heap. And remember the ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" montage from Spidey 2? There's something similar here in 3, but it's a grotesque severance from the narrative and appears solely to get some ""stupid people in the audience laughing"". There's even a dance sequence at a jazz club that basically looks like they cut and pasted from The Mask with Jim Carey.<br/><br/>Just a let down on every single level. Kinda like your favorite child getting busted by his school for bullying the fat kid. You're more disappointed than anything else. ""With great promise, comes great disappointment."" For the 8 plus dollars, I feel like demanding a refund. It's like I got punched in the gut by my girlfriend, who then got into the car of my best friend; it hurts on a lot of levels."

","After the movie it was difficult to understand what exactly one should feel! It was a Spider-man movie after all and one that had so much hype about it. I love Spider-man. I tried to reason: the plot wasn't so bad, it had optimal doses of humour, the theme was alright, the animation was excellent. That's pretty much all the good, I could say about it!<br/><br/>The dialogues were childish, misplaced, poorly delivered by the actors in the most careless of manners. The overall acting was also not fulfilling. Only a little trembling of the lips doesn't really work. A few scenes that were meant to be emotionally heavy, actually seemed funny. Every scene seemed to have a dose of everything.<br/><br/>The worst part, was that the movie seemed to be in a hurry, which during the actions scenes was great but definitely not in the emotional scenes. The introductions of the villains also seemed too haphazard. Each wasn't properly engraved into the plot. The plot was highly predictable.<br/><br/>Considering the stage created by the first two movies, with their mature dialogues, well enacted scenes and overall completeness, the third is a serious let-down for fans and others, as well. It could have really been better!!!"
"CelluloidRehab","5","2","4","7 May 2007"," The Public Castration and Impotence of Spider-Man (a.k.a. the former secret identity of Peter Parker) by Dr. Phil
","The potential for subject lines here are as infinite as where I could start with just how bad this movie is. Bad maybe an exaggeration. Knowing what I know about Spider-Man and of Raimi's work, it is bad. The movie by itself is barely average. In the echelon of the trilogy, this movie would be dead last. I haven't been this disappointed by a finale of a trilogy since Matrix Revolutions. I'm not counting Revenge of the Sith because in all honesty we knew it was going to be bad from the beginning (it is somewhere in the void of ""it's so bad its decent""). The second movie is the best in the trilogy and one of the best ""comic book movies"" made. This one meanders from the start with the opening credits involving a montage of scenes from the first two movies (minus Alex Ross). Did I just have my memory wiped? No, that would be one of the main characters (more on this later).<br/><br/>Where as the first movie was relatively slow, I can understand that the character and story development was needed. The follow up had all the elements in all the right proportions. Part three simply tries to be better by sheer force. If 1 villain was good, then 3 must be 3 times better, right? WRONG. If the trial, tribulations and personal problems of Peter Parker was meaningful to the character's development, then dropping a truck load of melodrama will make it that much better, right? WRONG. There is just too much of everything, except action. For those that thought Death Proof was boring, the first half of this movie will have you sucking down a Extra-Super-Large Coke just to maintain a semblance of consciousness. I felt like maybe Barbara Walters and her View cronies had written aspects of the script. I know Peter Parker is not your typical superhero, who often delves into his personal life and emotion, but did we have to give him estrogen therapy? Others have called this movie ""dark"" and full of revenge. By dark they must have meant the costume and/or lighting and by revenge they must not have seen OldBoy (or any of Chan-wook Park's revenge trilogy). There are too many nemeses, too much meaning-less dialog and situations we have already dealt with in some form and not enough new things. All the growth and development is at the end and done in such a lackadaisically talk show-like moment. I'm not even going to comment on the crappy and sudden ""sunset"" ending or the ""apology"". Ugh. Now I have to gargle some Stolichnaya to keep the vomit down.<br/><br/>There are few things that are good. The thing that foremost stood out in my mind is Sandman. I'm not talking about the character, but the CG creation. It is simply amazing and left me in awe. The Venom character is also impressive, but it did not resonate with me as much as Sandman. Maybe that was because Eric Forman kept talking out of the creature, with unscripted comic high jinks. I was half expecting a Chevy Chase-like pratfall somewhere (I think this is more of a problem with the actor than the character). The only other standout for me is the incomparable Bruce Campbell. He single-handedly outshines any of the marquee names in this movie (and he does this with a very limited screen time) and is one of the most vastly underrated actors out there. The black-suited Spider-Man is also interesting and has a couple of nice moments, but overall felt underwhelming (more is better equation again). The few good moments (Peter's dark side dancing included) are overwhelmed by repetition and muffled by long stretches of nothing.<br/><br/>The movie is a summer blockbuster gone bad. It was almost as if everyone involved was forced to work on this movie out of contractual obligations. It is completely soulless and the antithesis of the previous two movies. Even New York is missing, replaced by a generic looking metropolis. This would seem to be the case if you heard the way Tobe Maguire and Kirsten Dunst speaking on the ""promotion tour"" of the movie. I would be surprised if either of them (or the director) hook up for a fourth movie (this of course does not take in account the money and people's desire to sell as much of themselves as possible). It just seemed that everyone was tired of it all. Tobe plays Spider-Man in either a ""robot-mimic"" style or an over-the-top emotional fake. Does Spider-Man even need a costume anymore? Everyone seems to know who he is. Was Raimi looking towards the recent Marvel House of M and Civil War events for inspiration? Dunst is back to playing the flat Mary-Jane, who yet again is only good for kissing and requires constant rescuing. Topher Grace just doesn't fill up Venom's suit well and his acting acumen has not elevated him past Eric Forman(yet). Sandman as character made me yawn. About the only good characterization (apart from Bruce Campbell) would have to be James Franco (Harry Osbourne). He is the only one who actually looks like he cares; too bad he gets amnesia, his motivations change more times than a manual transmission and his butler has a sudden outbreak of Alzheimer's.<br/><br/>I didn't even mention the story, but that's mostly cause it just seems to be a collection of coincidences. One could say a Reader's Digest edited version of the best of Spider-Man. This movie reminds me much of the X-Men 3 movie except that movie made me laugh my ass off (unintentionally of course). I actually had high expectations for this movie, albeit I had a feeling it was going to try too much. I didn't expect too much to equal bad. Unless you are a teen, pre-teen or a drooling vegetable, you are probably not going to enjoy this movie much. Go back and see the previous two movies for your Spider-Man craving."

","Opening the 2007 summer movie season is Spider-Man 3, the ridiculously anticipated follow-up to its acclaimed 2002 and 2004 predecessors. What results is a film that finally shows the goofy, corny, yet extremely enjoyable style of director Sam Raimi. Still, the rumors are true, Spider-Man 3 does have too much going on, with about five different story lines tossed around. Raimi does a fairly competent job stringing them all together, but there isn't enough time to actually give some of the characters enough development. However, for all of the film's flaws, there are plenty of strengths.<br/><br/>First of all, the film is extremely entertaining to watch, with its nearly two and a half hour running time breezing by. Toby Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, who struggles with issues involving his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Now becoming more of a threat to his life than a personal problem is Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his eagerness to avenge his father's death by donning the Green Goblin mask. Yet another storyline concerns a desolate criminal named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who may have been the actual killer of Peter's uncle. Spider-Man also scuffles with a rival photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) who eventually transforms into a creature known as Venom, and wrestles with his own impending dark side. <br/><br/>With so much to keep track of in such a loaded film, characters like Venom and Flint Marko (The Sandman) don't receive enough screen time to really make an impact. Perhaps some story lines could have been saved for future films, in order to develop the more crucial characters. On the other hand, many segments are thoroughly cultivated, with Harry Osborn's relationship with Peter being one of the best handled elements of the film. <br/><br/>One sequence of the film causing much polarity amongst audiences is when Spider-Man fully embraces his dark side and his new black spidey suit. Instead of Peter being ruthless and dark, Raimi makes him absurdly pompous. Rather than getting what was advertised as the darkest of the Spider-Man movies, we receive a very fun superhero film with great action sequences and many hysterical moments, including a cameo by the legendary Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead trilogy) as a French maitre'd. <br/><br/>While definitely far from great, Spider-Man 3 has a notable distinction being that in spite of much of the clichéd dialogue and over the top moments, the film still succeeds in what it intends to do, which is to entertain. Raimi was certainly aware of what he was making, packing enough action, comedy, and strong performances to obscure the cringe inducing moments."
"Rainy-3","3","2","4","7 May 2007"," Extremely Disappointing
","This would have made two great movies, but it makes one very weak one. There are three story lines going on at the same time, and none of them gets enough attention to fully develop the story. This left me with a very contradictory feeling at the end of the movie, thinking both ""That was it?"" and ""My god that was a long movie."" Another problem with this movie is that all of the story lines are ended abruptly and in a very unconvincing way.<br/><br/>The special effects were OK at times, but for the most part the movie looked more like a video game than like something that was supposed to be convincing. The action moved too quickly and was too dark to follow most of the time, which left me more confused than impressed most of the time.<br/><br/>I loved the first two Spider Man movies, and I was very excited to see the third one, but unfortunately the entire movie was a disappointment."
"fury7767","6","2","4","7 May 2007"," Entertaining but doesn't live up to prior titles
","I got to say the movie itself was entertaining. There were times when I laughed, times when I awwed, and times when I sat back and said am I viewing a Spiderman movie or Mad TV? Spiderman 3 I felt didn't live up to its prior titles or roles. the characters are an interesting pick for villains but the development just wasn't fully there. It seemed as if the developers and screen writers tried to fit way to much into a 2.5 hour movie.<br/><br/>Topher Grace wasn't the best pick of the role of Eddie Brock. In my past experience in comic books Eddie Brock has always been this big tall body building guy that was strong in stature, Topher Grace didn't meet any of those requirements. Sitting there watching him you didn't know if this guy really is supposed to be Venom or some annoying Jimmy the photographer.<br/><br/>Despite the fact it did have a very strong opener, making it the leading movie opening of all times, one could predict this movie won't do as well as the first titles did. Special effects were very strong, The Sandman which everybody thought would have been weak was a very well done character.<br/><br/>From reading other posts you can pretty much make the same judgement, your either A. going to see spiderman with the expectations of this movie being as well as the first 2 or B. Going to see Spiderman and be disappointed."
"jdfancher","5","2","4","7 May 2007"," What the heck happened?
","Being a fan of some more recent comic-to-movie adaptations, and a rather big Spidey fan myself...the first two Spidey movies did a great job with giving fans another medium to see their favorite story, as well as making it easy for newcomers to get into the story as well. While the adaptation(s) fall stray from the actual comic books (which is understandable...it's almost impossible to take literary works to the screen without some mix/miss on the content), the basis to many things were left intact.<br/><br/>Too much onto too big of a plate in too little time. It's unfortunate that Spider-Man 3 falls short of what it should've been...which is 3 movies instead of one. Lacking character development and coherent story-telling, you find yourself wondering what you're watching halfway through the film.<br/><br/>It was great seeing two new villains introduced...but entirely disappointing to find them both ""gone"" at the end of the film. The storyline of Harry & Peter wraps up nicely, but honestly the film should have gone to them...which would have left the ""dark"" element out of the 3rd film.<br/><br/>The introduction of Venom was a huge ""pull"" to the film (especially for me...he's my all-time favorite villain). However his part is left too small and insignificant, hardly worthy of one of Spider-Mans ""biggest"" nemesis. The fact that they stuck so close to lore on the Spidey/Venom relationship is a testament to what writers ""should have"" done...which is give him the glory he deserves. Movies 1 & 2 gave appropriate time to build the villains into the films, using the story to strengthen their role, and make them ""part"" of the film. Sandman and Venom are left with very very thin entrances and exits...which makes you wonder ""what was the film about?"" The pointless dribble between action sequences was further proof of this problem, trying to fit too much story into area's of the movie that fell victim to poor character development. Seeing Peter ""dance"" like a fool in a Jazz club hardly shows the ""agony"" and ""dispair"" the symbiote inflicts on it's host. Hardly the ""dark"" side we all imagined prior to seeing the movie. Peter hardly struggles with this problem before deciding to remove the black goo...sending it to Brock, where they share a hatred for Peter. But why should the symbiote hate Peter? Who knows! They didn't explain it well enough, they were too busy trying to fit Sandman and Harry Osborne into the film when they should have been building ""one"" character instead of ""three"".<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's a Spider-Man movie, and I'm sure I'll own it and watch action sequences over and over again. But, it's entirely unfortunate that such potential was wasted to turn a movie into an almost 2 1/2 hour ""eye candy"" spectacle."
"robert_hennah","6","2","4","7 May 2007"," Soooo disappointed
","Well, where do I start, I guess I'll outline some of the good and the bad. The special effects team did a great job especially with the final action sequence although I thought some of the venom sequences were a little poor, such as when venom was talking the mouth movements looked quite bad and Eddie Brock's teeth changing to fangs permanently looked pretty stupid. Kirsten Dunst looked great, I thought she looked awful in Spiderman 2. Great to see the return of certain characters such as J Jameson, the Russian landlord, his daughter and the thug from number 1, not to mention Harry Osbourne who gave the best performance in the movie, he really gives a good show of conflicting emotions. The negatives are based primarily on a lot of cheesy acting. I know they were trying to show extremes between good and evil but dancing stupidly down the street? terrible child actors proclaiming ""wicked, cool!"",the annoying news reporter on scene for the final showdown, not to mention that Spider-man's heroic entry at the final battle shows the American flag flying behind him, disgusted flashback to Super-man (1978) anyone? The film never really explores Sandman's story properly, we learn his daughter is dying but not why, we learn Flint was trying to get money to pay for treatment but not what kind of treatment. He says he's not a bad guy but a guy who had bad luck, we know Flint killed Uncle Ben and his ""justifying story"" really has no justification and we're supposed to have sympathy for this guy? Besides all this information we know from the previews and trailers, no more information is given in the movie which is kinda annoying. The origin of Venom isn't explored properly, Harry Osbourne isn't really given enough screen time to give his character justice, consider that they've been teasing it for two movies and he gets half a dozen short scenes to wrap it all up!, all in all, having three opponents for spidey is all well and good if you can explore them properly, this is never really done but they did make for some great action sequences. I would also say it's a very soppy movie in that it features A lot of singing, dancing and extravagant dresses, it was mostly a chick flick with undertones of comic action. All in all, a chick flick crossed with an action movie. If you're a fan of the comics then this won't satisfy you as it doesn't explore the characters properly, although it is cool to see such infamous villains brought to life. If you're an action movie fan the action scenes are great but you will probably get bored by the chick flick scenes and vice versa, chick flick fans might get bored of the action scenes, but these tend to be over reasonably fast. I loved Spider-man and I liked Spider-man 2 a lot but I was so disappointed by Spider-man 3 that I have had to write my views immediately. Franco rocked as Harry and Simmons was great as Jonah, apart from that I cringed in my seat as opposed to sitting on the edge with excitement, wait for the rental, cheaper and you can pause it occasionally to recover from the awful cheesy moments for which Sam Raimi can not be forgiven. I looked forward to this for a long time, I am very, very disappointed."

","The Romantic angle of Spiderman throughout its existence in comics, TV and Film has been an intricate part of its story lines. However it is a secondary part. In the third installment of the franchise Raimi fails to live up to the expectations set by his previous 2 forays into the Marvel Universe of Spiderman. In this third installment he spends too much time focusing on the romantic trials and tribulations of Peter and MJ, and too little time developing meaningful characters or entertaining story lines.<br/><br/>In Spiderman he broke new ground, and set the franchise up to be the go-to summer blockbuster for fans of both the super hero and action genre. In Spiderman 2 he raised the bar, combining incredible action with story lines that were sure to please discerning film aficionados, and comic book fans alike. Balancing perfectly The Romantic story lines, with the dramatic ones, and interweaving them brilliantly with the action sequences that we expected.<br/><br/>In the third installment perhaps he became a victim of the success of the first two. In this film he tries to do too much, too many characters, too many villains, getting too little screen time, and far too much teenage ""romantic angst"" combined with far too little Spiderman for a film bearing the title Spiderman. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, far too many song and dance numbers for a film not titled Chicago!<br/><br/>In addition, in a move that, much like the first 2 films, I am certain was spurred by the egos of the films stars, Spiderman takes every chance he gets to remove his mask, or at least half of it. How everyone in New York does not know that Peter Parker is Spiderman I do not know. (I guess if they can not figure out that Clarke Kent is Superman it is feasible that they would not figure this out either). Two weeks ago I would have said that Tobey Maguire was Spiderman, and losing him would hurt the franchise, however after this installment, losing all of the big three (calling Dunst one of the big three gives me a bit of a pain, but...) would probably not hurt my feelings at all.<br/><br/>Of course as with most films, not everything is bad, even though there is not nearly enough Spiderman for my liking, the action sequences that this film does contain are spectacular, if somewhat disconnected from the film, and if the film were under 100 min the amount of action in this ""action film"" would probably have been adequate, however for a film with a running time pushing two and a half hours Spiderman 3 was seriously lacking in action for stretches that seemed to drag on for an eternity while we suffer through the twist scene.<br/><br/>The Good News is, this movie will make a fortune, so this very bad installment will not sink the Franchise, however the bad news is, this movie will make a fortune, and therefore the mistakes that were made may go unnoticed by the film maker."

","""Spiderman 3"" suffers from excessiveness... There is too much drama, too much background references, too much self-importance, too many indulgences, and rarely enough, not enough action or innovative special effects to make us care for what is special about this character and the new villains.<br/><br/>Enter Topher Grace, James Franco (well, re-enter), and Thomas Haden Church, and you have some very competent performers. Unfortunately, their time is shortened because we have a rather uninteresting drama unfolding between the main characters, a development that drags the rest of the film down, as we plod through scenes that we know can lead to nothing else but a happy outcome. There is no way the filmmakers are going to split M.J. and Peter, so why waste our time with story lines that are dead to begin with? Back to the villains, Sandman is probably the most interesting of the three, and he would be a terrific presence if he was a bit meaner... more diabolical, and less of a victim, himself. Then there is Mr. Grace, a man who shows promise, but looks like he belongs on the side of the good guys. His transformation into the horrifying Venom is semi effective, as we know what is behind the ""suit"".<br/><br/>There are problems with the direction because there is no sense of danger, impending violence, or anything remotely destructive. The only danger is to the audience's attention, who might be able to take a nap and not miss much in the first third of film.<br/><br/>When I walked out of the theatre, I felt like a had a nice light snack, but I wondered if that would be equally satisfying again..."
"colonel_green","9","2","4","6 May 2007"," A strong finish, although there are several flaws.
","Various reviews have mentioned the butler scene, which totally took me out of the film. However, perhaps even bigger than the problem of where this guy was while Harry wasted years on a mission of vengeance, a more fundamental problem is: what exactly does his testimony actually prove? So Osborne was impaled by his own glider; that doesn't mean anything; later on, Harry is impaled by his own glider; did Harry kill himself? Aside from the butler, most of this movie works quite well; the parts that don't basically all involve the Sandman, who is quite well-acted, but totally unnecessary. The retcon with Uncle Ben just sticks out as unnecessary. The ending is just weird; sure, he's repentant, but he's probably put four-score people in critical care, and caused millions of dollars in property damage (of course, perhaps Spidey just didn't have the energy to stop him at that point). Sandman should have been left out in favour of Harry and Venom. The Sandman's whole plot (criminal, sick daughter, superpowers) reminded me more of Scott Lang than anything else, although Lang became a hero (albeit by stealing).<br/><br/>Pretty much everything else works great. James Franco is excellent; he was rather awkward in the previous two.<br/><br/>One of the things that I really liked was the large, large cast of characters; to have Connors drop in for the film equivalent of two panels, and Captain Stacy, and the whole Bugle cast, etc., just is terrific for replicating the feel of a comic, where appearances of characters cost nothing.<br/><br/>The ""emo-Spidey"" scenes are played outrageously broadly, which I think is the point: it's goofy, laughable, until the ending scuffle, at which point the movie crashes down to earth. I really liked how it was handled. It's amusing how they cast natural blonde Dunst as redhead MJ, and then hired natural redhead Howard as blonde Gwen.<br/><br/>Eddie Brock is handled very well; although I'm not sure how the movie wants us to feel about his firing from the Bugle; sure, Peter was a bit of a jerk, but professionally speaking he did absolutely the right thing: Brock falsified, and he deserved to go down (not to mention smearing Spider-Man's reputation for no reason).<br/><br/>The ending is quite appropriate; I was afraid they'd have him propose or something like that, but instead we just get a ray of hope that they can work things out.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a tremendously ambitious film; it falls down in a couple of places, but I'll give it a 9/10. It was very entertaining."
"maxxxracer","5","2","4","6 May 2007"," One of the Worst Movies I've seen in a while
","You heard me right. Spider-Man 3 sucks. I was hoping it was going to be good and even drove out of the city to find an unpacked theater to view it at on Saturday. But much to my dismay the movie was terrible in every aspect other than special effects. <br/><br/>Directing - 2 thumbs down Acting - 2 thumbs down Writing - 2 thumbs down<br/><br/>Most movies that are not very good, I can actually stand to watch for the full duration of the movie, but Spider-Man 3 had me wanting to jump out of my seat and run out of the theater about 15 different times during the movie. There were a few good parts of the movie, but then the writers had to kill it again. I would have walked out of the movie if it wouldn't have been for the fact that I drove 15 miles out of my way and payed 10.25 to see this piece of trash. <br/><br/>I would have to say that I mostly blame the director Sam Raimi, who had previously directed the 1st and second movie, but for the 3rd he decided to direct and write it along with his older brother Ivan Raimi. In short, neither of them should EVER touch a screen play. It also appears that they axed the two writers (Stan Lee and Steve Ditko) of the first 2 movies who appear to be the creative knowledge of Marvel Comics, creating such characters as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, and many other characters. <br/><br/>But here is some good news folks. According to IMDb they are bringing back San Lee and Steve Ditko back for the fourth movie. So there is hope for #4 being good again."
"iam_majin_vegeta","5","2","4","6 May 2007"," Why oh why did Spiderman die....
","Well I should start with I am a Spider-man fan. The first Spidey movie was just cool: a good adaptation of the comic and a fun movie all around. The second one was just a little under the first. And now comes the third one... or as I like to call it ""the big steaming pile of monkey crap"". <br/><br/>Spider-man 3 is just a money maker. A weak move with a big budget behind it and a  so it sells (Batman and Robin). It was played horribly and written even worse. Peter P.'s character was a nerd by day yes but they just don't point out Spidey's sarcastic humor. And is it just me or does Tobey really sucks in this movie. In the first to he wasn't good but he plaid his best. Now he just is there; doing nothing.<br/><br/>The script has been modified for dramatic reasons and has deviated from the original comic. In my opinion that is just a stab in the hearts of the true fans. I will not spoil how the story was ruined but the fans will know when they will see this movie. It also has a tearjerker ending. <br/><br/>The Movie also is what I call a skipper. It skips needed scenes for the plot and jambs to much in to little time. If the movie was longer maybe it would have been a little better. It is a movie I recommend downloading. It does not deserve the money you give to go to the cinema or renting it. It killed Spider-man in cinema for me (much like ""B&R"" killed Batman; maybe we have a Spider-man returns with a better actor to re-launch the series a few years from now :D)<br/><br/>To sum it up: bad acting, bad script, bad directing, bad casting. Good special effects."
"timothy-shoemaker","6","2","4","6 May 2007"," below average
","I didn't like this film, for a number of reasons. I'm growing weary of the Peter-MJ-Harry love triangle. The stories would be a lot more focused if those relationships weren't intricate to the plot. To me, the minutiae of the subplots is distracting. I don't care whether they're together or not. I care about the relationship between Spider-Man and the criminal. There were too, too many sub-plots in this movie -- MJ and Peter, MJ and Harry, Peter and Harry, Peter and the Sandman, Peter and the obnoxious punk photographer -- uggh, enough already! At some point, it stopped being a comic book story and started being a soap opera. That's not what action comic-book movies are supposed to be. They should have complex characters, which this one does, but not complex plots. Next, they muddled the previous films by re-writing history. It was important to the first two Spider-Man movies that Peter Parker let his uncle's killer get away when he had the chance to stop him. Now, they're saying he wasn't the killer? There was no need for this revisionist history. The layer of guilt Peter Parker had in him in the first two films is now gone. Why did they do this? The black version of Spider-Man was overdone and overacted and unnecessary. The evil haircut they gave Parker was stupid. With all of their technology, that's all they came up with? That said, in theater where I saw this, people laughed and applauded. I left wondering whether they had ever seen a movie before. They obviously had never seen a good one."
"thereisnospoon333","4","2","4","6 May 2007"," Interesting approach, horrible execution
","I went to see this movie with complete knowledge that the series had already destroyed the original and classic story-line of Spider-man. I was OK with this, because, up until this sequel, I had an appreciation for the films that was separate from my love of the comics. But to my surprise, this film not only destroyed the original story line, it completely ruined the trilogy as well.<br/><br/>This film seemed incredibly rushed. The plot was everywhere, all at once. The dialog was HORRIBLE. The acting was laughable. Almost nothing actually made sense, and you could tell the actors knew that. I was beginning to wonder if anybody involved in the movie had ever actually read a Spider-Man comic before, or if they were just taking ideas and basic concepts and manipulating them. My festering and ever-increasing hatred for Sam Raimi peaked the night I watched this movie. The director I once idolized for the Evil Dead trilogy, I now put in the same category as Uwe Boll.<br/><br/>Story-line differences aside, this was just a horrible movie. Don't pay to watch it. If you have to see it, then rent it from McDonalds for a buck in a few months. If you have kids, and they are either under the age of 10 or haven't seen that many movies, then bring them, because they can most likely look past the awful awful script and enjoy the well choreographed, though not always logical, fight scenes (I say most likely because you will get the occasional ""Mommy, why did he just say that?"" and ""Why are they all crying??"")."

","I am a big fan of the Spiderman comics and I really loved the first two movies. The third movie did not live up to the promise and hype. Waited way too long for the symbiont to latch onto Peter and then not enough of Peter as the black Spiderman. The fight scenes were good (what little there were). Bottom line is too much romance and not enough action. Let's face facts, Spiderman is an action superhero not a soap opera star. The first two movies kept me on the edge of my seat, but I actually found myself starting to nod off a few times in this movie. Especially during the tragic dance scene in the bar. In the comic book the symbiont would ""cloth"" Peter when he needed to turn into Spiderman. It is then that the symbiont started taking over Peter's mind, not when he was walking around as Peter Parker. I am surprised Stan Lee didn't step up during the filming and say STOP!, this is all wrong!"

","COULD HAVE DONE BETTER I've been waiting for this film to release for a long time AND they have not met my expectations of third sequel of SpiderMAN. When Peter Parker (T.M) turned evil, it was not very evil to me at all, it was literally a joke to me. i thought ""what was he doing? when he danced in the jazz club and on the street"". MJ was barely there and nagging, and Harry Osbounre (j.F)is a 4 1/2 out of 5 star scale because they way he acted and i loved his role more than everyone else. <br/><br/>The Sandman(Thomas Haden) story was so low and pathetic i didn't think it was great. Gwen Stacey is a fresh face and was OK. Eddie Brock aka the Venom (Topher Grace) was good and got annoying too, but did alright. <br/><br/>Throughout this film, the special effect is fantastic but it was not plotted they way the director wanted. <br/><br/>a complete joke <br/><br/>2 out of 5"

","After seeing spider-man 3, i innocently came on here to find out what else Topher Grace was off. I was shocked to find so many people running the film down.<br/><br/>I loved both of the other spider-man films and this one was no exception. Other comments about it have said its cheesy. Yes, it is cheesy. But so hilarious with it. Whats wrong with peter parker's cheesy dancing?! Walking down the street, thinking he's a pimp? Hes meant to be a bit of an idiot. THATS THE POINT.<br/><br/>Other people have said there's too many rivals for spider-man. I'll agree that there maybe is too many. But the length of the film makes up for it. All the characters had a background, were seen being transformed and had their part in the story. So i do not agree with 'the characters had no depth, no chance to evolve'. Thats bull.<br/><br/>And the film is not on any accounts, a chick flick. The people who have commented this, have said they liked the first ones. If this is a chick flick, then so are they. Yeah, Peter and MJ, Harry and MJ, Peter and MJ but thats half of the story.<br/><br/>I loved the film as much as the first and second. If you've not seen it, i'd say go. It's been proved to not be to everyones taste, but thats a conclusion to make for yourself. If you're still unsure whether to go see it, bear in mind i am going to see it AGAIN and will no doubt buy it on DVD the first day it comes out. Don't listen to the people running it down.

"cyk0497","5","2","4","6 May 2007"," Time to quit before it is too late
","First of all, I'm a big fan of the Spiderman series and have been eagerly anticipating this film. With the first film, I was awed by the fact that the team could actually pull off a realistic movie. The second film had a great story and some amazing action. But this third installment fell very flat in my opinion given the expectations. The story was weak, as many have said -- too many stories were packed in. The action was few and far in between. The whole Symbiote / Venom story line was severely short-changed. The entire movie could / should have been based on this story line, which would have been far superior. Overall, I think that it is time for Raimi's saga to end. This is turning into Batman 1,2,and 3. The only way another Spiderman should be made is if the writer/directors are changed, as in Batman Begins. Raimi is getting too campy / corny / cheesy / kiddie to bear. The Spiderman series needs to be brought to a new and higher level, and only someone new can do it. This is coming from a Spiderman fan who obviously loved what Batman begins did for that series. However, for non spider-man lovers, I think you will find this movie to be fun to watch but with plenty of slow and boring moments, far too many for a spider man film."
"mariosakrivos","5","2","4","6 May 2007"," lost opportunity
","There are those kind of movies that you are bound to like,for whatever reason.SM3 was one of those movies for me.Even when last year I saw a sneak peak of the black suit and I thought it was a pity the original wasn't used.When I read the plot and found many key elements were changed.I thought to myself ""don't be a fan boy,just enjoy this"".Guess because I am a fan boy. Then there was the promising trailer,Raimi's passionate interviews(a fan himself) and the fact that I enjoyed the last two films immensely.Still (you can see it coming by now) I was indeed disappointed. Many of the first films' virtues are present as are some of their weaknesses.But while the former don't make the same impression the latter seem to be more tiring the third time around. Peter and MJ are constantly whining(unlike their comic counterparts)and new characters like sandman(who has a great beginning),Brock/Venom and Gwen, while they have rich history and potential are barely scratched(The use of Venom was ""enforced"" by the producers and Raimi having grown in the '60s/'70s was not familiar with the character).Also, the same plot twists are used again and the feeling of deja -vu is inevitable. The film greatly suffers by Raimi's struggle to fit too many plots and characters in the same movie and actually resolve everything before the end.After all, the multiple villain theme didn't work wonders on the Batman either.Each one of the sub-plots could easily support a movie on its own and give room to the characters to breathe.And why he infused the supposedly darkest chapter with such ridiculous light heartetness is a mystery. As I said though this is not a film without virtues.Raimi is still a magician with the camera and that shows at the action sequences that are manier than ever before.His love for the characters is a given so you get the feeling of an actual sequence unlike many similar films where everything is quite stale or radically changed.His talent also shows from the fact that New York is a co-star of this film (like before). Some will say it's a great film.Some will say it's the worst.I believe it was indeed a lost opportunity but if you manage to compromise with this fact you will actually have a good time.From a film like this though you expect a bit more.Like using the original black costume-(half)kidding..."

","As we all know the first two Spider-Man's are magnificent, so of course we all anxiously await the next chapter in the Peter Parker/Spider-Man film.<br/><br/>Now...in this film we see - for the first time - Spidey getting the s**t getting beat out of him, which is a daring move, and a wonderful one. It makes Spider-Man seem more human, and more interesting to see. Also we see a different side to the confident Mary Jane, who is struggling with her career after she is littered with unfriendly reviews and is replaced on the show. Harry is having his own troubles, thanks to a fight he had with Peter as the new Goblin, Harry suffers from amnesia and can't remember his hatred for Spider-Man/Peter or his father..blah blah. <br/><br/>Enter Flint Marko. He escapes from prison to help his dying daughter. There is an emotional scene between him and his either estranged (thanks to prison) or divorced wife where the daughter comes out and gives something to her dad. Moving on...Flint casually walks through the street and is spotted by the police, he runs they pursue. Flint climbs a fence and gets stuck in a machine that makes him Sandman. Then realizing his new powers Flint wreaks havoc on the city trying to steal money to help pay his daughters medical bills so she can get better. Enter Spidey Sandman face off. Though Sandman doesn't get any of the money, Spidey is obviously defeated.<br/><br/>Enter Gwen Stacy. Although she is a genuine love interest of Peter's in the comic books (and dies in the comic books) she is more of a sloppy way for Peter to make MJ mad (unintentionally of course).<br/><br/>Enter Eddie Brock. He's the new photographer at the Daily Bugle, so he and Peter become rivals from the get go. He's dating Gwen - until she dumps him and moves on with Peter - But things really start to get interesting with Brock's character when he photo-shops a picture of Spider-Man to make him look like a criminal -Peter outs him & Brock is fired from the paper- Thus begins Eddie's supreme hatred for Peter. but when Brock becomes attached to the symboite that was previously attached to Spider-Man's costume he becomes Venom.<br/><br/>The finally fight is superbly done. But every now and then there are those corny lines, and typical Peter Parker moments where he makes a complete fool of himself.<br/><br/>My only problems with the movie was that WAY TOO MANY TEARS ARE SHED!!! I mean come on! Man up Peter! Stop crying! MJ hardly shed a tear and her life was in the s**t hole in this movie! Harry even had more of a reason to cry, and he didn't! Also Eddie Brock/Venom could have been toned down/up. We saw more of the spunky wanna-be hotshot photographer than of the malicious Venom. <br/><br/>Overall see the movie. It may disappoint some, but will entertain the many."

","Went to see this last night, initial thought exiting the theatre was- That was an exciting, entertaining and impressive 2 hour cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Yes, there were flaws, some of which are slightly annoying, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it was a fitting 3rd movie to end the Trilogy(?)<br/><br/>The Negatives- <br/><br/>1/ The movie was FAR too busy, too many villains to deal with (especially since we are getting the bad guy's back story's). Along with the villains we have the ""dark"" side of Spider-man and the MJ, Gwen, Harry and Peter love triangle/square and the rise and fall of Brock all to deal with.<br/><br/>2/ Far too many coincidences for my liking, the meteor falling that close to MJ and Peter, Sandman falling into some particle accelerator, Gwen's floor being demolished by the crane etc etc.........(its a comic-book movie though I suppose) <br/><br/>3/ Too many fight scenes.<br/><br/>4/ The Gwen character, not a required element that the movie needed.<br/><br/>5/ Sandman turning out to be Uncle Ben's killer, another story strand that was not required and just made the movie even harder to come together.<br/><br/>The Positives- <br/><br/>1/ The effects are OUT-STANDING.<br/><br/>2/ The fight scenes are spectacular. (too many though).<br/><br/>3/ Acting, considering this is a comic-book/event movie the acting was top-drawer, especially from Tobey.<br/><br/>4/ The fun factor, Bruce Campbell and J. K. Simmons are FANTASTICALLY funny. As is the ""dark"" Peter Parker.<br/><br/>5/ The MJ/Peter love story, I genuinely felt sorry for the both of them and willed them to sort everything out. Kirsten performance was subdued but still impressive.<br/><br/>6/ The Excitement factor, from the starting credits to the end credits this was none stop,yes the film was far too busy, but at least thanks to that the movie is extremely exciting throughout.<br/><br/>7/ The ""dark"" Spider-man and Peter Parker. I believe the Sam (Raimi) could have dropped the whole Sandman character from this episode and introduced the black entity/""tormented"" Spider-man earlier which in turn would have given Venon/Brock some much needed extra screen time. But the ""dark"" suited Spider-man was an impressive part of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was excellent, yes as I stated the film was far from immune to serious flaws, but I can genuinely say that I came out the theatre satisfied I had seen a GREAT Spider-man movie! 9/10- A great effort, and a high quality event/comic-book movie. Fingers crossed we get a 4th movie with the same cast involved, unlikely(?). Time will soon tell. This is very much worth the entry cost, just for the spectacle of it all!"
"flicklover","6","2","4","5 May 2007"," The curse of the 3rd installment!!!!
","I have always thought that the 3red part of any movie trilogy come off as a near miss or a complete failure. There are many examples of this. Alien 3, Lethal Weapon 3, even Return of the Jedi is for me the weakest film in the 1st Star Wars trilogy. Spider-Man 3 is no exception. It is in no way a complete failure, but is the weakest of the Spider-Man films. It has been reported that it is the most expensive film of all time, and there lies the problem. I think that Sam Raimi and company had so much money and pressure to deliver a home run on this film that they packed the movie with way to much stuff. There are three villains this time, Sandman, Venom, and The Green Goblin. That is one too many, the movie lacks the focus of the first two. It's all over the place. There is the inner conflicts that Peter Parker deals with, his relationship with Mary Jane, it all was dealt with much better in the other 2 films. The disadvantage with here is that the audience is already so familiar with these characters that there isn't anything really new, so the conflicts between them are not as compelling.<br/><br/>Yes, the FX are impressive, but they are nothing that we haven't seen before. The action is well done, but without the strong story it just doesn't involve me more because the CGI cost so much. Sam Raimi balanced all the elements of a big budget summer movie to near perfection in Spider-man 2, the FX and action were there, but the story is what made it a great movie. Here he was given as many toys as he wanted and it almost got completely away from him.<br/><br/>It is entertaining, but I heard almost every person that was walking out the theater say that Spider-Man 2 was much better.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"MidnightWarrior","8","2","4","5 May 2007"," Go see it!
","As a word of caution, you must be open minded when you watch this film. Yes, Venom is in the film. BUT you'll have to remember, story wise, the film strays away from the source material as well as the cartoon show. So if you're a die-hard venom fan (I am) there's a good chance that you're going to be disappointed. Heavily disappointed.<br/><br/>The appearance of Venom is fantastic. The CGI is great and the character looks so cool. My only gripes are that Venom didn't have his slobbering tongue (how could they forget that?!), menacing voice (still Grace's gentle voice) and didn't refer to himself as ""we"" or ""us"". Alas, it was nice to see him on film... well, whatever few glimpses of him we received.<br/><br/>Moving along, the story is entertaining, the characters are fresh and different and the whole feel of the story is one of progression. There are some obvious deviations in this film, as compared to the first two series. While they are interesting, to say the least, they are too early, too risqué and out of the context of this film. I'm surprised they made the final cut. Nevertheless though, they are pretty funny.<br/><br/>If you can sort out through these deviations and the general lack of Venom, the story in itself is quite interesting. I won't bore you with a rehash of the plot, but will say that it's a nice update in the Spiderman films. The regular cast and crew do an amazing job (better than the first two films) as do the new additions, especially Bryce Dallas Howard. What a FOX (she looks great as a blonde)! **SPOILER** Maybe James Franco can come back in flashbacks as Uncle and William Defoe have. And Brock? Well, I doubt this is the last we've seen of him.<br/><br/>**END SPOILER** I should hope that they don't stop at this one. Forgive the Crew and encourage Marvel/Sony to make another one with Maguire, Dunst, Howard, Aunt May, Conners, Brock, JJ and all the other familiar characters. I leave you with the following quote: ""We've all done terrible things to each other, but we have to forgive each other. Or everything we ever were will mean nothing."" Incidentally, that quote is not in the film, but is in the trailers. It's good advice though. And considering the choices made in this film and the way the majority of the fan base has responded to the film, I'll say it's good to take MJ's advice. Forgive the cast and crew."
"tyuirgal","8","2","4","5 May 2007"," The End puts it all together
","Like X-men 3, Spiderman 3 suffers from having too many characters. There are just too many good, complex heroes and villains from the Marvel Universe to cram into two and a half hours of film. Gwen Stacy was hardly given the time she was due and I doubt anyone will remember Dr. Curt Connors (Peter's science teacher, who also turns into a villain in the comics). Sandman hardly gets enough time either, but at least we end up feeling sympathetic to the guy in the end (although that's about all he gets). But those characters that Raimi is able to bring to life certainly pick up the slack. Kirsten Dunst portrays a very deeply hurt Mary Jane very well, James Franco's New Goblin/Harry Osborn is as torn as ever (but surprised me in the end), and Tobey Maguire still is lovable in a nerdy way as he portrays Peter/Spidey. The ending made up for all the lost opportunities Raimi had during the film. Walking out of the theater, I felt my five dollar matinée fee was well spent."

","What a nice way to kick off the summer movie season! Tobey McGuire returns in his SpiderMan role and does a good job evolving the character into something a bit richer that everyday people can identify with. The nerdy guy still pining for the pretty girl...almost losing her to the attractive guy - AGAIN - and winning her again in the end....ahhh - makes your heart feel good, don't it? :-) True, Mary Jane could have been played by any pretty girl - but its Peter Parker, that makes you want to stick with the relationship. The interesting part is that this movie pits Spidey against FOUR villains - Sandman, Hobgoblin, Venom and in a way - himself - as the evil Spidey. I won't tell any more than this as I hate to be a plot spoiler but trust me - it makes for an exciting 2 and a half hours of super hero antics. If you are a MARVEL comics fan, this strays a bit from the true comic genre, but its still very entertaining. Four thumbs up....two of mine and two of my husbands. One of the better Spidey's in the franchise yet."
"ben-916","8","2","4","5 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 is TWO movies!
","Spiderman 3 is actually two movies.<br/><br/>The first involves The tale of the heir of Green Goblin and the origins of Sandman. This film is dark, powerful, a tragedy and deals with heavy emotional issues such as friendship and betrayal. It is the Director's movie essentially, and it has integrity. There are some scenes missing which would have helped the continuity of this film - however, I am hoping that these will be in the Director's cut - and I sincerely hope that there is a Director's cut of BOTH films.<br/><br/>The second film is very much the Producer's film - or rather it is the way that the Director has approached it. It is a hilarious comedy, a satire - almost a parody of the genre, in which many references are made to other superhero movie franchises that went downhill because of bad executive decisions. It references the original Batman TV series that went from bad to worse, the third series ending up with sets that consisted of door frames in a blank studio (the web message in the sky for spiderman, and the absurd 'trap' both references to the TV series - in fact in the third series, the Batman TV show started taking the mickey out of these devices as well).<br/><br/>There is a reference to the legacy Batman movies, in the Belltower scene, which is deliberately clumsily constructed - and a reference to the fact that this franchise was buried, ending with Clooney's opposition falling over to the comedy sound of swanee whistles. One sees a vast tower, yet a man standing at the bottom manages to recognise Parker at the top...a lovely touch of absurdity. There is another reference to Daredevil...the franchise that went down the sad path of pursuing Elektra as a spin off. It is the way that the Director pokes gentle but sarcastic fun at the Producer that makes this so funny - the overly long edit of the doors plastered with Closing Down - Sale signs - a sly reference to the fact that these franchises 'close down' when 'sales' are deemed the factor of importance. The brilliant way that Parker's 'bad side' in this movie is at a peak when the worst thing he can do is order more milk and cookies shows us that the Director has been told to 'appeal to the youngsters.' <br/><br/>The culmination of his 'badness' is portrayed in the fact that he plays a piano solo and dances with the object of Mary Jane's jealous suspicion - hilariously overdone performances, and a parody of the short single liners that bad comic book movies are littered with. An interesting treatment - Venom clearly is the enemy of choice for a younger generation - and the director (gleefully) only lets the character exist for a few short moments on screen. The youngness of the comic book audience is clearly represented - with tongue in cheek dialogue: ""Awesome. Wicked Cool!"" - and hilariously in the Emo style haircut and eyeliner that Parker sports when he is 'the bad Parker'. The haircut alone generated a laugh in the theatre I watched the film in.<br/><br/>Stan's apologetic cameo (there was no reason to it at all - it was a poke at the increasing irrelevance of the cameo role, and it) says it all: ""Sometimes ONE man is enough to make a difference"" - I think he was referring to the number of baddies in the film... ""enough said.""<br/><br/>The sad thing is that these two movies are stuffed into the same package and have to run simultaneously - the real battle here is not between Spidey and Green Goblin, the Symbiote, Venom or Sandman - no, the battle is between the producer and the director, and whilst the producer wins in terms of it being the Symbiote that has been the enduring marketing image - the director wins in the end because he makes two movies and gets to place a serious film and a comedic parody movie together to highlight and contrast the different attitudes if the artistic versus the money makers of the film industry.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't many will grasp how brilliant this film actually is unless they have a good knowledge of the film and comic book industry, and view the film as two separate entities. Let's wait for the Director's cut and see if he not only has balls, but manages to cut the balls off the Producer once and for all..."

That's why I was so shocked to find so many negative reviews this morning. Really really shocked. I expected there to be the typical haters and such, but I really could find very very little to criticize(ie dancing in the streets??), and the rest of the movie really cancelled that out. I realize that everyone is permitted there own opinion, but I suggest you go see it for yourself. Everyone I heard really enjoyed it, which is why I was just so stunned with all the negative reviews I've seen scince just this morning.<br/><br/>The only thing I can see that anyone would criticize is maybe that the younger guys might not enjoy it as much because there is a lot more emotion and love scenes and fewer action scenes. All the actors were brilliant, but I really have to give props to James Franco, his acting has much improved from the first two.<br/><br/>It was very interesting to see an evil side of Peter Parker. After all, there's only so much perfect hero the world can stand. Sandman and Venom were well-cast, but the door was let open to a number four. Personally I hope they stop now, leave the series on a high note.<br/><br/>At points the CGI was laughable, but the characters brought out so much more that you really didn't care too much. there was also a kickass shot of Spidey leaping into the final battle in front of an American flag, reminding so my people why Spiderman is such a unique comic book hero-he lives in the real world, facing the same demons that you and I face, just on a much larger and more challenging scale.<br/><br/>And in case you were wondering, I was really not a big Spider Man fan until this film. The first two were enjoyable, but just did not seem to have that extra bit. This one really had it. Please go see this movie and judge for yourself, I did not think it deservedso many bad reviews."
"supercygnus","6","2","4","5 May 2007"," The No Win Scenario
","The first in the series was groundbreaking. The original, while fresh and exciting was not without it's flaws. With all of it's back story and build-up we were left with only the beginning, the first chapter in adventures yet to come and thus not as inviting to multiple viewings. A strong, charming film and a worthy realization of Spidey on the big screen, but it still, like Peter Parker himself, certainly had room to grow and mature. Enter Spider-Man 2. Hilarious, exciting, heartbreaking and sometimes all at once (look no further than the tour-de-force finale) it is not only a stellar ""superhero"" flick but a well crafted, emotionally powerful and sincere film of any genre. It had raised the bar for blockbusters across the board. Now comes Spider-Man 3. With word of a mammoth budget and incredibly high fan expectation, meeting status quo will and has been interpreted by many as failure. Public perception seems to be as of this writing, that the film is not up to snuff of the previous 2, however in truth it is as good in different ways than it's predecessors, just not better. This is a no win scenario as it no longer has the benefit of first time novelty and must raise the stakes across the board to not only deal with it's own track record, but several franchises that have become more mature and complex in their own right (Batman Begins, Superman Returns and even non-superhero pulled from comic epics like 300 and Sin City). So the film piles on even more battles, more set pieces with outcomes determining bigger stakes and even bigger sacrifices. As a whole it is quite a wonder to see how it all gels in the end and makes sense because there is a lot going on here. Unfortunately, fans and critics (especially critics) are often cynical with ongoing installments of any series, and here the most vocal and easily annoyed are given some legitimate ammunition. 1) There is far too much emphasis in getting characters out of their masks and reminding us of the actor's abilities and not realizing the characters themselves. Voices are rarely altered (this vocal oversight is most noticeably a problem with Venom) and characters rarely wear the full costumes and masks they have been celebrated and associated with on page for decades. It seems quite obvious the studio paid for names, and thusly want bang for the buck. So we not only get a number of big ""thespian"" moments of tears, songs and dance (literally) to satisfy actor needs to ""showcase"" but we also get Spidey to often without a mask, Goblin 2 who rarely uses the protective mask that you would assume he needs to be safe during his acrobatic daring do and a constant facial reminder of who exactly is playing Venom (and at times in poorly chosen moments which detract from menace). The viewer is often ""taken"" out of the film. 2)Not enough forward progression. Some loose ends are tied, but the film leaves many still dangling and some rather large ones open altogether! While there is redemption, on the whole there is a feeling that this is an ""installment"" rather than true closure. That being said, anyone who tells you the money isn't on the screen must have been watching a different film. From the quiet almost poetic creation of the Sandman as he forms human shape; to the many brawls throughout the film, leading up to the juggernaut finale, you get your CGI money's worth, even if you do loose a little of the humanity in all of the many computer pixels buzzing around. The human moments are still the franchise's strongest points and there's more drama here than a full night of 1980's prime time soap opera. The whole endeavor may be a victim of it's own excess, but only the truly jaded and cynical viewer wont appreciate the tapestry of spectacle and emotion woven by director Sam Raimi and Comapny for what is still a Summer blockbuster entertainment that aims to be more than a clichéd collection of one liners and eye candy. It has a lot to live up and to, and sometimes fails but it remains a worthy successor in truly unique escapist franchise. 'Nuff said."
"dark_lunar_wolf","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," Great film but has it's flaws.
","I got to see Spider-Man 3 today. Now first off I loved Spider-Man 1+2 but did I love Spider-Man 3? Yes! Here are my thoughts: Good points.<br/><br/>Everything with Harry and Peter was outstanding. These two had great chemistry and had amazing fight scenes.<br/><br/>Sandman was surprise and was great character. The Sandman transformation was mind blowing he had an interesting story thats pulls you into the film.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell scene was hilarious. This has to be the best Campbell appearance in the Spider-Man series yet! Campbell is God! Topher Grace was good in the role! Bad points Venom..........Holy crap he was a joke! What was the point? We see like 10 Min's of Venom and 3/4 of is with Venom's face exposed. There is no ''WE ARE VENON''. Raimi didn't do anything to change or enhance Topher's voice when he was Venom. Oh and Venoms death was lame! Why would Eddie want to kill Peter anyway? He really didn't do anything bad to Eddie for him to be blood trusty murderer! Gwen Stacy, no real point of her.<br/><br/>In the middle of the movie it slows down bringing in issues from last two movies. We saw the last two movies, let the story move forward already.<br/><br/>Peter dancing............................I want a darker ego driven Peter! Harry's butler. You think the Butler would have told Harry about his own dad being killed by his own glider in the first place.<br/><br/>SM3 is worth seeing. It is my fav movie of 2007 so far. The bad sides don't overshadow the good ones for me!"
"JosephLee411","Null","2","4","4 May 2007"," Fails to live up to expectations but still very entertaining
","Spider-Man 3(2007)<br/><br/>Starring: Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson James Franco as Harry Osborn/The New Goblin Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman<br/><br/>Plot: In a complete reversal of the beginning of Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker's life is looking up! He finally has Mary Jane, Spider-Man is loved by the city of New York, and he's not doing too bad with his money problems. All that is ready to change, however, when a mysterious symbiote from space attaches itself to him. This gives him a new black suit, and a new outlook on life. Suddenly it enhances his darker qualities and he has to find a way to get rid of it. It doesn't help matters when there are three guys hunting for him: His best friend Harry, The Sandman, and later on, Venom.<br/><br/>It's been three long years since I've last been on an adventure with Spider-Man. Needless to say, the wait has been long and the excitement was at a fever pitch as I sat down to a midnight showing ready to finally see Spider-Man again. Not just that, but Venom! Everyone loves Venom and to see him on the screen hopefully would be a worthwhile experience. Was it?<br/><br/>I'll start on this with the flaws first, to get them out of the way. Raimi seems to have lost a step since Spider-Man 2. Not that I blame him, because after releasing a film that good, I can see how it would be hard to please the audience that well again. He tried to do this by over-filling the movie with a multitude of plots and villains and in the end it seems kind of crowded. The new villains aren't nearly as fleshed out as previously because there simply wasn't time, so caring about them is a little harder than last time.<br/><br/>This movie also has the disadvantage of some silliness. There are some lines, and some moments in the movie where I'm not quite sure what they were trying to accomplish. Why does Mary Jane sing? Why is Peter, under the influence of the suit or not, dancing around like a fool? It just seemed unnecessary and I didn't see the point of it at all. The comedy in the first two was intentional but kept to a minimum(Jameson, etc) but here it felt like they were trying too hard to keep the comedy in what should have been a darker movie.<br/><br/>When this movie does grasp it's dark roots, it works. Peter Parker, the jerk, is completely what he needed to be and Tobey pulls off a great job in making him that way. The subtle things like smashing Brock's camera or even the bigger things like attacking Harry do a much better job than some odd dance number thrown in. It's obvious they chose this story for the ""Battle Within"" subplot and they pull it off here, especially because Tobey is a credible actor and does what is needed and more.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are clearly comfortable in their roles and so they have no more effort to play them, but they still do a good job. JK Simmons returns again and he's always welcome(it's all about that scene with marketing the Bugle), and Bruce Campbell(making his third cameo in a completely unrelated role) is hilarious too. Thomas Haden Church was limited as The Sandman, but because of his abilities he is able to create sympathy(almost out of spite, it seemed) and Topher Grace plays Eddie Brock, and his alter-ego Venom very well(in spite of limited screen-time).<br/><br/>While I am mad that Venom isn't on nearly as much as I would like, he still looks great and Topher made him work. I think we'll see him again, in Spider-Man 4(And if you paid attention, you'd understand why). I love the fact they kept in certain aspects to the character, like his weakness, and the fact that he doesn't trigger Peter's Spider-Sense, as well as his origin.<br/><br/>The special effects and action sequences were good here again, including a battle royale at a construction site that just takes the cake. You know where the budget went? That final battle. There are so many hard shots and effects there that I can't imagine how much work went into it. Any problems that I had with the movie melted away as that last scene made it worth sitting through silly dancing and singing.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man 3 may be the weakest of the series, but that does not mean it was a bad movie. It was still worthwhile, the action was great and I very much enjoyed myself. BRING ON SPIDER-MAN 4!<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 of *****"
"simpsjd","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," Round 3
","Summer is finally here, no I do not mean boat races and the fifth of May, I mean MIDNIGHT MOVIES and what an amazing kick-off! Spider-Man 3 is far and away the best feature in the franchise, dare is say thus far? Spidey-fans will love all the subtle nuances, of course Stan Lee, however this film gives to the Sam Raimi fans as well. In addition the support cast is spectacular J.K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell and even Dylan Baker add to the story telling giving more depth and play-ability to the adventure. A touch on the kind side in places I believe that is one of the changes that breathes life into this film and helps progress, it also gives us true development which was clearly lacking in Spider-Man 2 The visual effects absolutely steal the show, not just the Venom effects that are stunning, but the Sandman visuals are truly inspired. We have seen sand move before, this time we get to see it move with style, grace and economy of motion. The one drawback to this film is that for some reason Spider-Man, Venom, and Sandman all think we want to see their faces  and honestly, I do not. The title of the film is Spider-Man 3 not Tobey Maguire in a Spider-Man costume 3 . Moreover, really who cares that Topher Grace is Venom, let the symbiote take him over and let us think no more of that 70's show So go and enjoy this film just remember that every time you see Toby's face Stan Lee has to be cringing with the rest of us."
"nickatropolis","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," A Treat for any Spidey-Fan!
","Although not without its problems, Spiderman 3 has everything a true Spidey fan will want and more.<br/><br/>The action sequences are not only amazing, they will keep you staring at the screen unblinkingly the entire time. Having grown up with Spiderman action figures and trying to imagine the best possible fight scenes and scenarios for my favorite superhero, I was thoroughly impressed with the scope and creativity brought to every single fight sequence. Not to mention the fact that the film completely captures the inherent humor in people fighting in mid-air: The scene with Harry Osborne fighting Peter Parker towards the beginning of the film is by far the best, and it has slapstick comedy throughout that will keep even the most easily-distracted human beings(like myself) entertained.<br/><br/>The problems arise when you take the sheer scope of the film: two and a half new villains (Sandman, Venom, and the half being the already-vengeful Harry) and Peter's complex inner struggle between vengeance and righteousness, and cram all of this into just two and a half hours. As soon as all the parts of the epic storyline are finally introduced and before they even have a chance to fully develop, the whole movie takes a complete nosedive in what seems to be a clumsy effort to finish the film on time. This humble observer's opinion is that a cliffhanger ending with the promise of a fourth movie (a la ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"") would have been justly warranted and would have left a much more satisfied general public. Instead, the hasty rap-up of the movie left many in my theater displeased. But then again, now the Spidey-loving public will have a conversation topic that will certainly last a long time to come, and isn't that worth the eight bucks right there? Overall, Spidey-fans will get everything they came for and much more: Huge action, great conflict, mind-boggling special effects, incredible spills and chills, and the promise of a bright future for Spiderman!"
"jruth88","9","2","4","4 May 2007"," The movie I was looking forward to most this year comes as a bit of a disappointment, but still entertaining.
","Spider-Man 3 was the movie I was looking forward to most out of 2007. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed by Raimi's third venture into the world of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The movie starts out just as thrilling as the previous, with all the action, drama, and even laughs that the first two had. But then about halfway into the movie I found myself repeatedly thinking ""Come on, this is ridiculous."" But it's not the fact that Spider-Man is being attacked by a man made of sand or because a black goo is following him around and has attached itself to him. I actually found those charmingly interesting, though unrealistic they certainly didn't take away from the fun and thrills of the movie. What caused the movie to seem so silly to me was the dialog. There were just too many instances to name in which the dialog ruined a perfectly good scene for me, and too many times where the theater began to laugh at a cheesy line in the middle of an emotional scene. And the infamous ""emo Pete"" segment in which Peter had darker hair that was combed over his eyes as he danced down the street was far too silly.<br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the movie was excellent, as long as you can handle a few corny lines sprinkled throughout. The action sequences are all I expected from them and more. The New Goblin was a great character and was much more a formidable opponent than one would expect. And as you may have heard time and time again Sandman and Venom look excellent. My favorite scene in the movie was the legendary bell tower scene which was truly epic. Bruce Campbell's role as the Maitre D' of the French restaurant managed to be hilarious, without being over the top.<br/><br/>I've been anticipating Spider-Man 3 for a long time and having tickets to the midnight showing to it was like a dream to me. That being said, the movie didn't live up to the expectations I had for it, which may be because I over-hyped it. Spider-Man 3 has everything the first two have but far too many attempts at comic relief which will make the true Spider-Man fan cringe at some points. Either way, you should enjoy this movie, even if the dialog is corny."
"tmiller97","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," really good.
","Some people will trash this movie because they think its the ""cool"" thing to do.<br/><br/>The movie was good. If you liked the other 2 you WILL like this movie. The actions scenes were fantastic, the story was good and more importantly it followed the comic's.<br/><br/>The c.g.i is much better than the first.<br/><br/>In the first one at the worlds day fair when spiderman and the green goblin were fighting it was obviously 2 guys in suits. In this day and age when we have lord of the rings, that's not gonna do. Their is none of that in this picture. <br/><br/>Howard Stern put it best, ""It is the best one so far""<br/><br/>Gusse what is not opsit day and your 2 cents does not matter."
"Chanchai","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3's web of plots only loosely captures our hearts this time...
","Spider-Man 3 goes for more than it can handle. The movie shuffles through a good number of potentially great stories, but they do fall thin. Don't get me wrong, its story is still a great story. But the storytelling suffers from trying to condense everything efficiently.<br/><br/>I would not be surprised if Sam Raimi eventually releases a warranted ""Extended Cut"" of Spider-Man 3. This movie ran for 2.5 hours, but I feel it's destined to be told in at least 3 hours and with more polish.<br/><br/>Gone is the focus and some would say ""heart"" that strongly resonated in Spider-Man 2. We felt the aches, pains, and rewards that Peter Parker felt in that film. Spider-Man 3 is a web of stories that do interlock with Peter realizing that he has much growing up to do and he has yet to learn that beyond sympathy there is empathy.<br/><br/>But it is hard to have empathy for the cast in this film because we are getting condensed glimpses of their experiences (which all do interlock with themes of Peter's growth as an individual). Spider-Man 3 attempts to sum up the inner struggle of its many characters in very small doses of tiny examples. The result is that we barely get to experience these characters. We know how they feel and we also know what we are supposed to feel. We have sympathy for these characters. However, we don't actually feel through these characters. There's just no room for empathy when all we get are small examples that only allow us to sympathize for them. <br/><br/>The movie just doesn't show us the empathy that Peter Parker must learn himself in this movie. If anything, the film makes the same mistake Peter himself makes when he just pays lip service out of sympathy.<br/><br/>This is a good thing for the sorts of audience that yell out ""I get it already,"" but it loses the emotional impact that brought so much respect to Spider-Man 2. Most people felt for Spider-Man 2. Many people will merely see Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>The cast gives a good overall performance. Some of it is risky such as seeing how far Maguire can portray a darker Peter Parker in this film, but it's set up so well that when we see it, it's not overacting, it's intentional corniness. Tobey does a fine job, but a team effort was needed to make it work. Dunst has some powerful moments in this film, but they are scattered about far enough apart that we're merely getting reminded of it now and then. I would comment on the rest of the cast, but their performances were shuffled all over the movie. Odd as it may sound, but Bruce Campbell probably gives the most memorable performance. And it's very Bruce Campbell. Take that as you will.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman might be consulting on this film, but his direct role is definitely missing. The score of Spider-Man 3 is fine, but it doesn't narrate the story nearly as well as the score for Spider-Man 2. There are great pieces though and it is amazing how well various Spider-Man themes from the past can be rewritten into different genres. I think the Spider-Man 3 score makes a good collection of music, but it doesn't narrate this story very well. It's almost all highlights.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fun and longer than your average action sequences. Furthermore, while there are a lot of CG based fight scenes, there are a lot of actor/stuntman fights as well. The final ""spectacular"" action sequence is an entire roller coaster ride in itself, but the atmosphere was a bit much for me (you'll have to see the movie but I felt like I was literally watching a roller coaster ride at a theme park, flags and all). Its intention is that it's a ""spectacle within a spectacle."" I'm trying hard not to give spoilers here.<br/><br/>It should be noted that there are a lot of hilarious and entertaining moments in Spider-Man 3. They are there and they pretty much deliver. That's why I give this film an 8, it meets a lot of requirements.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 has a lot of substance too... but we can only get a shallow glimpse of it. If Sam Raimi decides to put out an extended version of the film, I am all for it. But for what it is, it's good entertainment and it's not an entire sell-out by Raimi. However, compromises were definitely made."
"danjezeski","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," Review for Spider-Man 3 Not a Spoiler!
","Just saw Spider-Man 3. Overall I did like the movie because I am a huge Spider-Man fan; I mean I have him tattooed on my arm for heck's sake! They did try to cram too much into the film and tie up all of the loose ends. Such a shame. I think this was done partly if not wholly on the fact that the stars of the movie were only signed on for the 3 films.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Harry Osborne/New Goblin, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marco/Sandman were absolutely incredible. Sure the overconfident ""Dark Spider-Man"" was a little over the top but overall the performances of them were great and they did a spectacular job. I was especially impressed with Thomas Haden Church's performance. He really sold the piece, and man was he ripped; he really bulked up for the film. <br/><br/>As for Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom.....what can I say but absolutely pathetic. He did not seem to bulk up at all. It has always been known that Eddie Brock was supposed to have worked out constantly and had the strength equivalent to an Olympic weight lifter. The Venom just amplified the body's natural strengths. Venom was always supposed to be bigger and stronger then Spider-Man but just not as smart. Venom looked absolutely scrawny. And another thing...the Venom is also supposed to be able to change the appearance of the wearer so they didn't even need to wear street clothes, just think it and it would change its molecules to appear as clothes and provide the necessary pockets and whatnot. <br/><br/>The Venom character was way too rushed, and was introduced all wrong. They should have introduced him using an already introduced character, John Jameson on a mission in space exploring a meteorite and the Venom sneaks on board the ship, the ship malfunctions on re-entry, and crashes into the river with Spider-Man coming by to save the survivors and the Venom sneaks onto Spider-Man as he is in the water. That would have been a whole heck of a lot better then just a random meteorite crashing to earth and sneaking back to Parkers apartment on the back of his scooter. <br/><br/>Bruce Campbell's role as the restaurant employee was absolutely hilarious by the way, I'm glad he was worked into the film. Plus they got Stan Lee into the film and he got to say his signature ""Nuff Said"" line! That rocked! <br/><br/>Overall I would have to say that this is my least favorite Spider-Man film for storyline, but favorite for action/fight sequence. The Spider-Man/New Goblin fight was incredible! I give this Movie 8 out of 10 Stars."
"Roger_Sterling","7","2","4","4 May 2007"," Very good, but at the same time, disappointing (Spoiler free review).
","I feel conflicted. A great movie, no doubt, but it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Even though Danny Elfman was absent this time around, the music was still top notch, and so were the special effects. This movie is definitely a must for next year's best special fx Oscar.<br/><br/>Acting: Very good. Kirsten Dunst gives a surprisingly good performance, Tobey Maguire delivers again, James Franco steps it up a notch. and newcomers Topher Grace and Thomas Haden Church do quite well.<br/><br/>Villains: I was never a fan of Sandman, until now. Thomas Haden Church gave a great performance, and the special effects (especially during the ""birth"" of Sandman) were stunning. New Goblin: Hardly a villain, only for an early part of the movie. And the villain that drew me, and I'm sure MANY others to the movie, Venom. He gets a decent amount of screen time, but not as much as you'd want him to get.<br/><br/>Now, the bad: Even though it's the longest of the three, the movie still feels a little too rushed, with the 2 love triangles, the story of Sandman, the symbiote, and Harry's story. It should have been longer, or they could have saved some for Spider-Man 4.<br/><br/>8/10. Some missed potential, but ultimately satisfying."
"scottiejd2000","8","2","4","4 May 2007"," Enjoyable but flawed
","The long awaited third Spider-Man film is finally here and reactions to it will be mixed. As a life long Spider-Man fan, I loved the first two movies and enjoyed this too but multiple flaws almost detracted from the movie as a whole. Sam Raimi chose to make a movie which was in excess of two hours long. I have no issue with this but feel as though twenty minutes was wasted on ridiculous scenes and pointless sub-plots, this time would be better served to the character development of Venom (marvellously portrayed by the talented and versatile Topher Grace). The twenty minutes I am referring to are in various pieces - the ridiculous and painful jazz bar dance, the agonizing introduction of Gwen Stacey (portrayed in this movie as annoying and pointless when in fact a major character in the comic books who was not so annoying - correct me if I am wrong but Peter Parker was in LOVE with Gwen Stacey before the Green Goblin killed her - bad time error and therefore, pointless character in the movie) and the overly obnoxious parade scene. Instead, this time would have been better served developing Venom - the only one of the Spider-Man villains chosen for the trilogy who has no humanity. When Venom finally 'becomes' I thought 'great, now this movie is really gonna get good' and it did - but it was already almost over. There are, however, many sublime moments that outweigh the bad. Breathtaking action scenes top the list, my personal favorite being the joining together of Harry and Peter in the final showdown. Additionally, the emotion of Sandman and Harry Osborn's stories are heartfelt. Many believe the Sandman was a wasted story - I disagree, it was satisfying to close the loop on the death of Ben Parker and heart wrenching to see this man of true heart and petty crime fall so far from good albeit temporary. Humorous in parts and downright cheesy in others, Spider-Man certainly has something for everyone but even the hardcore fans will find themselves rolling their eyes in places (the landing in front of the animated US flag anyone?). James Franco flipped between poor and great acting but failed to be believable in parts. Tobey Maguire was given more corny moves and lines than ever to deal with (though, in-keeping with Spider-Man, there were several great one liners) and Kirsten Dunst does what Kirsten Dunst does but the real entertainment goes to Topher Grace who didn't get nearly enough screen time as the slimy and irritating Eddie Brock and even less as Venom and the always wonderful J.K Simmons who has continued to provide excellent humor throughout. All in all, a flawed yet terrific movie but beware - comic book fans may find the lack of character development a big let down."

","Possible Spoilers After two previous movies, neither of which I was a huge fan of (though SM2 grew on me), I figured the filmmakers would know what worked and what didn't. Thus Spider-Man 3 should and would be amazing..? Wrong.<br/><br/>With a two and a half hour running time, the filmmakers stuffed too much into the film and the pacing was off.<br/><br/>The melodrama and Shakespearean story of Harry Osborn was ridiculous.<br/><br/>The 'Singing in the Rain' sequence in the second film threw off my experience. The filmmakers topped that in this one. It was neither amusing nor necessary.<br/><br/>The action scenes were well done but ran too long and detracted from the overall story, which I felt was lacking.<br/><br/>The script, written by Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi, and Alvin Sargent was relatively light and packed with one-liners for a film that, with its dark and serious nature, I would've expected to take a more serious tone.<br/><br/>Hopefully the filmmakers and Marvel will realize that this franchise has run its course. If they do decide to make another film (which I hope they don't) they will realize what did not work in these last couple films and remedy them.<br/><br/>Again, these are just my opinions on the movie. If you disagree, that's totally fine because these are all just opinions."

Again in 2004, I was not disappointed with S2. I bought special 12:01am midnight tickets to see Spidey 3 tonight before most everyone else. Huge crowds of loyal fans filled three theatres at these sneak shows, and most of us are wondering - um what was that? I will not spend the time ranting about issues or spoilers, just let me say this - you may walk out of the theatre, scratching your head going What were Sam and Tobey thinking? It's not awful, but it is nowhere near as good as the first two. And the possibility of a fourth is in serious jeopardy. But I still love my Peter and his Mary Jane.

","Spider-Man 3 has a lot to offer to fans of the spider. For those of us who grew up reading Spider-Man comic books, this movie is a glimpse into what the cinematic franchise COULD be. The main problem with Spider-Man 3, however, is that while it does stay more true to the comic book series as far as storytelling technique and style, this is also its biggest downfall. Those who haven't been Spidey fans their whole lives will find the movie to be corny, and at times downright trite. But for those who were enthralled by the stories Stan Lee (who makes a rather amusing surprise cameo about a quarter through the movie) told via his comics, you'll find it spellbinding and love every minute of it."
"flasch","7","2","4","2 May 2007"," Not a spectacular Spiderman, but he gets the job done
","This is the good old Spiderman I remember reading many years ago: Peter Parker having trouble with his life, while Spiderman fights the bad guys. There are a number of story lines dealing with Spiderman, with Parker and with a number of other characters, and they all mix well together and builds up to the final scenes of the movie. The three major villains ensures that the melodrama doesn't get too boring, like I think it did in Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>Tobey Mcguire is a bit wooden in Spiderman 3. It's the way he played Spiderman in the previous movies, but it doesn't work very well here. I hate to say it, because he is so good in many other movies, but I think he is one of the weak points in Spiderman 3. The rest of the cast is good, and like many others I liked Bruce Campbells performance very much, though it was brief.<br/><br/>The fight scenes works fine, especially the last one, and in particular the Sandman special effects. But some people may find the movie too slow.There is nothing new or original in Spiderman 3, not even a major villain, but the crew gets the job done, and fans of Spiderman will probably find it very good."

"rowanmaillot","8","0","0","6 June 2020"," Underrated? Yes! Flawed? Yes!
","But deserving of all its hate? NO! Spider-Man 3 is directed by Sam Raimi, that guy who made two of the greatest horror comedies and two of the greatest superhero movies (Army of Darkness, The Evil Dead, The Evil Dead 2 etc.) this film is definitely flawed. But while it has its issues, this film should definitely not be considered as one of the worst films ever made! Toby Maguire's Spider-Man will never be topped, Tom Holland's is more of a comedic relief Spider-Man, whilst the Sam Raimi's Toby Maguire Spider-Man is a much darker and serious Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has directed (what are considered) to be the greatest horror comedies of all time such as; The Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness and The Evil Dead, three of which I consider to be some of the greatest horror comedies of all time! So people definitely went into this film with high expectations considering that the first two Spider-Man films were considered by many critics and audiences to be two of the greatest superhero film efforts since Tim Burton's Batman films and others. And yes, it is disappointing if you go into it expecting the next big Batman Begins or whatever you're expecting it to be, but if you go into it expecting a flawed superhero masterpiece, you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>It is flawed yes, but what movie isn't? Even epics like Jurassic Park, Psycho, Vertigo, The Dark Knight, Blade Runner and many others have flaws, but the excuse for most reviewers is that ""Sam Raimi is a great director"" or ""I went into this expecting the next big thing"" just stop! I have watched this film and yes I do have to say there is one character who feels unnecessary and that is Topher Grace's Venom. If he was played by another actor it would've been far much more interesting, it's definitely not Sam Raimi's best but definitely not his worst work.<br/><br/>The story is about Peter Parker trying to leave his Spider-Man life and get into a bigger relationship with Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, except he sees something suspicious going on between her and James Franco's character, they get into a big fight and a lot of things happen. Eventually, Franco's character dies at the end which is one of the saddest deaths of the 21st century. Don't get me wrong, the first two are greater by a milestone, but Spider-Man 3 is underappreciated and it wasn't the big Spider-Man 2 people were expecting it to be, but it should be respected a bit more. To all those people reading the negative reviews, don't listen to other people, try it for yourself and then decide whether it's good or not.<br/><br/>Literally nobody could've directed the Spider-Man trilogy other than Sam Raimi, the guy owns tens of thousands of comics so he went into this trilogy knowing what he was doing, it has cheesy scenes, cheesy dialogue, action-packed scenes and sure, it could've been better, but, whatever. All and all it's still a great superhero cheesy action flick and I'm going to give Spider-Man 3 an 82%"

I'm honestly, if those scenes were deleted, you'd have to redo the movie.The film had an incredibly scary antagonist. VENOM! But its realization was rather less successful. Venom doesn't look as big as he should but there were also comics where he was as big as spidey. The Sandman was good too but he was just in the background because of Venom. I only watched the German dubbed version until today and he was a good actor in that one. His character development was way too fast and they could have made a fourth movie out of Spider-Man 3 because two antagonists didn't fit into the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that the movie was entertaining, but also has some scenes that you would rather fast-forward through."

","As I said in my previous review, Spider Man 2 is my favorite superhero movie. I was very excited to see the 3rd one, though I had not heard the most praise for it. In fact, some really dislike it.<br/><br/>Before I get into that, I should explain what Spider Man 3 is about. This is Peter Parker's biggest challenge yet. Along with relationship issues with his friends Harry and Mary Jane, he has 3 villains to overcome- Sand Man, the New Goblin(This is Harry's conflict) and Venom.<br/><br/>Once again, he has to battle villains with daily life, causing numerous issues for Peter to resolve by himself.<br/><br/>I personally really enjoy this movie. To me, Spider Man 3 really works like Magnolia or Love Actually, a movie with numerous plots intertwined with each other.<br/><br/>As I already mentioned, he has 3 villains and 2 relationships to deal with. I see this as a plus and a flaw. It's a plus because it gives Spider Man a challenge unlike any other. How do you challenge Spidey? Give him more villains!<br/><br/>However, the movie WOULD work better if a couple of those plots were removed and was saved for a 4th movie or, honestly, just scrapped.<br/><br/>When it comes to what makes SM3 work, that would have to be with the story. It's web of plots aside(no pun intended), it's still very entertaining. There's also many action scenes that are thrilling, like when a building almost crumbles with Gwen Stacey inside.<br/><br/>I enjoyed a couple other things as well. There's also a heartfelt scene near the end when Peter Parker forgives Sandman for something I won't spoil, and Harry repairs his friendship with Peter, and they work together to save the day, which is really satisfying.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movie a 9 because of certain minor flaws that keep it from being a 10 like the first 2. I have 6, so I will list them now in no order:(SPOILERS POSSIBLE):<br/><br/>1. There is a scene where Peter and Mary Jane have a break up. They both cry, and it's very corny looking, to the point that I cringed. The break up is fine. The crying need to be more realistic and less corny.<br/><br/>2. There is a scene where Harry winks at Peter and disappears. Where did he go? Was it imagination? We don't know, and maybe that was the idea, but it's still quite annoying.<br/><br/>3. Harry tells Peter that he loved Mary Jane too. Why though? Why wait 3 movies to say this? It's hinted in the Thanksgiving scene of the first movie that he likes her, but does it take 5 years and 2 more movies in real time to have him to confess this?<br/><br/>4. The Goblin, an evil Spider Man, kidnaps Mary Jane and, seeing how hot she is, says ""My spidey senses are tingling!"" Even as I type this I shutter at how disgusting that line is! That's not a flaw like a plot hole, but I could live without the line.<br/><br/>5. Peter and Harry have a fight 19 minutes in(That's easy to remember because there was exactly 2 more hours of the movie), and Peter tries to tell him that his father's death from the first movie is not his fault. Harry completely ignores this and tries to punch Peter. Because Harry ignores this, we have a conflict that extends much longer than it needs to.<br/><br/>6. Finally, the movie ends with Mary Jane and Peter resolving their problems, but then it just ends. The 2nd movie ends with MJ leaving her wedding for another man to confess her love for Peter. Shouldn't this one end with their own marriage? Because of this, the end kind of left me cold.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws that I have with the trilogy's conclusion, the action and exciting plot outweigh this, making for a worthwhile movie. Sure, it is without a doubt the weakest movie, but that doesn't mean it's awful.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3 satisfies as a conclusion, but it also shows why good things must eventually come to an end."
"Animany94","6","0","0","7 April 2020"," Too many villains and a questionable take on the symbiote, but not terrible.
","Spider-Man 3 carries a reputation for being the worst movie in the Sam Raimi trilogy, and while that's true, the movie itself isn't all terrible.<br/><br/>The movie has a strong message of putting the needs of others before your own which is most prominent in the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane who were about to get serious, but clashed with Peter being Spider-Man.<br/><br/>And that theme could have fitted into the story with the symbiote. But with both the symbiote, Harry Osborn and Sandman, the movie seemed rather contrived and could easily have been split up into two movies. But even if it all seemed contrived and underdeveloped, the ending still made me feel something.<br/><br/>But how the writers handled the symbiote was pretty stupid. It's feeding on its host's negative emotions like anger, desperation and sadness and doesn't make people act like hotshots and do lame dance moves in doorways. That was the biggest let-down and wasn't really saved by Eddie Brock's bonding, because of some out-of-character lines that took the menace away from him.<br/><br/>But at least it's better than the train-wreck of a movie which shed disgrace on the character of Venom in 2018."

Overall it's slow and like I said when spiderman tries to be hard because of that black stuff and dealing with MJ it's really really bad. The fighting was okay."

","Spider-Man 3: 4/10
A horrible movie to end the trilogy. This movie took a big risk after two successful Spider-Man movies part of the trilogy. They went all out as if it was a TV series summed up in one 2 hour long episode. Let's get to the pros and cons!<br/><br/>CONS
-Too many villians and characters from the spiderman universe.
-CGI was horrible.
-90% of the action scenes looked like cartoon
-Too much was going on at once
-The plot was unknown
-Not much action we were expecting from black-suited spiderman
-It took 1 hour until the symbiote decided to finally bond with Peter
-The relationship between Peter & M.J. was very stupid
-Captain Stacy letting Aunt May and Peter know who was Uncle Ben's true killer after 5 years was a pathetic decision by the movies' script writer.
-Not to mention the fact that Harry's butler, Bernard, waited until Harry had no friends to tell him the truth about Norman's death.
-Spider-Man was no longer a vigilante/menace. He became New York's heart. Honesty, it's better to have the city view Spider-Man as a menace. in the comics, he was always viewed as a menace.
-Peter letting Gwen kiss her in front of Mary Jane was dirty.
-Showing a quick cameo of Flash Thompson after 5 years of was just late timing. Obviously it's good to show up to someone's funeral but we should've seen or at least known what happened to Flash after high school. He was never mentioned after he broke up with M.J. in Spider-Man 1.
-Movie was rushed and went by really fast. 2 hours and 20 minutes for a movie that had a lot going on all at once.
-No final Spider-Man swing??? The past two Spider-Man movies, we saw a final swing in the end. In this we didn't. All we saw was Peter & M.J. tearing up as they were hugging and dancing in the end.<br/><br/>PROS
-Tobey Maguire had another great performance!
-All the action scenes were sick!
-Black-suited Spider-Man was what we were waiting for.
-Music was amazing!
-We got to see Peter's dark side
-We got to see how Spider-Man views revenge; is it killing or by getting over it?<br/><br/>FINALLY<br/><br/>All in all the movie was very disappointing. This movie was lucky enough to receive a 4/10 from me. I know this movie failed because director Sam Raimi was running out of time to finish the movie. This movie could've succeeded in many ways. I would've cut the Venom saga, the Stacy family, the butler never telling Harry the truth, changing Uncle Ben's killer, showing Flash Thompson, giving Spider-Man the key to the city, having M.J. being a singer now instead of an actress, and Eddie Brock. This movie should've focused on Harry being the main villain and keep sandman as the side villian. That's all I'm going to say about how Spider-Man 3 shouldve been filmed. Let's get back to track. Sony was already planning to part ways with Saim Raimi and do a reboot before Spider-Man 3 even came out. I miss Tobey Maguire a lot. I watched the Spider-Man trilogy before I went to kindergarten. Hopefully, we get to see Tobey in Spider-Man: Multiverse. I'm going to wrap this up by rating the trilogy's movies out of 10.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 1: 9/10
Spider-Man 2: 9.5/10
Spider-Man 3: 4/10<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is the best spiderman we've ever had. No one can replace him. He'll forever be my spiderman and my favorite superhero. #1."

The little green devil's last behavior for the best friends and brothers to stand up and take the righteousness is really moving. Each of the Spider-Man trilogy has a theme: the first is confusion and choice; the second is escape and commitment; the third is pride and introspection. In this film, spider-man not only has to face three powerful enemies, but also face up to his demons. It is easy to indulge yourself. It is not easy to strengthen your conscience at all times and not to do things that hurt others. And ""even Spider-Man needs help"" ."

"dabeluoki","7","0","0","22 February 2020"," What Killed the Trilogy
","Spider-Man Character is what carries this movie.
The biggest problem with this movie are the villains, which each one of them could have worked it it were them solo as a villain.
Sandman is a villains with great potential and I think the retcon of him being Ben Parker killer was great. (Don't get me started on the beautiful scene Of Flint Mario becoming Sandman) His motivations for stealing to stop his daughter from dying is very touching. However with that said I did not like how even after admitting his wrong doing he seemingly just leaves off screen never to be heard of again. He should have turned himself in or something but nope he just gone. Maybe he not gonna commit crime anymore no way to say for sure.
Now Venom is a horrible villain in this story, Brock who is a good character until he turns into a villains. He basically gets caught plagiarism after Peter Parker Snitches on him and now wants Peter Parker dead. Even gets sandman to help try and kill him. However I will say his fight was pretty cool.
Harry Osborn character was fine in this movie however his amnesia in this movie, and his turn to the good side is so stupid. His butler basically tells him Spider-Man didn't kill Norman it's Norman himself who caused his death however it doesn't make sense why the butler took so long to tell him this information. I will say his death and his team up with Spider-Man in the end was great, although that first fight cgi was bad.
Now let's get to MJ...she's a thot she is mad that Peter kisses Gwen Stacy yet later in the movie she kisses Harry Osborn. Ffs they really didn't need relationship drama in this movie again. Although I do actual like how she is captured by venom in the end of the story as it's used to great affect. Giver Peter a reason to go ask Harry For Help. Well anyway I do feel like she was a little to mean to Peter in the 1st act of the movies . She signed up for this yet she's mad Peter always has to do Spider-Man Work.
Now I don't think I have mentioned her in any of the other reviews but Aunt May, JK Simmons, and his crew, and Uncle Ben are amazing characters.
Finally let's talk about Peter Parker, he is quite frankly a good character in these movies. You can really tell the fame is getting to his head. Which causes him to do a lot of stupid things all while going through a lot of personal stuff. Harry his best friend hates him, and his uncle killer is still on the lose. The First Movie was about doing what is right, the second movie was about with great power comes great responsibility, the third movie is about learning to forgive those who do you wrong."
"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","Null","0","0","15 December 2019"," Another great complex story. The trilogy can probably be rated 9. Mistakes can be fixed if you try... Forgiveness is hard. Emotional.
","The story is quite complex, which is interesting, but possibly something was missing.<br/><br/>Even though at the moment I rated each movie of the trilogy 8, I think that could be increased and the trilogy as a whole I would even rate 9. Mostly because of this complex story between Mary Jane and Peter Parker, I loved the chemistry between them. Also this Peter is so simple and human-like, I love that.<br/><br/>This movie also displays hardships and hard decisions for Peter. His life is hard but he's trying. In the end he deals a whole lot of damage to the people he loves, but it seems eventually it can be fixed... I'm so happy the ending is more or less happy, because for some reason I was expecting something different with MJ.<br/><br/>The fact that Peter's friend wasn't himself and took this path was quite sad and possibly slightly illogical."

That'll all change when he must battle the Sandman, Venom and Harry Obsourne who puts the moves on Mary-Jane. With his plate full, Peter begins to make bad and painfully awkward relationships decisions. The first half of the movie has a big focus on relationships and Harry avenging his father's death against Spider-man. Later, Peter ends up in a black costume that turns him cocky, full of himself and mean, which is a key problem for his Mary-Jane relationship. How will Peter and Spider-Man handles adversaries at all angles and not lose his girl? Overall, solid action scenes yet they felt squeezed into the second half.

","Ugh......... This is the worst Spider-Man movie ladies and gentlemen. Because there's more bad than good let's get the good stuff out of the way; Best effects, more J. Jonah Jameson as always, awesome cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell, and I measure Sandman on the same level as Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2. OK let the suffering begin. There are far too many subplots being squeezed in to focus on the main plot of the story, Sandman is Uncle Ben's real killer, and Harry has become the New Goblin and wants to kill Peter as a means to avenge his father and has temporary amnesia after hitting his head, and Peter and MJ are having relationship problems again when we should be focusing on what the trailers promised us, the birth and introduction of Venom, we'll get into that a little later....... *sigh*.......... And while on the subject of Harry, TEMPORARY AMNESIA??? Is that really the best they could come up with? Amnesia I don't think is temporary disease (we'll talk more about Harry later). Gwen Stacey if you ask me is the most pointless character in the movie aside from being there so that Peter can have someone to cheat on MJ with, and they had Bryce Dallas Howard playing her for crying out loud, how could they just flat out waste her like that? Venom is horribly misused in this, we all are familiar with his origin so no need to go over that but here's what these people did, when Peter gets attached to the symbiote it makes him an emo and it's used for more of a comedic tone and what made it so good in the comics was that it's supposed to torment Peter the same way an addict or Gollum was, plus the dream sequence never appears, and then comes the fact that Topher Grace was completely inaccurate with what the character should've been like and Venom gets only 10 minutes of screen time and then gets blown up in the end, and even then most of the time his face is peeled back, we don't want to sit through Topher Grace with fangs, we want to sit through Venom for crying out loud! Finally the romance, more complication between Peter and MJ as always but this is when it gets to the dropping point of how bad it is, in which Peter cheats on MJ with Gwen as mentioned before but after the dramatic dinner argument MJ realizes they need to forgive each other and they make up with one other. BUT WAIT!!! Harry suddenly gets his memory back and forces MJ to break up with Peter otherwise he'll kill him, thus they break up, has MJ forgotten Peter is Spider-Man? When Peter arrived she could've said ""Harry's got his memory back and is right over there! Deal with him!"" And Peter could've just defeated him and we can continue focusing on the stuff with the symbiote. BUT NO! She breaks up with him! And she never explains to Peter why she did it! Honestly, THOSE 2 NEED COUNSELING!! Finally I must address the worst thing about the movie........ *drum roll*......... *dramatic silence*.......... The jazz club scene................... *BUM BUM BUM!!!!* Peter and Gwen go to a jazz club, MJ is working there, Peter decides to make things right by dancing around, does that sound like a scene from a Spider-Man movie to you? It's so silly and over the top it feels like it's from a Chicago musical, but that's not what makes it fall flat, it's what follows that really kills the movie, after Gwen leaves feeling like something's wrong with Peter he gets into a fight with some of the employees and accidentally hits MJ and is then shown crouching over a church tower while it's raining, THESE ARE 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SCENE TONES THAT DON'T GO TOGETHER!!!!! THIS is what killed the movie. So overall, don't let the advertising of Venom fool you, because this is just a waste. Don't get me wrong, there are movies that are far worse than this, but as a Spider-Man movie, it's just ridiculous. What they should've done is have the story only be focused on Peter and Harry. The truth is revealed in Spider-Man 2 about Peter being Spider-Man and Harry accusing him of killing his father, Spider-Man 3 should've expanded upon that. THAT is what could've made the movie better."

","Spiderman 3 is directed by Sam Raimi and is the final installment of the Raimi Spiderman trilogy, after Spiderman (2002) and Spiderman 2 (2004). Now that nerdy college kid Peter Parker has got the girl, he can focus solely on being Spiderman during the day, rather than having to deal with girl drama, right? Well, when three (yes, three) new villains come to town, he must put aside his relationship with Mary Jane and fight Venom, Sandman, and Green Goblin number 2.<br/><br/>The above paragraph sounds confusing and partly inconceivable, and that's pretty much how this whole film was. Spiderman 3 was an absolute mess, relying just on the nostalgia of fanboys to carry it. Not much was going for this film, but, to its credit, what was going for it was really good, such as direction and special effects. However, an overabundance of characters and subplots, a bad script, and some very poor acting pulled this movie way below the bar.<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me the most about Spiderman 3 is Tobey Maguire's acting. All throughout the first two Spiderman films, Tobey Maguire was great as both Peter Parker and Spidey. However, Maguire's acting abilities in Spiderman 3 were just not present. In this installment, Maguire had to play Peter, ""bad"" Peter, Spiderman, and ""bad"" Spiderman, and he just couldn't handle it. It pains me to say that Tobey Maguire's acting in this film was less than mediocre, and he could've done way better, to say the least.<br/><br/>Not much of the other actors did that great either. Both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco as Mary Jane and Harry Osborn play their same old selves, with not much going for them. As seen in the end of Spiderman 2 (2004), Harry has taken up his father's legacy of the Green Goblin, so he has a new dark side to him. However, Franco doesn't pull this off at all. His ""dark side"" is more a whiny brat not willing to listen to reason about the truth of his father's death, and it got excessively annoying. Kirsten Dunst doesn't bring anything new or special to the character of MJ, and Topher Grace was probably the best actor throughout the entire film, playing Peter's competitor at work, Eddie Brock.<br/><br/>The direction and special effects are really good, to be completely honest. Sam Raimi once again does great behind the camera, and uses his skill to film clean, nice looking action sequences. The special effects in Spiderman 3 are even slightly better than that in the first two films, which is impressive, considering how good those effects were. This may be due to Spiderman 3's bigger budget, but it still is a nice thing to see in an overall boring movie.<br/><br/>The tiring amount of villains is really what hit this film hard. Although the audience may understand the motives and actions of Goblin, Sandman, and Venom, their characters aren't greatly developed. Sandman is just trying to collect money to help his sick daughter, which is nice and all, but his subplot changes a sturdy event that occurred in Spiderman (2002), which was a bad move on the script's part. Venom was quickly shoehorned in during the last act of the film, and his character was overall boring and quite dull. Goblin's motives were easily changeable, which took away from the character a lot. <br/><br/>The script was also pretty bad. The entire film has some awful dialogue, and jumps around often. The abundance of subplots is very bad for the film, and screws it over in unimaginable ways. Many lines were either cheesy, or just horrible, and, without good line delivery from the actors, the script ends up being a convoluted mess, too heavily relying on characters and actors to carry the film, which just didn't happen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Spiderman 3 isn't completely terrible, it just is an extreme let down from the amazing heights presented in the first two installments. With poor acting, characters, and a bad script, I'd recommend Spiderman 3 to anyone who enjoys superhero (or Marvel) movies, as long as you prepare yourself for a mess before hand."

","SPIDER-MAN 3<br/><br/>The final chapter in this trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie continues on from the second movie with Peter and MJ together, Harry angry with Peter and looking for revenge and 2 new villains on the loose.<br/><br/>This was entertaining, but was disappointing compared to the other films.<br/><br/>The story was actually not bad, but it seemed very stretched and there was a lot of things crammed into one movie.<br/><br/>The rivalry between Harry and Peter was very interesting, but would have liked to see more. I thought Harry's anger towards Spider-Man was so strong that the Hob Goblin could have had a whole movie to himself. The other bad guys were not really needed. But, the Hob Goblin was not the main villain. Sandman was the main bad guy. The effects were quite good for him and I thought he looked great, but I feel he should have been more evil. The writers made him more of a victim than a bad guy.<br/><br/>The other bad guy that made an appearance was Venom. Venom was my favourite character through the movie, I was just very disappointed that he had such little screen time. Especially as you have the posters with him all over. The scenes he was in were great though.<br/><br/>There were a few things about this film I didn't like. It felt like this film was ripping off parts of other movies. At one point it reminded me of Superman 3. Spider-Man started changing into an evil version of himself. During this time, Peter walks around town dancing and thinking he is gods gift to women. This just didn't seem to fit into the movie at all. It took the atmosphere away from the story and added too much comedy to the film. It distracted us from the main story and point of the film. I know Peter was going through some changes, but it should have been done differently. Secondly, there is a scene where Peter is dancing with some girl to make MJ jealous. This is another scene which should have been left. Out. It looked like a scene from The Mask. It just didn't fit in this film.<br/><br/>The effects and action sequences were very good. I really enjoyed them and thought they were as good as the other movies.<br/><br/>The acting was as good too. The original cast returned. Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. All did so good job. Other cast members were Thomas Haden Church & Topher Grace. It was also good to see Bruce Campbell and Stan Lee back.<br/><br/>OK, look... This is a good film, and I did like it... But the are a lot of things that were not so good. This is 2 films squeezed into 1 and it all feels a bit rushed.<br/><br/>I will give this 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>""You know... I guess one person really can make a difference.

"talarisw","6","0","0","2 May 2014"," The final installment in Sam Raimi's spider-man trilogy, with Toby Maquire as Peter Parker/Spider-man battling three villains as well as his own personal demons.
","This is not a completely bad movie but it's little disappointing, especially how great the original was and how fantastic the 2nd one was and this one is just OK at most. Sam Raimi is a fantastic director and you can see his talent at work here but his mistake here is trying to do too much in one movie. I feel like the three villains could of worked but it wasn't done in the right way. First let me say the special effects were great and all the actors did a great job. But I think the three villains could of been handled differently. First, the new Green Goblin, he was giving a great set up in the previous film and the opening fight between Harry/Goblin and Peter Parker in his street clothes was excellent! But I'm not so sure of the whole Harry getting amnesia story line, Franco was great in his part though. The rivalry/friendship between Peter and Harry is always good. Thomas Haden Church was perfectly cast as Flint Marko/Sandman and the special effects for sandman was great! Especially when he was flying through the sky like a sand cloud, that actually looked kind of creepy. Then there's my favorite spider-man villain Venom. There's a lot of good and bad with Venom. Supposlly Sam Raimi didn't like Venom and was pressured to include him. The good is that alien symbiont that is venom looks awesome! Great special effects on the symbiont or ""black ooze"" and Sam Raimi shows his horror movie roots with the creepy persona he gives to the black ooze. Raimi does a good job at making the symbiont/ooze feel alive and slowly shows it's true face. When the ooze gets on Eddie Brock it becomes Venom and he looks great, with his demonic looking fangs for teeth and it's banshee like screech he really looks like a demon and speaking as a big fan of the character this is the way he's suppose to be. Now the bad is that Eddie Brock wasn't giving much character development before becoming Venom. I thought Topher Grace was really good as Eddie but he wasn't given enough development. Topher was great at being sleazy, cocky and funny. I didn't mind if he was skinner then the much more muscular Brock from the comics. I thought Topher was well cast in the role. My favorite line is when Topher says as venom, mockingly ""Oh, my spider sense is tingling"". It's understandable that a lot of people felt like venom belonged in another movie and bringing him in here over stuffed the movie. However I feel Venom could'eve worked in this movie but I think the biggest mistake was making Venom and sandman team up at the end to attack spider-man. It should of been Venom by himself, there was no need to bring back sandman and having sandman there overshadows the awesomeness of Venom. People who are not familiar with Venom from the comics won't get a sense of why he's one of the most fearsome foes spider-man ever faced. The villains could've worked for each act: Goblin/Harry in act 1, Sandman in act 2, and venom vs spider- man showdown in act 3. If you really want to see the best take on Venom watch Spider-man the animated series of the 1990's, that's how it's suppose to be done! Also Toby/Peter going to the dark side thanks to the symbiont had some great moments but arguably could've been more darker and dangerous. I enjoyed the supporting cast especially J.K. Simmons who is absolutely perfect as the obnoxious J.Johna Jameson. The movie has a lot of good stuff about it but ultimately 3 villains just didn't work. Having it been just Peter/spider-man vs Harry/Goblin and Venom showing up at the end and no sandman at all probably would've been the best way to go. But I still enjoyed seeing the 'venom saga"" unfold in a live action movie."

","I'll address the elephant in the room now... It was OK, yes it could have been better, but some things were not too bad. Please read on, and fair warning spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>So a big thing in this movie was people felt there where too many villains. I don't feel that it had too many, there were 3 on paper, but in reality it was actually 2 at a time. You start off with ""new"" Goblin, and then add Sandman into the mix... then once Goblin is sidelined, you then get Venom. And let me address the villains. ""new"" Goblin was a sad version of Green Goblin of the first one, there was no crazy, the updated glider was a hoverboard on steroids (and still had those dumbass spike... did he learn NOTHING) and no goblin mask. I honestly would have rather have seen Harry wearing the full goblin armor from the first movie. Or paint it goldish, make him Hobgoblin (I am aware Harry Osborne was NOT the hobgoblin)...the new version just seemed so generic.<br/><br/>Second... Sandman... Thomas Haden Church... holy crap... nailed the look to the T... HOWEVER... they made his super sympathetic... like your rooting for him at some points more than Spiderman. Which is a big contrast from his comic book counterpart... but I digress, that happens a lot on comic movies... especially this one.<br/><br/>Lastly... Venom... ohh... the humanity... If you wanted to see the annoying bitch version on Venom... well this is your movie. The difference between Spiderman and Venom physically alone, is like Max and Mike Tyson from Punch-Out... instead in the movie they are the same size. Venom is supposed to a murderous psychopath... that stalks Spiderman, screwing with him left and right... in the movie, he calls him right out. He could have been much better if he was introduced halfway through the movie rather than last minute. They wasted the villain... similar to Two-Face in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Now the rest of the movie... the story itself is fairly solid... but the dialog and ""Emo"" Peter were lame. If ""Emo"" Peter was more hardass then douchebag, he would have been better.<br/><br/>The movie had potential to live up to Spiderman 2, but due to the lackluster Villains, and poor plot scenarios hurt this more than anything... and I don't blame too many villains, I blame the writing more than anything cause a group of villains, when written right works fine. Seem my Dark Knight review for that explanation."

","This is the second and final movie sequel to Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as the nerdy and shy Peter Parker, who has maintained a balance between his relationship with Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his responsibility as Spider-Man. But, Peter has to deal with his vengeful friend Harry Obsourne (James Franco) and new foe the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). He also must deal with the consequences of amplifying his powers, which inadvertently leads to his uniform changing colors to pitch black and the birth of another new foe called Venom.<br/><br/>The acting was decent for the most part, but, I've found Bryce Dallas Howard's Gwen Stacy role as just an annoying distraction to the plot and James Franco's Harry Osbourne character having the personality of a soap opera. The special effects were unrealistic and too campy, including the Sandman CGI effects. There are still plenty of action to keep the story exciting, including the fight scenes between Spider-Man and Venom, and I thought the subplot about finding the truth behind Ben Parker's killing was pretty intriguing. But the overall plot dragged a little and the series did look like it was losing steam by the time this movie was made.<br/><br/>Grade C"

","Okay here's my two cents on ""Spider-Man 3""... Well, what can I say? ""Spider-Man 3"" was awesome in fact, the film once again kept itself on the same pace as the first two and at the same time push the boundaries even further! It's no wonder that the ""Spider-Man"" film franchise is at a all time high! The only gaps I have with the film was that Venom was only shown as the grand finale (Or the main event) but in any case better to have him period than not having him and also the film didn't end with Spide-Man web-slinging like in the previous films but then again it wasen't really necessary anyway! It'll be too much like the 1967 cartoon series, always ending an episode with Spider-Man web-slinging. <br/><br/>And now some highlights from the film... <br/><br/>""Peter fights Harry (In his Goblin persona)"" <br/><br/>""Birth of Sandman"" ""Spidey saves Gwen Stacy"" ""Spidey fights Sandman"" <br/><br/>""Spidey's suits becomes jet black""<br/><br/>""Spidey (In his black suit) fights Sandman again"" <br/><br/>""Harry forces Mary-Jane to break up with Peter"" <br/><br/>""Peter fights Harry again"" <br/><br/>""Peter acts like a pompous jerk"" <br/><br/>""Spidey rips the black suit off and onto Eddie Brock"" <br/><br/>""Spidey fights Venom & Sandman"" <br/><br/>""Spidey & Harry (In his Goblin persona) fights Venom & Sandman"" <br/><br/>People originally wonder if this is truly the final ""Spider-Man"" film and since it did turn out to be so then I guess it really did end with a bang thus Sam Raimi did a great job bringing the ""Spider-Man"" film franchise to light after a long development hell and hopefully it'll never by forgotten except remembered."

You like that there's a little internal struggle, but in the end, you just want to see him fight baddies and win. Spider-man 2 had so much action, I could barely stand it. It had enough between MJ and Peter that you were curious about where they would go from there, but I'm guessing a lot of those scenes met the skip button when the movie was rewatched on DVD.

","""Spider-Man 3"" reunites Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and director Sam Raimi, who also co-writes the script with brother Ivan, and, unfortunately, falls between the same cracks as many other threequels released in 2007 (e.g. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End""): Too much content is forcibly shoved and messily pieced together in too short of a time. <br/><br/>As the longest of the three ""Spider-Man"" films by twenty or so minutes, one would think that a little extra layer to the script could work fine in the hands of a talented and innovative filmmaker such as Raimi; but a preponderance of subplots that lack both linearity and substance throughout the overall context of the story, leaves this film feeling out of place and messy in comparison with its much more superior predecessors. <br/><br/>In the first film, Raimi, who is very ardent in his belief that not everything in a film needs to be built in the computer, brilliantly integrated a mix of traditional and computer effects into great-looking sequences. This was accentuated in ""Spider-Man 2"", but for this third film the computer effects seem to dominate, taking away from what I found to be part of what made its predecessors so enjoyable. Not only does the computer seem to overtake the film in several sequences (notably the heavy action scenes), but, with more than one exception (the ""Birth of the Sandman"" sequence for instance), the effects look like cheap, quickly-thrown-together renderings. <br/><br/>The first two films had brilliant moments of well-placed comic relief (Peter learning to swing in the first film; the lust-struck daughter of Peter's landlord in the second film), but this film seems uncertain as to what genre it is: One minute it feels like a poorly-made drama; one second a cheesy comedy; then it's a musical; a romance - it all feels congested and muddled, and more often than not add nothing but time to the movie.<br/><br/>Three villains take the stage this time: Venom (played by Topher Grace); The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church); and Harry Osbourne (James Franco) as an amped-up and wimped-down ""New Goblin"": Unlike the well- staged emotion created between both first William Dafoe's Goblin then Alfred Molina's Doc. Oc in the first and second films, the villains in this film are introduced with no substance, resonance, or realism, thus leaving the inevitable resolve between good and evil during the film's falling action feeling less like a resolve and more like a cheap cop-out of an ending. The only real emotional connection made from screen to viewer is toward the final five minutes of the film, during Church's performance in his final scene, in which he repents his sins and asks for forgiveness.<br/><br/>The acting is terrible in the film overall: Maguire, as Parker/Spider- Man is stiff and seems to be trying too hard to be funny; Dunst plays as if she doesn't even want to be part of the project; Franco is halfway between being maniacal and comical; Topher Grace (Eddie Brock/Venom) is un-intimidating and over-the-top. The only two decent performances in the film are those by Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman. <br/><br/>The film is, nonetheless, well-made for what it is. The bad acting can be justified by a lackluster script, as can be the clutter of the story and the tediousness of the useless subplots and weak villains. Sam Raimi takes what is given him and delivers a film that is neither bad nor good, but enjoyable. While this is by far the weakest of the three films, it is made with skill and style from the director, is decently shot, pieced together well for what there is to work with, - but at the end of it all it still leaves a bit of a sour taste in one's mouth if they are fans of the first two films and expected something up to par. <br/><br/>A not-so-bad effort that pieced together a cluttered mess of a story."
"islander-14","4","0","0","26 September 2007"," Looks good but nothing like the first two.
","I enjoyed the first one. The second one was probably the best film based on a comic book character ever made. This one: I think the word is over the top. Don't get me wrong it's a fun night out but half way through the film new threads of the plot line were opening up and I was wondering how long it would take to tie up all the loose ends. I remember feeling that way three ours into Return of the King but that was after some 11 hours of film and character and story development. And to be honest Spidey is not worth the complexity.<br/><br/>If it wasn't because by the end of Spider-Man 2 I had come to admire this franchise so much, my rating would not be so negative. This time though I felt that the writers were too worried they would not manage to sign up the main actors to make three more films so they squeezed three major plot lines into one film. This is Spider 3-4-5 and none of them are very good.<br/><br/>They look fantastic though.<br/><br/>And no one screams like Kirsten Dunst. Even if Peter Parker's eyes may wander sometimes, his ears are hooked for good.<br/><br/>There was a high-brow filmic tribute in the film. The crucial turning of the story when Peter Parker realises he needs to tear himself away from the alien symbion stuck to him that is bringing out his dark side, makes him a great jazz/tango dancer and hit his girlfriend across her pretty face. He's helped by coincidence. It is fortunate that he happens to be on top of a church tower when he literally stumbles on the knowledge that the resonance of the ringing bell annoys the symbion stuck to him. The view down from the tower (and the view up from the bottom as seen by one of Spidey's many nemeses) is not too vaguely reminiscent of the church tower in Hitchcock's Hispanic church tower in Vertigo. Looks good too.<br/><br/>The real tribute in the film is given in the other cameo appearance: the one by Stan Lee, the creator of this most real of comic book super heroes.<br/><br/>Well Sam Raimi seems to have been overwhelmed by the oft repeated line: 'with great power comes great responsibility'. The end of Spider-Man 2 gave Raimi the responsibility of delivering yet again the 'best comic book movie ever made' and sadly the aim was so high overshooting was almost inevitable."

","At least not for me, but mind you I outgrew Spiderman long time ago (probably the same time as I did the Santa Claus), but there's something for everyone and I know there's plenty of comic books fans out-there so why not keep making the movies, right? I guess, but in that case you must face the consequences of making it fun and exciting especially when doing a 'trequel' of any kind of a movie, especially comic books. Perhaps the true comic book Spidey fans will always find something new and appealing in a movie like this, but (unfortunately) folks like me will come out of a movie theater shaking my head.<br/><br/>So what are my pet peeves: I'm really getting tired of seeing Tobey Maguire's face and Kirsten Dunst's grin- he is so not a superhero material and she is just.... annoying. And their break-up scene felt like a HS drama class presentation. In addition, watching Topher Grace as an arrogant/nosy geek was just like seeing Eric Forman's evil twin= both rather tedious. There were some cool special effects and funny bits, but nothing super great. And does the Spiderman have to be such a softy all the time? He can't even kill a guy who killed his uncle or whop anyone's ass without the help of the black evil force which makes him into a pompous ass prancing and dancing around. And making fun of the French is sooo last year, but I guess flying heroically around the American flag in his face is always in style- go figure. And just as Harry and Spidey become friends again Harry dies. Lame."

","I went to see this the Friday it came out, hoping for a good climax to the series, as reported. Well, I wait in line for the 12AM showing, and I see people coming out laughing and mocking it. Bad sign, and I should of obeyed my instincts telling me to get out and go see something else (unfortunately, a Friday night with only a couple of kiddie films showing at the theater and cops patrolling the area doesn't leave me a whole lot to do; plus, the mall's closed). That's that, but I had my suspicions from the group I witnessed and they stuck with me through the previews. Then, it began.<br/><br/>We start out the very minute where we left off in Spider-Man 2. Peter's just swooped off his balcony and is headed for the police sirens, Harry has gone evil on us after discovering his father's shocking demise and, even more shocking, who was responsible (also, he's found his father's lab with all the Greenie Goblin junk), and tension between MJ and Peter is beginning. That's that. We then are introduced to ""Sandman"", who undergoes his transformation after falling into some huge pit with radioactive-gamma-treatment-whatever-nonsense going on and some weired meteor/space goo that seems to ""amplify aggression"". Nothing new or too interesting...<br/><br/>Middle of the film: gets darker, Peter uses his new black suit, turned sour by the terrible space goo, Harry has tried killing Peter, only to be knocked out and suffering from amnesia, taking him back to the day before his father died (thus he has no memory of him discovering his best friend behind the mask or finding his father's lab), and Eddie Brock become increasingly jealous of Peter. Sandman plays a small part here, but nothing that big or interesting, save for being defeated by the ultimate bad-guy killer: water (doh! he's made of sand; that's right...). Oh, I almost forgot to mention Peter's dark side causes him not to act like a villain, but more like the emo kid in school with some issues and clandestine prodigal way about him (I am not joking, it's that cheesy). Oh, uh, MJ and Peter are thinking about... getting *cough*HITCHED*cough*.<br/><br/>The climax I'm not going to EVEN THINK of delving into. I will tell you how it ends, however: Eddie Brock becomes Venom for the last 20 minutes of the film (FFS! HE'S VENOM! COOLEST Villain EVER! WTF, STAN?!) and dies, Harry joins forces with Peter AGAIN, only to be impaled where he too dies, and Peter and MJ simply remain friends, refraining from engagement, as planned. The VERY last second is what's most painful. It leaves you hanging with that sort of, ""So what happened next?"" thing hanging in the back of your mind (MJ and Peter dance together- we fade to black... the end... what?... you were expecting more...?).<br/><br/>I seriously think that this film has rightfully doomed the series, assuming they even had plans to continue making one or two more Spider-Man films. As I said, Venom, the greatest and most well known villain of the comic book age, gets a 20 minute part in the entire film... no epic fight sequences people... although ""emo child"" has evolved into ""emo man"". Sandman ""fades into the wind""... wow... what a way to go out with a bang... any last words, maybe?... just a thought...<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of when Hollywood wants to cram too much into too short of a time frame. In my honest opinion, I would of done this film about Sandman and the beginning on Venom (the drop of space goo landing on him) and cut to black with a ""To Be Continued"" message at the end, then make a Spider-Man 4 which would deal with the late middle and climax of this film. Instead, they tried to end it where it stood without satisfying the viewer. Cheapest, though not uncommon, thing I've ever seen done.<br/><br/>I'll wait for the DVD. Hopefully it can redeem its rating here on IMDb... otherwise, it sinks."

","Spider-Man 3 kicks the summer off very successfully with amazing special effects and an edge of your seat knockout. Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) has finally found the balance that he's been looking for between the love of his life Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his responsibilities as Spider-Man. The city of New York is finally praising him for all of his hard work and Peter is inn the running for a new staff job at the Daily Bugle. However, everything that Peter has worked for will start to unravel. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), while escaping from prison gets caught in an accident that displaces his molecules and transforms him into the Sandman, who can make himself whatever shape, size he wants. When Peter discovers that Flint maws actually the one responsible for his Uncle Ben's death, Peter will stop at nothing to get revenge. Before Peter is able to do this, he discovers that a mysterious black substance has turned his Spider-Man suit jet black and has brought forth a dark side of himself and Spider-Man that no one has seen before. Peter begins to give in to this dark personality and he starts to abandon the people he loves most of all. His friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) decides to take up his late father's title and becomes the New Goblin. Peter begins to have a new romance with Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard), but by doing this he sets off a rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is obsessed with Gwen. Little does Peter know, the black substance has its sights set on Brock as well. The substance transforms Brock into Venom, an arch for that can mimic anything Spider-Man can do. Peter has to forget everything behind him and take on his greatest challenge yet. Many people say that Spider-Man 3 was a major disappointment; on the other hand many may say that it was the best of the series. To me it was a slight disappointment, the first two movies were fantastic; they had great villains and great story lines and everything. Spider-Man 3 has great villains as well. Sandman becomes one of Spider-Man's toughest enemies; he can make himself whatever size he wants even if that means becoming 20 feet tall! The biggest disappointment would have to be Venom. Yes Venom looks amazing in the movie, but there just isn't enough screen time with him. Venom doesn't actually appear in the movie until there is approximately 30 minuets left in the film. They should have waited until the 4th movie and gave Venom his own movie. The director (Sam Rami) is great behind the camera yet again. He somehow manages to make each film look better as it goes on. That includes the special effects, which also are visually stunning, and has you convinced that Toby Maguire is really swinging through New York.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 has one of the best story lines in the series; Spider-Man has to deal with 3 villains, sorry make that 4, yes that's right, 4 villains! Sandman's great strength, Venom's mimicking powers, Harry's mind and heart attacks, and Peter himself overcoming the revenge in his heart. Many people have said that Rami has put to many things into this movie, that is not the case. Rami has put in just enough story lines and he is able to make sure everything fits and that it doesn't become a big mess. The acting from the cast is great. Toby Maguire gives another strong performance as the troubled Peter Parker, while Kirsten Dunst gives a good performance as Mary Jane Watson. Rosemary Harris gives a great performance as Aunt May who gives Peter much needed advice throughout the film. Lastly, the two best performances of the movie came from James Franco as the menacing best friend of Peter, and Topher Grace who exceeded expectations as Eddie Brock.<br/><br/>The slight disappointment of Spider-Man 3 is that, while it is very good when it's dark, there is just too much of dark suited Spider-Man. On of the greatest things about Spider-Man is the colourful suite that he wears that makes Spider-Man so recognizable. The only other thing that made it a slight disappointment was that there wasn't that scene at the end where the audience sees Spider-Man swinging through the skies of New York unlike the first two where there is that scene at the end, that scene is always so spectacular to watch, unfortunately there is no scene like that in the Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>If you are contemplating about seeing this movie or not, go see it; yes it is a slight disappointment but it's still a fantastic movie. With the amazing visually effect and great storyline, Spider-Man 3 rates 8/10 and starts the summer off with a bang!"

","If Spider-Man 2 defied the rule that sequels are not as good as their precedents, Spider-Man 3 does not share this distinction. The film labors through a series of shallow subplots that converge only artificially through a series of ho-hum coincidences, such as the physical proximity of the characters.<br/><br/>This style of plot mingling may be suitable for the superhero comic book, where the dearth of text restricts the story line to the role of showcasing the fantastic powers of the characters in a two-dimensional extravaganza of special effects. The theme of superhero comic books has also traditionally centered on a predictable pattern: the triumph of good over evil as played out on the battlefield of human vs. inhuman motivations.<br/><br/>As a mere recreation of a comic book, perhaps Spider-Man 3 succeeds. One certainly has the feeling on several occasions while watching the movie of being inside a comic book. However, a film can aspire to more. The best of the comic book movies, including the first two Spider-Men and the first two X-Men movies, show how it is possible to recreate the camp and atmospherics of a comic book, and even its unique flavor of suspension of disbelief, without sacrificing the strengths of the filmic medium, such as narrative complexity and visual suspense.<br/><br/>The acting appears to be a casualty mostly of character development, which is a casualty in turn of the plot. The characters are asked to be puppets of petty motives and capricious plot turns ,such as bumps on the head, greed for fame (on Spiderman's part!), and vengefulness blown out of proportion. The actors dutifully and competently played their parts. The plot let them down. Call back Michael Chabon."

","Undoubtedly one of the summer's most highly anticipated movies, Spider-Man 3 picks up soon after the end of Spider-Man 2 (or I assume it does anyway). The problems are inherent right from the beginning as the film tries to push too much into one film. Of the issues addressed in this film are Peter's problems with Harry and the death of Norman Osborne, his affair with Mary Jane, two villains (one of which is Uncle Ben's real killer), not to mention Peter's own demons dealing with revenge. The film tries to touch on every one of these aspects (I'm forgetting the rivalry with Eddie Brock and another potential love interest in Gwen Stacy) and ends up not developing any of them very well.<br/><br/>One villain would've been OK; either Sandman or Venom but not both. I think deep down the fans really wanted more Venom and the evil Spider-Man than anything else. What really watered the movie down was the acting. A summer action movie really isn't supposed to be there for the acting, it's more about the escapism and fun. But what sold Spider-Man 2 to the world were the story and the performances. We really did care about Peter Parker and Spider-Man's survival in part two. In this one, it seems that the hero succeeds too easily on all levels. He doesn't fail enough and doesn't have to push enough to show us he's worthy of our attention and sympathy. But then again, it all goes back to the summer 2007 escapist spectacle. Spider-Man 3 ends up trying to win us over with the spectacles rather than focusing on the story and the characters.<br/><br/>The film did have some terrific action scenes. The birth of Sandman will go down as one of the greatest pieces of CGI work ever done. There was a lot of drama in this shot, and in the end you think to yourself that it was real and it happened, but it was just CGI mixed with Christopher Young's terrific background score. But then, the drama throughout the rest of the film falls a little short. Peter and Harry's friendship seemed to take the easy way out in terms of their story and acting. Strangely enough, Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst don't seem to have the chemistry they had in the previous two films. The scenes between Peter and MJ, apart from being overly melodramatic, just detracted from the film's pacing. Coming in at nearly two and a half hours, the movie ends up being too short and too long because there's too much Sandman and not enough Venom on top of all the things crammed into it.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 2 was a film that would go down as one of the greatest; if not the greatest super hero film of all time. Spidey 2 ends up being the real ending to the story. Spider-Man 3 simply fails to deliver. Some of us are left thinking, we should've waited for the DVD."

","Sam Raimi knows his craft and Spider-Man 3 is a great example.<br/><br/>There have been many 'critics' who have accused this film of being 'too complicated', or of 'trying to fit too much into a single movie'. It's a shame that people strive to simplify films, to dumb them down to mediocrity. Spider-man 3 contains many threads and the film is well paced as a result. Anyone should be able to follow the story with ease and the pace of the film is sustained and enriched by the intertwined stories. None of the plot threads is particularly challenging but they sustain the story which is, let's face it, all that matters.<br/><br/>Okay, the characterisations are not deep, but they are at least three dimensional.<br/><br/>One critic I read criticised Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker under the influence of the symbiont. Sure, the performance lacks power, but it moves the story along and when I watch a comic book superhero story I'm not looking for depth, I'm looking for motivation, character and, above all, ACTION! Spider-man 3 delivers action IN SPADES.<br/><br/>This is a chewing-gum superhero comic book story and Raimi's interpretation captures this perfectly.<br/><br/>If you like fast paced fantasy action superhero web slinging sand blasted sky surfing love stories then Spider-Man 3 will be right up your street."

","Right..........well, I didn't see this movie in the cinema, mostly because of my bad feelings about it (I always trust my instincts). I waited and heard all the bad reviews and comments from critics and trusted friends alike.<br/><br/>Today, I decide that after all this negativity, I couldn't possibly be disappointed, so would hopefully enjoy it and as such.........gave it a try.<br/><br/>I knew already that by trying to cram too much in, in the form of villains (why so many!!!?? it just made the whole thing seem futile), character exploration and endless amounts of self realisation (in many directions) by most, if not all of the characters, that it would seem abit stop start.<br/><br/>Nothing could prepare me for the horror that was about to insue........I never thought I would watch a film by Sam Raimi and wish it would end.........especially Spiderman!! something that he had got so right on the previous two visits.<br/><br/>The script was awful, inconsistent and not even plausible for a comic book movie. I found the affects to have taken a backwards step in CGI development. The constant too'ing and fro'ing that every single character was doing just got repetitive, predictable and very very boring...........character self realisation and overcoming weaknesses is something that all movies have (although Id love to see a film that builds all that up and then the character Doesn't change and the movie ends!!) but to have so much of this just ruined it all and made me not care at all really.<br/><br/>Although the US flag was used in previous Spidey movies, it was always playful, this one's use was blatant and pathetic..........AND the whole scene of ""bad"" Peter Parker was way way over the top, near the end of it my girlfriend was asking me to turn it off as it was soooooooo bad, again in previous movies where there's a playful scene trying to convey a characters feelings/emotions/mood (like Peter strolling along to ""Rain drops keep falling on my head""), this one was too long and seemed to just be filling gaps and pointlessly displaying character traits that meant nothing.<br/><br/>Overall, I cant imagine how Id have felt if I was actually expecting something from this movie but I never thought I would dred the next film..........unless Sam can try and return to his old playful, innovative, stylish, trend setting, original self."

","Spidey's back, and this time he is facing some new enemies (Venom and the Sandman), with the same friends, and some things that don't quite fit into either category (ie, the mysterious black entity from out of space), and a some who are undecided (his best friend Harry).<br/><br/>Like modern superhero movies, there is an understanding a hero is not made of muscles, weapons or super powers, but in the heart and mind of the character. A hero conquers because of their own personal transformation.<br/><br/>But what a tangled web we weave when first we try to write a decent plot line.<br/><br/>The first 2 spider movies had a single enemy against with spiderman battled. The heroes were more believable, they are almost possible. In SM3 the bad guys are less believable, and there more of them. Which means we don't really get to know them, understand, or see them as human beings, who villainy is partly created by an imbalance.<br/><br/>Here we see so many different plot elements, many lifted from the older spider man movies, that it gets a little bit boring after a while.<br/><br/>Some interesting aspects are in this movie, is the black suited alien symbiont spiderman is like the batman of batman returns. Cool, Strong, powerful, angry and looking for revenge and ultimately negative.<br/><br/>The Sandman is a person in the wrong situation, a person you never wanted to become what he is. He can only be defeated by words and reason.<br/><br/>There is more here, but maybe too much more.<br/><br/>Ultimately the movie missing it's mark when it comes to humour, fails to develop characters enough, is unbelievable in too many aspects of the movie, too many reversals in characters that leave your head spinning and worse yet, the ending is unsatisfying. It is the failure of the ending that really makes the movie hurt.<br/><br/>Good try, entertaining enough, not a waste of 2 hours, but put it behind various other better titles."

","So Spiderman 2 is a massive success. How to follow it up? One answer is to fill th screen with baddies. Having already done tortured troubled evil , Dr Octopus, with whom th audience have sympathies, the company tries to go in a different direction by filling the screen with Spidies enemies in the hope of blockbuster success. It looks a WWF tag match1 There are so many evils here that when the climax comes th audience hasn't been able to build a rapport with any of them so why should we care about them or what happens to them? This is a lesson in more is less, to use the cliché, which what they have clearly used here more than once. The redeeming one is a character mad out of sand. A feat of CGI to make his metamorphosis look convincing and the only character around long enough for rth e audience to feel anything towards. But he is not developed like Doc Octupus's screen time and so the main redeeming baddie has as much impression as sandcastle left out in the rain. The next in the franchise should return to solid scripting as its priority."

","I love the Spiderman franchise, I thought that Spiderman 2 was an amazing film and when I heard that Venom was going to be in this film I thought ""Hey, this could be awesome...They have the chance to make a really amazing sequel here!"" and I was quite excited about seeing it. By all rights this film should have been a very dark and moody affair, especially when Spiderman starts to become 'posessed' by the black suit. Instead what happened was Parker turns into a cheesy EMO kid and the result is somewhat of a joke, rather than being given the seriousness it deserved in terms of psychological inner turmoil... Venom should have had a Golum-like split personality, but even the existence of the symbiote's personality was absent in this film...Which was why Spiderman decided the suit was not for him in the comics...He became aware of its motives and how it was trying to take him over like a parasite, he rejected the suit and then it found a willing partner with Brock because they both hated/resented Parker and Spiderman... Venom should have sounded like some kind of messed up lizard/demon...Instead they just gave him the voice of Brock...Which was really weak. As well, Venom should have been much bulkier and bigger in general...Most of my problems with this film are with the whole 'black suit' thing which they used to advertise this film and it ended up feeling like false advertising...It should have been awesome, but everything about it was cheesy and overacted...There was too much singing and dancing and not enough depth..."

","While this movie attempts to depict Good and Evil, it seems that there is no such thing as actual redemption in the Spideyverse. I am speaking, of course, of Harry. Harry is Evil because his father was Evil, and because Harry wants to kill Peter. What the film fails to mention, however, is the fact that Harry is simply having the exact same reaction to the death of a loved one as Peter. While one could argue that the filmmakers are drawing parallels between the two story lines, the difference is that Harry becomes disfigured and finally dies, while Peter lives on unscarred. Why does Harry get redemption only in death? Smeg knows, because good!Harry is a better person than good!Peter. <br/><br/>The other character that supposedly walks the line between Good and Evil is Flint Marko, but it's made clear early on that Flint does what he does for the sake of his daughter, who is terminally ill with some unspecified disease that can only be cured with money. There is absolutely no question as to whether Flint is Good or Evil, so it comes as no surprise when he is finally absolved of the death of Uncle Ben and allowed to go free. <br/><br/>Brock/Venom barely even merits discussion, despite having the coolest look and powers of any of the characters and being one of the best-known Spidey villains. Brock is basically Evil for the sake of Evil. Initially, he seems all right, but he soon fakes a photograph and asks Jesus to kill Peter after Peter exposes him for fraud. He dies at the end because the Spideyverse has no room for real redemption.<br/><br/>The heart of the Spider-Man trilogy is pubescent angst, and watching Peter continue to go through puberty when he's in his twenties is tiresome. Every single one of the movies is about Peter going through a physical change and having social difficulties as a result. Peter is continually hurting MJ and then calling to make up, and it irks me to no end that she always accepts him back despite the fact that he is selfish and pompous at the best of times, and downright Evil at the worst. Of course, MJ is also an incredibly selfish person, who is wholeheartedly jealous of Peter's success. They probably deserve each other.<br/><br/>The film also violated numerous laws of reality, and while I understand that comic book movies are hardly going to be realism, I'd appreciate it if they at least pretended to care about the things they portrayed. I'll accept Flint/Sandman's transformation (his awakening scene after he was fused with silicone was easily one of the best parts of the movie), and I'll accept the idea of a rock from space containing some sort of alien symbiote. Being a Doctor Who fan, I am necessarily willing to accept all sorts of pseudo-scientific macguffins, so I'm not really thrown off by superheroes and supervillains. My biggest complaint about the movie's lack of reality is Peter's ability to multitask. Are we honestly supposed to believe that Peter is capable of being a professional photographer (he must be taking pictures of things other than Spider-Man at least some of the time), going to what is apparently a school for geniuses, keeping all of New York safe as Spider-Man, having a steady relationship with MJ, and getting enough sleep to function on a daily basis? Sorry, but that's just not happening.<br/><br/>The biggest turnoff of all, though, was the film's sloppy pacing and unsatisfactory resolution. The action scenes are (or at least feel) few and far between, as the filmmakers chose to focus instead on Peter and MJ's unhealthy, repulsively whiny romance. I loved the action sequences, but the rest of the movie was boring beyond reason. Cool action sequences are no substitute for a well-rounded movie.<br/><br/>The film tries to recreate the complexity of Batman Returns by loading the movie full of baddies, but in the end there was just too much going on to really get the audience attached to any one character. And, too, Peter was the only character allowed to have any complexity whatsoever, so all the potentially interesting aspects of the other characters were unceremoniously glossed over. Venom is completely wasted on this film, as he only becomes a superperson in the third act and has all of one battle with Spider-Man before being offed. The film's dramatic issues were all but resolved before Brock became Venom, and he was present in the film only because they needed a climactic battle sequence. The battle sequence was all sorts of fun to watch, but in terms of story structure it just felt tacked on.<br/><br/>The resolution between Peter and Flint felt flat, as Flint finally explains what the audience knew all along (that he was really just a nice guy who got caught up in events that were beyond his control), Peter grants his tearful forgiveness, and Flint flies off into the sunset. What is unsatisfactory about this outcome is that Peter never even thinks to apologize for his brutal attempted murder of Flint midway through the film, and Flint still lacks the funds to save his daughter. Presumably, then, Flint will keep on robbing banks and hurting people in the process, despite the fact that hey, Peter is friends with Harry, who is incredibly rich. Harry could easily have provided for Flint's daughter at the endbut Harry is dead and Flint just flies off dramatically. Nothing is solved.<br/><br/>And that, really, is the take-home synopsis of Spider-Man 3: some people whine and complain for several hours, there are a few pretty fight scenes, and in the end, nothing is solved."

","The problems with Spider-man 3 above all else was how incomplete it was all the way around. If nothing other than the fact that if the story is about ""revenge"" and what seeking it can do to someone, Spider-man 3 forgot to keep it in mind as they wrapped it up. Consider this: At the start of the film, Peter Parker is living the good life. The moons are aligned and for the first time in his life, things are clicking. School, MJ, Spidey... all coexist, cohesively. As the central theme of revenge begins to circulate we start seeing what changes can take place in the heart of each person. What will each person have to give up to seek the revenge they crave? The problem is, there were no consequences for Peter at the end of the film. It's important, nay, imperative that Peter at the end of his quest realize that he's back to square one. That he will never reach that utopia of internal peace. That for the rest of his life he is simply that guy that, like all of us, doesn't always catch the breaks. But instead we are told that his actions serve no ""real"" purpose. That he can betray and hurt and steal and ""justice"" doesn't find the heroes. What a lousy idea to release your characters out of such constraints and like Uncle Ben said, responsibility. That missing component isn't important because I said so, but because the idea of Spider-man demands it."

","There were too many stories packed into this nauseating wanna-be morality tale, and not enough time was spent developing most of the new characters. Spider-Man 3 probably would have been easier to tolerate if the stories were at least engaging and written well, but because everything plays out with the intellectual depth of a soap opera, I was barely able to tolerate it. There is even a character who, conveniently, gets amnesia just so some of the other story lines can have room to move forward. I kid you not.<br/><br/>The Sandman is one of the few developed characters in the film. Its too bad the Raimi brothers had to make him into what is, undoubtedly, one of the sappiest villains in movie history. What happened to villains who were evil because they were evil? Why must they also have nice sides? I can understand the need to add depth to the characters, but it seems like the Raimis are afraid to create genuinely villainous villains. The guy either goes crazy or has to help someone. <br/><br/>Because Raimi lacks talent as a director, Thomas Haden Church was forced to give this embarrassing and forced 'angry mouth / sad eyes' expression through out the entire film to constantly remind us Marko is angry, but... he also has a soft side. Awwww. I want to give him a hug now.<br/><br/>Venom is the only character who truly lacks humanity, but his story is barely explored. From what I read, Raimi didn't even want Venom in the film because of his ""lack of humanity."" Gwen Stacy is another character who just shows up out of no where and does nothing to move the main story forward. And May Parker, Peter's aunt, has become increasingly annoying with her long, drawn out, Yoda sermons on life.<br/><br/>In summary: Spider-Man 3 is garbage. Don't waste your money on this pile.

Publicity on its own fails to compensate for a great movie. This calibre of movie typically received widespread publicity which is clearly not justified.<br/><br/>The storyline is well written, but executed poorly. The movie though feels like an epic as it is 2 and half hours, which could easily been condensed. Some unnecessary scenes could have been eradicated. The pace of the story is too slow, filled in gaps with some irritating and baffling scenes. It took too long for the main villains Sandman and Venom to burst into the scene. By the time the movie introduced the villains, the movie was more than mid-way through the movie.<br/><br/>The characterisation of the movie is really bland. Sandman and Venom could have been further developed. With Venom, being the weakest character with no history underlying his character at all. Instead he growls like anything and scares everyone with his intimidating looks. Is this the rocky horror show if you get what I mean?<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 is the weakest link.

","There are definitely many reason why Spiderman 3 did not succeed in the way the two prequels did.

Another well-articulated reason might also be that scripts written under a decent amount of pressure simply won't be done blindfold. But the most sensible reason is in my eyes that the script was intended to please all kinds of audience, the action-freaks, the love story fans, the comic nerds and those who know that a Spiderman movie is always worth its money. Apparently this tactic didn't work out this time , cause despite of the potential of bundling the best comic book draft with the experience of the well-tried prequels Spiderman 3 never seems to find the right compilation of story elements, love/suffer and action to surpass the quality of its prequels.<br/><br/>But slow down..it still is well-performed with slight exceptions, features astonishing effects and presents an utterly comforting and satisfying ending.

","I have seen both of the previous spider-man movies and was a spider-man fan a few years before the release of Spider man 1. Therefore, if anything I am biased towards the quality of spider man 3 and yet it was still a disappointing movie for me.<br/><br/>The movie had the potential to exceed the other two: the same great actors from the other movies, cool villains(Sandman and New Goblin) and the black symbiote.<br/><br/>The black symbiote is one of my favourite parts of the spider man series and Peter's reaction to it wasn't handled well in my opinion. There are some scenes that show his new darkness well, but a few dancing scenes are not what I had in mind for dark spidey.<br/><br/>There are also too many villains in this movie. I don't wish to give too much away but the inclusion of a third villain in the last half hour was a bad choice. The origin of the Sandman and the events surrounding it(the way Flint Marko gets his powers) could have been improved as well. If you've seen the movie you probably know what I mean.<br/><br/>Overall, the action sequences and James Franco's(New Goblin's) performance is the high points of this movie. Kirsten Dunst plays a very needy Mary Jane in this movie, as opposed to the strong character of the last two movies. Tobey Mcguire wasn't completely convincing as dark spidey in certain scenes. For the most part, I was pleased with his performance, as well as those from supporting actors, most notably Thomas Haden Church(The Sandman)."

","Spiderman 3. well their is really nothing for me to say about the film itself. What I liked about it was the transformations of Thomas Hayden Church (sandman) And Topher Grace, (Eddie Brock/Venom).Good action sequences but that is all I need to quote about this film. Bryce Dallas Howard was okay. Still like and will like Kirsten Dunst. don't get me wrong Bryce will become better in her time of achievement. Special effects were good as well. But the story line was not good at all. Their were times when I wanted to fall asleep in the chair. Just waiting for the action to kick in. Lots and lots of romances here and there, and splitting up. Oh brother. If I were to see this again, I'd wait for the DVD to come out. Who directed this? Need a better script. Hope part four will be less make up time and more action. Okay. Let their be a marriage for Peter Parker and Mary Jane. in four. But may that be it. More action in part four. May it be lots of action in 4"

","We knew going in that there were too many heavies in this movie.<br/><br/>So it would likely flounder with set-up after set-up and reduce the screen time of the hero, as was the case in the nineties Batman movies.<br/><br/>But instead I think this film weaves those stories and keeps them trim, perhaps even surpassing the way the X-man movies have balanced many diverse characters. <br/><br/>The complaints I've seen about amnesia being a plot point for Harry being soap-opera level. . .may be true but it is in this context more suspenseful and more playful. Many great epic movies on this scale get away with cute or cliché elements which would fall flat in a simple talking heads bedroom and boardroom filler program. Here what is at stake has huge implications and the struggles of Peter Parker are very amusing and unique to this premise.<br/><br/>In a perfect world, yes, I would remove Sandman mainly because his character is ambiguous and his resolution offers no clean closure. The Venom story has a more satisfying resolution. But what Sandman offers is thematic texture. Is it a cop-out that Sandy wasn't really responsible? Is the real theme, ""Don't kill out of revenge because you might have the wrong man?"" Or is there a built in comic book code that forbids a pro-revenge theme?<br/><br/>Ultimately, no matter how I try to shuffle the tiles playing the ""Monday Morning Quarterback"" as many fans do, I see how Alvin Sargeant and the Raimi team had their hands full trying to incorporate Venom according to the wishes of Sony. That said, I never felt gee they are spending too much time on this or that the way I did watching Batman and Robin. They kept the scenes quick, and frankly I think this third film is every bit as good as the previous two."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","0","0","15 July 2007"," Decent sequel but not up to the original or Spiderman 2
","Spiderman 3 is not as good as Spiderman or Spiderman 2 but for a sequel it's not terrible. Spiderman has to fight three enemies: Sandman, Venom and New Goblin. He also has to fight to maintain his love relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Spidey doesn't do a very good job with any of these problems.<br/><br/>An early on chase between New Goblin and Spiderman through the skyscrapers of the city is the best action sequence in the film. Although there are many other chases and fights, they don't seem as exciting. Maybe it's because the film is almost 2 1/2 hours and it sometimes drags.<br/><br/>Credit to director Sam Raimi who is, in my opinion, the best action director working today. He does give a lot of screen time to develop the relationships between Spiderman and James Franco who blames him for killing his father and between Spiderman and Mary Jane. Besides that, Raimi has to introduce two new characters, Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman and Topher Grace as Venom.<br/><br/>Look for Ted Raimi, Sam's brother, who he always gives a small part to and who, as usual, is very funny, and also for Bruce Campbell, another actor who is always in Raimi's films, who is a riot as a French maitre d' and whose part got big laughs from the audience."

","The CGI did their job for the most part although Spidey often looks far too pixelated and cartoonish when the action starts rolling. The overall plot is great but the details and the acting are absolutely pathetic to the extreme!! The problem is they are borrowing the hype of Venom - the evil spiderman suit from an alien galaxy but then squandering that momentum on a VERY limp and thoroughly unrealistic and ridiculous drama that goes NOWHERE and has massively unbelievable super lame moments including Mary Jane and the hobgoblin making an omelette and then mimicking the scene from Pulp Fiction with Travolta and Uma as they dance to the twist. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at times it was so pathetically BAD in the plot development department. The action was OK-good but Geez Louise!! Could they not see that they had awful, horrendous acting and the sort of dramatic elements that make you want to tell your script writer to stop smoking crack??!<br/><br/>The ladies on the street reacting to the black formal suit montages w Peter Parker were especially pathetic, laughable, and just plain idiotic. Using the geeky hand movements of white boy disco was an especially pathetic saddening touch to the already disturbingly lame visual. <br/><br/>The acting is repulsively bad. The cgi is pretty good but for this budget, they screwed up royally and this qualifies as a TOTAL STINKER."

","Hello, welcome to my movie review, in this movie we join Peter Parker, aka , Spider Man, in his third movie. In a nutshell the movie involves him trying to propose to Mary Jane, while trying to control his anger when he wears the black spider man suit. But just how good is this movie? I've listed the good and bad parts.<br/><br/>Good: The action scenes were well done, I enjoyed the appearance of Venom, I also liked how Harry and The Sandman both redeemed themselves at the end of the movie. And I also liked the dark vibe you felt when Peter wore the black spidey suit. And also the movie did have some comic relief.<br/><br/>Bad: The movie involved a story that had Peter and Mary Jane conflicting in their relationship, even though it sounds like a good story, in order to make them have conflict, they had Mary Jane and Peter act like idiots toward each other, which just seemed a little out of character. Even though I enjoyed Venom's appearance, for such a great character, he really should've gotten more screen time, and also even though the dark part of the movie was good, they made Peter change his image, he'd wear all black and have his hair in his eyes like a Gothic kid, which seemed a little annoying.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an OK movie, 3 out of 5 stars, a rent or buy, whichever you want."

","Okay, I understand certain things have to happen in movies. I understand things like dramatic license, and I understand that you have to fudge things around to take that 30+ years of history and make it work.<br/><br/>Maybe it's cause I have a standing subscription to the current three Spidey titles, maybe it's cause I have a small collection of all the back issues from way before I was even born...<br/><br/>Maybe it's cause I know who Todd McFarlane is... I don't know the maybe's could go on forever....<br/><br/>But the simplest way to say this is this...<br/><br/>THEY TOOK SPIDER-MANS GREATEST VILLAIN EVER (even greater then the Goblin)AND GAVE HIM 20 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME!!!! Essentially i saw this, and felt that I was ripped off. I totally wanted my money back. Oh yes it had venom, but it didn't have Venom. It had Venom as supporting cast. I mean what is that? They took Sandman, and instead of leaving him as the two bit crook that he was way back, and still is today, turned him from a villain to a tortured character.<br/><br/>...and Spider-Man getting honored? ...Spider-Man getting the key's to the city?? ...Spider-Man getting anything other then ridiculed and hated, and always being at the wrong place at the wrong time?????<br/><br/>The whole movie was just to much, and not enough. I mean throwing random characters in the mix just cause they are in the books? Why not just have had JJJ kill off Gwen Stacy while your at it?<br/><br/>I liked the cast. I liked Topher Grace. I liked Hayden Christiansen. I liked Tobey McGuire. I liked pretty much everyone else... However...<br/><br/>Looking back at the Spider-Man Franchise as a whole, I have come to realize that there was one element that desperately needed to be corrected. Kiersten Dunst is no Mary Jane.<br/><br/>Mary Jane is the hottest chick you could imagine. She isn't cute. She isn't pretty. She's smoking HOT. She's the party girl. She's the one that every guy wants and no man can have. Dunst does not do that justice at all.<br/><br/>For all intent and purposes, she's a lot like Lindsey Lohan, minus all the drugs, alcohol, car wrecks, and random sex. That's who Mary Jane is...<br/><br/>Anymore, I have come to realize that all Hollywood needs to do anymore is slap a familiar name on the titles, and droves of sheeple (sadly in this case myself included) will flock and give Hollywood millions of dollars on crap. But hey, don't forget that no matter how much you hated it, your still going to buy the DVD wont you? I certainly wont. I'll save my money and give it the real artist at Marvel.<br/><br/>...And thus concludes my fanboy rant..."

","Most of the people I know who saw ""Spider-Man 3"" say they didn't like it. But to be honest, I think that if the bar hadn't been set so high by ""Spider-Man 2"", I think they would all say they liked it.<br/><br/>The biggest criticism I hear is that the villains don't have enough to do. Admittedly, I don't think Venom (Topher Grace), Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) or even New Goblin (James Franco) quite measure up to Willem Dafoe's performance as the original Green Goblin of the first film. But to be honest, I never thought the villains were the heart of any of the movies. Instead, it is Peter Parker's relationships with Mary Jane, Aunt May and Harry.<br/><br/>Where this film succeeds is where Sam Raimi's strengths lay: Firstly, the kinetic fireworks of his cinematography, not only during the action sequences, but also in the parts where Mary Jane and Peter are struggling with their relationship. Secondly, Raimi has known for a long time how to get the best performances out of his actors when the camera is absolutely still.<br/><br/>To address the film's main flaw, and the reason I still rate it lower than ""2"": Yes, the new villains disappoint, especially for comic-book purists. In the original comic, Sandman was an unrepentant crook. In this film, he is treated sympathetically and is given a seriously ill daughter that he steals for. (If they wanted a sympathetic villain, they should have used the Lizard or Man-Wolf, who had no choice in what they did). In the original comic, the New Goblin was a mentally ill drug addict. In the movie, he's merely a spoiled rich kid. And I thought his turning to the good side at the end felt forced. (I don't know how the movie Venom compares to his comic-book counterpart because I have no use for Marvel Comics published after Stan Lee quit writing them and became a mere figurehead).<br/><br/>However, because of Sam Raimi's skill as a director, the strengths of the actors, and the willingness to show Peter Parker having adult relationships with his loved ones, I give this 8 out of 10. If there is a Spider-Man 4, however, I will likely stay home if Raimi is not at the helm."

And I got it from Spider-Man 3. Maybe I should have wished from something else instead...<br/><br/>Because this one tries too much: too many characters, too many cheesy jokes, too many Aunt May speeches and too much bad acting from Toby Maguire and James Franco... Even good performances by Thomas Haden Church or Topher Grace cannot make up for the lack of continuity, depth or focus.<br/><br/>Because Spider-Man 3 throws at you a long series of events that hardly make up a storyline much less a movie.

","I liked the first Spider-Man movie a lot. I liked the second somewhat less, but i still liked it a lot as well. Few movies have managed to capture the comic book-adventure feeling in quite the same way. The two first movies managed to be dramatic and funny at the same time, while still managing to get the best out of the comic.<br/><br/>This however is something else completely. I wonder who at the studio made the decision to replace everything in the movie with a special effect? Where there used to be comedy, there are no special effects. Where there used to be action, there are now special effects. It's ridiculous to even call it special effects since there is probably hardly a single frame in this movie that is not edited with CGI. And trust me, i have nothing inherently against CGI, i only dislike it when it becomes a substitute for real film-making. And it does here.<br/><br/>First of all a good villain is missing. A lot of the quality from the first two movies were Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina. Both were great villains in their own way, although Dafoe had more fun themes to work with. Here we have a man made of sand that makes you more sad than anything, and an ""evil"" Spider-man which definitely makes me sad. While Haden-Church does the best he can with Sandman, the character is just not a lot of fun. He's more the tragic kind of villain. He has my sympathies, but he won't carry the movie on his own. Topher Grace in the sort of villain/asshole part is also OK, but again he doesn't have a lot of fun material to work with.<br/><br/>Besides missing a proper villain though, this movie has one major flaw and that is the effects. While they are probably technically very well done, they look expensive anyway, they are difficult to look at. At least for me it felt many times as though i was watching an animated roller-coaster. People were flying through the air, punching each other and my eyes started watering after a while. First of all, it's too exhausting to watch - especially for an effects-packed 140 minutes, and second it's not very well done despite the technical qualities. After all, i want to be able to see what's going on, now it was just things buzzing in front of my eyes. It hurt after about 80 minutes. After 140 minutes i was ready to throw away my lenses.<br/><br/>The third point that bothered me was the running time. Like i said above, 140 minutes is steep for something this action- and effects-packed. And besides that the movie really doesn't have the script nor the story for this kind of marathon-like running time. I was desperately bored by the end of the movie, and felt for a while it was the worst thing i'd seen in the theater for a long time. Of course, it wasn't that bad, but painfully slow endings will destroy even the best movie experiences.<br/><br/>In the end this isn't a disaster of an experience. I can't say i enjoyed this movie though. It was a mix between high expectations from the first two installments, and a general disappointment in the fact that an obviously huge budget has given such sloppy and hysterical special effects. I want more than this from Spider-Man. This just won't cut it. I rate it 4/10."

","What is my impression of this movie? The first thing to bore me out like hell were the CGI intro titles that were MORE THAN 3 MINUTES long and probably were worth a couple of millions to make. The further pace was pretty boring as well, even considering a number of action scenes. Now, about the action scenes. I think there was none to find without blatant goofs in it. And believe me, if you're watching a movie in the cinema for the first time and all you see ARE GOOFS it's not a good thing. For example (******SPOILERS******):<br/><br/>When the crane crushes the building again, the lower floor is completely empty.<br/><br/>The Spidey goes all along to save one blond chick and gain public respect for that, ignoring other people that might have been hurt by the crane and obviously crushed by the debris. Way to go, Spiderman.<br/><br/>The Sandman, when rising from sand for the first time, regenerates CLOTHES. I mean, if he remembers his body structure and rebuilds it with his will, how the hell he transmutes inorganic matters that doesn't belong to his cellar structure??<br/><br/>(and now about the last battle - the dumbest part in the whole movie):<br/><br/>The written challenge in the net looks stupid.<br/><br/>The TV reporter's comments are simply PATHETIC. I mean, for example, imagine that you're filming a rock golem beating up a tiny man in a spider's suit from afar. Should this make the reporter go ""oh my god! What violence! What a cruelty!""??<br/><br/>The reasoning why Sandman participates is: ""Let's join forces""; ""Okay""...<br/><br/>The sandman so far has been indestructible but a couple of comparably tiny missiles knock him down easily.<br/><br/>The black spider thing hesitates to kill the main hero and talks until he has a chance to resist somehow. Where HAVEN'T I seen this? Pathetic.<br/><br/>The explosion where the black thing dies along with the photographer leaves a clean floor.<br/><br/>The Sandman apologizes for being the Last Big Boss monster of the ridiculous computer game. Again, pathetic. (******Spoilers ends here******)<br/><br/>Overall, the ending was the most horrible. When I watched it, I thanked gods none of my friends sees me watching that garbage. The only thing saving this film might be the drama, although it's boring as hell. The CGI's are not very credible, and I really don't see where the 300 millions did go. I suggest labeling this film as ""The Worst Superhero Movie ever"", although one might argue that many stand in the line for that position already. Well, 4.5/10, I'd say."

There must be something wrong with that! It's not comic, it's a stupid and uninteresting love story. I don't get why they make those movies. It's not for adults, not for kids, not for teenagers. The graphics is poor. Spider-man looks totally unrealistic and bulky. And it's in 2007! With many million dollar budget? C'mon! Movement is so stupid, the physics is completely omitted, it's so unnatural, so weird looking. Combat scenes are so poorly written, with no understanding of physics at all, no realism at all. It just makes you wanna laugh. Venom was more muscular (they just used the model that their had I guess, why bother?). Screenplay is awful. The actor's play is bad, the cast itself is bad. Kirsten Dunst is so not Mary J. Tobey Maquire is so not in place. Lynn Kressel and Francine Maisler have done such a bad job. I'm so sorry for GREAT actor Willem Daffoe. Well, there is nothing we can do. I don't get it, do they think that you can just name a movie Spider-Man - and it will be successful? And people will eat it just like that? Don't think so.

","As a fan of both the comic and the movie series this film draws its heritage from, I had a lot of expectations for this flick. Maybe that's why I left the theater unsatisfied, my movie palette somewhat unquenched. But in a fan boy fit, I dismissed that theory. Later on, as I had time to reflect, I began to wonder, maybe it's just because the movie flat-out sucked? But that didn't seem entirely true. It was only later, like a week later, that my conflicted brain came up with the answer. <br/><br/>Both accusations were prevalent.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3, in many, but not all ways, is a grossly inferior film to its fun and exciting predecessors. Gone is the atmosphere of innocence and just-corny-enough ambiance that let you Merrily stroll through the Sam Raimi's and Stan Lee's world like a little kid again. Instead, you receive a film that, ironically, feels very much structurally like a spider web looks visually. It's has complexity, interweaving plot lines, abundant characters, and multiple character personality track-switches. The problem is, it just has to damn many of them.<br/><br/>The entire film just has, plain-and-simple, TO MUCH GOING ON. It truly does feel like two scripts cut-and-pasted together into one. Cleverly cut and pasted, to be sure, but cut and pasted none the less. Plot threads left dangling in the second film, like Harry Osborn finding his fathers Goblin Lair and Mary Jane finally admitting her love for Peter, are addressed, but very poorly used. Harry turns into the second goblin for what ultimately feels like the greater of five seconds, only to have his memory magically erased by a bonk to the head. True, he turns evil again later, but only to have his green ass handed to him by a black suit-clad peter and in the process, turns good yet again. Ugh.<br/><br/>This actually leads to another major problem with Spider Man 3. The Villains. There are three of them, Neo Goblin (I'm sorry, Goblin 2 is a stupid name and we all know it), The Sandman, and Venom. Unfortunately, all of them get as much screen time at once as almost everything else in the movie, approximately five minutes, and you never really feel connected with them like you did with the original Goblin and Doc Ock. The one who gets the worst of it is Venom, arguably the focal villain of the film and a character who is rapidly receiving a bad rap about only appearing at the end of the film for about ten minutes. I recently read a comparison to the villain of the movie ""Transformers,"" the robot Megatron, who also has a similar predicament and was stated to have been ""venomized."" While Neo Goblin and Sandman both get a better deal in this movie, they too suffer from lack of attention, and in the end, just feel flat.<br/><br/>The amount of just sheer STUFF going on is almost mind-bending. There's Peter wanting to propose to MJ, the (poorly done) landing of the Venom symbiont on Earth, the introduction of Venoms alter ego Eddie Brock, Peter's relationship with a skitzophrenic Harry, the background of the Sandman, Peter wanting revenge on his Uncles ""real"" murderer who IS the Sandman, Peter turning evil and pushing MJ away after unknowingly bonding with the Venom symbiont, Peter ruining Eddie Brocks life and wanting revenge on him, Peter dating the barely used Gwen Stacy and ruining MJ's life in the process...and all of this is happening virtually at once in a two hour long movie. <br/><br/>Sam Raimi said he didn't want Venom in the movie, and you can definitely feel it. The whole film plays like a machine with an extra cog stuck in it, and in the end, it damages the experience.<br/><br/>I had a lot of hope for this film. As it stands, it could have been a lot worse, but somehow, that's not much comfort.<br/><br/>6/10. Likable, but in the end, forgettable."

","After reading some of the comments and reviews on Spiderman 3 I was a bit shaky about watching this film at the theatres. But is it as disjointed as some say, a big-budget nothing as others did, or indeed too much romance and little time for anything else? Well, let me start with confirming that the film does feel rather disjointed. The conception and execution of the plans/plots of some of the characters seem to happen too quickly at times, at times without the usual intermittent change of scene; *wham* *boom* character flips from good to bad and vice-versa, now trying to destroy NY, the other trying to save it from oblivion etc... Regardless, it doesn't manage to ruin the film so I'd prefer to wait until the DVD version comes out to see if deleted scenes are re-integrated into the movie before the axe is dropped on its score.<br/><br/>It's quite clear that the Mary Jane issue is starting to consume too much time in the movies. Since the first film, the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane has absorbed more and more time. Not only does she appear in over half of the last film but, as in Spiderman 1 AND 2, she is yet again taken hostage by the villain(s) in the final battle, offering us the usual 10 mins of helpless obstacle dodging, not only by Spiderman... but herself. Leave the poor girl alone for goodness' sake! Hopefully, the demise of Harry Osborn should make their relationship just a bit less complicated and less focused on. So, I don't agree that the 90% of the film feels like a Dawson's Creek re-run as said in one of the previous comments, though in one of the scenes (the one on the bridge where Harry's 'dark' plot starts to unfold) that aforementioned comment did echo in my ears for a bit, but it doesn't last too long, thank goodness...<br/><br/>I also don't agree with people who said that there were too many villains and that they were not given enough space and depth. At the end of the film it's clear that both Sandman and Venom will appear again if the saga continues, especially the latter one of course, so one should be safe in the knowledge that more will come out in the future. As mentioned above, there are indications that this film was transitory and that the end of certain long-standing issues could be followed by the appearance of new ones which could re-generate the series a bit. Having a character such as Harry so close to the superhero is a problem when making such a film as neither Peter nor Spiderman can ignore him, therefore their feud always demanded its fair share of space in all of the films, but now that it's settled (hopefully) the story can move on and open up a bit to new plots and characters and maybe a proper re-visiting of familiar, yet underplayed, ones.<br/><br/>To conclude, this film will not be universally loved or hated by Spidey fans. You'll just have to go and see it for yourself. Though scenes like the (looong) one where Peter shows off in front of all of New York just to show us how 'bad' he's become simply because he changed his hairstyle, wears darker clothes and is more open with the ladies make the movie stutter in places, but it's still a solid film which is worth watching.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? 7/10"
"Rcwilkinson123","8","0","0","5 July 2007"," Fantastic, People's Expectations were too high
","With the brilliance of the first two Spider-man films, way too much was expected out of Spider-man 3. Yet, if people went back and watched it with lowered, not out-of-this-world expectations, they would realize the smarts behind this film too, thanks to director Sam Raimi and the interesting way in which he explored the responsibilities of such a beloved superhero.<br/><br/>To understand that this film delivered what it needed to, look back on the themes of each movie: the first explores how Peter was learning to accept his responsibilities; ""S2"" explores if he is willing to accept the responsibilities; ""S3"" explores if Peter is going to do the right things with those responsibilities. And in that sense, ""Spidey 3"" does just that. Yes, perhaps his delve into Venom and his vengeful self is a bit brief, but the audience gets the point. Others complained that New Goblin should have been evil longer, that they should have shown the city's reaction to a new Goblin in New York. But that was not the point of New Goblin. The point was to show that when he felt like he needed to avenge his father's death, when he was full of vengeance, his life was miserable. After he suffered amnesia, and he no longer felt his previous need to kill Spider-man, his life was happy. It was the same with Peter. At film's beginning, his life is great. Once he learns that his uncle's killer is still at large, he becomes vengeful and loses the happiness in his life. This is the paramount theme of the movie that people seemed to not understand.<br/><br/>The action and effects are incredible as well. New Goblin is awesome; he's got cooler gadgets than his dad. The concept of the Sandman was orchestrated rather quick, but well for how quick they had to do it, thanks to the limitations of the studio. And Venom is extremely creepy; the symbiote is great in representing vengeance. 3/4 stars"
"BritishPatriot","5","0","0","4 July 2007"," A bad case of a missed opportunity
","I was majorly disappointed with Spiderman 3. <br/><br/>Not enough, or barely any, time given to new characters and too much stuff repeated from the previous films. <br/><br/>I'd say almost every character (alive or dead) who had been in the first or second film re-appeared in the third. Fair enough Raimi likes to keep the story running in continuity like it happens in the comics, but enough of the re-hashing. Do we really need to see Parker's landlord again or his goofy daughter? That was already covered in Spider-man 2. Shouldn't Mary Jane either succeed or fail as an actress? Having her in the same place she's been for 2 movies was silly. Also, Aunt May and Peter sharing another scene where they talk about Uncle Ben. OK we get it. We got it in the first two movies!<br/><br/>Harry Osborne changes allegiance about 10 times, which I personally found quite annoying.<br/><br/>Thomas Hayden Church was great as Sandman but barely got any dialogue.<br/><br/>Venom is a superb character but did nothing. He had 1 great line at the very end when Spiderman tries to reason with the Eddie Brock part of his personality, to which Venom retracts the mask and says ""I like being insane"". That brilliantly sums up the character and highlights what they should've showcased throughout the film. Like other users have said, there is no explanation to Venom's origins (they could have at least used his origin from the original Spiderman animated series of the 90's). Also how on earth could Eddie Brock see it was Peter Parker removing the alien costume when he was so high up in the church and Eddie was on the ground?<br/><br/>In the comic (and the way it should have been on screen) Eddie Brock is older than Peter Parker and more of a brute force. Venom never once said ""We"" instead of ""I"" in the film (which could have been explained had the story been played out properly over the whole film), plus his voice was just the same as Eddie Brock's, where was the menace of that?<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes or so are a drag and the script seems to have been written in a hurry and Venom added purely due to the pressure from fans to see him on screen. He didn't even look as menacing as he should have done.<br/><br/>All in all this film makes me think of Batman and Robin, in that it features 3 villains and one of them is seriously misused (Bane in Batman and Robin was wasted as a pseudo-Frankenstein's Monster) and here we have Venom, completely misused.<br/><br/>Talk about missed opportunities.<br/><br/>Parker goes bad and does what? He says at one point ""Ive done terrible things"". What's that then, doing a John Travolta impression and wearing a dark suit? They should've had him kill Harry at least that would have made sense and been dramatic, but sadly Raimi went for the audience pleaser.<br/><br/>Good Points: The Sandman emerging and using his powers. The alien costume was well done, especially right at the end when separated from Eddie Brock.<br/><br/>Bad Points: Not enough villain screen time. A rushed script and Venom being added just for the hell of it.<br/><br/>To sum up: They should have probably given Venom a cameo role at the end of this film and continued the story in Spiderman 4. If this is to be Sam Raimi's or Spiderman's film swansong, it has failed to go out with a bang and remains the weakest of an all together excellent film series. Poor script, lame action, and clichés coming out of all corners. A missed opportunity to do something special. X-Men 3, Alien 3, Terminator 3, Superman 3, Rocky 3, Star Trek 3 - the curse of the threequal has struck again!<br/><br/>Let's hope Fantastic Four 3 doesn't disappoint."
"tyrylo","6","0","0","3 July 2007"," Why God? Why????????
","This movie was the most disappointing thing I've ever seen, EVER. They wasted the venom saga completely, besides, they explained NOTHING about venom in this over-rated piece of crap. He was just randomly thrown into the mix of the sandman, Pete and MJ's relationship, and Harry's evil scheme to ultimately get back at Peter. The whole movie I was aching in my seat to see venom and when the LAST 15 MINUTES of the movie finally showed its ugly face I wanted to kill the person who was in charge of the special effects. What kept my interest were the awesome effects for the sandman, VENOM'S SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, venom's mouth looked so dumb when he was talking, he sounded stupid, and wasn't Eddie Brock some huge body builder who could bench like 800 lbs or something, instead they get the nerdy kid from That 70's Show. To sum up, the acting sucked, the story was weak, and TOBEY MCGUIRE CANNOT CRY TO SAVE HIS LIFE!!! There is a scene when Peter cries on a bridge in the park, I laughed so hard. What was Sam Raimi thinking? The best part was Bruce Campbells cameo appearance as the hilarious French waiter. Also, Peter's little Goth, Emo phase made me want to slap John Travolta for ever inspiring that moment (Saturday Night Fever). If a 4th one is made, bring back venom, or I will hate this series."
"Pavel-8","6","0","0","3 July 2007"," This could be the end of Spider-Man.
","Buckle your seat belts. It's time for the summer movie season. Let's get this out of the way first: this is the summer of the sequel. Of the ten most hyped movies in the next four months, eight of them are sequels, and seven of those are at least the third in the series. Sequels are a tricky business, because there are often massive built-in expectations and points of reference. They can't be too similar to the prequels without risking boredom, but if they stray too far from the tone of the original, they risk alienating their audiences. Like last year's summer season, this year kicks off with the third movie in a blockbuster series. In 2006, the first out of the gate was ""Mission: Impossible 3""; in 2007, it is ""Spider-Man 3"".<br/><br/>When we last left Spidey three years ago, he had rid the world of Doctor Octopus, and had his identity revealed to his two closest friends, his girlfriend Mary Jane and his buddy/enemy Harry Osborn, whose father was the Green Goblin in the original picture. ""SM3"" picks up not long after, in a New York City where Spider-Man has gone glam, with his name and image plastered all over the media. Peter Parker relishes his newfound fame, so much that it begins to impede his relationship with Mary Jane. As that hits the rocks, he finds himself vulnerable at an inopportune time, which leads to the chaos that forms the crux of the movie.<br/><br/>One strong point of the movie is that is has the same principal cast as first two and also possesses a continuous story arc. Both features (think about it) are actually rarities among superhero trilogies. That definitely helps in the continuity department, because the characters, locations, and relationships are familiar. On the downside, the similarities amplify the fact that little of the movie is original. We've seen Spidey swoop and soar through city canyons, and we've seen him fight nasty villains. With the exception of an early chase scene, nothing is particularly different, either in style or content. That's disappointing, as a Spider-Man movie begs to be exhilarating. Say what you will about the vastly different styles of the three Mission: Impossibles, but each of them had a unique feel that individually defined each movie and made like events more interesting.<br/><br/>While the lack of novelty is disappointing, the most significant attempt at being unique provides the most unusual portion of the movie. As Parker/Spidey undergoes a transformation in the middle act, the movie takes a bizarre turn into romantic comedy. The idea is commendable; too few movies take too few chances. But this one doesn't work. For twenty minutes you understand what is happening, but still can't quite believe it. It would be like if Golden State had gone into a stall offense when they were up 20 against Dallas last night. Sure, it makes sense given the circumstances, but it still feels completely wrong and out of place.<br/><br/>The bigger problem is the end consequence of the emotional speed bump. It's something very rare in superhero movies: Peter Parker is not likable. Granted, that is part of the point, but when one starts disliking the title character, one loses interest in the movie, and that is huge strike against this kind of flick.<br/><br/>Like the later Batman installments, ""SM3"" also has too many characters and stories for one movie. Instead of completely marginalizing the hero like ""Batman & Robin"" did, ""SM3"" races through the stories of the antagonists. Two of the three could easily have filled the requisite two-plus hours in finer fashion. Then the villains' stories could have been fleshed out better to create the rare well-rounded superhero movie. Not only that, but Peter Parker's issues could have been expanded as well, in a manner more like its predecessors. One of the taglines for the movie is The Battle Within, and that promising fight unfortunately is not fully addressed, though in a pleasant surprise, numerous positive themes of responsibility and choice are.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I must provide the disclaimer that Spider-Man just doesn't do it for me. Batman does; Superman does; but Spider-Man doesn't. Maybe it has to do with Tobey Maguire's relatively diminutive stature, that I don't believe he could be a butt-kicking hero. Maybe the face-covering mask dehumanizes Spider-Man for me. Whatever.<br/><br/>People won't care that much; ""Spider-Man 3"" will still make a webful of money. If you like the other two Spider-Man movies, you'll enjoy this one, which isn't painful to watch. There are plenty of characters and eventually plenty of action. But ""Spider-Man 3"" matches its predecessors ways it shouldn't and doesn't match them in ways it should.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 6 of 10 for the first big release of the summer and perhaps the final Spider-Man movie. Not bad, but nothing special."

","Spiderman Three was a big disappointment. It was not good, and most certainly not great. It was melodramatic, and there were more miscasts than cats at an evil spinsters' home. James Cromwell's talent (which there isn't much of) is wasted in this. Topher Grace, who is great (well, good) in That Seventies Show is terrible in this. I didn't buy him for one second as the big burly bad guy. Speaking of big and burly, we find ourselves wondering why Thomas Haden Church (Academy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Sideways) is in this poor excuse for a film. And why put a villain as week as the Sandman in the last (hopefully) Spiderman. If you were going to put in a villain, why not put in Kingpin, or some other significant bad guy. I just didn't like it. I don't think that Tobey Maguire is a good actor in the least, and I think he should not 'grace' us in any other movies. Don't go and expect to see a great film, or even a good one. Go just to see action and visual effects, which are quite exceptional, but that's the only thing exceptional about it."

Overall this movie has its moments and I would rate it around 72% for the violence scenes and the fact I liked all the other movies on Spiderman so heres to hoping that Spiderman 4,5 and 6(which I heard they were going to make) and look for the 5 second of Stan Lee if you have not watched it yet."
"Listen_to_the_Law","6","0","0","2 July 2007"," The third isn't bad, but it's time to end the series now
","Spider-man 3 has shattered the box office record previously held by Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest for highest-grossing opening weekend ever, taking in $151 million compared to Pirate's $135.6 million last July. Although never poor movies, the Spider-man series always seems like the least deserving of the super-hero movies to garner such money. The drawing points of the Spider-man flicks has always been the web-action, but why market a movie on that when the bulk of it is spent with this love story trash between Peter Parker (McGuire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst)?<br/><br/>At the beginning, Peter is chatting it up with Mary Jane, and their chemistry appears to be better than ever. However good the acting may be, the love angle still sucks. Anyway, Peter later tells Aunt May (Rosemary Harris- good actress, wrong movie) about his plans, so once they open their mouths, they quickly kill any hope of the movie picking up. For a few brief seconds, we get to witness Spiderman swinging across town, and he even gets into a mediocre battle with the New Goblin. The New Goblin is Harry Osborn (James Franco), the original Goblin's son. Spiderman's battles seem to be sequences to enhance the real plot of the story. Now of course, Spiderman is human, so Peter Parker can't just fly around all day- he has to bring in money to keep a good living. Peter works at the Daily Bugle, an ignorantly-titled and fictional New York newspaper. Making a return is Mr. Jameson, the manager of the Daily Bugle. He looks, acts, and sounds like Vince McMahon, and is the man who he always has been, ordering his minions around with ego-driven orders. As you can guess, his character is a laugh-riot, and most of that is because of his witty temper. Jameson hired Peter Parker, yet he doesn't know that Spiderman is his alter-ego. And Jameson hates Spiderman. Anyways, like every make-believe work office, there is competition. Eddie Brock is a photographer, just like Peter Parker. Eddie Brock is played by Topher Grace, who is known to everyone as Eric Foreman from That 70s Show. They feud from the get-to, and are each assigned to snap cool pictures of Spiderman. After Parker dispatches Brock after catching him cheating by making up pictures of Spiderman, Brock gets his revenge by being Venom. Yes, that's correct: Eric Foreman is Venom!<br/><br/>Now, I could talk more about the story, but for two reasons I wont. One, I don't necessarily spoil movies when I review them. Two, I will dive into a hostel pool of negativity. I don't feel like being negative right now, but if you honestly want to know what happens in the rest of the story, expect to see too much of Peter Parker, including an emo-punk side. Too much of Parker equals not enough Spiderman. Not enough Spiderman equals a lack of other interesting characters, such as Sandman (a shape-shifting man made of sand), Venom, and even the New Goblin. The reason as to why there should be more time on these characters is because of just how cool they are: Sandman grows in size and is one hell of a special effect. Venom has perhaps one of the coolest spandex-like suits ever seen in a superhero movie. And for the first time ever, Harry Osborn grows to be a character who isn't annoying. But then there's that unexplained black stuff.<br/><br/>Here's the bottom line: Spider-man 3 is not a bad film; it's a good film with many misjudgments. All of the main actors seem to have picked it up, the newcomers did a respectable job, favorites like JJJ returned, and we still got to see some cool web action. On the other hand, way too much time is spent on non-superhero activities, Peter Parker's troubles (who pays money to see a geeky young male adult struggle through his love life?), andBroadway musicals? In a superhero movie? I think not.<br/><br/>Good) Sandman, Venom, New Goblin, Mr. Jameson<br/><br/>Bad) Peter Parker, the entire middle of the movie, not enough time spent on the villains May<br/><br/>25th) If you haven't seen Spiderman 3 by that date, you can completely forget about it"

","This movie it like a collection of short stories stitched together with the flimsiest glue. There is brilliance. The animation of the birth of the sand creature is perhaps the best realistic animation I have ever seen on screen. It was sheer poetry, movie magic at its best.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed swinging along with Peter between buildings in the first Spider Man movie. I did not get that enjoyment this time. The action was speeded up so much I felt an outsider watching machines zip about hyped up on some alien drug. It was all too fast to follow and too exaggerated to accept as real. I was no longer a participant, merely an observer.<br/><br/>I am gay and this movie offers up acres of male eye candy. Topher Grace (aka Eric Forman) drops his nerd persona and plays an irresistibly sexy, evil character. James Franco looks like some 50s pop idol with a smile that could melt steel. Thomas Hayden Church is massive, hard and terrifying in his intensity.<br/><br/>It is a metaphoric morality tale where evil, drugs, power are represented by a black, enveloping, alien life force. These black strands bestow power, euphoria and magnify character defects, just like drugs or war. I took the movie as a metaphor for the way the USA has become corrupted and needs to return to its old red-white-and-blue morality, not stooping to selfishness, sadism, gluttony and greed.<br/><br/>There are four villains Spidy has to contend with, often ganging up on him. The movie dragged a bit for me. However, some of the scenes with the sand creature were so entrancing the rest of the movie was irrelevant. Later on in the movie, the animation was dreadful -- reminiscent of an old Godzilla movie. It was like seeing an old Vermeer painting touched up by Ronald McDonald."

","Spiderman 3 is a much more ambitious film than its two predecessors. It features three villains/plot threads: the Peter Parker/Spiderman-Harry Osborn/Goblin-Mary Jane Watson love triangle thread, the Flint Marko/Sandman-Uncle Ben's murder revenge thread, and the Eddie Brock/Venom rivalry thread.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Sam Raimi and co. can't keep all of this going. The movie starts off promisingly enough with the inevitable Spiderman-Goblin showdown. But then it bogs down in the middle and never quite gains momentum again.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire, so good at playing a nerd with hidden hero potential, is unconvincing as a bad guy. And when did Mary Jane Watson become so whiny? There are references to everything from The Blob to The Nutty Professor to Charlotte's Web to Saturday Night Fever, but none of this coalesces. The big Spiderman-Goblin vs. Venom-Sandman climax feels more like a professional wrestling tag team match than a real emotional payoff.<br/><br/>I've read that Sam Raimi didn't want to do the Eddie Brock/Venom plot thread, that it was forced upon him by the producers. If true, that's unfortunate; one less plot thread might have given him room to more fully develop the other two. Let's hope Spiderman 4 is better."

"drnrg31","9","0","0","22 June 2007"," Great Actors, but maybe just a tad too much to take on?
","Don't get me wrong I understood the whole thing and how the stories came together, but it felt a little too rushed. Maybe it should have been a two part movie like the Matrix series. Anyways that said, my review will consist mainly as a review on different actors and the characters they play.<br/><br/>We start with M.J who is played by Kristen Durst. She does her part well. She is believable in her emotions like when she is fired from her Broadway ""gig"" and when she is strung up on a huge Venom Web while our other heroes are fighting below her. What I didn't believe too much was the fact that she was presented as a rather Jealous individual. I know Spidy's Kiss with Gwen was unforgivable(the same way he kissed M.J. in part 1), but she really didn't give Pete a chance. and the way she just ran into Harry's arms afterwords is just wrong. She also seemed to be very envious of Spiderman's current popularity among the citizens, but I guess this was a way to show her human side.<br/><br/>Next is James Franco who plays Hobgoblin? Well, actually New Goblin, because he never even wears the real costume. He plays an excellent role as Spiderman's best friend- turned bitter enemy, because of his own father's death. He does really well with the see-sawing job of emotions his script calls for. First he is pure evil on verge of destroying Spidy, then loses his memory to amnesia, then we see him all friends with him, but at the same time he kisses his girl. Then he is back to his avengful ways, then teams up with Spiderman, before finally getting killed in one of the movies most satisfying scenes. Wow that takes great acting.<br/><br/>Sandman is up next played wonderfully by Thomas Hayden Church. He looks like a carbon copy of the original comic. His story is great and played with delicately well. I myself never considered Sandman a real ruthless villain. All his actions are driven by his sick daughter's health. Even the money he steals is just so she can be cured. The fact that he is the actual person that killed Peter's uncle only adds to the sympathy one fells for him, after his story is told. He is actually a victim in the movie. His powers are punishment enough and it's only right that Spiderman lets him go.<br/><br/>Topher Grace is Eddie Brock, but not Venom. He is perfect for the obnoxious Eddie Brock(even though he is considerably skinnier than Marvel's version), but his lines at the Bugle and the way he outshines Peter on screen is Marvelous(no pun intended) The only gripe with his role was his Venom transformation. I think showing his face on Venom was inadequate to the characters menacing nature. I mean he is Eric Foreman. Yeah he can play Eddie Brock, but Venom. I think once Venom absorbed Eddie it should have been that. End of Eddie. Does everyone else think he looked like a buffed up Vampire.<br/><br/>Toby as Spiderman. He is the embodiment of The Spiderman character. Only this time we get to see his evil side, because of the symbionite, Venom. His darker side is actually what I expected ? Still kinda nerdy guy who thinks he is cooler than he is. Only his Landlord's daughter actually dug him. The whole going out with Gwen to make M.J. jealous only shows how inexperienced Peter was at being bad. Still, the scene at the club was very entertaining and the transformation from cool EMo dancing guy to furious violent EMO guy was great acting from Toby, but please no more crying.<br/><br/>All in all the movie was a great Roller-coaster ride. Spectacular Effects with the Sandman character. His scene of the transformation at the experimental site was simply astonishing. The way he struggles with himself to control his newfound abilities was really Human. <br/><br/>Everyone did wonders with their parts, but were given too little time to develop them to a full extent. Venom got the short end of the stick with less than 15 mins on screen. I really hope they bring him back for a later installment.<br/><br/>I think at this time the series is going very strong. It got the biggest Box Office opening in history(that may well be surpassed by Fantascic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer), but nonetheless the Spiderman series is definitely the best. Drama ,Action ,Comedy and even some Moral lessons were all rolled up into one incredible FUN TIME ride. Enjoy!"

","Spiderman has always been my favorite superhero, and ever since i heard they where making movies finally i was at first really excited to see them. But for me i am really disappointed. Spiderman never had this much drama, 60% of all these movies are Peter parker talking about Mary jane and the drama around them. They should be more about peter as a scientist figuring out stuff about villains and getting in all sorts of trouble with other villains on the way. But no everything is about Mary jane. i seriously thought after watching the second one that nothing could make me watch the next one, i was wrong.<br/><br/>When i saw they where making a Spiderman movie with Venom ( my all time favorite villain) The first thing i thought was '' oh sweet Jesus they better not screw this up, movie wont be that good but how can they make venom look bad? <br/><br/>I was wrong AGAIN, Venom used to be this huge Bad ass with a really monstrous threatening voice. Even Eddie brock used to be a big strong badass. But in the MOVIE he is a skinny white dude..... i then thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, yes it did. Venom had lost his monstrous voice, instead there was a skinny white dude with a girlish accent talking for him with a weird sound in the background....even Venom was small and skinny. Come on.<br/><br/>Also where are all the other villains? Kingpin for example? spiderman is supposed to be with super villains around every corner, Where is Black Cat? He wasn't with mary jane for so long he had other relationships. I also don't like the actor who plays spiderman at all, He is so far from Peter parker. I really can go on and on of things that bug me about this movie but i did see some good things too. The director clearly loves Sandman and Green goblin. I thought those stories where put out quite nicely and i liked the suspense between harry and peter.

I'm glad they kept Venom till the end. I think he looked great and every time i say him on screen i said ""wow"". And of course there's the story with mj and peter. All in all i thought it was a decent movie. COULD have been better, but it satisfied my hunger."

","OK, sandman tries to destroy spiderman along with new greengoblin(harry) who enters a hospital the first 30 minutes of the movie.

Finally, Venom, whom is one of spidermans enemies whom he could not defeat is shown maybe 20 minutes of the movie and is not even shown fighting much with harry and spiderman. Its just so stupid! I wanted to see an awesome fighting scene with Venom and he's not even shown fighting that much! The ending scene was so boring! Everything in this movie is totally predictable."

","Initially I was impressed with Sammies visualization of venom and the Sandman. Venom happens to be a villain I have great interest in. And I believe that if you could get one villain in this movie it would be Venom, and the birth of Carnage. But it doesn't happen here. And that was a major downer to me. There was a lot more of Venom in the comics, and he was a force to be reckon with.<br/><br/>The fight sequences in the Spiderman movies are becoming increasingly brutal at the expense of bad lines. Spider-man 3 is a dark movie struggling to maintain that Spider-Man feel of the first two movies. I found myself watching a movie similar to the last two Schumacher-Batman catastrophes. I don't care for Spider-Man all that much but I am interested in his enemies.<br/><br/>I have to say I give credit to Sam Raimi for taking a stab at Venom. Yet I wish it could have been better. I find myself leaving the theater unsatisfied with the disposal of a hardcore villain. But over all Tobey Maguire is still spot on for Peter Parker and establishes that he is Peter Parker in these films as does Daniel Radcliffe for Harry Potter. I recommend you see this film if you're in to the comics and you absolutely loved the first two films.<br/><br/>*note: there are plenty more villains in the Spidy universe to keep the movie franchise going, I suggest they go into deeper detail with the villains rather then dwelling on Parker's spilt milk. In other words keep from having two villains in a movie... Venom could of handled Spidy on his own in the comics, Partly because Parker's spider senses don't work with Venom."
"Lord_Crypto","7","0","0","17 June 2007"," Good movie but does not match the caliber of the first two films
","I do not want to call this film the worst of the spider-man films because I say the same thing when I say Batman and Robin was the worst of the Batman Films. And this film is in no way comparable with Batman and Robin. Spider-man 3 is a good film but does not match the caliber of the first two films.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) return in the two big roles with OK performances. James Franco returns in his best performance of the three films. He portrays an angry, distressed, and loyalty-torn character. It is truly a solid Harry Osborne character and I give compliments to Mr. Franco for doing so well in this third installment. Thomas Haden Church did an awesome job as Sandman. I was very happy with the Sandman character and the way he was created in the story. I loved watching him fight and the visual effects done on Sandman were outstanding. Some of his powers seem to be exaggerated but his character is great. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock and the new big villain, Venom! I would say Grace does a good job with the Venom character created for him. I still disagree with the Venom/Eddie Brock characters they created in this film. He is too cocky, too arrogant, and too much of a ""wimp"". Although looking at this as just a film, he does a pretty good job. OH, and Bryce Dallas Howard is in this film as Gwen Stacey. Although her role is of no importance, it simply enhances two factors in the film. That is all her character does, she plays no critical/event changing role.<br/><br/>Although I would say this is the darkest and grimmest Spider-man film (which I liked, this film had almost a different feel for it than the other two), it is also the funniest. J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) returns in his hilarious performance as usual and Bruce Campbell delivers yet another hilarious cameo. Even Topher Grace is funny at times (in a sick sort of way). So although the film is dark and grim, there is still some good comedy in it.<br/><br/>This film tries to fit a lot into a movie. They overflow the film with a lot of new characters who need introduced. Overall, they do an OK job but it could have been handled better. So it should be fairly enjoyable as a film with entertainment and a good/solid/overrun story. You will notice the tag-line for this film, ""The Battle Within."" I do not want to give away anything so just think about that line. Peter is obviously going to be torn apart by perhaps someone or something(?). The story revolving around ""The Battle Within"" is fairly good for a movie goer not judging the movie on its comic book characteristics. I think some of the effects are too ""video-gamish"" in this film. They are almost completely recognizable as fake. The best fight sequences are in this film which should be obvious since he is battling three villains. <br/><br/>Spidey, you have completed an excellent trilogy up to this point. This third installment is a good film. Maybe not the best way they could have gone out, but it was certainly good enough. A must see for anyone who enjoyed either of the first two Spider-man films."

","I'll be honest: I went into the theater with very high expectations due to the publicity, the great looking commercials and also because i thought the previous 2 spidermans were very good. however i do not think i could have been more disappointed by a movie. It started out with promise, however as it just fell apart after Peter turned into his dark alter-ego. The scenes of Peter's 'transformation' were pathetic and so over-the-top it was ridiculous. They turned Tobey Macguire from a great actor into a joke. I was laughing so hard not with it but at the movie when Peter started to wear black eye liner and turned into an Emo table-dancing moron.

","In Spider-Man 3 (SM3), we see a lot of stuff we wanted to see. Sandman, Venom, Black Spider-Man, and Death. What these things wrapped around, was what killed it for me.<br/><br/>SM3 has a lot of action scenes and some comical scenes. But the problem with SM3 is that the story was trying to be put together into something that didn't fit. Like Sandman being connected to Uncle Ben's death. Pssh. We also didn't want to know that he was a nice guy. Many people wanted to see Sandman, like in the comics, tearing up town and being a bad a$$ as usual, not trying to save his daughter. Which I'm not saying is wrong, but is wrong for a movie that sticks to the comics.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie was the LONG sequences of no action and luvy duvy stuff or just hard times with Peter. It was not boring, just not needed. It was also funny when Peter danced like John Travolta, but I'll just leave it at that.<br/><br/>I also hated venom. Wtf!!! were they thinking. We all know Venom, muscle built, big motha f*cka, bad a$$ and acting like he was king of the castle. And then to see this. A little wimp looking dude, Topher Grace, inside the suit and not even for a good purpose. Not to kill, but the embarrass Peter. I also hated the look of Venom, his head was awesome but the rest of it just looked like a black suit and a Venom head. Nothing else. That really disturbed me to look at that.<br/><br/>Now away with negative Nancy. I want to talk about what i liked. Bad A$$ SM walking around, beating up Sandman and taking down Harry. It was b-e-a-Utiful. I don't want to spoil much but when SM punched a hole in Sandman's chest, you knew somethins wrong there In the end, SM3 had its disappointments and its really cool action. I hope SM4 has some better sequences where nothing is happening. The end of the movie was like the end of the 1st one, and i liked that. If you didn't see the first one, then i wouldn't spoil it for you, but if you didn't see the first one...what are you doing seeing SM3??!!!"
"relaxedrob","7","0","0","17 June 2007"," Amazing special effects: better were the questions about good and evil..
","I saw Spiderman 3 recently and enjoyed it greatly for the special effects and for the new bad guys it introduces.<br/><br/>Most of all I empathised with and cheered for Thomas Haden Church's Sandman. His creation scene was sad and poignant: a poor man battling so much bad luck. He couldn't keep his family together and now cannot even keep himself together! I found Sandman's creation scene emotionally resonant with the sand blown scene in Altered States - which I imagined to be an allegory for two people who loved each other but were growing apart so slowly they didn't notice it any more.<br/><br/>An aspect of the first and second Spiderman movies that I most enjoyed was the emotional wrangling Peter Parker went through with his love for MJ. He loves her, but he feels as though he should reject that love, because he cannot protect her from the evil in his life. Ironically, he has brought the evil into his own life by choosing to ""fight crime"", to be a hero.<br/><br/>By implication, he is choosing the life of a hero over the life of a lover, a partner.<br/><br/>Why does he make this choice? What can make Spiderman reject the love of a good woman? Does he find the draw of being a hero, of having power and glory to be greater than the joy and satisfaction of having a partner? I won't mention the sex. Or does the emotional and moral imperative to help people form an irresistible urge that draws him to the inevitable conclusion that since he can't both help people and have a lover whom he can protect, helping people is what must win out.<br/><br/>I think the first and third movies present different answers to this question. In the first movie I felt that Peter Parker was irresistibly drawn to helping people. But in the third movie, he was after the glory! He fights so hard to make sure Spiderman gets good news paper coverage. Sure, he was under the influence of the black gunk - but it just exaggerates what is already there, so Peter loves the power and glory too.<br/><br/>Escape Pod - http://escapepod.org/2007/05/19/ep-review-spiderman-3 - has a very thoughtful review of Spiderman 3. It questions how easily Peter Parker rids himself of evil. He can strip off the black gunk and is immediately absolved of the evil he has committed (at least in the eyes of the audience). ""We always have a choice"", Peter says, yet in the words of the reviewer Jonathon Sullivan, Peter Parker paid the smallest price for his own evil.<br/><br/>The problem, Sullivan says, is that true evil comes from humans, not from external objects like black gunk from the sky. By relegating the source of Peter Parker's evil actions to the black gunk, we don't get to examine the true source of evil - the dark thoughts and desires in our hearts.<br/><br/>I find this to be a valid and important point. I was thrilled when Spidey managed to wipe the gunk off himself and ""gong it to death"", and I enjoyed the resolution he found with Sandman at the end.<br/><br/>However, as I was walking out I wondered ""how many people died in the scenes they portrayed?"" The movie showed lots of buildings and property getting destroyed - but surely all that damage would have taken quite a few people out as well. The aspect of ""Collateral Damage"" wasn't addressed - did Peter Parker have nightmares about the innocents who died while he was wearing the black suit? Perhaps this is common enough for all superheroes (or police, or soldiers..): in trying to do good deeds, sometimes innocent people get hurt.<br/><br/>Something I really wanted from Spiderman 3 was a bit more acknowledgment that tearing off the black suit doesn't mean Spiderman has torn all evil thoughts from his heart. It just means they aren't being amplified anymore. Some people will say that was reflected by his statement that ""we always have a choice"" - the choice to follow through with our dark desires or not. That is true, but I still wanted something more: something I see in shows like Law & Order. That final look on the face of the main character, a lawyer, cop, DA, coffee boy etc: thoughtful but uncomfortable. They are thinking: ""something bad has happened, unavoidable, necessary perhaps, but bad - and it can never be taken back.. I hope I can live with myself."" Rob :)"

","Superhero movies have never been known for their Oscar-winning appeal, other than technical categories like sound and visual effects. So, it was quite a welcome surprise when Spider-Man 2 premiered and critics were raving. Still not Best Picture material, but pretty darn close to it.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 takes us back to the typical superhero movie, complete with villains (and I mean VILLAINS), internal and external struggles, and an ending that ends nothing. This movie knows it's role as a money-making machine, and it doesn't pretend to be anything more or less. It knows that, as serious as it tries to be, it will never win any major awards, so it has fun with itself knowing it really has nothing to lose.<br/><br/>The general story has Peter Parker returning, very in love with MJ Watson, and still confronting problems with his old friend-turned-enemy Harry Osborne. To paraphrase the plot, MJ gets fired from her Broadway show, the police make a breakthrough in the case of Uncle Ben, an escaped convict trying to support his daughter turns into a sand creature, a new photographer forms quite a rivalry with Peter, and MJ is challenged by a foxy blonde who's the daughter of the police chief. All of these elements turn into Peter straying farther and farther away from the man he wants to be, and more and more into a monster. The monster in question is a black goo which gives Peter a shiny black suit and a feeling of ultimate power. Pretty soon, Peter is dressing like a member of an emo-band, with black hair combed over his forehead, and black clothing to match. He's winking at girls, he's buying new suits, and worst of all, he's taunting MJ with the sight of him dancing with Gwen Stacey.<br/><br/>Eventually, Harry joins Peter's fight against the Sandman and Venom, the aforementioned rival photographer, to stop them from hurting MJ (the poor girl needs to get out of the city). The ending is mushy, tragic, and uplifting, but at the same time it doesn't really end things. It suggests an ending and tries to get you to believe yourself.<br/><br/>The special effects are good enough to overshadow weaknesses in plot, the villains are fun enough to overshadow the unnecessary story of Peter being taken over by revenge. It would be better if he just took on the Sandman because he thinks the Sandman is bad rather than a misunderstanding of vengeful proportions. Overall, though, the movie is entertaining, which is exactly the role of a superhero movie. People pay large ticket prices in mass quantities (see the record-breaking opening weekend), and they get their money's worth of noises, sights, and sensations of wonder. It resembles a smoke-screen used in a magic trick, designed to draw the attention of the viewer away from figuring out the trick. There is no trick here, though. The filmmakers understand their formula for success 100%. Lots of cool stunts, lots of cool villains, and lots of cool battle scenes make for a pretty cool movie. I just wish the plot, characters, and general mood of the movie had been better. 7/10"

","Although this is the best Spiderman movie so far it was a bit over the top of everything. At the beginning Pter or Spideman was saying that he had a bad life before in the fit two movies of Spiderman he says in this one that everyone likes him. Then he goes to MJ's play where she sings the most annoying song and then he finds Harry outside the theaters trying to say sorry. Afterwards he mets up with MJ and says she did great on th stag and then there's a scene of Harry turning into the new Goblin. Well that's all I can say for now but I'm trying to say there was like too much going on which makes the movie go over th top of things which is quite annoying. Like the part when they show Sandman running from the cops and then he lands in a pit of and and these people who ar working on something turn Flent into the Sandman. And also when thy introduce the new characters like Gwen Stacey and Eddie Brock I think they don't introduce them properly in a way thy are tying to say thy could of been in the first two Spiderman movies. But I love the part when sandman and Spiderman battle each other especially in the truck and when Petr gets consumed by Venom and turns into a angry but very groovy character trying to be emo and cool.

","When i first saw Spiderman 3 in theaters when it came out, I was amazed at what Sam did. Astounding fight scenes, realistic CGI effects, and drama (which was sometimes off). I'll admit: #3 was'nt a perfect movie. Now don't get me wrong it was one heck of a Summer movie, but there were a few details that held it back from getting a 10. First off, the positives: 1: Superb fight scenes. Sam definitely did his best in this area.<br/><br/>2: Amazing CGI. Sandman's CGI effects were the most brilliant I've ever seen.<br/><br/>3: Humor. Since when does Jameson never make you laugh. Bruce Campbell's scene was pretty hilarious too.<br/><br/>Now (drum roll), the negatives: 1: Acting. Most of the acting was good, but some of it was absolutely sloppy. Come on now Tobey that was the worst crying impression on the bridge i ever heard!!! 2: Useless villain. And I'm talking about Venom. yes, he's a good and powerful character to put in a Spiderman movie, but he was just added a little too early in the franchise. It would of been a lot better if he was in a future installment.<br/><br/>3: Fast-pacing. This movie would have been a lot better if it reached the 3 hour marker. That way Raimi could do everything right. The scene where Eddie turns into Venom and 5-10 minutes later Spiderman fights him at the construction site was going a little too fast in storytelling. Sam should have focused on one or two villains, not three, because you're sort of ruining the focus of of every story line in the movie. Now if this movie was three hours long, the pacing MIGHT be a little better.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was still an amazing spectacle to watch. I just hope future installments don't fall because of the same things."

I'm still confused as to how they thought that James Franco had any acting ability. He isn't any good and should not get work! I mean come on! A jazz dance number!?! I will concede that the Sandman graphics were really cool but did his initial awakening have to take half the movie? Add that to the fact that the beginning had about two hours of confusing nothing and I wonder where they can go now? All this just brings up the question 'Why does Sam Raimi hate Spider-Man?'"

","I was itching like crazy for this new instalment of Spiderman to be released but didn't get round to viewing it until yesterday.<br/><br/>The first remarks I want to make is that although I did enjoy this film, I didn't enjoy it as much as either of the first two films. I think the reason for this is that I realised on viewing that I am becoming tired of Spidey now and they should lay it rest before they damage the reputation of what all in all has been a great trilogy. I feel there is nowhere else for them to go now.<br/><br/>I didn't think much to the special effects in this film either - many of them looked rather amateur and didn't seem to ""flow"" along properly with the action - kind of jarring and some even looked cartoon-like rather than real. I suppose me being a critic of CGI may explain that last comment but I can only write what my eye sees.<br/><br/>The new villain, the Sandman was good and an exception to the dowdy special effects in that all the action sequences in which he was involved in worked very well indeed and looked real.<br/><br/>The on/off relationship between Parker and MJ continued throughout the movie and I found myself wondering why Parker kept bothering with such a moody young woman - obviously it must be down to the stunning good looks of Kirsten Dunst, one of my all-time favourite sexy chicks.<br/><br/>All in all it was the usual mix of action/romance/thriller/comedy that we have come to expect with Spiderman movies and I feel sure that fans will not be disappointed with this film. A bit of a tear-jerker too towards the end.<br/><br/>Just one last word about the middle portion of the film when Parker was infected by the black stuff and was trying to act cool: RIDICULOUS!! And not one bit funny - they could have used the time much better with maybe another fight scene.<br/><br/>I will buy the DVD on release simply because I own the other 2."
"Okonh0wp","9","0","0","13 June 2007"," Uneven but an ultimately satisfying experience
","Spiderman 3 opened to mixed reviews but I wouldn't consider it a failure of a film. I personally thought it was a very uneven experience at first but satisfying overall. More importantly, it served as a satisfying conclusion to the series.<br/><br/>The main problem, I think was that so much was resolved in Spiderman 2 (Harry knows who Spiderman is, Peter and Mary Jane get together, Peter confesses to Aunt May for lying about Uncle Ben's death, etc.) that there was little tension left over for Spiderman 3. That left the first hour of Spiderman 3 boring and uneventful. It started to feel like a teen flick and reminded me that without the superhero element, Spiderman does not have as much to offer in terms of rich and dynamic characters. In other words, I don't feel that Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry are interesting enough characters to base a film around if the superhero angle was taken out of the equation.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was imperative for the film to not waste too much time with exposition and get into the superhero dynamics before the audience gets bored, which was the case with me. Once, the film found its groove, things started rolling, however. When Spiderman's suit turned from red to black (I'm sure there's some more technical term for what happened to him that some comic geek would know), you could really tell that Tobey MaGuire was having fun playing against type for the first time in his career. The new additions to the cast were all added in small doses, so as to not shadow the development of the three main characters: Topher Grace's sardonic humor complimented the tone of the series well (his humor sort of doubled that of the newspaper editor who provided much needed comic relief in the first two installments), Thomas Haden Church's character created opportunities for some great special effects work, and I have no major complaints about Bryce Dallas Howard.<br/><br/>My final verdict of satisfaction came about ultimately because the ending really was very effective and it's hard to feel satisfied by any ending that you've waited five years and sat through a combined 7 hours of film to see."

","The lightheartedness of the first Spiderman movie was entertaining. The seriousness of the second Spiderman was enthralling, and the third Spiderman movie was just disappointing. Let's hope that Batman continues its momentum and doesn't end the way of Spiderman.<br/><br/>The main complaint is the movie is too long and jumps around way too much. The relationship between Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey MacGuire) and Harry Osborn/Young Goblin (James Franco) is so erratic it's like watching a tennis match. They are trying to kill each other, they are friends, they are trying to kill each other, they are friends etc. It was exhausting keeping up with it.<br/><br/>Also, the scene where Peter Parker becomes the 'black Spiderman' is very distracting. I know it's vital to the story but how the director composed it was bad. There's 1970s pimp music as Peter walks down the street and watching Tobey MacGuire trying to act like a pimp and cool cat was so hilarious and awkward it took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>I just felt the movie tried to accomplish too much. I am not a fan of the comic books and I could tell the writers had a hard time concluding this series. There are hundreds of stories of Spiderman how do you condense it down to three films? I certainly understand the dilemma but the screenwriters and producers came empty with this film.<br/><br/>The special effects were certainly visually appealing but the story was a major let down to the previous two.

Kirsten Dunst didn't have enough screen time, which was surprising seeing shes the best actress in the movie. I thought the idea of black sludge taking over your body was a little cheesy also.

The disappointment with the movie is that it flies at an extremely fast pace, in fact too fast. I felt that there are to many 'main' characters. I think that the movie would have worked a lot better if the Sandman had not been included in the film. or just have him as the main baddie and do away with Venom (Who surely deserves centre stage without any rival baddies.) the Sandman's evolution is somewhat rushed and to be honest in my opinion dull and a little too easy. With the introduction of Venom we have a seriously good Baddie. (How's that for an oxymoron?) The re-introduction of Harry / Goblin is I suppose somewhat expected.<br/><br/>****************** (PLOT SPOILERS COMING UP ) *************************<br/><br/>******************* YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!! *************************<br/><br/>We are given the inevitable closure with Harry's redemption with him coming to Spiderman's aid at the end of the film even though it ends with his own demise. Why this was necessary i don't know ? Unless it was either because James Franco didn't want to be in the next Spidey sequel ? Surely he could have just remained in the amnesiac state again giving the option for his return in future sequels?<br/><br/>Also I feel that Venom had a poor and somewhat pitiful ending.

The plot was typical. Peter Parker trying to cope with some inner difficulty he's facing while villains appear and run wild. Nevertheless, I found the movie to be quite entertaining until ""the black suit"" clinged to lil' Tobey. After that it was like a high school prom with all the emo kids out in full force. Peter Parker becomes a tough guy parting his hair a different way and becoming crude with the ladies. Don't even get me started on the bar scene when he did that ridiculous dancing.

More worryingly, I felt that if I did, I'd get away with it. Spiderman wouldn't fire web at me - the only thing liable to come out of his wrists would be blood as he went off to write a song about my meanness.<br/><br/>I know you aren't supposed to like the guy when he's venomous, but I still wanted to respect him. Instead I hated him and thought him laughable. He annoyed the hell out of me. And that is not a good opinion to hold about the hero.<br/><br/>Sandman was neither here nor there really, and the guy who took over as Venom was equally annoying and unconvincing as spiderman. The only decent villain in the film was Harry.<br/><br/>Harry managed to hurt spiderman more than the others combined. In fact more than probably any of the other villains from the franchise combined. He, I respected. And when it came to the finale and he had to choose whether to fight fir or against spiderman, I was so unimpressed with the other 3 that I was following Harry all the way. Whichever side he picked is the side I was supporting, and that was the consensus opinion among my friends.<br/><br/>Quite frankly he had to die. Otherwise there would DEFINITELY not be a spiderman 4. There would have been a Harry Osborne spin off instead, and I get the feeling the studio didn't want to explore that direction. It's a shame. After being lame for 2 movies, Harry came good. I'd pay to see a Harry movie. Another spiderman - I'm not yet convinced."

","It makes me wonder why some movies, that are actually weak and very lame, affect me so much. Exactly this happened after seeing ""Spider-Man 3"". Flaws of this movie I am unable to count because the whole flick drips with unrealistic character development, cheesy humor and almost total lack of depth. Yet this may be the reason why I enjoyed it so much - this is what comic book adaptation on screen should look like. These were real comic book characters, that you can't find from anywhere in this world. And in a strange way this affects me more than most of the serious and good movies. Only thing that keeps me from giving ""Spider-Man 3"" ten points is the fact that there is ridiculously little time given to Venom who is basically the most enjoyable villain there is. And that is a real shame."

","I saw this movie this weekend, expecting to be disappointed. I wasn't, but I felt more was needed to make it a film of the same caliber as the last two. The problem with the movie is that it is extremely long, and, with a little bit more development, could of extended into two separate films.<br/><br/>Besides that, I also had a problem with how the storyline went. Sure, it had some action in the beginning, but really, the first half was a PP/MJ love story. After they break up, the movie is really Peter Parker being evil and absolutely stupid until the very end.<br/><br/>The final battle scene was very action packed, but the shots were often blurred and you cant get a really good feel for whats happening until a lull in the action. It was gigantic in proportion to the other two movies, sort of Revenge of the Sith-esquire. <br/><br/>Overall, it was okay, with some parts I really liked and some parts I really hated. (i.e. The battle sequence(good) and the dance scene(bad). I would recommend this movie to my friends, but some parts of it just seemed pointless."

","This movie was a terrible let down as a potential climax to the cinematic translation of the Spiderman comics. In the first several minutes of the movie, I was tempted to simply stand up and leave the theater. I stayed only because movies cost money and I could only hope that it would not get any worse from there.<br/><br/>I'll put this simply. If you are a big fan of Kirsten Dunst or enjoy the troubled romance shared between her character MJ and Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman, than you will have a sheer blast watching this. I'm positive it would be nearly impossible to jam Dunst's MJ into any more scenes throughout the movie without extending the reel.<br/><br/>The villain's story lines are thrown together sloppily and cut to very small uninformative pieces that don't even make much sense when run together. For every brief cut-scene that gives you some idea of what is going on behind the antagonist's roles, you are forced to wait through never ending scenes of Peter Parker's very dreary and emotionally turbulent life.<br/><br/>The Spiderman story is a backdrop to the Peter Parker story as it always has been in these films. I will simply speak for myself here but I'm sure many true Spiderman fans think the same, no one enjoyed the comics because they wanted to be Peter Parker. At least, not without the Spiderman."

","What's good about it?: The special effects are amazing, every fight scene is great and usually pretty long (which is good). There are 3 villains, Sandman, Venom and the Green Goblin 2. There are two amazing fights between Peter and Green Goblin 2. There are more fighting scenes then Spider-Man 2. <br/><br/>What's bad about it?: It's about 20 minutes to long. When there is no action there is a lot of talking scenes with Peter's Aunt May or other people like her. Although the black suit was advertised as a main part it came in during the second hour and its only there for about 45 min. Also the advertising made people excited about Venom, when he was only in it for about 15-20min. The score of the movie was also cartoon like and annoying! <br/><br/>Overall: The movie was filled with boring scenes (but not as many as the last one). It was also to long. But, the special effects and story were pretty good. When Venom was in it, it was so exciting and suspenseful, although he was so disappointing. You can tell who dies near the beginning of the movie pretty much, and you sort of wish it was another person. <br/><br/>Grade: ***1/2 Rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence My rating: the same"
"Wraith8677","6","0","0","2 June 2007"," Spider-Man trips and falls with a terrible script but still manages to succeed.
","Here we go boys and girls it's the incredible, the fantastic, the amazing Spider-Man! The first was great and the second, despite almost everyone's oppositions to any and all sequels, dominated overall. Now Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco have returned to fulfill their obligations to Spider-Man 3, it says so in their contracts. The greatest Spider-Man film yet!...or so we're told. Yet after watching Spider-Man3 It took me a good long while, three days in fact, to decide whether or not I liked it.<br/><br/>In the end I liked it, but not in the traditional sense. It's more along the lines of having a best friend for years and finding out that they didn't invite you to a party, I mean you still like them but you feel betrayed.<br/><br/>That's what Spider-Man 3 is like and what is the one single factor that takes the Slinger out of Web-Slinger? The script.<br/><br/>Yep the script is bi-polar, its dark and depressing one second and bright cheery for the next ten minutes. Yep, that's a balanced tone for a movie. This was painfully obvious where in a scene with Peter and MJ they are breaking up, Peter is fine in one shot and then is sobbing in the next. What? He's already crying? No build up to tears like all other humans? Hmm, I guess Peter Parker is Bi-polar too. <br/><br/>As a side note Mary Jane gets kidnapped AGAIN, she glorifies the fact that no girl should, under any circumstances, date a super hero. So girls if you are dating a super hero break it off now, your only going to be kidnapped and set up as bait for him. <br/><br/>Also the movie asks a lot from the audience in terms of feelings of remorse when it comes to Harry Osbourn, when he first attacks Peter (great missed opportunity for his Spidey-sense to go off BTW) he hits his head and is unconscious, we see him in the ER and at first it looks like he may die. People in the theater are sniffling for him hoping it isn't true, it isn't. Yet a few for more scenes later he fights Peter again and is ""Blown up"" by a pumpkin bomb, OK now Harry must be dead he was hit with a BOMB. So we conjure up our feelings of sympathy one more time but no, believe it or not he's still alive. Now you get the feeling that the movie is pointing and laughing at you saying, ""Haha made ya cry!"" So at the end when Harry final does die, you've already cried over his ""death"" twice that you just don't care that he's finally dead.<br/><br/>Now for other things thats wrong here is not only the villains but the casting decisions for them. I have nothing against Topher Graces he's a fine actor but I can't look at him and not see Eric Foreman, I almost expected Red to come out behind Topher saying, ""I'm gonna put my foot in your ass!"" Despite my disagreement having Sandman in the film I ended up liking him somehow, he was a different kind of criminal, he actually put his daughter before himself. <br/><br/>Harry/ New Goblin as he's called, because i guess Hobgoblin was already taken, looks cool but he pretty much flies on a turbine engine snowboard. <br/><br/>Venom, the one villain everybody wanted over all only makes an appearance the last 25 minutes. Reasons for this is that the Venom back story is very long. In fact had they done everything leading up to venom it would easily fill out two movies, but fans wanted Venom and so he was written in at the last second and then is killed off after 25 minutes of air time. Bye bye Venom, the greatest Spider-Man super villain doesn't get more than a half hour appearance because Sandman is more important. <br/><br/>Now I'm sure your wondering, Dude you sound like you hated this, what's up? Well like I said I don't, despite everything I said I was still entertained by the action sequences the dark undertones, and finally a good cameo by Stan Lee. But it's all weighed down by a terrible script that Stan Lee himself wouldn't approve of. <br/><br/>Even with all of this Spider-Man 3 is still one of the most grossing movies of the year, so a lot of people still liked it. I can only hope that Spider-Man 4 which is unlikely to have the same cast (we all know how well those kinds of movies do wink-wink) gives us a better script that we could get interested in. So my score for Spider-Man 3 is, 3 highly successful movies out of 5."

","When you enter in theater to watch spidey 3 you think , that you are about to see another magnificent comic film , a film that ,like the first two, will focus in character development more than in action sequences ....... forget this thought, because this time they've have smelled the fresh aroma of money , and they have made a more commercial film, in lots of ways. But spidey is spidey ,and the dedication of Sam Raimi allow us to be blowed up and immerse in two and a half hours of drama, vengeance and romance. This is thanks to the great actings( Kirsten dunst one not so much), the stunning visual effects and the fact that after all ,is a spidey film.But the major weak point of the Movie is the scrip, because is a mixture of ideas and characters that sometimes converge but other times gets even cofusing , and leaves the two most interesting villains of the movie (Sandman and Venom)with no screen time ,just a few scenes and no character development( in fact Venom appearance is ridiculous short and even can be consider as an injustice for fans). But despite his strange scrip and the studio pressure and intentions , Spider-Man 3 is a great flick, one great ride that (despite its failures)provides entertainment , loads of entertainment."
"ChrisPSY","7","0","0","31 May 2007"," Enjoyable, but flawed.
","Warning: Contains major spoilers.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 was a frustrating experience. It was a movie that had a lot of fun elements, but also a laundry list of problems. I don't feel this was due to the stacked nature of the story, but rather the fact that certain scenes either didn't work or required too much of a leap of faith from the audience.<br/><br/>Let's take the infamous Butler scene. The Butler tells Harry that Norman's wounds were self-inflicted. How on earth could he come to such a conclusion? It was a poor way of bringing about Harry's change of heart. Similarly, Eddie Brock tells the Sandman that he knows about his daughter. How did he acquire this information? These two scenes were rather critical moments(Harry putting aside his revenge and Sandman teaming up with Venom, respectively), yet the logic behind them was poorly explained.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 is easily the most emotional film of the trilogy; however, there are moments when the characters display a complete lack of emotion or response to the surrounding circumstances. In the aforementioned Butler scene, Harry isn't the least bit annoyed that the ""information"" regarding his father was kept from him for so long. Harry's manipulation of Mary Jane - getting her to break up with Peter - isn't referenced again, despite it having a significant impact on their relationship. And when the Sandman tackles ""Spiderman"" in an alley-way, only to be met with the screaming face of Venom, he actually turns around and begins to walk away! He is completely unfazed by this monstrous creature he's just encountered in a dark alley.<br/><br/>The film continues the annoying trend of Spiderman frequently losing his mask, taking it to gratuitous levels at the end. Peter loses his mask during his first confrontation with Venom, manages to put in on again when fighting Venom and Sandman, only to have it torn and eventually knocked off completely by Venom once again. The use of the black suit is restricted as well, in favour of Peter in street clothes, with the black suit just about visible at collar level. Raimi clearly has reservations about conveying a masked Spiderman and it's annoying to see the lengths he goes to in order to cause Spiderman to lose his mask.<br/><br/>Criticisms aside, the film did have its good points - good points which I think outweigh the bad overall. In terms of the characters, we have the reliable comedy from J Jonah Jameson and other co-stars, and Bruce Campbell once again getting the time to shine. The Sandman is an excellent addition to the series - his backstory is unoriginal, but he's not a cookie-cutter villain and the special effects (particularly when he first tries to maintain human form) are impressive at times. Eddie Brock, whilst being completely different from the character in the comics, receives a limited but well performed role as Peter's rival. Gwen Stacey is a breath of fresh air, in the few scenes she's in, as an alternative to Mary Jane. Though I really feel that Gwen should have been the damsel-in-distress at the end.<br/><br/>The overall story of the film was also enjoyable. Spiderman 2 and Superman Returns excelled at presenting how difficult it is to be a superhero. The formula continues in Spiderman 3, shifting from Spiderman's newfound celebrity status to the problems in Peter's personal life. There are also some nice nods to the first film, such as the hallucination of Norman telling Harry ""We attack his heart!"" and Gwen giving Spidey an upside-down kiss. Little touches like that go a long way towards making the series seem like a trilogy. I disagree with the general view that too much was packed in - there were problems with certain scenes, but they were problems from the get-go, rather than being the result of trying to tell too much. For goodness sake, the Butler obviously has an advanced medical degree or psychic powers, while Harry and Mary Jane spontaneously decide to dance whilst preparing a meal! The only point in the film where I felt things were a little rushed was when Peter first donned the black suit. We could have seen a little more of his crime-fighting efforts in his new threads, perhaps testing how his abilities had changed, before moving to Peter's growing attitude problems.<br/><br/>There are a number of action scenes in the film. The first fight between Peter and the New Goblin should be familiar to many, as it was released on the internet in its entirety. It's a fun scene, though the night-time setting and frenetic pace makes it difficult to make out what's going on. Peter's wedding ring, however, clearly exists outside the laws of conventional gravity. My favourite fight scene was actually Spidey's first meeting with the Sandman, in the armoured car. It was a nice portrayal of Spidey having a chip on his shoulder (""I'm the sheriff in this town"" or words to that effect), and being completely unprepared for a man who could turn into sand (followed by a funny ""Where do these guys come from?"" pondering after the fight). The tag team battle at the end was very entertaining, and made all the more special by a cheering crowd rallying behind the heroes (a setting which I think is sorely lacking in superhero films). I could have done without the overly-British reporter commenting on the action, however.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this to fans of the first two films. There are flaws which I could not ignore, which made it a disappointing experience. But it's worth checking out, and I'll still be getting it on DVD when it arrives. For those of you who are not fans of the Spiderman film franchise, or were not bowled over by Spiderman 2, I would advise you to keep away; the problems of the film will no doubt be intensified by a dislike for Raimi's general ""wacky"" style."
"buckeye22","2","0","0","28 May 2007"," What a mess
","My original comment on this movie included a 6/10 rating -- mostly due to the amazing special effects in the movie. I saw the movie at an IMAX theater and the special effects overwhelmed the movie. But after considering it a bit, I've decided the special effects really don't compensate for the horrible muddled-mess of a storyline. As I mentioned before, there are no less than NINE subplots. Nine. The movie is so unbelievably difficult to follow, that I'd probably have to rent it to figure out all the story lines. But I'm not going to. I'm not going to waste my money on this horrible movie again. I wish I had known how bad this was before I paid $12 to see it in IMAX. <br/><br/>I cannot believe that the word has not gotten out about this movie and that it's still #1 in the country. I guess people are starved for entertainment. So, now I'm giving it a ""2"" so that will make my average rating a 4 -- which is what it should have been in the first place."
"chris-3749","3","0","0","28 May 2007"," incoherent, bloated and painful
","I am a long time spider-fan. I enjoyed the first two movies. Did not enjoy S3.<br/><br/>Why not? In general, the plot is thin. With a bad story, poor character development, and incoherent action, this is a step back from the standard of the first two Spider movies.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned, the story in S3 is bloated with characters. Too many characters and not enough time spent developing any of them. These are talented actors, but with so many of them, they end up sharing scraps of screen-time. The back stories of the new characters are weak to begin with and their motivations are poorly or partially expressed.<br/><br/>Returning characters do not fare so well here either. The big hype of Peter Parker facing his ""dark side"" is mostly played for laughs, but the attempts at humor fall flat. Deadly flat. The scenes featuring a new ""cool"" Peter Parker were cringe-worthy and too long. The more serious scenes unintentionally brought out laughter from the audience - I have never heard an audience mock another movie so much. No wonder that Tobey Maguire may not want to come back for a fourth film (but I bet the $ will be hard to say no to...), as many of his scenes were painfully embarrassing. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the bits with J K Simmons and Bruce Campbell. These scenes were a welcome relief... attempts at humor that actually worked.<br/><br/>There seems to be a push to pump up the action for this outing, but with all the CGI, it felt more like I was watching someone playing a video game, except less cohesive and more disorienting. A chase scene between Spidey and Harry was well done, with the camera swinging and spinning (maybe too much spinning) around the characters. Similar techniques are used throughout the other action scenes with less success. Later action scenes with the new, poorly developed characters do not seem as complete. A battle between the Sandman and Spidey which passes from storm drain, to subway tunnels, and back to storm drain, is hard to follow. The lack of continuity in the climatic battle was distracting as characters (the Venom/Brock character in particular) seem to simply vanish for stretches without explanation.<br/><br/>Big spoilers here----- The Spidey movies are a little less planted in reality and more about fun than other comic- book films, but several gaffes take away from S3. A grenade that totally destroys Brock/ Venom, only scars Harry. When the Sandman and everything else with him is first dissolved into molecules of sand (which looks great), for some reason the chain and locket with a picture of his daughter does not. What is the deal with Sandman being able to ""fly"" as a cloud of dust? It looks cool, but sand has the power to fly? Why do Brock's teeth grow into fangs as Venom? Dumb.<br/><br/>In the end, S3 is simply a bad film, totally disappointing. I would go so far as to call it awful. Bad plot and poor/laughable character development make for a bad movie no matter how much you like Spider-Man or how good the special effects are."

","I'm not one to complain of the length of movies ( I can watch the lengthen versions of the lord of the rings easily!) but I felt poor editing and writing left Spidey 3 making me squirm in my seat waiting for the end of the movie. Although the action and special effects on sandman were excellent, the story lacked reason and in many cases logic. I found that the whole Ben Parker murder was completely unnecessary to the story, (not to mention I m still not sure how Marko accidentally killed Ben Parker). The harry Osborne thing could of been a whole movie in itself, and it would have been better also. Not being a comic book reader, I didn't get the whole Venom story, which they hardly explained at all. I was thoroughly entertained by Toby Maguire's less then spectacular performance as Emo Peter, especially when I was not suppose to laugh. Gwen Stacy seemed completely unnecessary to the story, and the romance story between Mary Jane and Peter had some potential but was handled badly and left me asking myself ""What was the point of that?!?!?"" All in all, it could have been much better, but trying to cram too many villains in the film messed it up. It was not bad, but disappointed compared to Spidey 2"

The whole black suit thing was kind of cool for about 10 min, then it got old. Sandman? Not really all that interesting. I guess to show the compassionate side of villains? I dunno but it really didn't add anything. The whole Harry as Green Goblin thing is cool, but they kind of screwed that up too and I must say the end scene where he dies is so clichéd!

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) has now died down a bit as a phenomenon and is now more of a neighbourhood service, doing his duty and delving out justice to the low-lives of Manhattan. But his old friend Harry (James Franco) still has a score to settle with him over the death of his father and returns as the 'New' Goblin, ready to wreak vengeance on his old friend. But a freak accident lands him in hospital with severe memory loss (and just as well because villains wise in this film he's already got his work cut out.) So with him out the picture, Ol' Spidey must now battle the inner villain within himself when an evil new serum attaches itself to him, causing his suit to turn black and making his vicious instincts to come to life. These come in full force when he discovers the identity of his grand-father's real killer Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who's just escaped from prison and has been turned into The Sandman, capable of morphing into a giant indestructible monster who can take on anything. In the face of his biggest challenge yet, Peter must defeat his greatest enemy as well as the raging evil within himself.<br/><br/>With the rave reviews for the last two films still ringing fresh in my mind, I was expecting the final instalment in the Spider-Man franchise to receive similar glaring words. But I was as surprised as probably anyone was when it received a barrage of not awful but distinctly average reviews. A big complaint has been too many villains and I would agree with everyone on that. In fact it speaks volumes that the film's most memorable moment comes not with one of Spider-Man's showdowns with one of these villains, but with a spectacular action sequence involving a giant building block crashing into a skyscraper, causing everything (and everyone) in it to come plummeting out of it.<br/><br/>This aside, I also want to niggle about the theme and tone of the film, involving Peter's quest for revenge and battle against the inner demons raging inside him. Batman is a dark hero, Spider-Man I think is more of an undemanding kind of hero, and the whole dark tone of the film I felt was totally mis-placed.<br/><br/>I'm sure it won't be the worst blockbuster out this year, but I must say I'm glad Sam Raimi has finally closed the lid on the downward spiralling Spider-Man franchise and that there won't be any more to tarnish the memory of the highly enjoyable original. **"

","Spidey's back! YAY! Spiderman 3 is the Hollywood blockbuster with the biggest ever budget, $258 million on production alone (That's cast, filming, editing and special effects, but no advertisement or distribution) which made the previous record holder, King Kong ($207million) look like a cheap tramp.<br/><br/>The money is well spent; the special effects and CGI are amazing, sometimes indistinguishable from the actors or background. The fight sequences are the best in the series so far and with not one, not two, but three bad guys there are a few of them.<br/><br/>Spider-man's new costume is the source of his (totally lame) internal battle sub-plot. It was fused to him and is made of a symbiote which later becomes venom. Venom is Eddie Brock Junior who That 70s Show fans will recognise as Eric 'Dumbass' Foreman. Played by Topher Grace, Brock puts on a good performance in this film and is, for a change, a scrawny Venom host, as opposed to the muscle-bound Eddie Brock from the comics.<br/><br/>The second (of three) in the Green Goblin dynasty appear, small hint its Harry Osborn (or New Goblin) played by James Franco. Franco tries to replicate the madness of the original Green Goblin and fails, this is because Willem Defoe is a great actor and James Franco isn't.<br/><br/>The Sandman also makes and appearance and is revealed to have more to do with Parker's past than first thought. This character's story is one of justification and redemption and his appearance is a throwback to ancient Marvel Comic history (1963 was his first appearance). Other references to Spider-man's past are Gwen Stacey who was Parker's girlfriend long before Mary-Jane; she was killed on an infamous bridge scene by Norman Osborn. There is also a cameo by Stan Lee.<br/><br/>With more humour and greater love conflict than the previous films, Spider-man 3 also manages to be gut wrenchingly patriotic. I think the point the movie is trying to make that valour and modesty triumph over dominance. This eventually leads Spidey back to his original costume (and personality) but in my opinion the new costume and take-no-prisoners attitude were just what the young Peter Parker needed. Well worth watching, even just for the battle scenes, however it does stand up on its own and some prick in the audience did stand up and clap at the end of the movie. I give Spider-man 3 7 blobs of tar out of 10."

That is to say, it seems to evolve comfortably and you just want to be sure to sit through it without leaving.<br/><br/>While I can agree that some of the characters could have used some more development, it's not enough that you cannot be comfortable with in what transpires during the movie. Also, the CGI is the best yet and the line between what is real and what isn't is getting very fine indeed. Peter's bar scene was great and Harry on that flying snowboard was nothing short of a scene steel.<br/><br/>Great movie, I loved it and this is worth a trip to the theater.

","Spider-Man gets all emo and bad ass at the same time with the introduction of ""evil black space goo"". This time, he must duel with the Sandman, Green Goblin and Venom, as the movie, literally, loses the plot. I could try and explain it to you, but it would make The Big Sleep sound like Snakes On A Plane. The basic thread is Spider-Man discovers his dark side, after being infected with a black substance from outer-space. It causes him to stop combing his hair, do a ridiculous ""impression"" of John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever and generally act like a horny sixth-former. It also greatly increases his violent tendencies, as he shows no remorse pummelling some of his enemies to their apparent deaths. In the mean time, Mary Jane is failing as an actress, and getting kidnapped every now and again. Her relationship with Peter is once again strained, which has a lot to do with the introduction of Gwen Stacey, another potential love foil.<br/><br/>The first two Spider-Man movies were underwhelming, in terms of spectacle (Spider-Man 2 less so). The CGI had always been ropey, the dialogue reeked of cheese, and much of the action was disappointingly pedestrian. What the series had going for it was its heart and faith in the characters. It was never really about Spider-Man but Peter Parker, who struggled with his identity in the last film, only to come clean to Mary Jane at the end. Spider-Man 3 aspires to the same level of drama, with none of the reward. The plot is completely incomprehensible and having three bad guys wander in and out of the film's narrative only serves to make matters more confusing. Firstly, why do we need the sandman? There is nothing scary about a man who can turn into a beach, whether he is played by Thomas Haden Church or not. Secondly, whenever a character suffers from Amnesia, it is usually a film-making short cut so we can go over ground already trampled upon in the past. And that is exactly what happens here. Thirdly  Venom is played by Topher Grace, the single most annoying actor in the world. If you had ever read the comics or even seen the animated series of Spider-Man, you would know that Venom is meant to be scary as hell. Yet listening to him talk like a racquetball-playing yuppy, albeit occasionally screeching, just made me think what he really needs is a nice cappuccino and a Apple laptop to put his photos on.<br/><br/>The film's saving graces are all down to director Sam Raimi and leading player Tobey Maguire. Raimi has always been good at placing comedy in his films, and there are a couple of really funny moments, involving Bruce Campbell in a hilarious cameo, and JK Simmons doing JJ Jameson, the newspaper editor from hell shtick, he does so well. Also, the action isn't half bad either. There is an absolutely spectacular sequence involving a humongous crane pillaging through the side of a skyscraper, only for Spider to come to the rescue. But at a reported $258 million (that's fifty million than Titanic) it does not justify its price or hype. There are only so many times we can witness Mary Jane get kidnapped before it becomes numbing. Tobey Maguire does his best, as always. And does nothing to disserve the drama of the piece. But considering just how good this could have been, it really wasn't worth the hype."

","OK well I saw Spider-man 3 a few weeks ago and was furious to the point that I nearly walked out. So after a friend begged me I gave it another chance and while I did not walk out I was still just as frustrated. As someone who is a fan of the comics I was disappointed but that was not because of the comic story parts but because the movie felt very disjointed and it just never got into a rhythm. I tried to give it another chance as a movie but I actually found myself more disappointed than I was with the use of venom. It seemed as if the direction team felt like they need to cram 3 movies into one and in doing this the plot lines just do not follow very well. The three villains were perfect for the big screen but were poorly used and it seemed like the director put the villains on a roulette wheel and that's how it was decided when to include them. For instance after a battle with one villain we do not even see the villain for good bit of time and when he does come back(or it's revealed he's still alive) it feels really really forced. Finally, as a comic fan I have to say this about the black suit story line...it should have been Spider-man 4, I say this because I actually like Topher Grace's casting and how he played Brock but his character was not given a lot of development time and so other than when he becomes venom you are kinda bored with the character. Also the black suit was to give Peter more power not turn him into a dancing w/ the stars candidate. Anyways, I gave this movie two tries and while it was very ambitious it just never comes together."

","After seeing spiderman 1 (good movie) and spiderman 2 (superb movie) I was really disappointed with spiderman 3. It was not a bad movie and that is why I still give it a 5/10 but... There were too many villains in that movie! I am not the first person to say this but this is clearly the main problem with this movie : trying to fit too much story in too little time. A movie with just sandman or venom would have been great. If you add harry/goblin, dark spidey, gwen stacy, problems with MJ... you have a recipe for disaster!<br/><br/>I just thought that the action scenes were all the same. I mean... I just watched batman (1989 and 1992 tim burton version) the other day and they did not need to have the 2 villains battling each other for hours for us to understand the point. What is it with those modern movies that you always have to have 2 guys punching each other on the face for half the film? The final scene was so unnecessary I thought it would never end. I was literally sleeping in the theater.<br/><br/>I may be old school but the CGI effects looked FAKE. I mean, when it looks like a video game it is not a sign of good special effects!<br/><br/>Another BIG problem : tobey maguire! I mean... he was OK in the first 2 movies, he was kind of cute but still cool. In this movie he was ugly, fat and totally annoying (the bad dialog did not help). It was so bad I wanted harry to kill him.<br/><br/>Many things were OK in this film (some good action, some good characters, some funny moments) but there are too many flaws to call it a good film. The fact that they bring back the story of uncle ben... BORING! and harry who always wants to avenge its father... BORING! I mean, they are supposed to be superheros but they can not get over the death of their old parents? What is this? And gwen stacy? They could not find a more beautiful girl to play this girl who is supposed to be super sexy? And the ""I forgive you"" at the end... my god, And the ""bad"" peter parker who is dancing around making a fool of himself. Wow! I am glad I only spent 6$ on this."

","Spiderman 3<br/><br/>*** I must say firstly Sam Rami should not direct the Hobbit, nothing against him just that it should be Peter Jackson's film. ***<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing this film after some doubts about it to begin with. I really enjoyed the first Spidy film, the second one was disappointing but the trailers of this one looked promising. So I went out on opening night, and as expected the cinema was packed<br/><br/>From the moment the film began the script was cheesy, worse then your usual Comic book hero and it was cheese through out the entire film. There also seemed to be a lot of jokes added, some good and some very poor.<br/><br/>Maguire's Spiderman anger was as painful to watch as Anakin Skywalker's hissy fits in Star Wars, and when (I think) we were meant to be watching the Black Suit taking him over it felt more like we was watching 'The Mask', it was painful to see. Dunst was OK but nothing amazing, usual damsel in distress thing. The love triangle (or square, there was 4 of them!) was weak and I didn't really notice any emotion connection between any of them, the character of Gwen you wouldn't of missed her if she wasn't there. <br/><br/>Topher Grace as Eddie was my shining light (I personally feel that he would have been great casting in the role of Spiderman), his anger was a lot more believable then Spidy's despite what little background we had of his reasons and the highlight of the film was watching him as Eddie/Venom. <br/><br/>Also James Franco was great as the New Green Goblin, one of the few characters with a back story from previous films. He was far more charming, funny, even angry and entertaining then the other main characters. <br/><br/>The 3 bad guys are all played by good actors but Rami was just trying to pack too much in that none of them got a good strong storyline. You feel that Rami was saying 'right this is my last Spidy film let's go out with a bang' but instead it was just a mess of poor jokes, too much CGI and weak characters. (Once the film finished I even checked with the guy sat next to me that we all saw the same poor excuse of a Spiderman film! He agreed.)<br/><br/>I give the film 2 stars for its only two stars (shame they didn't have more screen time) Topher Grace and James Franco.<br/><br/>Roll on Pirates 3"

","In short ... the movie was great, all was fun till the moment Venom came and died in less than 20 minutes!!!!! Up till now i think am in a dream ... Venom is the strongest Vaillan Spiderman had ever, how can he be dead in this short time?!!!! and on top of all that, nothing was made to let us know more about Venom - like you think every one already know from the comics and the cartoon - he just appeared,fought and died!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the main thing that killed my love to this movie, other than that, the movie is cool ... just i hope the too much crying will reduce in the next movies.<br/><br/>I really hope that we see Venom back again some how in the next movie, any ideas like he went to another demetion or something when the bomb exploded will do, its a real unfiar thing to be done with Venom like that!"

","""Spider-Man 3"" is a good film. Although there is a big gap between the heights its two predecessors reached and what ""Spider-Man 3"" is able to accomplish, it still is one of the better products coming out of the big blockbuster factory in Hollywood. That's because Sam Raimi gave the ""Spider-Man""-series a heart, or better, he kept the heart of the comics. So many blockbuster-directors and producers today think a pseudo-cool look or language or story makes a good movie. So I give Sam Raimi credit for this, but I think this time he is also responsible for the weak spots of the film. Three villains are too much. Raimi gave up one of the main reasons why he had been so successful with this series: The villains had enough time to develop. Here only the conflict between Harry and Peter is working for the largest part. That's really a shame, because both, Venom and Sandman, had huge potential. In addition to that, also the Peter-Mary Jane relationship doesn't really work this time."

","Now I don't expect anything amazing from the tie-up-loose-ends film in a Comic book trilogy but Spiderman 3 was just excessively bad When ya go see a superhero film you expect some ass kicking and some pretty nifty special effects with a high adrenaline boost to keep you rooting for the superhero But in this film there was quite the opposite most of the film was showing Peter Parker being a bit of a crap boyfriend and having troubles with his relationship with Mary Jane, which made some audience members around me call him nasty names (not bad to say he's the good guy). As for the special effects yeah Sandman is pretty nifty I'll admit that, apart from the scene where he first realises his power that scene looks like some advert for a computing system not a million dollar budgeted film There's also many bits in the film where you can tell that it was done via the actor doing something and a green screen behind them it looks cheap and really tacky To say it's an action film it confuses me as I seem to remember there was an ""i love you"" dance in a jazz bar in which the lowly male dances to impress the girl of his dreams since she's fallen out with him because he cheated that kinda thing has been seen in romantic comedies throughout the history of film... it was all about Peter Parker's relationship Not the web-slinging hero of New York Spiderman only had four fights Peter Parker had one bless 'im... not exactly an action packed superhero film if ya ask me and even the BIG CLIMATIC brawl between the goody and the baddies was a bit poor lacking in suspense and superhero violence and you could guess what was going to happen next, and then the use of comic relief was brought in with really bad timing.<br/><br/>The whole point of the film was to get the audience to see Venom appear as he is quite a cult favourite... He wasn't referred to as Venom throughout the whole film and he was on screen for the last 20 minutes n that's your lot and (possible spoiler here) he wants to kill Spiderman because of wait for it Spiderman made him lose his girlfriend!!! RELATIONSHIPS AGAIN The only thing I thought was good in this film was the fact that Danny Elfman wrote the original score so it's good to see he's created an impact on films before Tim Burton's Batman scores for superhero films were some cheesy pop-rock song from the 70's (watch Power Rangers: The Movie and the original TMNT films to see what I'm on about) then along came Elfman and now all superhero films have the string quartet with some good music drifting along the background... Oh and Wolfmother do a song for the soundtrack.. that's also excellent..<br/><br/>So if you're after a super-hero comic book film that actually keeps the feel of the comic book and excite you and keep you hooked stay with the first two Spiderman films if you want a 140-minute soap with a few punch-ups then this is the film for you One of the worst mainstream films I've seen in a long time"

","The film was good fine, but it was a big disappointment. The film promised to be a darker film. But the whole thing seemed too corny for the original 2. The storyline was good and the actors were good as well, especially Topher Grace who was good as Venom/Eddie Brock. But the story and screenplay could have been more developed. And the ending was rubbish. I have a way the ending could be a lot better for example, Dr. Connors still kept the symbiote sample, this could have easily bonded with him, grew back his missing arm and turn him into the lizard. That ending would have been a great cliffhanger to work from so to develop Spider-Man 4. All round a film with disappointments but plenty of thrills."

He has to fight many enemies such as a rich madman with a flying suit and a runaway convict who can turn into sand. <br/><br/>Listen, Spiderman is Stan Lee's classic, its a staple of American pop culture, but I think that people attend cinemas with academy award winning performances and immaculate directing. Sheer entertainment and sometimes nostalgia what can be gained from a film like Spiderman. <br/><br/>I think that the corny sob story of the sandman added some comic book flare, explaining how no one is truly a ""bad"" guy. Venom was crept into the storyline with flare and finesse, and Toby Mcguire, who has become the face of spider-man did just as well as he did in the first two spidey flicks. <br/><br/>The Special effects were great, awesome action scenes, perfect amount of drama, humor, and violence. This film was a sheer entertainer. I'm shocked to see that people liked Ghost Rider better than Spider Man 3.

"allykazam04","8","0","0","21 May 2007"," just not good enough
","First of all its got to be said that it was a great movie. For all those not too interested in the spider man tales or into movies it was overall amazing. The effects were amazing the fight with sand man was awesome! but there was just so much lacking to it. <br/><br/>When i first saw Gwen Stacy i was shocked to think they were going to fight her story in as well as Sandman and Venom. But no they just added her character totally out of context. Why was she in there? where was the story? her fathers death? her love for peter but hatred of spider man? her death caused by spider man :S ? none of it was there it was like they just wanted to add another face. <br/><br/>the Sandman story was near nuff perfect and well done. Venom was done not bad but i thot spider man got the suit from space but I'm not to sure. I didn't think he was that impressive tho, at the end wen spidy kills him was good but throughout he was just too small.<br/><br/>The whole bad peter thing i dunno if i agree it was done well. The whole supposable emo thing just didn't work. The scene in the club where Mj works made me wanna stand up and leave.<br/><br/>But i have to say i did enjoy the movie once i got passed all the mumf and ill definitely be buying it but it definitely wasn't my favourite spidy film, it felt like they just wanted to get it over with as quickly as the could and bunched a bunch of snip its together<br/><br/>but u gotta love the spidy!<br/><br/>oh one thing i found hilarious when i went to see it. two men behind me were talking bout how spider man was missing something all great superheros had such as batman and superman ( however in my mind batman ain't a superhero) anyway they were complain spider man had no theme tune and that he couldn't b a real hero till he did. now i may be wrong but I'm sure he does<br/><br/>spider man spider man does whatever a spider can spins a web any size catches thieves just ike flies look out here comes spider man<br/><br/>ye thats all i know lol"

","I may be in the minority, seeing as I was shocked to read all of the negative impressions on the third installment of the Spiderman series, and I found myself enjoying it more than the former two. This combines elements of campy humor consistent with the comic books, action and a mushy love story-turned-betrayal and whatnot, making it the sort of film you cross your legs real tight to avoid having to take a bathroom break and missing a moment. It was sheer entertainment, exciting and nerve-wracking with dialog that should be hovering from a speech bubble overhead. The second film had so many eye-rolling, lame, supposed-to-be-cute moments with formulaic elements and predictable story lines that I feared the worst when entering the theater, and I was delighted to find that instead of a continuation of this, we were faced with a script that pokes fun at itself and its roots justly, making the characters sympathetic and understandable instead of infuriating.<br/><br/>I give it an 8/10 because I enjoyed every second, and for once it seemed that the parts I was laughing at were supposed to be funny."

","Well first of all I'm glad they gave J.K Simmons and Bruce Campbell more time on screen. I also liked they way the mixed scary scenes and comedy into the movie. Venom's might be the scariest thing in this movie. Although I'm sad Venom only came at the end the good thing about that is he didn't scream all over the movie. There is a reason they put Sandman in this movie but I won't spoil it. The casting was great. I was unsure about Topher Grace playing Eddie Brock/Venom because I thought he'd be to much like Eric from That 70's Show but after 2 minutes you forget it's him. One problem about this movie is there is not that much Spidey it's more about Peter and MJ's relationship that being said it's over two hours so your going to get what you came for.

","The individual parts of Spidey 3 were very well done. Overall, I was entertained, but the whole thing did seem more than a bit disjointed and cobbled together. It took forever to get going and the three main story lines didn't really mesh at all until near the end--and even then, the convergence of the three was clumsily handled.<br/><br/>It was as if they made three really, really good episodes of a Spiderman TV show, each with its own story arc, and then forcibly edited the them all into one feature film. They used to do this with popular TV shows like ""Man From Uncle"" and ""The Virginian"" back in the 60s.<br/><br/>As I watched the story lines of S3 slowly unfold I couldn't help but think that each of them--the Sandman's story, the New Goblin story, and the Venom story--was being shortchanged, and that each would have been better if filled out to about an hour and a half on its own. But when a flick costs about a quarter of a billion bucks, I guess they think you should get at least three movies worth for your ticket money--but I'd rather pay three times and get three really good movies instead!"

The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge.<br/><br/>I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching!

"ckieran","6","0","0","21 May 2007"," Another average comic book adaption
","Being a former avid comic book collector when I was younger, it pains me to see how Hollywood has been treating comic adaptations of late. There seems to be a bit of a pattern developing where movie makers seem to either try to fit too much into the time and end up not exploring any one topic or character well enough for you to care about the events presented, or else focus almost completely on the action to the detriment of story and character exploration so once again you don't care about the outcome.<br/><br/>Some comic book movies DO manage to escape fully slipping into one or both of these categories eg. good characterisation and reasonable exploration of only a few core concepts in the X-men movies; and good characterisation in The Hulk - which only just manages to win out over the confused addition of an extra villain late in the game. Both of these however might have also seemed better due to the higher class of acting ability? I haven't decided yet.<br/><br/>In any case, Spiderman 3 unfortunately seems to have a mix of both patterns and as such just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Being that the Spiderman movies are about a single character, I would expect that character to be fleshed out well. X-men, as I mentioned, manages to explore a number of characters reasonably well, but as the Spiderman trilogy has progressed I feel that Peter Parker has become more wooden and prone to posturing about spouting lame catch cries mixed with out of character moments thrown in to advance the plot quickly (eg Gwen Stacey related events). I ceased to feel for his character and ended up getting irritated that he was whining all the time about how badly he had screwed up. In fact, he was either arrogant and pompous, taking himself too seriously, or a bit childish and whiny... All in all I ended up bored.<br/><br/>The treatment of Peter Parker's character mirrored the style of the movie itself - it alternated between taking itself way too seriously with preachy speeches backed by music possibly intended to be inspirational, with American flags waving in the background :/ to weird scenes of the characters behaving in stupid ways (Peter Parker's dancing in the streets bit). All in all I could never tell if I was supposed to feel sorry for a character, hate them, like them, laugh at them or just not bother with in any of these. In the end that is the one I chose as it provided less confusion.<br/><br/>I think my main problem with the movie, and with most comic adaptations that have been executed poorly (Daredevil *shudders*) is that I recognise the *potential* there was for a decent movie (given all the provided back stories) that was squandered by poorly written scripts/dialogue/plot. Given the potentially interesting nature of Venom and his origins, I wasn't quite sure why they had bothered including Sandman in the movie at all - it would have been much more coherent if Venom was the sole new character and had been given the attention he deserved. The unfortunate casting of Topher Grace (that 70s Show) in the role of Eddie Brock/Venom was another distraction that completely killed interest in the character for me.<br/><br/>Anyway, the special effects were great as you might expect (the only reason I just managed to give this a 6/10), but the rest of the movie ended up so infuriating in parts that around 10 or 15 in a cinema of 300 walked out before the end. On my way out I heard murmurings from almost half the people I passed about how ""lame"" it was. I ended up apologising to my partner for even dragging her to see it. Maybe go see it if you're a fan, but be ready for some major disappointment. If I was able to get my money back at the end of the movie as a way of showing Hollywood studios that they are starting to get comic book movies WRONG I would. Now I'm not even sure if I should bother with the next Fantastic 4  Jessica Alba or not! :("

Seriously, there's too many things happening at once here! You've got the Parker/MJ/Harry love triangle, the introduction of sandman , the introduction of gwen stacey, the introduction of eddie brock , the venom/symbiote saga AND harry loosing his memory. Its too much to fit in one film-the venom story alone is enough to fill a 2 hour movie. <br/><br/>Sam raimis film tries to give you as much bang for your buck as possible , but it spreads it self thin by including too many different elements and not fleshing them out enough . As a result, the moments that are supposed to be big and dramatic loose a lot of their impact, villains aren't given enough time to shine and character relationships seem a little hollow- it all feels rushed and insincere.<br/><br/>This may sound like a bad review, but its not.Spiderman 3 has good things going for it; the new additions to the cast do great with the material their given and raimi makes sure that there's a welcome dose of humour .But on the whole though its lacking - spiderman 1 and 2 were such brilliant films that seeing a mediocre entry to the series just feels disappointing.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 is watchable , but no way as enjoyable,exciting or as heartfelt as its predecessors.

"mrband99","6","0","0","21 May 2007"," No good villains!
","Movie pundits are projecting it to be one of the biggest openings ever, perhaps surpassing the first Spider-man's mark of $110 million opening weekend - or even breaking the all-time record set by last year's Pirates of $135 million opening weekend. After seeing it, I can see why this may be the case. It has pretty much what everyone is looking for - drama, comedy, romance, and lots of action.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Spider-man - one in which I have never been completely sold on him - and Kirsten Dunst is back as his girlfriend. Tobey actually gets a chance to do a little bit more with the role this time, gleefully hamming it up as overly cocky and aggressive when a parasitic black goo from outer space fuses with his suit (only in comic books can you come up with this stuff!). There are some scenes of him strutting down the street like John Travolta and flirting with women that are pretty darn funny. Kirsten, however, moves to more of a background role. Yes of course she still gets kidnapped by bad guys and has to be saved repeatedly. But in the few non-perilous scenes she's in, she looks tired and haggard and barely says much. When did she turn 40 anyway? I could have sworn she was like 24 last year.<br/><br/>The action scenes are of course fantastic again, featuring dazzling special effects and huge fights. But while these were fun to watch, I couldn't quite get into them as much as in previous Spider-man movies. Some of this I believe stems from the problem that there isn't just 1 clear-cut super villain in this movie. Instead, there are 3 or 4 different villains, but some of them aren't *really* villains. They're just nice guys who are having problems. Take for instance the Sandman. He's the father of a deathly sick little girl who's trying to raise money to help her. And what happens? He falls into some particle physics experiment and has all of his molecules turned into sand. Great, as if he didn't have enough problems. Then of course there's Peter Parker's best friend Harry, who is still trying to kill him (daddy Willem DeFoe is still egging him on). Oh yeah, and the extra-terrestrial black goo - you know that's got to be bad. And all of this while poor Peter is trying to ask M.J. to marry him. <br/><br/>All of these characters and action are great, but there isn't really a clear-cut plot with one antagonist that needs to be stopped. Even Spider-man himself starts looking pretty un-protagonistic himself through a lot of the movie. So while there's lots of stuff going on, there's almost too much stuff going on, and the movie seems to wander around for a good portion in the middle. Of course, everything comes together and makes more sense in the end, and the last half hour is great. Although it does stoop to a pretty low ""deus ex machina"" moment. Just when we're thinking ""Man, this is terrible, how is this conflict ever going to get resolved?"" out pops some completely random character to give us exactly the information we need to resolve the conflict - in about 30 seconds. How convenient. Where the hell did this guy come from? And why didn't he give us this information before - like in the last Spider-man movie! He could have saved them a lot of trouble. But better late than never. And so, the problems are resolved, good stuff happens, the end. Maybe they didn't want to add any more to the already long 2 hour and 20 minute running time.<br/><br/>I may be exaggerating some of the flaws of this picture, but I actually did like it. I just think I preferred Spider-man 2. At least, I liked Doc Ock a lot more than any of these wannabe villains. But director Sam Raimi continues the great comic-book-to-movie-screen adaptations, and most audiences will not be disappointed. Be sure to look for Raimi's childhood film-making buddy and ""Evil Dead"" collaborator Bruce Campbell in a hilarious little role as the maitre d' of a snooty French restaurant. I also liked the addition of Topher Grace as a slimy photographer competing with Parker for shots of Spider-man. He's probably the most interesting character, but unfortunately he doesn't really get the time to develop.<br/><br/>I can be picky about some of the things in this movie, but maybe that's just because I was half asleep at 2am watching it. Overall, it does deliver exactly what people expect. As long as you know you're going to watch a summer popcorn movie based on a comic book, you should have a decent time."

","I am in no way an enormous Spiderman fan i enjoy the character and the films but not to the point that cinematic alterations to the comic book bothers me.I thought both previous Spiderman films were great blockbusters, fun summer films, and awesome comic book adaptations however while i believe the same for Spiderman 3 it's obvious fanboys and dedicated readers will not.Many say the problem with Spiderman 3 lies with the ""too many villains"" factor however i believe it was that they spent too much time on the wrong villains and too little time on the right one.I am aware of Venom's huge popularity, his fan base is almost as big as Spiderman's but unfortunately there is definitely not enough of him and they defeat him too easily and too quickly you will feel as if you've been ripped off when it comes to Venom.Sandman is by far the most entertaining and coolest villain in the film you can tell Sam Raimi loved this character and wanted to bring him in to the franchise in a big way and trust me the confrontations between Sandman and spiderman are just the impact Sandman needed to forever cement himself as a classic character in the Spidey film franchise.Harry Osbourne was the villain they needed to cut down in terms of screen time as everything with him especially his first fight scene while fantastically choreographed came out of nowhere and felt very random and rushed.The soap opera drama that filled up Spidey 2 is again present in Spidey 3 but due to all the action and adventure it's not as annoying but it completely makes you roll your eyes when Mary Jane is on screen.The emo Peter Parker thing was definitely the thing that killed the seriousness of the film as i found it downright funny.I know the symbiote story and i know the symbiote makes Parker violent and angry not a narcissistic emo for awhile it felt like we had two Eddie Brock characters.Speaking of Eddie Brock Topher Grace is such a lovable bad guy that you instantly forget he's the exact opposite of the comic book Eddie Brock.The action is spectacular, and the visuals are as great as they've always been with unbelievably great CGI and fantastic colour coordination.The score is absolutely brutal it's by far the worst thing about the film and the most noticeable flaw.It makes everything feel awkward and out of place i definitely missed Danny Elfman during the film after the first time i heard that score i thought i was watching a 1940's detective film as the music is loud and overbearing.The film i think is more good than bad it has good morals, a pretty good storyline, amazing action, flawless visuals, great comic relief from J.Jonah and Bruce Campbell really when you break it down if Venom wasn't in it everyone would enjoy it more and it wouldn't be such a disappointment."

","This film was an interesting departure from the previous two Spider-Man movies... that is, if you follow the Joss Whedon definition of ""interesting""-- meaning something similar to ""Oh God, oh God! We're all going to die!"" It was painful to watch Venom being misused in several scenes (I, personally, missed his constant self-referencing ""me""). Moreover, it was painful to watch the emotive restyling of the symbiote-suited Spidey. To restate what at least one commentator has already pointed out, Maguire is simply not good at playing the bad guy.<br/><br/>But hey, at least they nailed Sandman's storyline. While straddling the line of actual, hardcore super villain and not-really-evil nuisance for Maguire is often a point of criticism, I thought that this establishment was brilliant and quite true to Sandman's personality in the old comic books (let us not forget that, at least by the ""Maximum Carnage"" saga, he's not entirely evil). Thomas Haden Church was a good choice for portraying this oft-misunderstood (and very neat) character, and the way in which he is manifest in the film was fabulous.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""Maximum Carnage"", this movie was lacking the full symbiote storyline and it hurt the integrity of the film. I do hope that they at least touch on Carnage, but to do the Maximum Carnage saga would take multiple movies (or one very long one-- thank you, random walk-on characters). And Topher Grace probably would have been a better choice for Kasady than Brock.<br/><br/>Green Goblin 2 was relatively well-done (the upgrade in technology was a very contemporary but also quaint change). For once, I'm actually convinced that James Franco is capable of acting.<br/><br/>So perhaps it wasn't entirely awful (though Venom probably should have been better cast and should have had his own film)-- Church and Franco's performances are certainly the redemption song for this piece, and the effects on Venom were dazzling.<br/><br/>7/10 Overall."

","Im a very girly girl...I don't like comic books at all, generally hate when movies are based on a comic book hero, and actually never watch action films...i stick with the chick flicks. But, for some reason, I always enjoyed the spider man movies. I guess its because there is definitely a cute story with Peter and M.J. and their basically my age, so i enjoy watching it...and a lot of the fight scenes had always been Peter saving someones life, which is always emotional and fun to see. So, Im reading the other comments about this movie, and I see that most people are disappointed with the lack of great fight scenes, or the fact that it goes against the actual comic book. I could care less about that. I will agree with some other writers who say there was way too much going on and then they just threw some scenes in that really seem to not belong, just to make room for the other characters. And the whole bad Peter thing, really stupid and rushed. I was thinking during the movie that there are way too many villains, but, it kinda made for a really good ending, so I appreciated it at the end. Though, they still could have gotten rid of him being his own nemesis. The truth is some things could have waited for the next movie...but, is there gonna be another? And, if so, if its with different actors then it may just not be worth seeing anyways. So, if u are someone like me, who just enjoys the movies for the tearful, emotional story, its a pretty good one. I think for the people who care more about the fighting and true spider man story, you may be disappointed."

","I hope there is a number 4 to redeem the franchise but the powers that be obviously didn't think there would be another movie so they threw in all the villains and tied everything up in a neat bow at the end. They didn't leave much open for a 4th movie, it is either forgiveness or death for the 3 villains. Plus there were too many villains, as everyone else on the board has mentioned. Certainly Harry/Goblin had to be there but either pick Sandman or Venom and make good full use of them. Or let it go and hope for the next movie to bring one in. <br/><br/>AS for Peter hitting the dark side, what was with the hair? I was starting to feel real empathy for why Eddie Brock would want to see him dead, cause Peter was starting to make me want to smack him around as well. I did like the special effects of course and Peter being a jerk while Mary Jane is struggling was a good plot especially where Harry comes back in as the friend she can turn to. Peter was however TOO over the top and the scenes in the jazz club, really I thought he was idiotic. I love almost any scene with Peter and Harry and Harry and Mary Jane because Harry goes through his own struggles, bad guy-good guy, friend or foe. That was important but as for Sandman we were clearly supposed to feel empathy for him, doing everything to help his ill daughter that did n't ring true to me. The last scene with Peter/Spidey and Flint/Sandman fell flat the whole I forgive you bit and off SAndman goes into the air. Didn't work for me, Venom was far too underused, he could have had so much more. Topher Grace I thought was great as Eddie and the bit where he says he likes being bad as Venom that could have been something to really delve into in another movie, but that wasn't left open. That is my biggest gripe - in the last 2 movies you knew there would be another because there was so much more especially with Harry/goblin. But with this one it was deliberately wrapped up so I couldn't see any place for a sequel although with the money this one made I am sure it will happen, but without Harry or Venom; and Sandman was neutered it seemed . That is disappointing to me. I still ranked it higher that I might otherwise because the acting was solid but there was too much going on for just one movie."
"travelbug-2","5","0","0","19 May 2007"," Too Abitious
","Bringing a comic book hero to life usually means some sort of action-packed adventure. This time Spidey takes on three adversaries - unfortunately it all gets somewhat downtrodden in background stories and set-up together with his alter-ego's ongoing romance. It all starts blissfully enough with Peter and MJ together on top of the world - Spiderman has now been officially accepted as a hero and MJ has landed a promising singing job. Unfortunately, this makes Peter somewhat selfish, concentrating mainly on his own achievements and not realising what is going on around him. In comes the first foe then the next and things go south from there for him to the inevitable climax. Regrettably, this movie is trying to cramp too much information into its two and a half hours, making it rather slow and despondent at times. The action scenes - far and few between - are as good as ever though and well worth seeing. Sadly, while the set-ups are there, it is somewhat ambiguous at best."

","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be fantastic but the movie was awful. I actually fell asleep during this movie (that rarely ever happens, I even stayed awake through 300). The only good part about the movie was the special effects. Thats the only reason it didn't get a 1. The only way i suggest to go see this movie is for the special effects. If your looking for a story than keep looking. I suggest waiting till either May 25th and go to see Pirates Of The Caribbean 3:At Worlds End or June 8 for Hostel Part 2. Both of them are going to hit it huge unlike Spiderman 3. Hopefully they have ended the sorry franchise that we all know as the Spiderman movies. If you want a good comic book based movie go buy The Punisher, X-Men, The Hulk or Daredevil."

","I thought the movie's finale tied up the disparate elements together pretty well but I did find problems with the main body of the film. The singing and dancing scenes were completely wrong; they weren't so much a new direction to take the movies in as they made the movie feel like it was just getting lost; they made it feel like another movie interrupted this one.<br/><br/>CGI notwithstanding, I didn't find the Sandman character a very intriguing villain (but I did like the scene with him at the end when he was in human form). Wouldn't that science experiment that he just tumbled onto have been better protected? Yes, there was razor wire but it just seemed to happen too easy.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the comic books so I was confused about Venom. Venom is black goop, Venom is the black suit, Venom is an alien, first he's Peter, then he's this other guy. When Peter and Venom became separated and Venom went to that other guy, I thought it started getting interesting again.<br/><br/>Throughout the last two movies, I have just grown tired of Harry Osborne's whining about his father's death. Peter finally says the sentence that should have been said long ago ""Your father caused his own death"" which is corroborated by the butler.<br/><br/>On the up side, I thought Bryce Dallas Howard was just stunning.<br/><br/>I thought it was okay, lots of action scenes, a few too many things going on, Sandman was underdeveloped, too much singing and dancing but it was okay."
"geebeegb1","6","0","0","19 May 2007"," Not terrific but not bad.
","I think Spiderman 3 suffered (as a lot of movies do these days) from a lack of material on the cutting room floor. The story line was a bit hectic and there were too many characters flying/climbing/changing, but the biggest problem I had were some scenes that caused me to keep checking my watch. A couple were just downright embarrassing to watch like the ones with Peter Parker strutting around town as an ""irresitable"" jock. Give me a break. Toby McGuire just doesn't fit that bill in the role of Peter Parker. In addition, the entire scene in Harry's apartment between Harry and MJ could have been deleted without any loss of storyline. The ""Twist"" dance scene was stupid and merely filler for whatever reason. It was boring and a time waster.<br/><br/>Topher Grace was great in both his roles as Eddie and Venom. He was mean, sad, pushy, competitive, yet somehow likable at the same time. I was sorry to see his demise but it seemed fitting to the storyline.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was okay but the role has always been a bit shallow. She is a good screamer, so plays the damsel in distress well, but her performance is nothing memorable. Same with Toby McGuire - okay but nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>All in all - certainly worth seeing (and worth the big screen special effects) but don't expect to be blown away."

","I went into the theater on opening night with high hopes for Spider-Man 3. I bought tickets online a week early and showed up for seating 2 hours early. Little did i know that my endeavors would be literally a waste of energy, money, and time....<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was probably my biggest complaint. Mainly from Toby McGuire. Throughout the whole movie i wanted Spider-Man to get his ass kicked (which wasn't too hard considering they made no use of the ""spidey sense"").... not only because of how much of a dick he was being (especially when he hit MJ), but because of the horrid acting on Toby's behalf. He blows at being bad... I was laughing throughout most of the show not because it was supposed to be humorous, but because of the mix of cheesy lines and ridiculous plot. Topher Grace was by far the best actor in the film... but he had to many cheesy lines himself. Throughout the entire gross display of Spidey trying desperately hard to be suave (which he failed miserably on), i felt the urge to walk out of the theater! I stayed in hopes it would get better, but unfortunately it did not.<br/><br/>The only reason i give this movie a 4 out of 10 is because of the visual effects.

","The movie started off well, but got into trouble (with me) almost immediately. *SPOILERS* are necessary here since I would be accuse of being a troll if I'd just criticize the movie without giving my reason.<br/><br/>First it started off with Peter & Mary Jane, then it was about Harry, then it was about this escaped convict, then it was about this creature in the meteor, etc.-- even though these people were NOT in the same place. Then when the first ""action"" sequence came, first it was about the Goblin, then it was about the Sandman, then it was about the Goblin, then it was about the Sandman, etc.-- even though these people were NOT in the same place. You see where I'm going with this?<br/><br/>This problem persists right through to the final ""end"" sequences: first it was about Venom, then it was about the Sandman, then it was about the Goblin, etc.-- even though these people were NOT in the same place. Spiderman 3 feels like one of those anime feature films re-edited from an entire anime series-- meaning that it is very difficult to enjoy as a stand-alone movie, what with ""no-flow"" in the music, acting, scripting, etc.. I mean, someone must have been so busy calculating the lighting ratios and frame-rates that they switched off their ""human sense"".<br/><br/>It gets at least a pass (5) from me for its special effects & production values-- though I am seriously tempted to give it a lower score for using such an awkward way and taking such an awfully long time to deliver them... but I'm a fan (of Spidey, not the movie)."

","In my opinion, Spiderman 3 was the worst Spiderman movie out of the 3. The story line was terrible, but the special effects made up for it. Had I known how bad the movie really was I would never had gone to see it. The battle scenes were extremely cool, but a little tacky.They made Venom into a pansy and Sandman into someone that they want you to sympathize with. Sometimes in the flick, you can't get past Eric Foreman's (Topher Grace's character on That 70s Show) voice as the voice of Venom. I would also really like to know why they keep killing the villains off, i.e. Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, New Goblin, and Venom. This definitely takes away from the Spiderman series, knowing that in the comic books, the villains return. If this is a movie that you're dying to see, my advice to you is to rent it. I hope they make up for it in Spiderman 4, which I will not be seeing in theaters."

","I went in with low expectations, having hated the trailers and left thinking that this was maybe the best Spider-Man movie so far. Spider-Man seems more developed as a character, with more interesting flaws, as well as some great webspinning acrobatics and the best villains so far. It really reminded me of the comic books, and made me think that many complaints about this movie are actually complaints about the way comic book plots develop. For anyone familiar with Spidey, this movie is like those issues that would occasionally come out with three different villains on the cover and ""Introducing... the Sandman, plus Venom and The Green Goblin!!!"" or something like that running along one side. It's got tons of action and the pace may come at the cost of character development, but it's a comic book movie and a good one!"
"jdkraus","7","0","0","15 May 2007"," Good, but not great...
","The first Spider-man was simply great. But I felt the second one slacked off a bit. So, I was not sure if this one would deliver like the original or flop or the second one. It's neither horrible nor great. Here's why.<br/><br/>The Good: For starters, I was again impressed by Tobey McGuire's acting talent as Peter Parker/Spider-man. It was even more exciting to see a ""darker"" look at Spider-man, from the mysterious ""black suit"". I honestly thought Tobey would not be able to pull off being bad, but he filled it in; despite the fact it felt slightly awkward for such a hero to turn evil, even if it was temporarily.<br/><br/>-I never really thought of James Franco as a good actor. To me, he was like a bland, three-dimensional individual. But in this film, he redeems himself not only as being a better actor, but also shows a villainous side of Harry Osborne, henceforth, the New Goblin. The fight between both Parker and Osborne was a strong point to the film that was quite satisfying.<br/><br/>-Thomas Hayden Church (who reminds me of Lee Marvin junior) was a very good villain as the ill-tempered Sandman. There's a sense of feeling for his character, which he delivers as a quite ambivalent individual who is stuck between right and wrong, but is given an unlikely power. Basically, he's not a stereotype villain; he's not all evil or all good.<br/><br/>-The CGI is triumphant over the first two films. I haven't seen such good visual effects since Peter Jackson's King Kong! It was not stylized like the previous Spidey films, but more on the cooler and a bit on the realistic side. It did not look fake at all. With the help of such great visuals, it broadened the action sequences very well, making them intense and glamorous to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>-In the mix of the film, there was some good humor put forth extremely well by J.K. Simmons. He was flat-out hysterical, once again as J. Jonah Johnson.<br/><br/>The Bad: The damaging flaw to this film is the story lines. Yes, it holds to Spider-man fighting ""the evil within"", but the film leaves plenty of plot holes as to where the ""black suit"" came from. There's no explanation to this mystery. Even more so agonizing was that the screenwriters and the director tried to cram so much into the film, including: Sandman, Harry Osborne/the New Goblin, the ""black suit"", Parker's strained relationship with MJ, Gwen Stacey, and Venom. It all grew very tiresome after the first hour. It did not mesh together at the end in an organized fashion.<br/><br/>-Added to this, the film had the tendency of not only dragging, but also choppy, jumping from one side story to another. It was a headache, and to a disappointment, the action sequences were relatively few, making the pace even slower. The two hour and twenty minute film felt like a three hour film. Even if the director wanted to make a four movie of this, it still would not have turned out right. It needed to be two separate films all together (some of which could have been added to the second Spidey).<br/><br/>-Topher Grace right off the bat was a wrong choice for Venom/ Eddie Brock. Instead of being a vicious character, he was an annoying laugh riot. Every time I saw him on the screen, I wanted to laugh, because his acting was so lame. Even worse was some of the most important aspects of the film were rather corny and poorly done (which I will not mention), while other scenes, particularly at the end were left hanging and needed to wrap-up the film.<br/><br/>Overall: I liked this Spider-man. It had a potential, but it was nothing spectacular. It lacked the knots needed to tie all the plot(s). It's a good popcorn-loving film. But Spider-man fans, don't expect a triumph like the first one.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I wanted to watch this film earlier but the haters put me off. Having now seen the film it is apparent where the hate is coming from but these factors are not enough to detract from the overall enjoyment which can be derived from the film. The haters point to the over use of coincidence, poor character exploration (especially the villains), the weird portrayal of the bad Spidey and the use of certain scenes as mere vessels to further the plot at the expense of cohesion. The haters have a point. This film does not have the freshness and crisp execution of the first nor is it as good an overall film as the second.<br/><br/>What this film has an abundance of is fun. The effects needless to say are impressive, the thrills and spills come thick and fast and the humour although less subtle than its predecessors make the film extremely entertaining. Despite Peter Parker being made a figure of fun, I believe the general audience will still have enough emotional investment in the character to care about what happens to him. You can make fun out of Spiderman in a way that would not work for Superman or Batman which why audiences world wide have a great affection for Peter Parker. The film could certainly have been better which is where a lot of the frustration comes from but I couldn't help but leave the film with a geeky smile on my face."

","My rating reflects loosely how I felt throughout the duration of the movie.Without giving anything away, the last few scenes didn't fill in much gaps, but for the most part Spider-Man 3 very much pleased me and I'm really looking forward to seeing it again.<br/><br/>The action in this film is arguably the best out of all three Spidey flicks. Breathtaking, to say the least. Any movie with actions scenes that get my heart racing and my girlfriend's palm sweaty gets a massive seal of approval and the movie does indeed have far more action than its prequels.<br/><br/>The plot itself is complex but very coherent and engaging. Once again, the entire cast has delivered a tremendous performance. Every character is believable to a tee which is always important for a fantasy movie like Spider-Man. Peter Parker's inner turmoil and transformation ranges from entertaining to disturbing - it is this 'face your demons' theme that holds the film together well.<br/><br/>On to my gripes. Since this is the third and apparently last Spider-Man film, I was hoping for an ending with a bit more finality. The final confrontation is tense and visually astounding, but also quite erratic because of all the characters involved. In addition, I feel there was a missed opportunity regarding the lack of an epic one-on-one between Spidey and Venom.<br/><br/>Certain issues that were brought up in the movie are not addressed in the end and lot is left hanging, which is why I believe another Spidey movie is on the cards. I would be quite surprised if there weren't because the final scene especially offers very little closure, considering.<br/><br/>All in all this is a fantastic film. The only thing that really bugged me was the lack of closure, especially since this is supposed to be the last Spidey in the series. Apart from that, director Sam Raimi has once again told a powerful story full of emotion, excitement, danger and darkness that should not be missed by any movie lover anywhere. I'll not be totally satisfied, however, until I get that closing finale that I've been waiting for. Roll on Spidey 4!"

","This movie was very disappointing. I saw the first two Spiderman movies and I thought they were entertaining. They brought the feeling of the comic to film very well. This episode was very flawed. First it was too, too maudlin. Second, there were too many references back to the original movie. Give it a rest. I don't want to see Uncle Ben die again. Is Cliff Robertson in financial trouble and in need of a job? I'll donate to a Cliff fund just to not see Uncle Ben die again. Third, the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane has to advance beyond the grammar school hand holding. What is the target audience? Twelve year olds? It is so goofy. It is so boring and there's way too much time spent on it. Get over it. The movie bogged down so much without the action sequences. I heard audible sighs from more than one patron and the sighs weren't over the love story. It was exasperation. Even the ending, after the climatic fight scene, was overly long and saccharine. I watched people leave before the end shaking their heads. But on the plus side there were the effects. The Sandman effects were fascinating and the black gooey stuff was good. What happened to the stuff in the lab? That was a bit of a plot hole. The New Goblin fight sequences were exciting and Spiderman's city swinging was fun but again they had to drag Willem Dafoe back into the movie along with the immature Harry Osborn. I'm glad he died since maybe, please, we won't have to go through that story again. The Venom character was good but he was too much. There were too many villains and because of that each one was only superficially developed. The franchise has to move beyond the original story and develop new story lines. It seems difficult for these comic book heroes to move beyond their superficial story lines. Batman is troubled and brooding and you have to watch the moody, pouty scenes. Superman will have some romance with a skinny Lois Lane then some villain will get some kryptonite and trap Superman only for it to be foiled by the villain's moll. Spiderman will appeal to shut-in pre-teens. The plots are predictable and frankly boring. The special effects are the draw and I wish the back stories would just disappear. I enjoyed Hellboy but expect a sequel to repeat lots of the original story. I rate this movie low because too much of it was saccharine hand holding and repetition of the original movie. The action was fun but too interrupted by sentimentality."

Whilst Spider-Man 3 delivers the requisite thrills and goosebumps, Raimi has also given detractors plenty of ammunition - For every inspired moment there's a disappointing scene.<br/><br/>The ridiculously-hyped appearance of Venom was always going to disappoint the rabid fan-boys, and in that respect it didn't disappoint - the origin of the alien symbiote was weakly contrived.<br/><br/>Having never seen him in anything previously, I thought Topher Grace, did a reasonable job despite being lumped with a couple of dud lines and one really bad piece of expositional dialogue. The Venom character itself was amazing and probably the most satisfyingly rendered bad-guy in the trilogy; complaints have arisen due to the alleged lack of Venom's screen time, but some folks are just greedy; Venom/Eddie Brock's arc was handled pretty neatly and streamlined in that pleasing, popcorn-munching way that the Spider-Man films does so well .. but alas, that flimsy backstory !!<br/><br/>Bryce Howard was perfectly charming but completely wasted in her thin role as Gwen Stacey - the inclusion of a character named Gwen Stacey was a rare mis-step for Raimi when it comes to re-inventing Spider-Man's history; where Raimi's decree that Spidey's web-fluid was to be an organic substance was a clever change from the comic, there was really no need to bring the Gwen Stacey character into the movie cannon - the original Gwen Stacey storyline in the comic books was great (Peter Parker's girlfriend Gwen dies at the hands of the Green Goblin, further re-inforcing Parker's commitment to his responsibilities in tragic circumstances) and the weak character development in the movie actually surprised me when I half-expected something more substantial from such a potentially rich character source ..<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church took up where Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin and Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus left off; he was great as Flint Marko/Sandman. However the CGI Sandman himself was underwhelming. <br/><br/>The character arcs of Kirsten Dunst's MJ and James Franco's Harry Osborn became unnecessarily convoluted and not altogether satisfyingly resolved; the scene where Harry learns of the true fate of his father was awkwardly resolved and has already copped plenty of criticism; rightly so. Nonetheless I particularly enjoyed Franco's performance in all three films.<br/><br/>OK, enough of the mixed reviewin', onto the really juicy stuff, the stuff I loved.<br/><br/>* J.K. Simmons is still a blast as blow-hard Daily Bugle Editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson<br/><br/>* 'the New Goblin' has been somewhat overlooked in the wake of the Venom/Sandman combination - however I thought the first fight scene between the Goblin and Spider-Man was the best action sequence in the film - that glider thingy was really cool !<br/><br/>* Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and Cliff Robertson in the smaller role of Uncle Ben were both serviceable once again; their characters always have the potential to become cloying, yet both actors invest great dignity into their roles as Peter Parker's guardians.<br/><br/>* Bruce Campbell. That's all I need to say, the guy is a legend.<br/><br/>* Elya Baskin and Mageina Tovah, playing the parts of Peter Parker's landlord and his daughter, were great again and had some fun scenes.<br/><br/>* the balls of Raimi to include two extended sequences of high quirkiness : Peter Parker, under the influence of the evil alien symbiote (disguised as a slick black Spider-Man outfit), begins to behave decidedly un-hero like - a scene involving Tobey Maguire strutting down the streets of New York bustin' some decidedly un-funky moves in order to impress the ladies is both hilarious and a clever way to portray Peter Parker's altered psyche. Later, a stylish dance sequence further illustrates Peter's ugly transformation. These scenes play out kinda like an inverted take on the equally unexpected 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head' scene from Spider-Man 2 - it's moments like that which made the Spider-Man trilogy special imo. A flawed but very entertaining film."

","the spider-man movie franchise has been always expected to be one of the biggest and coolest action-packed films of the summer. The First two spider-man films were excellent in the views of storytelling, conflicts, action sequences...etc.<br/><br/>now...with spider-man 3...i wouldn't go far describing bits and pieces of the film that are 'considered' stupid....i was trying to understand where this film was going as with the plot and comic 'funny' sequences. i just couldn't buy it....at least some of it. <br/><br/>to be stereotypical on this one....what was up with Spiderman turning 'emo'? That thing with peter having his hair down...reminded me of a friend of mine who wears tight pants and gets picked on by stereotypes, sometimes reffered to as 'emo'. I don't know if the hair thing was used to illustrate Peter's 'evil-ness'...but it simply did not work for me. <br/><br/>fast-forwarding to Venom...When the symbiote arrived from outer space in a comet or meteorite or whatever...i thought that was pretty random. Im guessing, for three villains in the film, they didn't have time to explain much...so i guess everything had to be squeezed and thrown in to this film. although the film was pretty long. With the de-molecularization of the sand man...I'm sure ""everyone knows exactly what de-molecularization is""<br/><br/>overall....the action sequences were good. Sandman was enourmously impressive although some of the cgi looked absolutely pretty fake. The conflicts with Peter and Mary Jane were pretty shocking. Overall, its a fun movie to watch in the theater with a couple of friends or family. If you're a crazed movie expert fanatic or whatever, you'll probably notice these things...and hopefully does not ruin the experience of spider-man 3"

","Good marks for special effects, low points for dumb down story, Spiderman left doing nothing on this, there's no real danger just, Good vs Bad revenge type story vs buildings that fight back. City and people that live in it wasted on this crap movie, they where just used as a prop for destructing and latest CGI Effects. I hope Sam Raimi moves on from this PG made for Hollywood bank machine and make his own original movies for adults that are not restricted to PG, I felt like his hands was tied on this.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi I know would've made spider-man go all way to be evil or his girl maybe sleep with his best friend or something. Spiderman kisses another girl for picture shoot now she breaks up with him to further the dumb story so spider man can turn bad ass and practice his moves for Dancing with the Stars. Hope you guys know scripts in a big franchise needs to get green light from studios and DC comics before they film, I bet they had to do a lot of rewrites to please everyone, thats why this one is really thin, everyone involve on this was playing it safe.<br/><br/>Spiderman foes here have no reason to revenge anything, I mean 1 guy loses his job so now he has to kill spider-man, I know this is comic book popcorn movie for kids but this is very weak, bad acting is forgivable for movie like this, but this movie nowhere near as interesting as X-men 3 as a wrap-up or sequel movie, It felt really all jammed packed and rushed to fit as much effects and action in 2 hours. The plot and characters is left for chance, only Bruce Campbell, and butler was only people in movie that I liked and didn't letdown spider-man 3. Why not Riami make a spoof of spider-man using Campbell and the butler, would've made a more entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Good movie needs real evil enemies, and if their backdrop is in city then citizens need to be in real danger for movie to be effective and hero to save them. This movie I felt had nothing but a showcase for special effects, I hope Sam Raimi goes back to making his own movies and forget strings attached sequels and do what he does best. Movies like Evil Dead and Darkman great films hes done in past, There was no need to do this spider-man except for money. Let this be a lesson, X-Men 3 or Superman 2 is holy grail for Hollywood to shoot for, If you look at that superman 2 you can see great evil foes at work in that film and why it worked so well. <br/><br/>PS: I think Riami just was sick of making this movie and rushed it by so he can get his paycheck. Heard he doesn't want to make another spider-man. Popcorn movies sequels should be limited to 2 sequels, thats 3 parts, History has proved part 3 always suck, Except for Evil Dead series."
"lmayer2","7","0","0","14 May 2007"," It was experimental, it was put out there to be critiqued
","I think the case for most (if not all) movie trilogies/series is that there is at least one bland film in the series. For example, some may argue that Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace was the blandest in the Star Wars series. True or not, there had to be one episode in that series that really did not deliver. Spiderman 3 was merely just a break from all of hype. I am sure that Sam Raimi and the crew will bounce back. It had its share of slow points and points at which you knew they weren't out to make the best film in the series. They could've changed some roles but Topher Grace was excellent as the villain, Venom. No series can carry on to deliver a Five Star performance. They've all fallen through to the cold, articulate measure of the critics. In the Godfather, it was Godfather Part 3, as an example. You have to take a break sometime in a series, right? Especially if there's talk of another 3 movies or so coming out in the Spiderman series and I'm sure it will show in future series to come such as Shrek, Batman, Harry Potter etc. Who knows. Spiderman 3 was good though. It was experimental, it was out there and it was put on display from critiquing. It had to happen sometime."

","I was wary of seeing Spiderman 3 after reading the reviews in newspapers and on IMDb; however, the movie was as good as the first two. I think that there are many who don't realize the amount of Spiderman's plot that actually revolves around Peter Parker (in the comic). Like it or not, if you watch or read Spiderman, you will be spending a lot of time watching the mediocre life of a lovable nerd.<br/><br/>The movie had three villains and each villain had a story behind him. Some of the stories were well thought-out and well-acted. Some of the stories were simply thrown together without much thought. The special effects were strong and the acting, for the most part, was strong as well. The most disturbing personality in the movie is that of Mary Jane (Parker's girlf). As a stage actress, she spends so much time second guessing herself that she destroys her relationship with Parker.<br/><br/>Bugle editor J.J. Jameson is especially funny in this third installment of the Spiderman series. Enjoy!"
"shadowman123","7","0","0","14 May 2007"," Is 3rd time really a charm ?
","My favourite web-slinger is back for a third outing and I for one was very hyped up about it. Ladies and Gents I have been a huge spider-man fan since I was a kid and when I saw the the teaser trailer of this third instalments with him hanging up-side in his black symbiont suit I for one was counting the days to see it. From reading other comments I can understand why people felt let down, I mean all this hype going round and Sam Rami had taken a very bold step in introducing the symbiont which I felt was too early in the franchise but being that the first two movies where brilliant it was understanding that he had to deliver the goods and bring something new and fresh to the table.<br/><br/>On the whole the movie was not that bad, but as a Spider-man fan I did feel a little something missing. The whole concept of the darker side of Spider-man was good but unfortunately we never really truly see it go to that level I mean any spider-man fan will tell you that what the symbiont CAN REALLY DO. The film was also rushed in places with things getting hectic and chaotic which made it seem messy! We Mary-Jane juggling her own problems with Harry Osborn donning the suit of his father, the Sandman seemed to be the central villain in this movie and not Venom who seemed more like a tweener (what the Fu!K)with silly little sub-plots firing left right and centre. On the other side I really enjoyed watching the symbiont spider-man being he was given very little screen time , the fight sequences were good and still filling . And the comedic moments were funny as well. The stars that stood out were Haden as the Sandman, although I felt that they got the character of the Sandman wrong he still done a wonderful job and J.K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson was better this time round. James Franco was surprisingly a lot darker than Tobey Maguire who at times was starting to show the his darker side but then abruptly cuts it off and Kirsten Dunst was just plain moaning and whining whilst Topher seemed to behave a lot more like Carnage than Venom !<br/><br/>Too conclude Spider-man 3 could of been the best in the series but unfortunately Sam Rami crammed wayyyy too much into it which makes it seem messy rather than mind-blowing and it could of been one hell of an exit for Maguire and Dunst who will not be reprising there roles. I would like to see Venom back for the 4th instalments but Rami should sit down and take it easy rather than rushing it because I felt this could of been the best one in the franchise. On the whole I have tried my hardest to defend this film the best I can because I did feel that others were cutting it for no reason but any movie movie goer or Spider-man fan can tell you that there a problems clearly visible but I do hope this is not an omen of any kind. Spider-man 3 is worth a look at but after all the hype it merely satisfies and not amazes.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN 3 : 8.1 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THE GREATEST BATTLE LIES WITHIN!"
"giginida2000","7","0","0","13 May 2007"," I enjoyed it
","I like the second movie better, but this one was still good. The acting from Maguire and especially Franco, in my opinion, has improved (although there was one scene with Maguire that made me as - a huge fan of his - cringe and want to crack up in laughter). There are some corny moments, but think of it this way - Peter Parker is a geeky superhero. Here's some advice I heard from Elvis Duran from the y100 Morning Zoo(a great radio show, by the way)that really helped me: go see this film with mediocre expectations and you'll get great results. Have fun - don't take the movie too seriously. And pay no attention to what the critics are saying. Go see it for yourself!!"
"dottyjyoung","6","0","0","12 May 2007"," It wasn't half bad.....
","Just a little under half, actually........<br/><br/>So everyone agrees that there were too many story lines, no adequate development for *any* of the stories, that Venom got the short end of thestick on screen time, that Peter Parker could have spent 50% less time looking like a GQ-wanna-be, and that Bryce Dallas Howard's character (what was her name again?) got no character development.<br/><br/>Since we all agree on that, I'm going to (gasp!) point out a few of its strong points. If these points had been given time to grow, this could havebeen the most powerful of all three. Unfortunately for all of us, they were not, but my hope is to encourage people reading this to grow as writers.<br/><br/>For starters, there IS something beyond the ""happily ever after"" ending of most love stories---there's the conflict of learning how to be together! I was thrilled to see Peter Parker and MJ dealing with the age-old ""I don't want you to fix my problem, I just want you to listen and be there for me"" issue. I loved the (little bit of) wisdom that aunt Mae tried to share with Peter--you have to put your wife/husband before yourself. Both MJ and Spidey were completely self-absorbed and not ready to get married. (MJ was wrapped up in her problems, Spidey in his success.) This was a beautiful gem that could have been polished more.<br/><br/>My husband and I nearly fell out of our seats when we saw the redemption of Harry, and the forgiveness of Flint. It's wonderful to see a movie where people are not locked into an ever-deepening pit of despair. (I still want to take a shower every time I *think* about the movie The Prestige) People do have a choice---my mistakes in life are not all my parents' fault, society's fault, or even God's fault. They're MY mistakes. I can choose to wallow in my misery, or forgive and move on. It was wonderful to see both Harry and Spiderman choose to forgive. I wish for the life of me that we had seen more of the conflict with Harry. Their opening fight scene was the best in the trilogy, and James Franco proved to be an incredibly versatile and subtle actor.<br/><br/>And who didn't cheer when Stan Lee showed up for a cameo? :) <br/><br/>So, it's worth going to see again----at the dollar theater. :)"
"thisiscnn2","7","0","0","11 May 2007"," Spider-man 3 review
","OK, I waited anxiously to see Spider-man 3 like everyone else.My fiancÃ© and I have seen spider-man every opening day and it has become a tradition for us. I won't give anything away, but let me say this. Spider-man (1) was one of the best movies ever made. It fully explored all aspects of what Spidey should be, even though it's not entirely true to the comics, but what is? Sider-man 2 had more holes in it although the action sequences were better, not as good of a movie as 1 because of more holes in the plot. Most people seem to forget about the holes in the movie and praise it as better than one. In my opinion this is a mistake. Now that you know about my feelings of 1 and 2, i will tell you my thoughts of 3. Tobey and Kirstin both felt wrong. They both felt as if they had gotten sick of their roles and were waiting for something new. They have lost any passion they might have had for their roles. The special effects were unbelievable, literally. The physics of some of the scenes didn't add up. I will say this. Topher Grace did an excellent job. The portrayal of his character of Eddie Brock was dead on, and gave a refreshing breath of air to a seemingly dying series of movies. If they can find a way to bring him in to the next film, I will see it just for him. one last comment. Having so many villains with intertwining story lines made the movie long and complex. If you didn't know at least a little of the storyline of spider-man from the comics it is conceivable for you to get lost in this movie. However, the fight scenes are incredible and almost faster than the eye can see. It is worth seeing this movie for this alone. Overall I gave it a 7, 2 gets an 8, and 1 gets a 10 for being one of the best movies ever made. Thanks for reading, John"
"Cel_Stacker","8","0","0","11 May 2007"," Forgiveness, what a concept...
","By now, I've heard my share of conflicting reports on this movie. I made a promise to myself long ago not to go into films I haven't seen with unrealistic or unfair expectations. It's served me well, and it was no less of a learning experience this time, having heard most every critic and wannabe critic's take on it, several of them negative.<br/><br/>I submit to them all, negative and positive, that they're missing the point. Spider-Man 3 successfully does what few films will even ATTEMPT nowadays. More on that later.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is on cloud nine. Things are finally looking up. As Spider-Man, he is the greatest thing since...well, the internet. A bona-fide celebrity. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) isn't doing too shabbily, either, having debuted in a Broadway show. Peter sees the perfect timing in finally proposing to MJ, for which Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) entrusts him with a precious family heirloom ring. Harry Osborn (James Franco) attempts the direct approach to exorcising his own demons in a confrontation with Peter, and as a result, becomes friends with him again. But not all is well in New York. Escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) has the heat breathing down his neck as he desperately looks for a way to reconnect with a repressed wife and a critically ill daughter. Meanwhile, upstart photo jock Edward Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) is looking to become Spider-Man's new unofficial PR for the Daily Bugle. Things get more and more complicated as protagonists and antagonists alike cross paths, and wind up learning something about themselves.<br/><br/>I'll admit, it won't win any awards, save maybe an Oscar or two for the effects and editing, and some MTV awards for the fights. You've heard it all, I'm sure, by now, so I'll mention in passing that the special effects and animation in this film are truly eye popping. Cinematography is grand, which it ought to be, 'cause this one wasn't cheap. On a basic level, and considering the source material, the story is well-handled; Sam Raimi remains the most capable director as far as taking a comic-book plot, virtually sticking to it verbatim, and making it work in a film format. Everyone earns their paycheck in portrayals--and additions and deviations, where damaging in other franchises, are welcome here. Haden Church gives classic brute Sandman a firm measure of humanity, James Franco must be applauded for his stalwart handling of a highly conflicted character in Harry Osborn, and despite limited screen-time, Topher Grace, yes, I have to admit, did gleeful justice to the wall-crawler's most fascinating adversary.<br/><br/>So what's different, you ask? What does Spider-Man 3 do that's so rare and great? The moral. Forgiveness, sadly, is a concept that's rarely broached in either fantasy OR real life. Particularly, at this most cynical time, and in our eye-for-an-eye, litigant-rich society, this is a lesson that kids from 3 to 133 could stand to learn and re-learn. If the cast and crew of Spider-Man 3 would take any pride in anything they've done here, it should be mostly for that. While I felt that the first two films were nicely done, this is the first Spider-Man that I actually wanted to buy.<br/><br/>Here's hoping the world's most popular comic book hero has started a long-overdue new trend in storytelling."
"Bunty-at-IMDB","7","0","0","11 May 2007"," The emotional installment
","I saw Spidey 3 in cinemas. I was expecting a very super-hero type action movie, but the movie totally doesn't fits into these genres. Movie was overall very good, although in some places it was poorly handled. A big minus point for this movie was it's own plot. Story was not very good. Villains in this movie are added gratuitously , which makes the plot very weak. <br/><br/>The movie revolves around Peter, his girlfriend Mary Jane and there friend Harry. Characters like Flint, Gwen and Eddie play a vital role. There are 2 (+2) villains in this movie. Main are Sandman (Flint/ Thomas Harden) and Venom (Eddie/ Topher Grace). New goblin which is Harry Osborn (James Franco) turns out a good person in the end and a so-called ""Black Suited Spider-Man"" kills his evil near the end. <br/><br/>Venom appears in the last half of the movie. Sandman also turns out good at the very end. So, only evil left was Venom (who was a parasite on Eddie Brock). Acting was fine. Cinematography was awesome. VFX were cool, but not classy.<br/><br/>This movie is actually a love-story with a very emotional ending. You should not expect any super-hero thing in this movie. But still this movie makes an impact on your mind. So, overall i'll say it was ""Very Good"" but not as good as Spider-Man 2, although its better than Spider Man 1. 2."
"finbarr-8","3","0","0","11 May 2007"," Not one for the CV, Sam
","Oh where to begin? I have been waiting very patiently for the last three years for the release of Spider-Man 3, making sure that I didn't succumb to the temptation of those forums and websites touting sneak-peeks and spoilers aplenty. I wanted this to be the trilogy's best, the full on thrill overdose promised by the tantalising finale to Spider-Man 2, so as I took my place in the cinema last Saturday evening I was, to use the vernacular, pumped! I was quietly confident that with the same main cast, director and scriptwriter in place that they could pull it off, especially with the tender loving care given to the character and story development in part 2 - the greatest superhero movie ever made, in my view.<br/><br/>Not only is Spider-Man 3 not the trilogy's best, it is the trilogy's worst, and by a considerable distance; I am still trying to come to terms with how Sam Raimi has manged to drop the ball so spectacularly with this film, after the excellent offerings that came before it.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 should, for the most part, have been Harry Osborn's movie. This was the climax to the intriguing story arc of a man wrestling with his soul and his conscience on discovering that has father's murderer, so he thought, had turned out to be his best friend. To give a suitable amount of time to conclude this story, with Harry's inevitable transformation into the second Goblin, and to allow for further character and plot development, one other villain, with a complementary storyline may have been do-able. In the event we got two more, and the whole thing collapsed under its own weight.<br/><br/>Not only was there too much story to cope with, but, and this is what completely mystifies me, the whole thing reeks of bad film-making otherwise. There were buttock clenching moments aplenty. Take, for example, the extremely clunky dialogue involving dreadfully unsubtle exposition, a very poor (and irritatingly obtrusive - especially in its clumsy re-use of some of Danny Elfman's previous work) musical score, very major and egregious plot cop-outs - Bernard the butler with the forensics qualification and an unforgivably bad sense of timing (almost two movies too late, in fact), and Doctor Connors' amazing ability to discern that the alien substance 'amplifies aggression' by having a quick peek at it under a microscope. If the symbiote loves its host so much, why does it allow Peter to take it off? and then lock it up in a trunk? To compound the mess there was a woeful (almost non-existent) level of character development (the Markos, the Staceys and Brock in particular), and, to accommodate the Sandman, some unnecessary tampering with the Uncle Ben back story, which should have been left well alone.<br/><br/>Wheras I was really rooting for the characters in Spider-Man 2, and was completely absorbed in Spidey's world, the third film has left me feeling detached from those same characters, with absolutely no emotional buy-in. It was shocking to realise that, by the end of the film, I didn't really care what happened to Harry, or the others for that matter. When I reflect on how I felt about Harry's dilemma at the end of Spider-Man 2, then that alone speaks absolute volumes about the sheer vacuousness of Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>My advice is, if you've seen the first two and you enjoy the fact that they (the second one especially) are character driven, and a lot of time and effort is put into developing those characters to a satisfying degree, then live your life with the knowledge that they were great films and, so as not to taint your memory of them, avoid Spider-Man 3 like the plague."
"nyskins1","6","0","0","10 May 2007"," An enjoyable film, but not without flaws
","What made the first two Spider-Man movies so enjoyable was the extent to which they stuck to the overall feeling of the comic books--the schmaltz, the fun action, and the somewhat cheesy dialogue. And while Spider-Man 3 is enjoyable as well, where it ultimately fails is in trying too hard to capture that essence--and in trying to do too much.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film finds Peter in a rather good place. The city loves him, things are going great with Mary Jane, and he's doing well in his physics class. But things go south rather quickly when Mary Jane starts to feel under-accomplished next to him; Harry decides to go on a murderous revenge streak; there's a new photographer at the Bugle named Eddie Brock; and, to top it all off, the guy he killed in the first movie didn't actually kill his uncle. Have I lost you yet?<br/><br/>That's not to say, however, that Spider-Man 3 feels cluttered. It just feels underdeveloped. In the previous two movies we had villains who had interesting backgrounds with lots of exposition. Here, the villains are kind of left to the wayside. All that matters is that they exist. Which is a shame, considering how well-cast both parts were.<br/><br/>Continuing the tradition of the previous two Spidey flicks, this movie is beautifully cast. In the first film, we had Willem Dafoe playing essentially two parts. In the second movie. Alfred Molina captured the quiet genius and complex menace of Doc Ock. In this movie, we have Topher Grace, who does surprisingly well as the brash, arrogant Eddie Brock. And Thomas Haden Church takes what little exposition is given him and creates a truly multi-layered villain. Then there's Bryce Dallas Howard, who--while a bit underused--is a perfect Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>Enough cannot be said about the effects in this movie. It is easy to see where the money went. It is virtually impossible to tell when Spidey is CGI vs. real (ignoring, of course, the impossibility of some shots). Some of the camera-work is incredible; it is rare to see a director who can make some scenes that are disorienting yet still easy to follow.<br/><br/>But where Spider-Man 3 ultimately falls short is in its trying to do too much. There's too much of the comic book cheese; too much story; even too much action, perhaps. But the film is still extremely enjoyable despite its flaws, and it is head and shoulders above some of the travesties put out by Marvel in recent years (Fantastic Four, Daredevil, The Hulk). Do yourself a favor and see this movie for what it is--an enjoyable conclusion to a well-done trilogy."

","Never been a Marvel comics guy, and never read a Spider-Man comic, but I was a big fan of the first two Spider-Man films and was looking forward to the third one. Figured, if nothing else, it would be a typical fun summer flick. It wasn't.<br/><br/>Everyone's going to comment on the whole ""too many bad guys"" element, but I'll have to disagree. It wasn't ""too many bad guys."" It wasn't even ""too many plot elements"" or ""too many loose ends to tie up."" Too much is one thing, and a valid excuse if that's really the problem, however, I'd argue that's not the problem here. What people seem to be overlooking is that nothing was done well. Not one element; not the love story, not Spidey's ego issues, not the Sandman. You can do a lot in a film if you do it all well; if characters are developed and the focus is tight and snappy. Spider-man didn't do that, and ultimately, Spider-Man 3 did nothing well, except maybe special effects.<br/><br/>The writing was pretty sad, and half the film belonged on the cutting room floor. I think the first thing anyone bad-mouths is the ""emo bad guy"" Spidey, and rightfully so. I swear to God, I was praying that was a dream-sequence the whole time. It was absurd. Every movie deals with it's own reality, and when you violate that reality, you make a bad movie. Peter Parker tapping random girls' behinds is pretty iffy, but when he walks onto the stage at a jazz club, steals the piano, grabs the microphone, dances on the tables, swings off the lights, and rocks out on the middle of the dance floor with background dancers snapping behind him like he's in a production of West Side Story, the movie loses all touch with it's reality. I'm not saying Spider-Man 1 or 2 were ""realistic,"" I'm just saying that even in Spider-Man's reality, that doesn't happen. It was absurd, and while obviously an attempt at humor, I found it insulting.<br/><br/>I could probably go on for a long while Spider-Man's problems, but let me just say a three more things. First off, in Spider-Man 3, grenades aren't grenades, they're plot devices. Just another violation of Spider-Man's internal reality. When Spider-Man throws a plot device at Harry Osborn and it explodes next to his face, he gets a nasty scar. When Spider-Man throws a plot device at Venom and Eddie Brock, it destroys them completely. That makes tons of sense, eh? Secondly, Sandman. Since when can Sand fly? I dunno, I'll leave that aside. Clearly, Sandman is one heck of a villain, and he's established as being pretty darn tough to kill. Spider-Man tries water, that doesn't work. Harry later tries turning him into glass and cracking him, but clearly that's ineffective too. So how does the movie get rid of him? Magical change of heart. No build up, no explanation other than the implied one that goes like ""he's just a good guy who had tough luck, and now he wants to show it."" One minute Sandman's trying to kill everyone, one minute he's asking Spidey to forgive him. How satisfying to the audience. I wanted resolution. That's pretty poor.<br/><br/>Lastly, the black stuff. What the heck? I don't care that it fell from the sky, just give me a little bit of back-story or some kind of development. Spidey takes it to some random scientist who just happens to not care that a reporter just brought him a weird black alien organism in a glass jar. Maybe they figured he'd do a better job at giving us expositional dialog than a Spider-man voice-over. If you read the comics, you know all about the ""venom symbiote,"" but if you don't, you're imagining the Doctor saying something like; ""Peter, be careful, it enhances aggression, it seems to want you, and appears to be some symbiotic alien organism. I know, because that's what it says in the script."" And finally; look, if a weird black alien goo falls down from the sky and takes you over, amplifying your aggression and your anger and essentially all the bad traits within you, I'm pretty sure the love of your life would understand that if you told her.<br/><br/>Maybe I didn't hit on the best points, because there are tons of things to criticize here, but those stand out to me. Others could be summed up by phrases like ""convenient bout of amnesia"" or ""Gwen Stacy is invulnerable to getting hit in the face with a desk"" or ""emo hair is not a bad-guy look."" Disappointing, and seems to show that Spider-Man is going in the direction of the old Batman series: turning into a cartoon, not a comic."

","Once I saw the preview in the commercial for Spider-Man 3 I was excited because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. What I like about the Spider-Man movies is that they're exciting and not boring like other previews that you are fooled by seeing that the movie is going to be good when in reality they are boring which seems like you just wasted your money on something worthless. For Spiderman I don't think its a waste of money because once you come out of the theatre all you can say is that it was a good movie. That's the same reaction that I've had for the other movies and I expect this one to be the same. Hopefully I'll have used ma money on a good movie!!!"
"ExpendableMan","6","0","0","10 May 2007"," So....where's Venom?
","If you've caught any of the pre-release hype for the third Spiderman movie (and if you haven't, welcome friend to Earth, this little grey box before you is called a Talk-A-Matron and my name is HAL. I'm in charge round here), chances are you've been convinced that it's the dark chapter in the saga. You know, the grim and brooding one with the web-slinger sat on Gargoyles at the top of Cathedrals in the rain. The one which will send the kids home with nightmares, terrified that Venom is hiding in the attic and so forth. Well, Sam Raimi and co lied to you I'm afraid. That's right, they lied! Because this movie is so light and breezy as to make Scooby-Doo look like The Exorcist and the emphasis is on extended action sequences rather than subtle and layered character development.<br/><br/>As such, Peter Parker's much talked about descent amounts to him getting a bit more arrogant than usual, dressing in black, adding a touch of mascara to his face and doing up his hair in a trendy new Indie rock do. If only he'd started listening to The Jesus And Mary Chain in his spare time then maybe Aunt May would have found something more to worry about.<br/><br/>Luckily, when Raimi and co are dishing out the action sequences things step up a gear into pure popcorn munching fun. In many ways, it all plays like a video game: Level One, high speed chase with the new Goblin; Level Two, security van smackdown with the Sandman; Level Three, guide Spidey through angst-ridden interpretive dance in a jazz club...It's all very silly and won't be winning anything at Cannes by any stretch of the imagination, but then you don't exactly go to watch comic book movies for bold, innovative film making do you? With Tobey Maguire going through a difficult phase, it falls to the rest of the cast to spice things up, with this year's ""Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie"" award going to Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marco, aka The Sandman. Raimi clearly has a lot of love for the character as reports of the special effects team studying sand for two years will testify and this is channelled into a moving portrayal of wounded masculinity by the best actor in the film. Given that he's labelled as the real killer of Parker's Uncle Ben, the fact that he's able to wring such pathos from those sad, sad eyes is all the more impressive.<br/><br/>If you've seen either of the preceding chapters you'll know what to expect from cast regulars Kirsten Dunst and James Franco, as well as the traditional scene stealing from J. K. Simmons as Parker's boss, so with fanboy speculation driven to breaking point by months of teaser trailers, the bulk of expectation falls on Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, more commonly known as Venom. And aside from the fact that he's not quite imposing enough, Grace does a terrific job. From his first moments on screen, he is delightfully sleazy and just the sort of man who society doesn't want to get hold of super powers. After all, for Parker, great power brings great responsibility whereas for Brock it brings great opportunities for ass-kicking.<br/><br/>Sadly though, despite that long waiting period and plenty of build up, Venom doesn't exactly get a lot of screen time. In fact he's barely shown up before the climactic brawl for all that pitches our hero into a match with all three of his foes at once. It's terrific to see Venom on screen naturally but you can't help wishing he were there longer and it winds up feeling an awful lot like a Wrestling Pay Per View which features the long awaited return of the Rock, only for him to fall off the entrance ramp and get rushed to hospital after four hours of matches between less-interesting grapplers.<br/><br/>Parents needn't be afraid though, the nippers are going to absolutely love this. It's not half as bleak as you might imagine, has wall to wall action and best of all, will keep them entertained for a full two and a half hours. For those of us who are a bit older than the kids and a bit younger than their parents however, it does disappoint somewhat after the near-perfect Spiderman 2, even if it does boast a trio of cameos which are all memorable for different reasons, namely Bruce Campbell (awesome!), Willem Dafoe (sinister) and Stan Lee (really, really stupid). On the slim chance that any of the producers are reading this however, I'd recommend editing out the 'swing in front of the American flag' bit for the overseas market when the DVD comes out."

","I was worried about Spider-Man 3. It looked as though the series might have taken a wrong turn and start heading down the path as the old Batman Series did after Batman Returns. It looked as though to much might have been crammed into this film, with to little amount of time. There is the Goblin story, plus the Sandman, and the story everyone has been waiting for, Venom.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I was mistaken, and seeing as my expectations were so low, Spider-man 3 actually pleasantly surprised me. If this truly is the last film, which rumors are flying that it might be, but we know how that works, then Spider-man 3 has a nice wrap up story. In Star Wars terms, Spider-man 3 is the series Return Of The Jedi, while Spider-Man 2 is the Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>taking place a few years after Spider-man 2, Peter parker (Tobey Mcguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are madly in love. M.J. is now in a Broadway musical, and it seems that the people of New York are ignoring The Daily Bugle and coming to love and appreciate Spider-Man for the hero that he is.<br/><br/>Enter Flint Marko, and escapade convict, who come to find out is the real person who killed Peter's uncle Ben. While Flint (Thomas Hayden Church) is on the run he enters a molecular testing site and becomes ""living"" sand due to an accident. Turns out Marko is a crook with a ""heart"" and only commits his crimes to get money to cure his daughters disease, which is never explained.<br/><br/>Then comes Harry Osbourne (James Franco, son of Norman the original Green Goblin, who wants Peter dead for Spider-man killing his father, a death that was a mishap on Norman's part, that Harry does not know about. Harry tries to get at Peter through messing with his head. The Harry Osbourne story in my opinion was the weakest sub-plot in Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>Then along comes the character every Spider-Man fan has been waiting for Venom. While making out with Mary Jane in a giant web, he misses a comet fall to earth (I'd still like to know how that happens) and from the comet comes the black ooze that bonds to peter and makes him more darker and evil (almost like the awful Superman III). The new ""black"" costume, made up of this ooze gives Peter enhanced strength, however he finds himself inching closer to ""the dark side"" like Luke in Jedi.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 makes up something that has been rarely seen in Hollywood since the original Star Wars trilogy, a good trilogy. Now a lot of comic book die hards will complain about the continuity issue with the Sandman being uncle Ben's real killer, but I was able to over look that. My big complaints about the film was an over the top song and dance number and I wish Venom spoke like he speaks in the comic, calling himself ""we"" and ""us"".<br/><br/>Regardless Spiser-man 3 was fun. That's something I'm glad Hollywood has got back into making. Movies that are fun, you just check your brain at the door, and get lost in the film. That's what was great about the other 2 Spider-Man films. Spidr-man 3 is a good ending, there is no need for Spider-man 4, but then again this is Hollywood."
"irabovsky","8","0","0","10 May 2007"," Cheesy- yet entertaining
","This movie felt like classic Sam Raimi directing, way more than the other 2 Spiderman movies. The movie had god-awful dialog and the acting was poor. Venom looked really cheesy, unless Topher Grace's head was showing. It didn't succeed in pulling 3 stories together (Harry Ozbourne, Venom and Sandman).<br/><br/>What this movie DID have, however, is humor. And plenty of it! There is a lot of really subtle comedy in this piece and its well worth your time to go look at it. It felt a LOT like evil-dead kind of funny, where its situational and the dialog is just cheesy enough for it to feel like a classic B-Cult flick. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you shouldn't look at this film in the perspective of a Hollywood blockbuster. You should look at this flick in the perspective of a classic Sam Raimi film and just loosen up.<br/><br/>That being said, I was very entertained by this movie. It was the first of the Spiderman- movies to actually look and feel like a comic book! It wasn't like watching a film-adaptation of a comic, it WAS the comic. <br/><br/>The action-scenes were really well done. They were cool, for lack of a better word. Especially to see Harry on a hover-board, fighting spider-man.<br/><br/>There was little character development, which is fine for characters like Peter and Mary Jane, because they're well established from the last two films.. but, characters like Eddy Brock suffer from it.<br/><br/>I wish they'd make a reference to Peter's professor the future Lizardman.<br/><br/>I don't think they should make a Fantastic 4 sequel (saw the preview in the theater).<br/><br/>So, in conclusion: Its funny, entertaining, Bruce Cambell is the best part. Its got terrible dialog, little character development, etc. If you're a big fan of Spiderman, you'd most likely get offended. If you're a really laid back moviegoer, it might be worth your time and money. I really enjoyed this film, even though it butchers the spider-man story.."

","Spider-Man 3 had the potential to be not only the best of it's trilogy, but, in my own opinion, one of the best films period. Unfortunately, a web of problems (hah hah) has stood in it's way, rendering it an entertaining popcorn flick, but nowhere near the epic that was Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>First of all, it should have been two movies. Sandman. The black suit. Gwen Stacey. The second GG. Venom. There's too much, going too fast. Each of these villains had the potential to carry the movie on their own (perhaps Harry could have been a side-villain to one of the others), but all three of them together just limits their potential.<br/><br/>Secondly, I don't know who was writing this thing, but it has some of the goofiest dialog and plot development of any movie I've ever seen. Peter gets this suit that supposedly augments his dark side, bringing out the inner evil that resides in the dark recessed of his soul...so he transforms into an emo John Travolta? And what was with the old butler at the end, revealing the big revelation to Harry? ""Oh yes, Harry, your dad was the Green Goblin, I've known all along. I just neglected to tell you for the past two movies because, well, I thought it would be funny."" Not even the fight choreography was all that great this time around. I lost count of how many times Spidey pulled the 'web-bullet' move, or how many 'falling fistfight' shots there were. (I hope you're enjoying 'Hot Wheels', John Dykstra! I hope you're enjoying it reeeeal good!) On a positive note, the actors did a splendid job of conveying their darker sides. There are some scenes (I.E., Peter hitting Harry with the bomb, the look on Harry's face when he's in the diner) that were downright disturbing.<br/><br/>All in all, go ahead and see it, it makes for a fun night out. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece."

The film did not explain much about Venom and why it can beat spidey. The film did not totally explain sand man well what was it ""o there seems to be a bird in the reactor"" seriously? The next film needs to get explaining not matter how boring it is. It will lose comic fans and that shouldn't happen. Also having 3 villains to explain about is not clever with ""Harry"", ""Sandman"" and ""Venom"" you could also say himself it leaves you with big explanations.

","Spider-Man 3 is a disappointment. I was really looking forward to this movie as the first two installments were quite good and I thought Raimi was pretty much in control of the characters, but he let it slip this time around, unfortunately. It seemed to me like the whole staff, cast & crew were just overwhelmed by the magnitude of the film and the whole thing just got real sloppy (OK, the special effects not included -- but that shouldn't be surprising in 2007). First of all, NYC loves Spider-Man??? I thought JJJ was running the show and he certainly is not the kind of man to give Spidey good PR. I cannot recall any period in Spidey's life in the comics when his reputation was not ambiguous at best. And Peter Parker becoming cocky?? The guy is supposed to be a living statue of self-sacrifice, responsibility and caring for others. And if you have a superhero for a boyfriend, please quit the whining and the ""what about me?"" attitude, MJ! Enter Sandman: I liked the acting and the special effects were really good, but what's with all the melodrama? And how could he possibly just fly away in the end with Spidey waving good-bye to the man who killed his beloved uncle and threatened to kill his girlfriend?? Oh, he said sorry, right. The New Goblin is really no goblin at all but a sky-surfer with gadgets. How did Harry get his new gear? I really liked the way the original Green Goblin was put together in the first movie (Oscorp developing the gear for the army), but this time around Harry (who would have flunked junior high school physics if it hadn't been for Peter) does all this improvement alone? Or did that know-it-all butler do it for him (afterall he took one look at Norman Osborne's wounds and concluded they were caused by his own hover-board -- not bad!). And now Venom: OK, so the symbiote is supposed to bring your bad side out. Ooooh and did he do that with Peter! What a monster he's become! Emo hair, eyeliner, a new black jacket and acting like a damn fool around women. Oh, let's not forget the dance routine and accidentally hitting MJ on the face. The horror! The pain! Somebody stop this menace! And the black suit is not something you take off and put in a suitcase -- because it's not really a suit, you know! Eddie Brock was actually a pleasant surprise from Topher Grace and Venom wasn't all too bad. He should have deserved much more screen time and much more involvement in the storyline -- maybe instead of having to witness MJ's career crisis. And a comment to Stan Lee: I know it's exciting to get a cameo role in all your characters' movies, but how could you stand by and watch Spider-Man get surprised from behind by an enemy??? Spider-sense, Mr. Lee, do you remember? You gave that special power, one of the key powers, to Spider-Man. What you did not give him is shooting web balls from his wrist like an idiot. Oh no, a web ball, quick, run, I might get a bump on my forehead if it hits me!<br/><br/>Not quite the disgrace that Schumacher made with Batman, but almost. I really think Spider-Man 4 should be Spider-Man Begins."

","Spider-Man 2 was a masterpiece of character drama that managed to keep an audience of comic book fans and superhero buffs and kids gripped even during large gaps without action. It was incredibly riveting and the cinematography was never corny the way it tends to be with many superhero films and especially Sam Raimi films. It was a landmark. Spider-Man 3 is fine, but it just doesn't hit as hard. I'm not feeling anything for it right now. I know it's a good movie, but I saw it yesterday and I forgot until now to write my review. It's not a forgettable movie in the sense that you're indifferent the entire time. It's just another comic book flick.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that I'm for some odd reason fickle in my viewpoints on several things in this movie, and I'm usually very hard-headed about what I think of a movie, right down to the last frame. For instance, the story seems very contrived and constructed rather than led to, but on another hand, the almost ad-libbing, seemingly improvised script draws interest from the audience. Examples include that there's a Sand Man, but there's also an alien venom. Or that Harry still wants revenge for his father's death and won't listen, but he will, but he won't. Peter gets pushed around and handles it in unpredictable, self-destructive ways, but will Spider-Man still save the day? The audience desperately wants to know, not just for their sake but for the togetherness of the movie, how all of these strands are handled and woven together by the end.<br/><br/>Another thing I'm torn about is the episode of the film dealing with the venomized spidersuit, where Spider-Man is influenced by the black alien venom. This isn't a spoiler, so don't worry. You see that in the trailer. My problem with it is that that is my favorite part of the movie, because I enjoy everything he does when he wears this venomized suit. I think the audience is supposed to like certain things he does to an extent and certain parts of it are meant to be productive to him and thus making the venom addictive, but I happen to commend all the vindication and rebellion by him in the duration of this part.<br/><br/>I'm certain of a few things, though. One of them is how the Sandman, played by the odd casting choice of Thomas Haden Church, comes to be the Sandman. It's ridiculous, completely not believable, and even though one can't fault a superhero movie for being a superhero movie, there are certain things that need to be believable. I can't stand not giving it away in order to explain it, but I want those who are reading these reviews on here to be able to use them for what they're meant to be used for: Persuasion and direction of one's expectations. The reviews with spoiler alerts serve no purpose, because you can only read them after you've seen it. What's the point? Anyway, I do however find a lot of the special effects pertaining to the Sandman to be awesome, especially in the first scene where he appears, falling apart but still moving and gathering up again.<br/><br/>So the verdict is that Spider-Man 3 does not surpass its predecessor and perhaps in film series that are constructed continuations for the sake of franchise rather than large-scale stories that last that long to be told simply can't be as memorable because of how many times we've seen the same characters already, almost like an episode in a television series. But, it is very entertaining in that fast, fun, undemanding Hollywood way."

","The special effects are incredible. You just wonder how far will the go in that matter. It's so good it seems real !!! But let's face it, the story is simply not good. The story would be good for a bad ""comic book"", but for a movie you have to give much more than that to the viewers. Especially after a film like ""Batman begins"" with Christian Bale. ""Batman begins"" is the perfect example of a well balanced movie : a really good story well put together that holds you spellbound ; a good amount of special effects without overshadowing the story; an excellent group of actors (except for Katie Holmes). I thought that ""Batman begins"" was the new standard, that any director, worthy of the name, had to give us a movie as good as ""Batman begins"" or even better. But unfortunately it doesn't look like that. I only hope that Christopher Nolan, the director for ""Batman begins"", will give ""director lessons"" to all the others directors out there."
"moldo_bmf","8","0","0","8 May 2007"," Could have been much better....
","I will go ahead and say this so people will understand why I didn't give this movie a lower grade: I love Spider-Man. I watched nearly the entire animated series when they first came out. However it pains me to see the third installment of this series fall flat under the two previous parts. Spider-Man was good, Spider-Man 2 was great, Spider-Man 3... could have been greater. First big mistake on the part of director Sam Raimi along with Ivan Raimi and the other people who wrote the screenplay was the fact that they tried to squeeze in 2 times more villains than the previous parts put together. Of course, if the movie would have had an epic time length of 4 hours this decision would have been fairly justified. Even more weird is the fact that even though we had this many villains and would have expected an even more action packed movie than the other two, Sam Raimi wanted to make room for tear-jerking, heart-breaking, pity-inspiring drama... he failed miserably. <br/><br/>Why? It's not because of the over-exaggeration or the uncalled for soap-opera moments and not even the fact that some things just don't make all that much sense (like Spider-man kissing Gwen in front of his girlfriend as if just wanting to start a conflict, and his even cooler punch line ""She's just a girl from my class"" instead of just saying something like ""I did it for the cameras"") but because of one man: Tobey Maguire. I really appreciate him as an actor and i think he did a great job of playing Spider-Man, but i'll just go ahead and say this: he has 0 dramatic value in the scenes in which he is put. I mean seriously, upon seeing his face when he started crying i couldn't help but laugh. I figured at first that i might be a raving lunatic for transforming such ""dramatic"" scenes into jokes. That is until people in 3 different cinemas (yes i have seen it 3 times) all laughed at the same scenes. Case closed. <br/><br/>On the good side, the visual effects were just candy for the retina and i just couldn't help but almost drool at the sight of the battles and the sheer brutality of certain hits (speaking of which Harry Osbourne has a weird habit of just slamming his head into any hard object he can see right?). This was an aspect that made me pass over the drama and tear-jerking (tears of laughter) scenes only to expect another clash of titans. As a conclusion I recommend you go watch this movie with several friends so as to just have a good laugh when seeing Spider-Man cry his blue and red heart out at the thought that Mary Jane is going to dump him. <br/><br/>Oh, one more thing. Although i don't appreciate the fact that director Sam Raimi brutally slaughtered the image of Spider-Man when he was wearing the suit by turning him into some crazed 70's disco fanatic, i have to admit it was funny as hell. However, i don't want to see a superhero turned into something like ""that"" any time soon. :D"

","****SPOILER ALERT****<br/><br/>To put it simply, I was extremely disappointed. I couldn't believe how awful some parts of the movie were put together, it made me sick. They totally ruined such a good superhero in one movie. I thought Daredevil was bad, but this could be on par. I mean, some parts of the film were entertaining, to say the least. The Sandman was put together quite nicely, storyline and all. How his story ended though, was sad and just wrong. I know the whole "" If you can forgive yourself thing"" meant to forgive Sandman because they shared the same path, but still, it was just a long drag. On top of that, Harry wasn't as good as his father. I mean, he didn't have the craziness to him like the original Goblin. I know they were best friends and all, and I'll admit he did a good part in the movie, especially after regaining memory. But I didn't like the fact that they teamed up and became all buddy buddy like. I know Spider-Man couldn't handle the both by himself ( if it was the cartoon he would so kick their ass :p) but still. The overuse of 'Watch out buddy!' and whatnot in the fight was just ridiculous. And now, Venom. This made me cry. I almost felt like walking out of the theater because I was so upset. How could they ruin such an awesome character? The real Venom has the following traits:<br/><br/>Big body build. Crazy attitude. Jock-type personality. Almost mentally insane, not like Carnage, but he was crazy. :p Spoke as a group, not as Eddy. Long, bad ass tongue. And a wicked voice that sounded alien-like.<br/><br/>In the movie this is how they portrayed Venom:<br/><br/>Skinny, nerdy, annoying. Didn't really sound that different with the suit on, maybe a bit deeper. No bad ass tongue. No awesome symbol on suit. Didn't really feel like he even had the suit. Not enough craziness or spunk, just seemed like a teen trying hard.<br/><br/>AND WHY THE HELL DID THEY HAVE TO KILL OFF VENOM SO FAST. WHY. HE IS THE BEST FREAKING CHARACTER IN THE DAMN SERIES AND THEY KILL HIM OFF.<br/><br/>That drove me nuts, how could they ruin such a film. The only thing I'm hoping for is that they make another film, and add the piece of symbiote that Doc Conners had, or introduce Eddie Brock Sr, as a better, more bad ass Venom.<br/><br/>The possibilities are out there, but as for now I was completely upset with this movie. I don't really recommend anything, I would say watch it for yourself to critique it yourself, or you can just wait for it on DVD. Either way you might feel the same."

The dancing??? what the hell was that all about???? Why did Venom die??? It makes no sense to me why they couldn't follow the original story line, it would have been so much better. Now carnage cant come in because Carnage was supposed to kill Venom not Spiderman and What happened to the Hob Goblin??? There really wasn't one. I just wish they would have done better on the story.

Spidey often battled more than one villain. I did like Franco and I liked Spiderman as a bad guy. That was pretty smooth. I hear they are making another. Please Marvel, get a new director.

"MalcolmJTaylor","7","0","0","7 May 2007"," Dark Spidey's the only reason to see this film
","Having seen the first two installment, I saw Spidey 3 more out of obligation rather than anticipation. The bulk of the movie functions as a cure for insomnia and washroom breaks. The overwrought romantic story line is suffocatingly sentimental. The picture feels formulaic, as if all the innovation has been sucked dry by the series first two installments. <br/><br/>It is unashamedly American with lots of senseless ""cartoon"" violence where characters get repeatedly bludgeoned, lacerated and pummeled yet magically never suffer any consequences all the way through and beyond the flag waving crescendo. All for the wonder of seeing the webbed crime-fighter do his thing in full CGI glory. It would be far more rewarding to see a Spiderman updated for our times and not one that is still stuck in 1950's moral values.<br/><br/>Welcome new dark Spidey, the most entertaining by far. Now this guy gets things done. He just has to reign it in a little bit and use his powers with more discretion.<br/><br/>Other than that the story lacks freshness. The entire Sandman character feels contrived, though Haden Church gives a great performance. As for Spiderman's other foe, equally so. It feels thin. The main dramatic plot point being a staff-job competition for the Bugle. Wow, talk about dated. Spidey's enemies have no creativity in this film and lack any real plan for world-domination-type thinking. They are small time. Leaving only one thing that's any fun, dark Spidey. Still not quite worth the price of admission though. However, thumbs up to Tobey for pulling it off so well."

","Spiderman 3 is one of the most anticipated films of the year. The media, the news, our neighbors, our friends, everyone talked and expected this movie to be grand and to be honest, I did enjoy the movie, however, there is a lot of disappointment when it comes to the plot, story lines, and some scenes. Although the cinematography and special effects can blow you away, the entire movie was all over the place. There were plots and subplots, characters that weren't developed enough or were put on hold. It was a complete MESS; too many things was going on and everything was just all over the place and maybe the reason is because they wanted to throw everything in this movie, in case it was the last, when in fact they could've created another part and extended some of the characters in this film onto the next. But hey, it's Spiderman! You cannot not see this movie!"
"extravaluejotter","5","0","0","7 May 2007"," Good, but...
","Only the ache in my legs when I got up told me that I'd sat through over 2 hours of the latest Spider-Man film. It was full of wham-bang action and quality acting and I was glad to have caught it on the big screen.<br/><br/>This is where the ""buts"" come in...<br/><br/>However, at times I caught myself wondering if Sam Raimi hadn't over-reached himself with this movie. There were a lot of complex special effects on display in some of the action sequences and as well-rendered as they were, they required me to suspend my disbelief on a very slender webline. In places there was just too much going on to take it all in.<br/><br/>Raimi and his cast did a good job of telling a human story as well as providing a golly-gee action romp, but as the kids all around me shuffled and muttered during the ""quiet"" bits, I began to question the way that the Spider-Man franchise was being marketed.<br/><br/>There's the obligatory appearance of Spidey's co-creator Stan Lee (and the great man gets a little dialogue this time, yay!), great supporting performances from Ted Raimi, Theresa Russell, Bruce Campbell, Rosemary Harris and J K Simmons. Kirsten Dunst is given a run for her money in the ""Screaming Girlie"" stakes by Bryce Dallas Howard. Tobey Maguire and James Franco get to do some scenery chewing while Topher Grace and Thomas Haden Church provide us with a pair of reliably human villains. Unfortunately, all this talent on show only increases the feeling that ""Spider-Man 3"" is a quart jammed into a pint pot. Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, James Cromwell and Bryce Dallas Howard are wasted in this film, with thin and sketchy cartoon roles designed to fit the plot. Dunst and Franco are particularly ill-served, having provided sterling support in their previous Spidey outings, with their characters doing little more than jumping through a series of plot-driven hoops. A lot of the heart of the previous films has been torn out of ""Spider-Man 3"" by forcing its main characters into a contrived and immature storyline rather than continuing to spin the Peter-MJ-Harry love triangle thread. <br/><br/>It's just too good, which I know is a strange criticism for a film. What I mean is that it needed to be slimmed down at the planning stage, instead of chucking so many good actors and so much quality CGI at a ""Worthy"" screenplay. All of the Spider-Man movies have something to say about the people we all want to be, but in this 3rd instalment it feels a little like the drama has been dumbed-down to make room for all those eye-catching visual effects. The cringe-making TV reportage of Spidey's climactic battle with the bad guys is symptomatic of the movie's ""More is Less"" malaise. It's simply unnecessary and it's badly done too. Another ridiculous add-on is Harry Osborn's butler Bernard, who was conspicuous in his absence in Parts 1 and 2. Bernard's earnest little speech about Harry's father is one of the most contrived pieces of exposition ever witnessed outside a Matrix movie. <br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" is nowhere near as good as 1 or 2, and Spidey will become another victim of The Law of Diminishing Returns unless someone takes a long hard look at what makes this franchise work. Having now viewed it on DVD, I'm downgrading it to ""Average"". A lot of the action scenes are cluttered and confusing and the contrived 3rd act seriously undermines Sam Raimi's reputation."
"huicholo","7","0","0","7 May 2007"," It was entertaining.
","I had fun watching it. That is about all the positive things I can say about it. I think that the problem with the film is that it has Kirsten Dunst in the Mary Jane role. Now they have to include that character in every plot about Spider-Man. Nothing in this film is explained. There is no build up. It just happens. Boom! Enter is Sandman! Boom! There is Venom! Boom! Another Green Goblin, but wait he turns into a good guy. Spider-man is running out archenemies to fight. I wonder who he will fight in the next one. My guess is the Hobgoblin. Action was very cool, however, the plot was like a spiders web, full of holes.<br/><br/>What I would like to see is the rise of organized crime. Spider-man is always fighting legions of criminals in the strip. I also would like Mary Jane to disappear some how."

Sure, the ending dragged on a bit, and it is good to get away from a cinema theatre with too many noisy kids inside, ( why, oh why, in Egypt do they let young kids - and I mean babies - into the cinemas ), but I did enjoy the film rather a lot.<br/><br/>The evil characters, with their completely different characteristics, for me the Sandman was by far the best, and their varying motives and agendas, as well as the split personalities of Spiderman, ( personally I prefer the more conceited or the more evil Spiderman to the original wishy washy version - as I feel that the Police Commissioners daughter would be a much better catch than that boring red headed regular girlfriend ), made for a much better, more entertaining, all round appealing film."

"evetsview","Null","0","0","6 May 2007"," Interesting Twist in the Web
","Spider Man 3 takes some different twists and turns. We pick up where we left off from Spider Man 2 where Peter and MJ have decided to give in to their true feelings and take the risks that will no doubt put a great deal of strain on their relationship. We also see the tension still mounting between Peter and Harry. However instead of continuing on the predictable course of a series of scenes with MJ being put in constant peril and Spidey coming to the rescue in the nick of time, we see a much more personal, human culprit begin to undermine the relationship - fame and ego and career struggles and disappointments. All these things are handled in a believable manner but Spider Man 3 suffers from the old case of trying to cram too much into one film in order to top the previous film.<br/><br/>The Sandman character was predictable and boring and the film would have been better off without it. The special effects are very good but the character had very little depth and took up more screen time which could have been put to better use with the Eddie Brock character and the development of Venom. I'm not sure why the film felt it had to put in more story that had to touch on the death of Uncle Ben again, by this time its growing tiresome. The developing triangle that occurs between Peter MJ and Harry is dramatic and well-paced. Sadly the mysterious dark suit that falls from the sky is given no explanation at all. (Unless Venom will make a return in future films and this detail will be thought out a little better).<br/><br/>There's more humor in this movie and it keeps the action from getting over the top - the scenes involving Jonah Jameson and (Bruce Campbell) as the french matre 'd stand out. The scenes where we see the darker side of Peter caused by the suit is well done and his other scenes played for humor were enjoyable. However by the last part of the film the dialogue begins to get very weak - The reporter covering the battle at the end is ridiculous and some of the character of Brock's speaking lines are hard to swallow though I think Grace did a decent job of portraying the cocky photographer. <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie and though it shows signs of being rushed and again with too many characters, I can't help but feel a certain degree of finality to Spider Man 3. It could very well be the last time with see Tobey Maquire and Kirsten Dunst in the lead roles. If its decided to continue the franchise, it will probably be with different faces, which could mean a slow downward slide of the series. -- I hope not."

The movie had it's flaws that's for sure but I think that in the end the exceeded in getting just what they were going for. Don't judge this movie before you even really give it a chance. It's not just about the villains, the battles and all that but what it's really about is Peter Parker and his life as Spider-man.

","With a lot of films that I see, I often give a movie tons of credit for what I thought were the enjoyable bits of it. I give it a good rating because I thoroughly enjoyed the film. This one is no exception.<br/><br/>However, I also note some of the things that I didn't like about the film. This one is no exception for this part as well. Here's what I have to say about Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>I liked the characters, particularly Harry. Peter got on my nerves quite a few times throughout this film, which may have been one of Sam Raimi's intentions when he filmed the movie. I felt really bad for M.J., whose life is just not going right in this film. Harry was my favorite character. I liked how they finally went back to his nicer personality from the first film. I felt bad for him as well, especially at the end (won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie and wants to). Flint Marko was an interesting character. A man who is only trying to save and protect his daughter but can't make that happen due to mistakes that get him in trouble with the cops. Eddie Brock Jr. was also an interesting character. You feel bad for him at first, but then he becomes Venom and you lose all sympathy for him. But he still manages to be a cool character.<br/><br/>The story was filled with tough moments for many characters. There are certain scenes that got way over-the-top with Peter's character when he allows his more confident side to get the best of him. You might even despise him. They also leave us hanging with Venom (who I hope will be in the fourth movie). I didn't like the ending very much. Very sad, but it also wasn't the traditional Spider-Man movie ending. I did like that Sandman has a possible future in the movies.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a good, entertaining film, but it's also quite a disappointment. Don't expect this to be the best installment of the franchise. Even I have to admit, it's not. Try to enjoy it though."

","Spider-Man 3/2007/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Spider-Man/Peter Parker: Tobey Maguire Mary Jane Watson: Kirsten Dunst New Goblin/Harry Osborn: James Franco Sandman/Flint Marko: Thomas Haden Church Venom/Eddie Brock: Topher Grace<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, a breathtaking action thriller. Although not as good as its predecessor, Spider-Man 2, Sam Raimi still gives us another entertaining blockbuster everyone will be talking about for a while. When I walked into the AMC 24 Theater at Veterans in Tampa, Florida, I saw, to my surprise that the theater was not as crowded as I thought it would be. Sure enough, however, when I walked out of the theater after seeing the exhausting film, the entire hallway was packed. The next showing was at 10:00 P.M. The ropes were up and people were waiting in line. I was glad I saw it earlier. Oh, where do I begin? The movie has about a thousand sub-plots (at least), and I actually thought the extra sub-plots made the movie more fun and showed creativity on the screenwriters' part: Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi (his older brother) and Oscar-winner Alvin Sargent. Sam Raimi, who's also the director, gives us a visually impressive film. Some parts would leave you hanging but would resolve some time later. Plus, there were moments that would not be further elaborated. But that's the reason why they are making yet another ""Spider-Man"". Spider-Man 4 is due to come out circa 2009. Well, Spidey is in for yet another movie filled with misadventure. He gets beat up constantly thrown into walls, getting slammed in the head, falling from high levels Literally, I'm surprised he's still alive. But hey, comic book films are creative and far-fetched and they always will be. There is the major plot with Spidey and his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Are they going to continue their relationship together? Then there's the major plot with Harry Osborn/New Goblin (James Franco) (son of Old Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe) who wants to kill Spidey for murdering his father. But is revenge the best thing? Then there are the sub-plots with Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who is an alleged killer and escaped criminal, who perhaps has killed someone close to Peter. And then there's Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace), an arrogant photographer competitor to Peter. Brock has a girlfriend named Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who shows up for brief moments in the film. Although her part is small, she actually is an imperative part in the film. She somewhat wavers the relationship between Parker and Watson. The film takes off where Spider-Man 2 landed and goes from there. The action starts almost immediately. He fights New Goblin and that's all I'm saying. Parker is still the photographer for The Daily Bugle and J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is still the top guy/big cheese/head honcho of the newspaper, funny as ever. Parker, however, will have a tough time with a competitor now. Just watch. The venom that attacks Parker and makes him a darker person appears out of nowhere and is not further detailed. But hey, that's what sequels and sequels and sequels are for- to elaborate on things its predecessors neglected to. That's the beauty of a sequel; however, sequels aren't always entertaining. Spider-Man 2 was a departure for mediocre sequels because it was excellent. It was the best ""Spider-Man"" movie ever and one of the best superhero films besides Batman Begins and Superman. I thought when Parker became darker was a great part of the film! It was dramatic and funny simultaneously. Can you imagine nerdy Tobey Maguire trying to act cool? Not gonna happen, right? Well, hate to break it to ya, but it did. He bee-bopped down a New York City street and every time he would see a chick he would wink and point and act stupid. But it was comic relief to a previous dark scene and then another dark scene pops out but then the bee-bopping continues, each one less appealing than the previous. So, what's the Sandman's problem? Actually, the way he turned into Sandman was quite well done but that's not the point. According to him, it was family matters. Perhaps that will also be further elaborated in the fourth installment. It might go more in depth into his family history. You never know. But what about Brock? Brock's nickname is Venom! He had to be exposed to the venom somehow right? How he turned into Venom was also quite well done. But, again, that's not the point! He turns into a monstrous creature that looks oddly like Spider-Man and the entire town is shocked and dismayed that someone like Spidey would do this! But it wasn't Spidey! Or perhaps Spidey contributed. Actually he did! Why not see the movie to find out how yourself? Great idea! So, overall, a sticky mess but yet still had some breathtaking action sequences, good acting, directing, clever writing here and there Spider-Man 3 is a good, dark, messy family film and that you can take to the web. Movie directed by Sam Raimi."

","OK, by now you have read several reviews. My opinion is that it is not better or worse then the other Spider-man movies, its just different. The fact is that there is way too much here to fit into a 2 hour movie. At the end you question both Flint Marco's motivation and Venom's outcome. It would of been nice to see more to the teaming up of Venom and Sandman, but the result in the movie is a quick scene of basically ""c'mon lets go get spider-man"". By the end of the movie you are left thinking I just saw a whole lot in this movie for it to end so quick. I think the middle of the movie that showcases bad Peter is longer than the finale.<br/><br/>In remembering that this movie is for KIDS and adults, it will be loved by the kids. Long time comic book fans will be angered. I enjoyed the film up to the end when it just was over too fast.<br/><br/>There's a scene with Curt Connors and in the background is a skeleton of a reptile, nice hint of whats to come. Next films should focus on Peter in college, bring in the Lizard, introduce Miles Warren/Jackel and get back to what you know Raimi.....old school Spider-man."

The only reason I didn't give it a really low score is because the special effects were excellent - not just good - excellent.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn/Gob Jr. developed better than any other character and I liked his performance. I liked getting a glimpse into some of the other characters lives, but it fell too short, and it was not incorporated well. I am hoping that Kirsten Dunst was acting when she was singing badly, or that she's at least aware she ain't a singer (or a dancer for that matter). She looked bored. Toby McGuire looked pasty and I don't know how many face shots he was promised, but the cheap cotton sock look to his the mask when torn was pretty lame.<br/><br/>I was just underwhelmed by the editing - it was disjointed. I think the problem is that we didn't need the sandman. There had to be another way to do this.

He jumps over a fence and suddenly he finds himself beside a particle accelerator that makes his body transform into sand. And then... nothing more about that. He sees his little girl that is sick for 5 minutes.

","I love the Spiderman movies. I like Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco; but come on now Sam! The storyline of this film was forced and semi-lucid at times then completely annoying at others. Topher Grace is a good actor, but even this role was stretch for him. The emotion and sympathy I felt for the characters in Spiderman 1 and 2 was gone in this one. I couldn't relate to any of them. One could blame the editor, the director, the producer, the actors, or the audience; but the real determination of the movie doesn't lie with the critics it will lay with the audience in the end. All I say is that I would rather have seen Spiderman 4 and separated some of the interweaving plots in this one so I could feel more for the characters. They try to develop some sympathy for the Sandman, but it never quite gets there because now you see him, he talks, you begin to feel, then he's gone. Just like the story, it's gone too. I don't think there's really any spoilers in this, but I wanted to warn people that may want to see the movie without the danger of being predisposed by someone else's view. That's why I put the SPOILER alert on this post."

","Spider-Man is the highest grossing comic-book-to-movie franchise in history, so we all knew it was inevitable that we were going to see sequel after sequel. After I saw the third installment, a friend of mine told me that a Spider-Man 4, 5, and 6 were being planned. And then I realized...this series is only getting dragged out for money. The story took a backseat.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is a fairly good movie, don't get me wrong, but there is nothing new or ridiculously exciting here. I feel like I've seen all of the dude's moves and I've seen the action sequences before. The cinematography is good but not any different than the other movies and none of the scenes really jumped out. It just didn't cut it for me.<br/><br/>Anyways, Peter Parker is back as Spider-Man, and we see that his life is back on track. He's in school, he saves people, and he's dating that ""what's her name"" chick. Life is good. But a movie would suck if nothing happens, so sh*t happens here. Now we have three bad guys going after him: Harry Osbourne as the Goblin dude, the Sandman, and Venom. You would think that all these villains makes the movie more interesting, but all it does is make it into a bigger mess. Too many plots are going on and the movie is just too long. It's funny because during the movie (about 2 hours in), I'm thinking ""God, wrap it up already!"" When I went to Grindhouse and it finished (after about 3 hrs. 40 minutes), I'm thinking ""God, why wasn't it longer?"" Spider-Man 3 just didn't hold my full interest.<br/><br/>Plot aside, the action sequences are very good. Some of them look like graphics from a video game, and some look fantastic. They are exciting but like I said before, nothing really different when being compared to the other Spider-Man movies. One thing that I really hated about this movie was the cheesy dialogue. I mean, some scenes were very bad. You had to go to ""The School of Screenwriters and Cheese"" to write some of these lines. But that's the thing with most superhero movies, so just enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I really think Spider-Man 2 was a better movie. It was more organized and more interesting. Nevertheless, this movie will not disappoint fans of the series and it definitely won't disappoint at the box office.

","It's difficult to sustain a franchise for the third time. Seriously, can you name an example where the third movie improves on the first two? A lot of this is to do with the difficulty of trying to move something on yet retain the familiarity that cinema goers expect. Spiderman 3 doesn't really try to move on or even generate a new story arc. The movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Of course the special effects are nothing short of astounding. Most of the best bits we've seen in the constant trailers but the story and twisting of themes as Spidey moves over to the dark side are a seriously missed opportunity. One expects that an oddball like Parker would be come seriously deranged and anyone who has seen a real spider edge across it's web to a fly know's that the opportunity for ruthlessness could have been much more entertaining.<br/><br/>What we are left with is a reworked storyline touching on all too familiar themes with a bloated budget. Though this makes absolute economic sense, it falls far short of entertainment expectations. Kirsten Dunst suggested they should make Spiderman 4 as a low budget horror going back to Director Raimi's roots, now that would be moving the ideas on."
"a_ngox","7","0","0","6 May 2007"," Too much drama, but still love it..
","Well, I watched the movie earlier today - quite late for a fan I would say. It is indeed I saw many critical reviews pondering and saying that Spidey 1 and 2 were much better. Well, to be completely honest, they are true but not completely.<br/><br/>Here is the problem with Spidey 3. First, there is too much drama in the movie. This was probably intended to push the audience to empathize with Peter or Spidey. Unfortunately this simply does not work. I even glanced my watch during the movie to see how long the scene would take. Second reason is probably felt by the Spidey fans. Venom was illustrated too small. Eddie Brock should be much bigger, not a boy-band kind of kid. Thirdly, the ending was a bit shallow. Let's just say, it could have been better.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie still serves partly of its main purpose - to relieve all the Spidey fans thirsts after 3 years. The battle scenes were great as the effects were smoother made than the previous two releases. The fact it has different antagonists gave more variety in the battle scenes. Further, the jokes were still great and quite fresh.<br/><br/>Simply put, this may not be the best Spiderman movie, but I still love it."

","I went to go see this movie yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie had great action sequences, and Tobey Maguire gives a phenomenal performance. I half expected this movie to be a flop, just because the second one and the first one were both so good, but it wasn't like that at all. It had a good storyline, and though they could have made it a little shorter, I definitely think its worth seeing.<br/><br/>I also thought that it might be hard to really get into the plot, seeing there were three villains in the movie, but they all intertwine very well and come down to an amazingly exciting battle in the end, not bad for the last in the trilogy, if I were you, I'd goo see it."

","I really liked the first spiderman movie and thought that the second was even better. I went to spiderman 3 hoping it would be the best, and was a little disappointed. It is a good movie, and of all Spiderman movies it definitely has the best action. But as far as the story goes, I think Sam Raimi tried to do way too many things at one time. There's's the story of Harry and Pete's rivalry, Pete and Mary Jane's relationship troubles, the origin and motives of the Sandman, the story of the symbiote and spiderman, and then finally the story of Eddie Brock and Venom. It seems like it would have worked so much better as two separate movies, the sybiote and venom story alone is enough for a two hour movie. And since it kept jumping back and forth between characters and settings, it was hard to get into something because you were quickly knocked out of it shortly after. The acting and comedy is just as good as it's ever been, it's just the pacing that hurt the performances. Like I said, it's good, but really should have been split into two movies."

","The 1st film laid the seeds of good characterisation and story, solid action (if wanting in a few CGI FX scenes of realising Spiderman). This in turn gave us the personal issues of growing up we have come to expect from Parker's teenage angst. The 2nd movie was quite nearly perfect, the only real weakness (& now prevalent in all 3 movies) is when Raimi insists on sentimental flag-waving ""Spirit of America"" imagery. This third film is messy- sure, its packed with some amazing fights, but story-wise its the weakest of the 3 films. This is due mainly due to the plate-spinning script problems of introducing too many issues and characters. The FX sometimes fall short as well; The Sandman's ""birth"" is great- but his construction site finale ""monster"" is more reminiscent of the Marshmallow man of Ghostbusters! Sandman is convincingly (and sympathetically)played by Haden Church- a small miracle given the poorly structured arc of his journey. His character does things to service the inclusion of a big fight, or functionally join the plot holes, rather than aid the story itself. The characters are immersed in a soap opera script- they do things that have you wanting to shout ""Why don't they just tell one another whats on their minds?!""- Then, of course there would be no misunderstandings to unravel! But It would save screen time & allow a more structured story to unfold as we have come to expect from this franchise.<br/><br/>And Sam Raimi?! How could you have taken your eye off the ball so much?! Could you please do a ""Director's Cut"" and lose ""Mr & Mrs Exposition""- that bloody butler and the annoying British Reporter- both used to fill in the yawning cavern of a plot hole (or Black Hole) that had been developing since the 45 minute mark.<br/><br/>Shame to see Cromwell and Dallas Howard shoe-horned into the film and so underused.<br/><br/>I still had fun watching it,if my criticism seems a little harsh- its because Spiderman movies have really shown what a Superhero movie can be. Unfortunately, this Three-quel, as with the X-Men, has fallen from the towering heights of the near perfect 2nd movie and slipped into an erratic, overly packed story. Sometimes less is more."
"tlk93","5","0","0","5 May 2007"," ""Mary Jane Watson & Peter Parker"" (wasn't Spider-Man in the title though?)
","Spider-Man 3 is worth just about every cent, but those of us who are looking for a plot, or even multiple special-effects filled action scenes may leave the theater unsure. <br/><br/>When you think of Spider-Man 1 & 2, you think of the crazy scientists who somewhere went wrong with their work, whether a lab accident, or a race to keep their funding. Both Norman Osborn and Doc Ock had an agenda, that somehow related to their mutation, and an even deeper and (stressing) continuous plot followed.<br/><br/>But not in Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>No. Flint Marko escapes from prison and becomes Sandman. Harry Osborn tries to avenge his late father. The symbiote takes over Spider-Man. And a jobless Eddie Brock wants to kill Peter.<br/><br/>Yet then there is Mary Jane. She is disappointed with Peter. He not only says but does STUPID things. Peter misunderstands her. Mary Jane keeps things from Peter. Peter doesn't want Mary Jane's help. Their relationship is failing. Mary Jane is lonely. Peter acts extremely weird (and embarrassing I'm sure for Tobey to act and watch).<br/><br/>Spider-Man and the villains get their very own paragraph. But Mary Jane and Peter's is longer. <br/><br/>This movie needed to be more about Spider-Man (hence the title). Much of the Mary Jane/Peter plot was unnecessary, and though it gave Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst tons of screen time, where was Spider-Man?<br/><br/>Though in a sense in has a less than half decent way of connecting events from previous movies, there is a certain something that sets it apart from Spider-Man 1 & 2. Perhaps it is because for the first time Ivan and Sam Raimi came up with the story, something that the previous Spidey writers needed to be apart of. I personally also found listening to Christopher Young's music to be a less than exciting experience as apposed to listening to a Danny Elfman score.<br/><br/>Aside from a script that needed second thoughts, brief acting issues *sigh*, an annoying emo-looking Tobey Maguire (that's easy to laugh at), and a more than different score, SPIDER-MAN 3 has amazing special effects, designs, cinematography, and villains. Because although you can argue the plot was iffy, you'd have to be pretty crazy to argue that Venom was too."

","I must say(this is my first comment ever) that Spider-man 3 is the best Spider-man movie. Tobey Maguire (is he spelled that way?) is really good but the best performance is Kirsten Dunsts trofé. A great movie should contain three things: romance, action and a good story. Spider-man 3 is containing them all. Then I must say that the effects in this movie is... yeah they are so good.

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","8","3","8","8 February 2019"," I forgive you - decent not a bad superhero movie that everyone is saying underrated
","This was a decent third sequel in Spider-Man trilogy it was not bad like everyone was saying that it was horrible it was not. I like this movie just like I like Spider-Man 2 it has drama, sci-fi elements and action in it. The movie is like Superman III get's crap on it, for no good reason, I always liked this film. It is not better than Spider-Man 1 and 2 but it is in lighter category decent - underrated.<br/><br/>I like the bond between those three leads Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. This movie is about revenge, transformation in to bad Spidey on a dark side. It has dark tone and it has redemption by the end of the movie. Sam Raimi returned with direction of the third movie in which he helped to write a script with his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent who wrote a script for Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man at least did not kill Gwen Stacy like he did in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and than Garfield wined like some school kid over his toy. So yea I like this movie it is a decent Kirsten Dunst is still excellent as Mary Jane Watson she is jealous on Peter/Spider-Man but I like that in the movie. I like the soundtrack playing on the end of credits: Signal Fire by Snow Patrol.<br/><br/>I like the action sequences in which Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in black suit fights Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) in underground station I like the sequence in which Spider-Man glues on trains, I like that so much. I like Spider-Man in black suit hanging on a church I like that sequence. Spider-Man fights off Venom (Topher Grace) and he fights with Sandman while trying to help Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). I like Harry Osborn in which he turns in to New Goblin but helps out Peter fighting two monsters, I like that in the movie. He blamed Peter for his father's death but on the end he helped out his best friend Peter.<br/><br/>In my opinion those trio did a good job respectfully playing their characters: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco like they are actually friends. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock / Venom was perfect bad guy too me, just like right from the comic books. They filmed now Venom (2018) with Tom Hardy how will that movie work without Spider-Man? I have no idea but I will check that movie out. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy was to me better than Emma Stone. Bryce didn't look like some rich model she was a normal girl a classmate from Peter Parker and I like that in the movie. I like Bryce Dallas Howard in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) who also gets crap for it and I like her in this movie a lot.<br/><br/>About actor James Franco I grew up watching him in his movies Spider-Man trilogy and Whatever It Takes (2000) those were the movies I watched in high school. They are big part of me growing up. I heard accusation about Franco's sexual harassment allegations. Actress Ally Sheedy accused him why she left the movie business on twitter, but deleted those tweets. Than like 5 other woman come forward and continue accusing Franco about sexual harassment. The most ridicules to me is an actress I don't know her name was upset because she had to be naked in Franco's movie, but she was pay $100 at day. It is ridicules because she sign a contract and she was pay. Why making that allegations? It is stupid! I support James Franco 100% so what he made a mistakes and he shouldn't be judged. I respect and support the guy.<br/><br/>I know people complained because there were too many villains in it and because Peter was dancing. They did not like the Twist dancing in which Harry and Mary Jane dancing. I did not mind anything in the film and I like it. It is hell way better than The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 is underrated. I forgive you - means in the movie after Peter finds the real killer of his uncle Ben the guy apologized and Peter forgives him, because that's what he does Spider-Man doesn't kill people he saves them."
"sunnythestalker2","1","3","8","12 May 2007"," two and a half hours in a funeral home
","I had to go and see Spiderman 3 in the local theater, it is one of the three big blockbuster sequels that we expect this summer (Spiderman 3, Shrek the 3rd, and Pirates of the Caribbean 3), and for which everyone is talking about. <br/><br/>I was annoyed by the predictability (for example in the final fighting sequence everyone expected Harry to appear and help Spiderman), the unconvincing ""moral lessons"" (God may forgive, but the society and the law should not: if someone robs, kills and causes mass destruction, his place is in jail, not being let go, and pitied that he really wanted the money but was not able to get it with honest work), the flag (not this flag at this moment, when it represents, and is used by, an administration that started an unprovoked and unjustified war, which is going on for more than 4 years, longer than WWII, and which cost the lives of 120000 people, and counting).<br/><br/>But when I came back home, I felt puzzled, there was something else in the movie that I really did not like but could not identify, something that was really missing, but I felt it only subconsciously, I could not formulate it. Then I compared Spiderman with the Pirates and Shrek, and it hit me, it was the humor! Spiderman 3 completely, totally lacked any light and humorous moments (not that the previous two installments were any better). The Pirates was great for humorous moments, they lighten you up, lift the spirit, make you smile, laugh, and feel happy. Nobody laughed for 2.5 hours tonight, it felt like being in a funeral home!<br/><br/>Bottom line: Spiderman sucks! Since Shrek is mostly for kids, I hope the Pirates will be the movie that will be a real joy to watch this summer."
"Matt_Layden","6","3","8","4 May 2007"," Spidey Is Back In Black, Third Installment Is For Fans Of The Films, Not The Comics.
","In my review of X3, I faulted it for it's inconsistency with the comics. It would be unfair if I didn't do the same for Spiderman 3. Sam Raimi and co are back in this third installment of the mega box office franchise and have tweaked the comics a bit to create more of an emotional impact on the viewer. Unfortunately any emotional scene is ruined by the cheese factor that emits from the screen. When characters try to be heartfelt, bits of laughter came out of the theatre. Spidey is indeed back, this time in black. It will definitely please fans of the films, but comic lovers may end up disappointed when the credits begin to roll.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this film, could the rumours of Venom being in it be true? Could my geek fanboy dreams be true? Then more and more people popped up and I thought, can they pull this off? Can they fit in Harry's revenge, The Sandman, Venom, Dark Spidey and Gwen Stacey all into one film that won't run over three hours? Raimi tried his best to give each segment enough screen time to resolve itself by the final scene, but it all proves too much for him to handle.<br/><br/>Let me get my fanboy nitpicks out of the way first. Venom is, in my honest opinion, ruined in this film. Raimi was hesitant in putting this villain into the film and it shows, he seems like a last ditch effort to get more people in the seats. Something they created in post-production to get more word of mouth circling. Was the Sandman not enough? Venom came and went quicker then Jon Lovitz career. Most of the time it's Eddie Brock's face rather then the creature Venom. This isn't what the fans wanted. Secondly, we all know that Flint Marko (Sandman) did not kill Ben Parker, here he did. Reason for this change? To make him seem more important then he actually is. They took a cool character, played well by Church, in the small screen time he does have, and made him boring, non threatening, and ultimately not as cool as previous villains, like Doc Ock. Any emotional impact that Raimi was aiming for is ruined by the shoddy acting and cheesy dialogue. Then Gwen Stacey, but let me stop there. Again, fanboy nitpicks.<br/><br/>Back to the film. There is way too much going on for anything to have significant screen time. The fight sequences with the Sandman never reach the level of excitement when Spidey was fighting Dock Ock and it's quick fighting scenes interwoven with the slow dialogue spoken by almost everyone makes for some awkward pacing. Spiderman and the Dark Costume is too much to be stuff into as a sub plot. They did a decent job of handling it, but it could have been so much more. None of the villains ever really seemed threatening. If Venom had more screen time he could have been more of a threat.<br/><br/>There is next to no chemistry with Dunst and Maguire this time around. This could have been done on purpose, but it really ruined the believability that these two are lovers. If it weren't for the first two films would we ever guess they were together? Franco's role here is an awkward one. Here is not menacing at all, and his scenes with him having no memory come off comedic and inappropriate. Also Maguire turns emo on the us when he's suppose to be 'bad' Seems like a lot of bad stuff went wrong in this film, but that's not really true. All in all I enjoyed this film. It was a good addition to the series. Better then the first film and only falling a hair short of the second. With more emphasis on the villains and what the substance from the meteorite was, this film could have easily been the best comic book film ever. So what was good about it your asking? Well, everything else.<br/><br/>Watch out for those cameos, Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell both make an appearance and both received applause from the audience. Campbell who's scene here is the funniest out of all three films is the comedic highlight. I always have a smile on my face when he graces the screen. Speaking of comedy, this film has a lot of it, some intentional some not. Parker pulls off a Saturday Night Fever moment half way through the film which is, I can only guess, a reminder of the ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" moment from the second.<br/><br/>Special Effects and action sequences are top notch. My favourite action scene is still the Doc Ock train fight, but it's obvious Raimi was trying to top himself here. Everything in this film is on a bigger scope. The action sequences stand out more then the fight sequences. Seeing Spiderman save Gwen from falling, through debris and what not, was a treat. Even if Spiderman decided to save her and not stop the machine (watch film and you'll understand). The fight scenes leading up to the final climatic battle are short, but good nonetheless. Plenty of aerial fights, with both characters falling to the ground while still battling it out. A surprise stand out fight sequence I have to give to Harry VS Spiderman. It was the most ambitious of them all.<br/><br/>Is Spiderman 3 a disappointment? Yes and No. I expected a lot more out of it and only got half of it. The half I got was was very pleased with. The film had so much in it, but not enough time for any of it. Raimi's eyes were bigger then his stomach. He wanted bigger and better, all he got was bigger. I can recommend the film as it was entertaining and did it's job on delivering action, but there is that little voice in the back of my head that wanted more."

"meako1973","6","3","8","3 May 2007"," Fans will weep - Public will love it
","The film is the weakest of the series, and shows the strain of too much happening in the 2 hours and 20 minutes of running time. The stories are patched together badly, leaving a very episodic feel to the proceedings. All of the events that take place have their specific chunk of film to play in, and never feel like they are occurring together. The symbiote from the meteorite seems to do nothing for most of the film, despite being in Peter's apartment for a while. No sense that any of the events correlate is felt, and it all feels a bit messy. Some chunks of the film, such as the first fight with the Goblin, could have been taken out completely without damaging the rest of the film. The time saved could have then been put to good use to develop Sandman, or even Gwen Stacy, or Brock. Stacy herself could have been taken out the film completely and you wouldn't notice. Now, consider this for a moment. Gwen Stacy, Peter's first true love, who died in his arms in the comic, who MJ was simply a replacement for  reduced to a minor character with nothing more than a walk-on part! The lack of screen time she offers means that the jealousy that MJ shows towards her is ridiculous! Raimi stated in early interviews on the first film that there were so many villains he liked personally. However, when asked about the fan-boy favorite Venom, he stated his reluctance to use the character as he wasn't a fan and didn't really feel that he was a strong enough role. Seeing how poorly Eddie Brock is portrayed in the film, and how dubious the CGI on Venom himself actually is, you can see that Raimi wasn't all that happy with having to give the 'fans' what they wanted. Sadly the time wasted on Venom takes away from the much stronger, and deeper, Sandman. Not that Sandman is a total loss. Some of the heart of the character is intact, but it is all too fleeting toward the end of the film. As for the new Goblin, well it almost works but plays out in a poor, and unnecessary, direction toward the early half of the film.<br/><br/>Fans of the comic books will be the most disappointed here, as they will know what potential each of these tales had, and given a film each to play out in, well they could have been three amazing films! All three in one means that, sadly, it is too much and not enough at the same time.<br/><br/>The general public, who don't read the comics will get the most out of this as it is a popcorn movie throughout. The CGI is even better than before, and the action sequences are truly amazing throughout! The realization of Sandman works so well, much better than the dubious Venom rendition. Aside from a few cornier elements, particularly during Peter's dark phase (which includes a dance routine in a jazz club  and when did he learn the piano?), this is simple entertainment, and should please the masses.<br/><br/>Kind of ironic that the film in which Raimi gives the fans what they want is also the film that the fans will be most upset with. Even the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, or Bruce Campbell screen hogging does nothing to distract from the fact that this is a seriously missed opportunity. Batman & Robin it ain't, but it certainly isn't what we expect from Raimi."
"syko-paranova","6","3","8","3 May 2007"," Was I watching spider-man or peter parker?
","I felt that this was less a spider-man movie and more of a Peter Parker movie. Many people who go to see spider-man swing around and capture the bad guys will be disappointed. Of the 140 minutes the movie takes up, he's in costume maybe 50 tops. The villains seem like they aren't really thought out, and even harry's turn seemed a bit rushed and tied up just for the sake of doing so.<br/><br/>While the action sequences are great, they are still too far and few in between. Even with the wonderful planning of each one they all seem to have something a little off. Wither certain parts aren't really finished(the crane scene) or the civilians don't react at all the way they should for a giant sand monster and a vicious black monster without a name (the final battle).<br/><br/>While the actual spider-man sequences were pretty well done, the peter parker scenes (more than 70% of the movie) seemed too drawn out and boring. While trying to be funny they seemed to have tried to hard and missed their mark (it was funner to make fun OF them)m when trying to be serious, it sometimes seemed over the top (and ended up being funnier than the comic relief). In the end the movie just seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be: A good character piece or a great action movie. You are left with a sort of awkward feeling where you don't know when to laugh, when to be serious, when it's OK to call Peter stupid, or why it took the butler so long to open his mouth.<br/><br/>overall nothing is really changed from the end of 2 except there are a few less people around to cause peter trouble, and it doesn't seem like MJ and Pete have made any progress.<br/><br/>this movie suffers from over exposure, and trying to take on too much. If you don't buy into the hype you may be able to enjoy this, but if you've already taken it all in, you will be disappointed."
"Joejoesan","8","9","37","20 April 2007"," Too soapy, too long, but overall okay
","Being a big Spider-Man 1-2 and Sam Raimi fan, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I couldn't imagine that Raimi would be able to surpass the brilliant Spider-Man 2, but was at least hoping for a decent closure. And I think that Spider-Man 3 is exactly that: a decent closure. The first half of the story is heavy on the soapy side. While Peter Parker is getting all the appreciation as Spider-Man, the career of MJ is really going down. She gets fired from her Broadway play and must go back waitering in a jazz café. This causes a lot of stress in their relationship. The movie really kicks off when Sandman arrives at the scene and when Harry starts making plans to get rid of Peter Parker once and for all. Later on there's Topher Grace as well. Him becoming Venom is a great thing. I just wished there was more screen time for Venom. The Harry - Peter Parker relationship (with MJ in the middle) was what really worked in the film. Showing Peter Parker's dark side was well done, but couldn't they stop him from dancing? You know what I mean when you see the film. Of course, the movie is action packed. But frankly, we've seen fight scenes like these before (in part 1 and 2). They don't surprise us anymore. The final fight between the good guy(s) and bad guys is really cool. You really get that superhero-comic book sense of a greatness. Spider-Man 3 is no masterpiece. It's a very well made movie that only disappoints when you compare it to the previous movies.

","I saw Spiderman3 the day before yesterday, and was really excited about seeing it. And yet again my anticipation was quickly deflated. It seems like every Spiderman movie catches me out like that. Anyway, the film is good. I know I started on a negative note, but it really is a solid film. The Sandman looks very good, and venom steals the show. It's a bit too long(as usual). There's a fantastic cameo from Bruce Campbell, which really nailed the Spiderman sense of humour, and it was good to see him again. The things that disappoint me are unfortunately rather important for a movie in that they are the two leading actors, Tobey Maguire fit the original part perfectly, but he has not matured, he remains the gormless, lost teenage geek. Kirsten Dunst turns out a very run of the mill performance, and has two rather unnecessary songs.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't massively downhearted as it really only is Saturday afternoon entertainment, and Spiderman has never been the kind of film you would look forward to watching again. Effects are good, villains are good. Spidey 3 is good, not great, but good."

","Not only will you be wasting your money on this film, You will be wasting 2.5 hours of your life. I had such high hopes for this film and it let me down. The worst thing was i kept myself in the cinema just to see the ending...It was torturous. I disagree with anyone who has given this film anything above a 2 star rating. It was so bad, the cinema actually cheered when it ended. <br/><br/>I have to say this film goes amongst my worst films ever....and i usually try to see the best side in things.<br/><br/>If you're thinking of going to see a movie, don't see spider-man 3 - it will be the worst decision you've ever made"
"UMWolvie2442","Null","10","44","3 May 2007"," Incredible Experience & a GREAT film!
","What I said about Spider-Man 2 holds true for this movie. In fact, it took everything good about the second and added more action and excitement.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is not just a good comic book movie. It's a great movie period. Rarely have I gone through such a range of emotions during a film (not since SM2 anyway). Absolutely an incredible experience that everybody should be a part of and everybody should rush to see.<br/><br/>The complexity, depth, heart and action were off the charts. I honestly can't remember when I saw a better movie. I totally agree with the film critic who said it's the best of the three movies due to the added complexities in its storytelling and the evolution and growth of the characters as a whole since the first movie. I was stunned that SM3 is actually an improvement on what was essentially a classic. I know many movies claim to have something for everyone but this one manages to pull it off while remaining interesting and compelling all the way through. There are spectacular action scenes as well as heartfelt family moments. There is romance and there is humor. I can't imagine anyone at any age not enjoying some aspect of this film.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi, the cast, the crew and writers should all be proud of this masterpiece and take a bow. The only remotely negative thing I have to say about this movie is how can they possibly top it now? Then again, I said that after Spider-Man 2 so who knows? Bring on Spider-Man 4!"
"AlexanderMorris","1","16","80","25 April 2007"," As Bad As 1 and 2
","I just viewed this movie at a pre screening and i am compelled to say Spiderman 3 is an utter disgrace to cinema in general.The overuse of CGI in this film is unbearable and brutal.The cartoony special effects that consumed Spiderman 1 and 2 are even worse in this movie.The villains are way too corny and over the top Sandman is a moronic sand creature who we are supposed to feel sorry for while venom is an unbelievable alien force which is the most ridiculous thing ever written on paper.Spiderman 3 is already unrealistic but they had to add an even more unintelligent plot about an alien suit...wasn't that already covered i The Tuxedo? Kirsten Dunst is the only good actress in this film everybody else is corny and overdone so we feel emotions for them.The fight scenes are so horrible i wanted to use my popcorn bucket as a barf bag and the apparent love story is like an episode of Young and The Restless.Spiderman 3 is so bad you wish it were only an hour and a half long but no Sam Raimi chooses to torture us with a 3 hour long movie in other words three hours of wanting to gouge out your eyes.Spiderman 3 is just like that other glorified music video 300 without the special effects both movies would suck as their bad story lines, horrible acting, and childish action sequences would be exposed.So far this years films have all been brutal TMNT sucked, Grindhouse was pretty bad, 300 was despicable, and now Spiderman 3 another money sucking video game cut scene extended for 3 hours.Now i get to look forward to the third Pirates Of The Carribbean and Transformers two movies that look just as bad as this film.Hollywood needs to stop this horrible comic book craze as everyone of them has been too terrible for words. Spiderman 3 is without a doubt the worst of this stupid and unnessescary trilogy and i truly hope they don't pull a Star Wars and make more."

"BA_Harrison","3","2","5","5 July 2014"," And it was all going so well
","He did such a good job with Spiderman 1 and 2 that it's kinda hard to understand how director Sam Raimi could screw up so badly with part 3.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for the problems to start, with a meteor falling within spitting distance of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as they lay staring at the stars on a giant web hammock. Forget the astronomical chances of just being in the same vicinity as a falling meteor; what are the chances of a superhero with heightened senses being in the same vicinity as a falling meteor containing a malevolent symbiotic alien and remaining completely oblivious, even as the creature latches onto the back of his moped? Unbelievable, huh?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it only gets worse from here-on in<br/><br/>Just like 'the man of steel' in part 3 of the '70s/'80s Superman movie series, this chapter in the Spiderman franchise sees Peter Parker turning bad (after the symbiote attaches itself to his costume), only here the transformation from superhero to super-jerk isn't handled anywhere near as successfully, Maguire unable to pull off 'menacing' anywhere near as convincingly as he does 'dorky'. Putting a bit of dark makeup under the eyes and allowing the actor's hair to flop down at the front simply doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mary Jane and Harry Osborn (James Franco) are getting close once again, having a quick snog after an impromptu twist dancing session in the kitchen. If this scene doesn't strike you as awkward, then howsabout the god-awful sequence that has Peter strutting down the street, doing the 'wink and gun' gesture to all the pretty ladies? Embarrassing doesn't even begin to describe it. This is followed soon-after by Peter visiting the bar where MJ works and shaking his booty with Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), girlfriend of his Daily Bugle rival Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). Jeez, Sam, couldn't you see how bad this scene would be when you wrote it?<br/><br/>The cringes continue as Brock becomes the next victim of the symbiote, turning into Venom and teaming up with Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) to try and take down Spiderman once and for all. The pair of super-villains kidnap Mary Jane and suspend her in a giant web between skyscrapers to lure the webslinger into a trap. If, like me, you thought that earlier fight scenes stretched plausibility to breaking point, what happens next will have you choking in disbelief. The level of violence that Peter Parker can endure without severe injury is most impressive, the guy withstanding physical punishment that would even have the Incredible Hulk throwing in the towel.<br/><br/>Just as things actually start to look bad for Spidey, his good-friend-turned-archenemy Harry turns up to help in the battle, having finally been told by his butler that Peter Parker wasn't responsible for his father's death. Hooray for the butler! The little kids watching the fight shout 'Awesome!' and 'Wicked Cool', Kirtsen Dunst does her best (but fails) to look scared, Spiderman defeats Venom through the use of sound-waves and one of Harry's explosive devices which conveniently limits its blast radius to a few feet, and Sandman says he's sorry and floats away on the wind. All of which is as bad, or if not worse, than it sounds.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least after this debacle, Raimi wisely returned to the safety of the horror genre, giving us the entertaining Drag Me To Hell as his next movie. Let's be thankful for small mercies."
"MarvelFan123","1","2","5","3 January 2013"," What the hell did they do to Spider-Man?! (My childhood icon)
","When I saw the first Spider-Man movie, it was OK and the content works in that movie even if it didn't actually follow the original story line in the comics and when I saw Spider-Man 2, it was better than the first movie and actually managed to show a great example of a superhero movie. But when I saw Spider-Man 3 in the theaters...my childhood was destroyed...<br/><br/>The plot of this film is Peter Parker asks Mary Jane to marry him. While out watching the stars in Central Park, a meteor crashes near the two without them noticing and an alien symbiote starts following Peter. Elsewhere, the police chase after Flint Marko who runs into a sand mutation experiment and the sand fuses with him becoming The Sandman. Harry Osborn knowing that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, attacks him with his new Goblin technology. While that is going on, Captain George Stacy tells Peter and Aunt May that Flint Marko is Uncle Ben's real killer. Knowing that he's still out there in the city, Spider-Man swears revenge on him. While trying to find the whereabouts of Sandman, he falls asleep and the symbiote bonds with him making his Spidey Suit black and finds Sandman and confronts him. With the symbiote changing Peter's personality, Mary Jane goes to Harry and...I won't even bother telling you what happens between them because it's just stupid. Harry Osborn recovers from his amnesia and compels Mary Jane to break up with Peter.<br/><br/>First, I'll start with the flaws like I usually do. There were some pointless characters in this movie. In the comic books, they played a bigger role, but in this movie...they had no purpose whatsoever. Dr. Curt Connors (the man who becomes The Lizard in the comics) helps Peter in the movie so I guess that's OK, but what about Gwen Stacy? She actually had a bigger role in the comic, in fact she was Peter's first girlfriend, but she's just a throwaway character in this movie.<br/><br/>Second, Flint Marko, the Sandman is Uncle Ben's real killer? Really?! So you're telling me that the guy Spider-Man went after in the first film was not the main killer?! That makes no sense whatsoever! I know he needed the money to cure his sick daughter but the thing is...that wasn't even written from the comics at all! Flint Marko was just the bad guy in the comics! Not to mention, when he tells Peter the truth about his Uncle, Peter just lets him go! I know it was out of forgiveness but would've turned him into the police anyway!<br/><br/>Now when I heard that Venom was going to be in this movie, I was really hyped and excited to see this character in action! But I was really sad on how much screen time he had in this movie. (excluding the parts where he had his face peeled back) They shouldn't put Venom in this movie if he only gets like 10 minute screen time! In the comics, the suit tortured him and that alone could fill an entire movie! But he's mixed in with some other subplots that he's only given 10 minutes of screen time! They could've just save him for Spider-Man 4! (which was canceled) I wish I could've seen a lot more of him. And the Symbiote that Peter is attached to is only suppose to alter his personality, it feeds on negative emotion! Not make him into a geeky...idiot. <br/><br/>Now for Emo Peter...he's one of the most hated aspects in this movie. Emo Peter goes more for comedy when he's dancing in public and it's just...geeky. If they went for a more serious route, this movie would have been more effective. <br/><br/>Finally...the dance scene. Oh my god, this is the dumbest moment ever in this movie! It changes everything and it sucks out any amount of seriousness you were going for. <br/><br/>Now for the pros, I like the special effects (obviously), I liked the scene where Peter rips his black suit off and then falls on Eddie Brock who becomes Venom and I especially liked the design of Venom, it looked really realistic. That's it! These were only 3 things that I liked about this movie!<br/><br/>This film changed a lot of elements in the original comic book series by making Flint Marko/Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben, interesting Gwen Stacy when she was obviously murdered by the Green Goblin in the Amazing Spider-Man series, ruining the character of Peter Parker and giving Venom only 10 minutes of screen time! <br/><br/>Also, we never saw the planet from the Secret Wars storyline, where the alien symbiote, Venom, came from and we never get to see the dream sequence from The Amazing Spider-Man issue number 258 were Peter Parker is running for his life were the black suit and the original Spider-Man suit are battling each other. When they see Peter trying to get away, they grab him and they're trying to tear him apart. Yes I know that this idea would be a bit cliché to put in Spider-Man 3 but at least it would make the film tens times better considering that this is a ""comic book"" film!<br/><br/>So overall...This film destroyed my childhood, didn't managed to stay faithful to the original comic book series and it's one of the worst Marvel and superhero movies I've ever seen! Seriously, I wanted to like this movie but there were just so many flaws in this film that it's hard to give this film a decent score! Do not buy this film, it's seriously a huge slap in the face to Spider-Man and comic book fans such as myself!<br/><br/>My final verdict for this film is: 1/10!"
"Jerique","2","2","5","7 April 2010"," Awful adaptation, worse sequel!
","A truckload of insults will be thrust in this review toward Spider-Man 3. As an avid fan of the television show years ago, in the 90's, and as a big fan of the comic books, I can safely say this film failed on truly showing and grasping many aspects of Peter's rise and fall with relation to Venom.<br/><br/>Topher Grace wasn't terrible as Eddie Brock/Venom, but he wasn't the right build. As far as the comic books, video games and TV shows go, Spider-man is agile and quick whereas Venom is violent and powerful. Eddie Brock in Spider-Man 3 is near the same size as Peter Parker. I'm not convinced he can overpower Spider-Man in his Venom form.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 interweaves too much for the viewer to concentrate on. There's a love triangle between Mary Jane, Peter and Harry. There's another one between Peter, Eddie and Gwen. There's another one between Peter, Gwen and Mary Jane. Throw in The Sandman's story and then make Eddie Brock turn into Venom, unconvincingly, and now let's make Harry turn into the Green Goblin. It's too much story and only about 10 minutes of action.<br/><br/>You can't make this movie into a tag-team match and hope everyone will love it. Venom being killed off so quickly and with such ease was a big reason for this movie being such a terrible piece of film. Venom is a principle character in the Spider-Man chronicles and Venom is the most popular villain for Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Venom never spoke in the first person, singular. He spoke in first person, plural. Venom always spoke as himself saying, ""we know about you, Spider-Man."" In the film, he spoke in the singular first person, and he spoke without the symbiote on his face. I don't mind watching Topher's acting abilities of being ""the bad guy"" but Venome always spoke with his true face.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst has lost so much face with audiences and in this one, she feels more like a secondary character. As well, she should since we have four super heroes/villains taking up the majority of screen-time.<br/><br/>It's really a shame that Sam Raimi couldn't repeat his amazing level of adaptation he did in the first two films for this one. It would have been wonderful to see him really put on a great show.<br/><br/>Fans of the comic books and TV show (and even the video games) will not like this instalment of Spider-Man and I don't know the ones who haven't read the comic books or watched the show could enjoy this one.<br/><br/>Peter spends too much time being a total ass, Mary Jane spends too much time pining over Harry while still ""loving"" Peter, and the rest of the cast suck up the screen time pointlessly.<br/><br/>I suggest you grab Spider-Man 1 or 2 and re-watch them because you're just wasting your time on Spider-Man 3. Skip it."

Why is Peter sticking around, concerned that Harry might be dead? (Peter is lucky to be alive and should be running the other way.)<br/><br/>23:23: Interior Scientific Laboratory in New York's Marshlands.

"CrassActionHero","1","2","5","30 October 2007"," Spiderman 3: My Take
","Spider-Man 3 (2007) <br/><br/>Review: I enjoy Spider Man movies. The first was a nice start and a fitting welcome. The second was one of the best superhero movies this side of Batman Begins. Now we reached the climax(Maybe), and is this good? Here's my take: <br/><br/>Spider Man 3 has a problem, it cannot decide what kind of movie it wants to be. We have Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), living in a REALLY rundown apartment and his squeeze Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), who wants to sing Broadway. That's sounds fine and all. What we encounter is too much smooch-smooch talk that is highly evident in your average chick flick.<br/><br/>What's worse is that we are given Flint Marko(Thomas Hayden Church), a escaped con who winds up in some sort of experiment that turn him into the Sandman. Sandman has many inconsistencies. He has escaped police custody and is doing this risky stuff all for his daughter. The Sandman is a total second rate ""villain"". More on this later.<br/><br/>Then we got Harry Osbourne(James Franco), who has not forgotten about his father's death. He attacks Peter to give us one neat action sequence that Harry winds up hitting his head hard and suffers short term memory loss. He then becomes a unwitting rival of Parker for guess who.<br/><br/>Then there's Eddie Brock(Topher Grace), who is a rather desperate reporter that will do anything to get work. More on this one shortly.<br/><br/>As you can tell, there is WAY too much going on here and to top it off, we have some relationship troubles with our hero to add to the already crammed mix. But it's not over, a strange substance from outer space falls down and latches on to Peter's bike and follows him home. This substance make the host body act differently in many ways, especially aggression. Right. So The transformation starts off right with an impassioned Spidey taking on Sandman.<br/><br/>Then the worst happens, Spidey-Peter goes EMO on us. He does the stupid thing with his hair and dresses in black clothing. His attitude is laughable and painful to watch. It does a good job on making the Emo look bad as it should, but I cannot watch this without wincing in pain. This is not the way to undergo a transformation to the dark side. More like the douche bag side.<br/><br/>This movie has it's good. The action here delivers enough. The FX are nice if not a little cartoon like, but overall is nice. Bryce Dallas Howard is here and is just stunning. Too bad she is trapped in a helpless role as Mary Jane's rival. And the best scene of the movie belongs to Mr. Bruce Campbell. He is always funny and here he is a treat. The boss of the Daily Bugle is also hilarious.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. The Sandman apparently killed Peter's uncle. This is so bad. Then what was he locked up for in the first place than that? Also, Eddie Brock inside a church says to the Jesus symbol, ""I Want You To Kill Peter Parker."" Gahh. The character Venom is, here anyway came off as a second rate villain. He is suddenly Venom and knows all about his powers in record time. He finds Marko in even faster time and allies with him just like that unaware of the fact that he is merged with some type of monster talking to a guy who can transform sand. They just met and suddenly...""Okay."" Just like that they ally.<br/><br/>The Sandman despite killing Spidey's uncle and almost killing Spidey himself is forgiven. Whaaa? I would have him locked up. Despite his intentions, he killed someone and tried to kill you. I would hold a grudge to be honest with you. Not to mention could have killed a armored car driver and many other innocent people in the process.<br/><br/>Did I mention the Emo? Ick.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Spidey 3 has too much story, too much sappy relationship issues, too little substance and not enough action.<br/><br/>The Last Word: A terrible mess. There are not enough janitors in the world to clean this up. From the chick flick stuff to the bad Emo stuff, Spidey's main problem is that it could not decide what type of movie it should be, A chick flick, a teenage Emo flick, or a Spider Man flick. Pass this one up. Even hardcore fans might hate this."

Check out the reporter near the end of the movie, deffo never had an acting lesson in her life and the guy on the surf board can only contribute very cheesy acting. An altogether suicidal movie.

If I wanted to watch a soap opera, I would watch As the World turns.<br/><br/>One excellent example is the restaurant scene where Peter is to propose to Mary but the proposal falls apart after a ""chance"" meeting.

Spider-Man 3 reeks of poor storytelling, acting, and directing, and it has big name talent in each of these three departments. Sam Raimi is one of the most innovative directors in the business but Spidey 3 lacks his creative touch. It seems more like Columbia Tristar's film than Sam Raimi's film. Raimi had stated that he has all ways hated the beloved Spider-Man character Venom in countless interviews due to his ""lack of humanity"". Columbia's paycheck must have been awfully convincing because Raimi stated that he reread the comics and developed a new love for Spider-Man's evil black suited counterpart.. Raimi creates a disgusting misinterpretation of the character by making the horrible mistake(Can I call it mistake? It just seems too mild.Sin against nature may be a more appropriate thing to call it) of casting That 70's Show regular Topher Grace as Spider-Man's arch nemesis. Did I watch the same That 70's Show episodes that he did? Because I haven't seen a Topher Grace performance which would make think he was even ready to play Venom's understudy. He was no where near ready to handle a major dramatic role like this and it more than shows in the final product. His Venom is less evil and threatening than his That 70's Show character Eric Foreman. As much as I hate to say it Arnold Schwarzenegger's infamous portrayal of Mr.Freeze in Batman & Robin is Oscar worthy in comparison. The pinnacle of this mistake is shown when we see Topher enact a classic scene from the comics in which Venom's article ego Eddie Brock lie in a church contemplating his shattered life, Grace's portrayal makes this well written scene from the comics laughable. Grace is not the only one to point the finger at though, the usually outstanding Tobey Maguire seems off key here. There are moments in the movie where he just seems out of place, I know he could have done much better than this based on his outstanding resume but then again maybe he just couldn't take this horrible script seriously. Thomas Haden Church is good as Flint Marko a.k.a Sandman but his character is so poorly written and has no character development. I get the feeling Church didn't feel quite right delivering cliché lines like ""I'm a good man I've just done some bad things"". James Franco is an extremely talented actor and you can tell he is frustrated with the Harry Osborne role in his performance, you get the feeling he is more than happy to be able to move on.You know it's sad that the best performance in the movie is a five minute cameo by Raimi's friend character actor Bruce Campbell as a stereotypical French waiter. Spider-Man 3's script is probably the worst of it's many flaws. There are too many loose ends in it, and the story is sloppily pulled together. This is shown with the way the movie handles it's handful of villains, instead of having Spider-Man battle them all at once, they become incapacitated for brief periods of time, (The cliché of amnesia is used for Harry Osborne a.k.a The Green Goblin). The weakest part of the script is how Spider-Man deals with his inner demons which are being pulled out by the symbiotic suit. In the comics Peter suffered a near mental breakdown in 3 he does a disco strut down New York's streets which would make John Travolta call his lawyer to sue for copy right infringement. Scenes like these made me wonder if Raimi actually read his source material before he began filming this movie. I wanted to like 3 I really did. I love the Spider-Man character, and Sam Raimi's movies but in the end I just couldn't even pretend to like the movie. 3 has no redeemable qualities other than knowing Spider-Man 4 can't be that disappointing(Or that Topher Grace won't be back).<br/><br/>* out of ****"

","Dear god. I just got in from the movie at Silver City in Ancaster. I'm still hoping that I will wake up in my bed having a nightmare because the realization that I just spent $10 for garbage like that could only be the result of a bad dream. Sadly I fear it is truth. This movie is one big mistake from beginning to end. I don't think I could possibly say as much bad things that are needed to be said about this movie in one review but I will try. First and foremost, they tried to do WAY too much with this film. It comes off as very hurried and sloppy, and you don't have enough time to bond or relate to the characters before they are killed or Parker is crying about something else. I began worrying halfway through the film if I was going to be struck in the back from the vomit coming from the rows behind me. Poor Kirsten Dunst. This girl has SO much talent and so much potential and it all just gets wasted away in this film in a perfect example of bad directing, bad script writing and a tiresome story. The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the fact that my ride wanted to watch the whole movie. Otherwise I think I would have walked to the bathroom, jammed my head in the toilet and flushed it. It's that simple. This is just a terrible movie. Compounded by the fact that this new flirtation with hand held shots vs mounted cameras is just one headache. Through critical scenes, you would be able to follow the action if you were suffering a mild seizure. Just all around, a bad movie. Terrible script, awful acting from Tobey (not that I'm surprised as I was mortified by the second film), too many characters left undeveloped and the audience members left feeling violated. Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT pay to see this film. Get a free pass from a cereal box and smack the first person in the face that suggests you pay."
"David_Frames","5","2","5","14 May 2007"," Hype creep
","You may have missed it but something extraordinary happened recently. Perhaps you were busy romancing your best friend's girlfriend, drowning the kittens of your partner's grotesque children in the canal or like me, trying to remove an entire layer of fatty tissue from your bath tub after the acid had drained out but over in America, punters paid $148M to see Spider-man 3. That's nearly 5 pounds sterling.<br/><br/>What made them do it? Well it wasn't coherence, good writing or sharp plotting but we can assume millions of dollars worth of marketing played their part. A popular character, two reasonably entertaining and well judged films and the kind of brand recognition that would make Coke envious, all fed into the pre-summer hype and when there's that much anticipation amongst the young and the socially stunted these things have a habit of becoming a self-fulfilling prophesy. It's just a pity that the movie itself isn't very good.<br/><br/>Its fascinating, you might think and even if you wouldn't I would, that parents are a great deal more relaxed about entertainment than other confected consumables. Spider-man is the ultimate corporate movie making exercise and the big spiders forced to pay for their egg sack progeny to watch the bloody thing, see it all as harmless, if juvenile fun. It'd be a real killjoy that berated people for enjoying this sort of thing wouldn't it? And with that in mind, on we go.<br/><br/>The thing is you see legions of kids, accompanied by well meaning but unconsciously hypocritical parents, lap it up like maggots to human remains. These are the same people who won't let their kids eat anything that isn't organically produced and spend hours examining packaging in supermarkets for additives. Imagine for a moment that they applied the same standard to movies. Lactating mothers whose husbands work in the city all day and didn't know they were ever pregnant, let alone looking after their 3 children, would accost miserable cinema staff and ask them things like 'has this film been written by a single individual nurturing his own idea and is the story true to the principles of creative film-making, nurtured by independently minded professionals and funded with the profits from art house festivals?' If the poor sod said no then Mum would take her offspring elsewhere, looking for wholesome, and intellectually nourishing entertainment. But we don't think this way of course and so consequently our offspring get force fed a sickly sweet diet of confected glop like 'ol Spidey here. Okay, says Sony's marketing department, the script is Sam Rami's vision of the arachnid super-hero but you only have to watch the new film to see the tension between commercial interest and the auteur imperative and you better believe the latter always gets snuffed out when there's a budget of $258M involved.<br/><br/>What's so depressing about Spider-man 3 is how synthetic is actually feels. It's a demographically minded, committee made 140 minutes with numerous plot strands all jockeying for attention, amidst some admittedly impressive special effects and a truckle of characters, none of whom have any time or space to develop in any satisfactory manor. Every moment is calculated with such cynicism that it's almost impossible not to feel embarrassed watching it flaunt its crowd pleasing conventions. They're well worn certainly, but we keep coming back for them like a sadist making a homeless man dance for his pleasure for the price of some cigarettes and a subway meatball sandwich. You know its self-destructive but you can't help yourself.<br/><br/>What works is mainly held over from previous films, which means it's extended into this one without being developed further. Maguire still doesn't have any descent quips but he's reasonably endearing if too bug eyed by half as the hero and Dunst still has a sweetness about her but the sentimental etchings of her failing relationship with Tobey, vomited into the proceedings, is enough to turn an unfocused script into pure flab in some places. You'd think a man who could ejaculate through his wrists would be interesting enough not to have girl trouble but true to her sex, Dunst is never satisfied.<br/><br/>Reversing a good decision from previous Spider-mans, this one has too many villains and subsequently can't give them room to develop. Thomas Haden Church is wasted as Sandman, having nothing to do but morph into a sandstorm and the film's promised ""battle from within"" following Peter Parker's infection with an alien parasite, turns him from an irritating but hubristic do gooder into a bit of a sticky tosser who dresses like Gomez Addams and does poor impressions of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Based on this evidence half the clubbers in Britain have been exposed to venom and before you rush out, that isn't a new name for an old venereal diseasethough if you're concerned you've probably got that too.<br/><br/>Cluttered and lacking the, er, intelligence of previous outings, Spider-man 3 is big, well dressed multiplex fodder but is in turn both childish and sugary enough to be fairly disappointing overall. Rami's screenplay is pretty dreadful so a bit of the old directorial bravado might have helped but these days the man who used to run his work through with wit and vigor behind the camera is content to point and click, leaving the real work to the effects artists. Fine but don't be surprised if you find yourself as undernourished as a kid who survives on sweets and soft drinks alone. Your Mum would have told you these things were bad for you but she was busy buying the tickets and stocking up on the popcorn.<br/><br/>Glazed with cash but bland as butter."

","I'm giving this one a 6 with several criticisms along the way. Quick Summary: Definite date/chick flick. If you want to get your action fix on and still go see it with your significant other, then this is the one. <br/><br/>I tolerated Toby's quivering lip in other roles, but sh*t, it's like an un-repaired cleft palette in this one. If he or anyone else cried any longer in the film, I would have expected a walk-on from Meryl Streep(sp?).<br/><br/>My wife and I were laughing out loud at the scenes when Spidey/Parker ""bared his soul"" to M.J. and had the lip quiver/tear roll going. Also, the prance-skip the unmasked Spiderman did when he rushed to the side of his fallen foe/friend was so satirical that it almost seemed like a Saturday Night Live Parody of the whole crybaby attitude Parker had in the whole movie. Now, before I get flamed on this, The movie was indeed very entertaining. I loved seeing Spiderman return to the screen (especially in DLP). All of my cinematic Marvel fantasies are coming to fruition as I creep into middle age. But let's tune in a little tighter to the comic personae not represented in the Marvel movies of late. I'm not going to geek-out on this review, but some readers will know what I mean-- heck, even my 15-year-old sympathized with me. Spidey was soft...too soft.<br/><br/>OK, my Topher reference in the Summary header: I've admired this guy's work since the ""70's Show."" He even favors the Peter Parker representation in the movies. I have to wonder if it's not a nod to a previous consideration for the lead role. BTW, Kirstin Dunst should have stopped after ""Interview with the Vampire."" Toper has a promising future in film, so long as his agent casts him properly and springboards on this role departure. This film is a good start -- he definitely broke the 70's Show stereotype. <br/><br/>Despite the harsh words, this film is fun. The actors do as they're told, so the film plays as directed. Surprising, but again, I love seeing these characters on the big screen--and so do my kids. <br/><br/>Just remember, recognize and respect the content source beyond a Stan Lee cameo."

","Well, it finally happened.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 fell to what's commonly known as ""too many villains syndrome.""<br/><br/>Don't believe me? Check out any of the Batman movies, especially Batman and Robin. There's too many villains, and the plot suffers because they try to accommodate the villains.<br/><br/>In this case, Peter Parker, aka Spiderman (Tobey McGuire)has to deal with 3: The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Harry Osborn, aka Green Goblin (James Franco)and Eddie Brock, aka Venom (Topher Grace). He also has to deal with the jealousy of Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst), who is going through a hard time. Most of all, Peter has to deal with his fame and the liquid creature that turns him into a dark figure and also a bit of a jerk to boot.<br/><br/>The film has some disturbing scenes, such as Peter walking down the street, trying to look sexy and suave.<br/><br/>Some of the plot points make no sense whatsoever, and it's a shame that Sam Raimi would let this hit the screen. It's heavy on great special fx, but incredibly light on a credible story. And what was the point of Bryce Dallas Howard being in the film other than eye candy? Again, it reminded me of Elle McPherson and Vivica A. Fox in ""Batman And Robin,"" a pointless role with no real meaning.<br/><br/>It's the most disappointing entry in the Spiderman series."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","2","5","12 May 2007"," A Shell of Spider-Man
","""Spider-Man 3"" feels 2 hours and 20 minutes long. Returning Director and Writer Sam Raimi along with co-writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent seem to be running on fumes in this third installment of the Spider-Man tale. Uncharacteristically, the storytelling is messy. There are way too many villains: New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom. Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) journey into Darth Vader territory, down the dark side ends up more repulsive instead of sympathetic. This is a critical miscalculation. Maguire's earnest and strong performance as Peter and Spider-Man barely salvages ""Spider-Man 3"". Overall, ""Spider-Man 3"" is well crafted and visually spectacularthat's all. I loved ""Spider-Man 2"". I thought that ""Spider-Man 2"" was not only a great sequel, but also a great movie on its own. ""Spider-Man 2"" had the great scene with Aunt May saying, ""I believe there is a hero in all of us"" That story was all about inspired greatness and being a hero. ""Spider-Man 3"" seems to have forgotten that cultural context. Although pretty to look at, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a shell with glossy veneer. This is a little disappointing coming from the talented Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>In ""Spider-Man 3"" the opening narration by Peter (Maguire) astonishingly sounds full of himself; thus, hinting the hero's pitfall. Peter seems to believe his own press clippings. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead on a Broadway show. Peter is thinking about asking MJ to marry him. Freelance news photographer Peter has a rival in smarmy Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). And he also has potential rival for his affections in the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Harry Osborn (James Franco) has sworn vengeance upon Peter and Spider-Man for the death of his father. To add to the convolution, escaped criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) goes through a surprising transformation in a scientific mishap. Marko may also be involved in the murder of Peter's Uncle Ben. Finally, an extra-terrestrial parasite infects Peter. This galactic symbiotic creature unbridles everyone's darker nature.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" aspires for greatness. However, it is off focus, clunky and kluged. The strong performances by Maguire, Harris, and Franco are really left in a lurch without a compelling story. Fortunately, Raimi's narrative focuses near the end. Though clumsy throughout, I believe Raimi wanted to tell his story of forgiveness. Visually, the movie is stunning. The opening aerial battle between Peter and New Goblin (Fanco) is breathtaking. The inconsistent and bewildering Sandman effects are technical marvels. A lot of money was spent making ""Spider-Man"" look great. What would have served the movie might have been less villains and perhaps a cathartic examination of our own dark side. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker. However, in his darker manifestation the normally engaging Maguire is not at all sympathetic. The misstep is almost costly, because of the inherent semi-comic tone. Maguire's innate earnestness and calm retrieve this from the abyss. On the other hand Kirsten Dunst comes off very whiny as MJ. Granted her character's life is not going as she had wished; she is still unpleasant. James Franco is charismatic as Harry.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" has some spectacular action scenes. It is in its quiet moments void of ""sound and fury"" that the movie fails. There is not a compelling story to tell here. This comment really has no merit in the big picture. ""Spider-Man 3"" has as a shot at becoming the biggest grossing movie of all time. Perhaps, with all the returning talent in the inevitable ""Spider-Man 4"" Raimi and company can recapture the greatness of the classic hero tale that moves and inspires."
"gfgr","4","2","5","11 May 2007"," Last and Least of the Trilogy
","**!!!Lot's of Spoilers!!!**<br/><br/>Before seeing the movie I read the review on Spider-Man 3 in Empire magazine that didn't exactly praise the movie. I thought ""this is bull, this is the same magazine that gave 3 stars for GhostRider, the worst movie EVER after Catwoman""<br/><br/>I am something of a comicbook fan, but distant enough to have an objective opinion not influenced by excitement. This is what I thought of the movie after I saw it. I didn't like the lazy titles in the beginning, they didn't really inform you if you hadn't seen the previous two movies about the events and were boring to go through if you had. After the titles the movie begging and I find myself watching events unfold in a fast paste not having a chance to think or feel anything as the plot unfolded. It also kind of felt that I had missed the beginning and walked into the movie 15minutes late, it started too roughly. I was OK with the actors, Tobey Maguire's face has grown a bit round, Kirsten Dunst has looked worst (in Spider-Man 2),I guess, James Franco was good considering what he was given to do (especially in the end of the movie), Thomas Haden Church as Sand Man was quite good I must say, though many people didn't like him in the movie, I even thought Sand Man was a lame choice of villain before I saw the movie, in the end I would say Sandman had some of the most interesting scenes, giving the movie flints of magic experienced in Spider-Man one and two. Topher Grace was good at giving his own -less muscular- version of Eddie Brock though in all Venom was a HUGE disappointment for later generation Spider-Man fans such as myself.<br/><br/>Too many villains they said. I thought ""the more the merrier"" before I saw the movie, but it wasn't The evil black symbiotic blob takes over Peter Parker and turns him into a black suited Spider-Man, it was cool, though just turning his suit black with a slightly different spider symbol seemed a bit lazy on behalf of the costume department to me Having the symbiot gives Peter more power as Spider-Man, but makes him arrogant as well hmmm not evil enough! Then we go to Sand-Man, the murderer/robber with the heart of gold. I enjoyed the scene of him trying to literally put himself together when he is turned into a pile of sand, it was touching. MJ and Peter's relationship problems become boring, Gwen Stacy has a nice scene at first hanging and falling and being rescued, but after that she is forgotten and they don't even bother killing her off at the end as they do in the comicbook (no one left to kill her since Green Goblin isn't around anymore, she should have been in the first movie!) Though we saw ""evil"" Peter Parker, there wasn't much of evil Spider-Man. And that's one of the huge things missing in the movie, there was too much Peter Parker and not so much Spider-Man. Bad jokes, American flags waving in the background (could it be any HUGER?), retro badboy Peter shenanigans with bangs, all sins of this instalment. The killer of the movie for me which would have been make or brake was Venom. Why? Just because Sam Raimi was in his 50's by the time Venom was created in the comicbooks he didn't have to snob him that much. I found the special effects used to create Venom mediocre at best. He wasn't bulky enough, he wasn't evil and slimy enough he didn't kill enough, he wasn't in the movie enough and now he's dead, or at least Eddie, his host is. When he spoke with the ""suit"" on it seemed silly as the mouth wasn't designed to speak but only to chew bits off people and the scene where the slime withdraws to reveille Eddies face made me feel uncomfortable for how badly it was made. I wouldn't blame Topher's performance though he did well on his behalf. I didn't care for the new goblin or whatever Harry Osborn's character was supposed to be, I though his performance as a drunk and spiteful brat was much more powerful in the previous movie. He hit's his head and gets amnesia, he gets beat up by Spider-man and ends up with his face scarred, he dies, and still you feel nothing much Finally, using MJ again as the victim and Spider-Man saving her yet again has started wearing thin.<br/><br/>The news that Sam Raimi and the leads of the cast would not return to do more spider-man movies use to worry me, now after having seen the latest movie I think maybe it would be for the best as they seem to be sick and tired of the franchise and did this last installment because of a three-movie contract they had signed up for and money!<br/><br/>I would suggest that Marvel spent some money on remaking this movie instead of remaking the Hulk, which I thought to be brilliant!<br/><br/>let's hope there is a fourth one with Carnage to do the alien symbiot's some justice!<br/><br/>4/10 because they could have done a hell lot better and they have!"

","Saw it this afternoon, double featured it with ""28 weeks later"" and if I hadn't gotten to see both for the $6. price tag I would have been complaining bitterly. I had high expectations for this movie as I am a huge fan and saw that the preview voter ratings at IMDb were at 8.4. I was tempted to see it at the initial general showing last Thursday at midnight. I'm glad I didn't. The ratings plummeted within a few days and as of today were at 6.8. They probably shouldn't even be that high. The film has spectacular special effects that go to the next level of technical development in much the same way that X-Men progressed from film to film. But that isn't enough to carry the whole project through nearly 2 1/2 hours of viewing time. I was disappointed with the screenplay, dialog and especially the direction and evolution of the character development. I found myself antsy in my seat and glancing at my watch between battle scenes. <br/><br/>Early on, an alien meteorite just HAPPENS to strike the earth exactly where Pete and Mary Jane are ""pitching woo"" in a spidey hammock and beyond THAT coincidence, they don't even take notice !? Who developed the Green Goblin's improved transport vehicle and new mask ? I thought I remembered that James Franco's character just barely graduated from High School. If it was him then he must be some kind of repressed super-genius. Tobey Maguire does a laughable morph when he's symbiotisized by the black goo and becomes a low budget Tony Manero, strutting about with an Adolph Hitler hair-do. I half expected to hear the Bee Gees start to sing ""Staying Alive"" in the background. PUH-LEEZE ! These are just small examples of the stupidity woven throughout this VERY poorly developed movie. Danny Elfman's scoring is adequate, but he's no John Williams. J.K. Simmons is amusing but underutilized as the editor of the newspaper; James Cromwell's formidable talents are completely wasted.......... too bad.......remember how disappointing ""Alien 3"" was ?.......Maybe Spiderman 4 will be better............"

","I feel since I just wasted two and half hours of my life watching this movie, that I'm now entitled to use a over-used cliché to describe the biggest disappointment of a film I've ever seen. ""Oh, what a tangled web they weaved"".<br/><br/>This movie was the biggest car wreck of a movie I've been to since ""Battlefield Earth"". But at least I expected that to suck. I was a huge fan of the previous two entries in the Spider-Man franchise. They were very enjoyable and they stayed true to their source material. This movie made it all up as they went along and showed just enough hints of greatness to keep me saying to myself right up until the end ""any minute now, this movie will be awesome"". It never was.<br/><br/>One word sums it up. Overkill. Two many characters (some of them completely needless) and two many plots. All throughout the film there were scenes that would have been great in another version of the story, just not this one. The movie felt like they took three stories and slammed them together to get the final product. Everything felt rushed, even though the movie ran way too long. It was full of cheap ""huh?!"" plot devices. The comedy was anything but comedy (outside of Bruce Cambell's turn as a John Cleese-like french waiter) and was frankly, embarrassing. Spider-Man's much hyped desent into the ""dark side"" was just Peter Parker getting emo hair and not showering, and the normally interesting relationship between Spidey and MJ felt like slow, dull torture.<br/><br/>Thomas Hayden Church's performance as the Sandman was great, and he was clearly the most interesting character in the film both visually, and character wise, but he was swallowed up by this monster of a film. By the end, I didn't even see a need for him to be in the story at all. He turned out just to be a plot device to rehash a storyline from the first film that was already settled before Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>And Venom! I had waited 15 years to see Venom, the greatest Spider-Man villain of all time, rendered onto the movie screen. The skinny kid with the big Adam's Apple from ""That 70s Show"" was Venom for maybe only the last 30 minutes of the film, and they didn't even mention he WAS Venom during the movie. Everyone just called him ""that other spider-man!"" after the film. And the continuity was so bad, no one bothered to explain why Topher Grey's character got horrible rat teeth once he became ""that other Spider-Man"". Even Toby's chompers stayed pearly white when he went all emo after wearing the black costume.<br/><br/>Fans of the comics will dislike this movie because they basically molested the source material (I.E. the Spider-Man comics this franchise was once so faithful to) to get all these pieces to fit together.<br/><br/>Causual fans (I.E. people who only really know about Spidey from the films) will dislike this movie because its just way too much for one film to handle.<br/><br/>The only people who'll truly like this movie are CGI junkies. The special effects and the fight scenes are the ONLY arena this film excelled in.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money at theaters, unless your a total fan-boy. See it on DVD only if you MUST. Watching it for free on television is what I recommend.<br/><br/>What a turkey."

","Let me preface my review of ""Spider-Man 3"" by saying that in the last few years Marvel Comics has ruined what they have deemed for more than forty years as their flagship character and fictional ambassador, Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Spider-Man was used and abused by Marvel in their disastrous epic storyline known as ""Civil War,"" where he was essentially forced by his creators (and characters in the story) to unmask himself publicly, ruining his reputation as Peter Parker, his crime-fighting career as Spider-Man, and most stupidly of all, risking the very lives of himself and every single person he cares for.<br/><br/>Really, in the scheme of the Marvel Universe, there is no Spider-Man any more. Oh, yes, he still appears in any number of eponymous titles published in grind house-fashion from the House of Ideas, but Peter Parker really isn't Spider-Man any more.<br/><br/>However, the Webslinger still exists, and oddly enough, he exists truly only on the silver screen. What Sam Raimi and Co. have done since 2002 has placed Spider-Man at the forefront of public consciousness in a way that Marvel never has, and now, never will.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" continues that strange phenomenon, and is an awe-inspiring addition to the two companion films that preceded it. Also, interestingly enough, due to its dense, multi-layered, and intricate plot lines, it is the most comic book-esquire film ever made in this re-emerging genre.<br/><br/>So-called critics have complained that too much goes on ""Spider-Man 3,"" and thus, it falls flat. Look, if the eight-year old children sitting around me in the theater could follow the plot(s), and still enjoy the film and themselves, then I really fail to see how middle aged, accomplished writers and journalists could not.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man 3"" was able to masterful weave Peter Parker, our lamented titular hero, and the very love of his life, Mary Jane Watson's burgeoning relationship's ups and down, along with MJ's own lagging stage career, Peter's growing ego now that his alter ego has become the city's most beloved citizen and resident protector, the origin story of the criminal Sandman, and the reality that he was actually the murderer of Peter's Uncle Ben Parker, the arrival of rival photographer Eddie Brock, the bonding of Peter with the alien ""symbiote"" who affords him a new, black costume and a severe personality alteration, Harry Osborn's vendetta against Peter, whom he sees as the murderer of his father, and finally, the rise of Venom, his team-up with the Sandman, the climatic battle between heroes and villains, and culminating in deaths, forgiveness, and redemption. Yes, all that happens in 140 minutes, and somehow, it is done with such skill and enjoyment on the part of the audience, that I still wonder at how it was accomplished.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire returns as our hero, and hopefully, not for the last time. Maguire epitomizes what Spider-Man used to be, and wears the role with the sort of ease the late, great Christopher Reeve possessed during his reign as the screen's Superman. Kirsten Dunst is given a lot to do here, and portrays Mary Jane Watson with real dramatic gusto, although as the film progresses, I really began to loathe MJ in a way I never have before.<br/><br/>The true highlights are James Franco's Harry Osborn/New Goblin and Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marko/The Sandman. Franco's character has evolved so much during the series, and in ""Spider-Man 3"" his fall into darkness is well done, as his return to innocence following his disastrous attack on Peter. I have to admit that there were tears in my eyes when Harry, now knowing how his father really died (thanks, Bernard!), saves the life of Peter, not once, but twice in the climactic battle with the Sandman and Venom. Harry dies for his friends, and is truly redeemed in a Darth Vader-like way that is sad, but satisfying.<br/><br/>Church fully fleshes out Flint Marko in such a way, that you can really see director Raimi's fondness for the popular Spidey villain. Church's Sandman is a tragic figure, not sure if he is good or bad, but ultimately willing to do anything to save the life of his daughter (incidentally, also the daughter of the Bride in Kill Bill Vol. 2). Church's Sandman not only survives this film, but actually is forgiven for the worst crime in the Spider-Man mythos, killing Uncle Ben, by Peter himself.<br/><br/>Topher Grace somewhat channels his smarmy role as Carter Duryea in ""In Good Company"" as the despicable Edward Brock, Jr. And frankly, as the symbiote-fueled Venom, is given little to do at the end. Venom is not seen on screen until the final battle, and does not survive the outcome. And I think for this fact alone, many fans of Spider-Man's comic book adventures from the late 80s and through the late 90s were turned off by this film. Venom rose from a one-trick pony. rip-off supervillain (see Superman's Bizarro No.1 and The Flash's Reverse-Flash) to a full-fledged anti-hero, and I guess, many fanboys expected this to be on full display in ""Spider-Man 3."" But, this wasn't Venom's story, or even the symbiote's story. It was the story of three friends, Peter, MJ, and Harry, who at last overcome the horrible things that have done to themselves and one another, and at last triumph over evil in a way that could never be done behind a mask or with super-powers.<br/><br/>If this is the end of Spider-Man's cinematic adventures, then I am truly sad. There are still just too many damn stories to tell about the Wall-Crawler. If this is simply the next chapter in Peter Parker's tale, then it is a fitting one that opens the door to the future of still my favorite hard-luck hero...well, next to Batman.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation!"
"zero-cypher","2","2","5","5 May 2007"," Let's pretend that didn't just happen...
","Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Spidey fan. Been reading the comics for years.<br/><br/>This movie does him no justice.<br/><br/>To start with, the black suit that Spider-Man wears has always been a sign of his more dark and troubled times. He becomes more like a vigilante and less like your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. They totally F'd this one up. Instead of becoming dark and brooding, angry, cynical as he should have, he becomes a cocky, flippant Emo. What the heck is this? He's dancing in the street, creeping people out, being a total jack-*** to MJ and being an idiot in general.<br/><br/>And then there's Venom. Venom is, and has been, one of Spidey's more interesting villains. They could have (and probably should have) spent most the movie just going through the back-story of how Venom came to be. Instead the movie gives no real explanation as to how Spider-Man even figures out the costume is alive, why he takes it to Dr. Conners (which really he was supposed to take it to Mr. Fantastic but no biggie there) in the first place, or really how much more powerful the suit makes him. The closest it really even comes in that regard is showing a couple of pictures of Spidey lifting cars (which he should have been able to do before the suit if you follow the comics at all; Spidey once lifted a train over his head and threatened to throw it at someone). So really, you kind of have to wonder just how powerful Venom really is supposed to be. And those of you that don't follow the comics at all and all you know is the movies were probably wondering just who the hell he was anyways.<br/><br/>Venom was always one of Spidey's most powerful, dangerous villains. There's nothing like a guy that's half-crazy lifting you up by the throat and declaring that ""we're"" going to eat your brains. Especially when he's got the power to do it. The only saving grace as far as Venom is concerned is that he's not dead. Sure, he supposedly gets blown up at the end, but he's not really dead. At least he better not be.<br/><br/>Next up: Sandman. Why was he even in this movie? Oh yea... So Sam could waste his 250 mil on special effects. Great thinking Sam... Base a movie solely around special effects... That'll work. Seriously, Sandman was never one of the Bad bad guys. Just a guys that made some poor choices and wound up on the wrong side of a nuclear test. What's this about a sick daughter? Great... instant justification for robbing banks and killing cops right there... I've got a sick daughter. That justifies me killing your uncle, robbing you, taking your car and then trying to kill you later. Sure... And then Spidey forgives him. Because it was an ""accident."" One of the few decent lines in the movie: ""You want forgiveness, find religion."" 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>Back to Mary Jane Watson. Since when was she a singer? I can deal with making her a struggling Broadway actress, but a singer? What purpose does that serve? To set up the blues club scene later in the movie? And Raimi totally messed up her character. She was supposed to be a party girl, flippant, rambunctious, dragging the nerd that is Peter Parker out of his shell long enough to show him a good time enough times that he falls in love with her. Not some whiny little actress type that goes to tears over a bad review, then can't even manage to tell Peter she got fired for not being able to sing. Oh and by the way, whoever she was lip syncing to isn't very good either. And Dunst can't even stay in sync with her. I will give Raimi credit for one thing though, he make MJ act like a real actress... A completely self obsessed whiny attention-whore. Congrats on messing up Mary Jane too. There goes my childhood.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn. Honestly, I don't think they did too bad with him... until the end. So the jet board is a huge departure from the standard goblin gear that was made classic by the comics (only super villains get to wear green and purple together. It's a rule.). Not that big a deal in comparison to so many of the other flaws. He's still got the motivation there to kill Spidey which isn't too far from the mark and the Osborn legacy of madness; though underplayed; is still there. Harry was always just a bumbler as goblin anyways. But the instant forgiveness that both Harry and Peter give each other at the end of the movie... what a load of crap! ""You blew up half my face but I'll forgive you and help you save the day anyways."" ""Thanks Harry, and I forgive you for trying to kill me all those times."" ""Oh, it's alright Pete, now lets go save Mary Jane!"" Need I say more? Peter Parker. Why is he crying every other scene? Why is he never wearing a mask? Is he even trying to protect his secret identity? Why is he suddenly loved by everyone? Did he just cure cancer sometime between the last movie and this one? Suddenly he's loved out of no-where? And he's arrogant about it? And he rants about it to MJ all over the place? 'Cause that's not gonna cause problems with the relationship. Oh wait... It did. And he's crying again. Now he's dancing... and he's crying again. And why dose he look like he's smiling and crying? Ya know what? I'm running close to the 1000 word limit here. Just go see it for yourself. You'll see exactly what I mean.<br/><br/>Redeeming qualities: Bruce Campbell is hilarious, and the goblin/Spidey fight at the beginning is exceptionally well done. But that's it.<br/><br/>Cypher."
"gevalero","5","2","5","5 May 2007"," This could (and should) be the end of Spiderman
","Maybe they should have spent a little more of the $300M budget in a decent script. Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad ""Three's company"" episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1&2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1&2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system."
"tyguyhunt007","4","2","5","5 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 Met My Expectations
","There aren't really any major spoilers here, I'm just playing it safe. This movie was everything I hoped it could be. I knew most of the story before seeing the movie due to message boards, etc. After knowing this I just thought: How is Sam Raimi gonna pull this off? There is just too much story. There is no way he can do this cleanly. However, he did. With that said, I'll discuss the acting. I thought the acting in this movie was really good. James Franco plays a little bit of a different Harry throughout part of the film and I believe he played this different Harry very well. I think Tobey Maguire has played a better Peter Parker/Spiderman in the past movies, but there isn't really much to complain about here. Kirsten Dunst is the good actress she has been in the first two, so there is nothing to complain about here either. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace were both good in the roles of the new villains. However, Topher does a much better job of portraying a new kind of Venom. Venom is a crowd favorite, and even though this Venom is different, I can promise you won't be disappointed. In fact, the only complaints I have about acting in this movie is in one of the last scenes that require Peter and Mary Jane to cry. There is this lip quiver thing that made me laugh a little to myself. Now that I have discussed acting, I will tackle action. There isn't really a whole lot to say here because it was all so awesome. The best fights from all 3 Spiderman movies are in Spiderman 3. The last fight with Venom is incredible. It makes you want to be Spiderman. There are some cheesy aspects of the movie I need to talk about. For example, when Peter has the black suit and he walks down the street and dances, its pretty corny. However, this was put in for laughs and it did, in fact, get laughs. Spiderman isn't just a movie for older people, it is also a kid favorite. Cheesy things like this are liked by kids. Since kids are a major portion of the audience, it isn't too odd that this scene is in the movie, therefore, I can't really hold that against the movie. Also, when Spiderman lands in front of a large American flag I thought it to be pretty corny. But then I realized all the Spiderman movies have had some kind of Spidey/American Flag scene. The scene in the first was due to 9/11 occurring just months before the release. You can't hold this one small 2 second scene against the movie either. So basically, Spiderman 3 has gotten some bad reviews from people all over the world. However, I think it is because they feel the movie didn't live up to their expectations, because they feel compelled to hate all things that are popular, or because they picked out some corny scenes from the movie that I pointed out and chose to hate the movie because of it. However, you can't let minor flaws destroy your movie going experience. Spiderman 3 is my favorite Spidey so far. People went into Spiderman 3 with huge expectations and when it didn't meet them, they felt compelled to seek out the flaws and decide it was a horrible movie. As for me, it is the best time I have had at the movies this year and I strongly recommend it.I am prepared to say it will be the best film of the summer. I didn't go into the movie expecting it to be the best movie ever, I went into it expecting what it was: a pretty good superhero movie featuring my favorite superhero and the characters of his universe. I give it an 7.5 out of 10(that rounds up to 8)."
"sherif_mohsen","5","2","5","5 May 2007"," Mediocre, but fun to watch
","I don't know, i just felt that the 3rd part was the worst by far. It seemed to be targeted to teenagers. Even ""the struggle lies within theme"" was not properly executed. The movie had a lotttt of corny scenes.. I mean wut's up with the clapping thing? Every time spiderman appears in public or saves someone, people are just clapping idiotically! The drama acting of the main characters was very good, but I think the director couldn't meet our growing expectations (Since Spiderman 2 was a kick ass!!) So all in all, the movie is not that bad, but if you still wanna see it, just go with minimum expectations! Trust me!"
"NeilBarnett","6","2","5","5 May 2007"," 3rd time unlucky.
","From seeing the trailer so many weeks ago, this was the movie from the list of summer blockbuster movies (mainly sequels) I was looking forward to seeing.<br/><br/>Spider-man 2 was without doubt the best comic book genre film ever, it had everything. So with Spider-man 3 out and the trailers looking fantastic I pre-booked my ticket and went to see it.<br/><br/>Everything that was good in the second film was bad in the third. It was basically a re-run, going over the same story lines from the first two films.<br/><br/>But my main problem with this film was the special effects. Apart from one or two scenes they were terrible. Where in the second film the CGI effects had depth and felt and looked right in the third film they stand away from the background and neither the foreground or background matched in light and shadow.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with the film was how the film flowed. It was just a collection of scenes sellotaped together, and not very well. Perphaps if it was 30 to 40 minutes shorter, had one bad guy less it would of been a much better film."
"emilydavies87","5","2","5","5 May 2007"," What a let down
","Too Long, Too Flashy, Too Full.<br/><br/>After viewing Spiderman 3 last night I thought it was only fair that I broadcast my feelings about it.<br/><br/>Firstly its too long. It took about an hour to get going and by that point I was ready to walk out.<br/><br/>Secondly, I understand that after the previous 2 films they had a level of special effects to beat, but it just felt too fake!<br/><br/>Thirdly, was there a real need for the Sandman, The Green Goblin and Venom. The conflict between Spiderman and Venom would have been enough! Oh and WTF!!!!! With giving Peter Parker an EMO look when he's wearing the Venom suit???? And Bryce Dallas Howard??? Did she need to be in it either? Plus Kirsten Dunst singing? (well if that was actually her singing)<br/><br/>I think that Sam Raimi has tried to put too much into the 3rd instalment and by sticking to maybe just 2 characters (like Venom/ New Green Goblin) the audience may have actually cared what happened to them as by the end of the film all I cared about was the traffic leaving the flicks!!!!"
"SSBunny45","4","2","5","5 May 2007"," The worst end to a great trilogy
","I had such high hopes when I pre-ordered my ticket for Spider-Man 3, and all my hopes were shot down. The movie was cheesy, too underdeveloped, and just plain bad. I found myself laughing at the, ""serious"" parts of the movie rather than shedding a tear or feeling suspenseful. Performances that were given were alright, but they weren't great. Tobey Maguire is a great actor, and he was slightly mediocre in this film. James Franco did alright too, but nothing as good as the second movie where he played the vengeful part so well. Kirsten Dunst was just whiny and unconvincing. Bryce Dallas Howard, who is a great talent, got very little screen time and was completely underused as an actor, which is very sad. The same goes for Topher Grace, who should have been the focal point villain in the movie because he was so good at it, but he was only a villain for the last part of the movie. Thomas Hayden Church is a great actor, who trained over a year for this film, and he just played the part of a meathead convict who had bad luck? The whole movie was crap. The story lines were just too bad and too many and they left me and my fellow viewers unsatisfied at the end of the movie. After Spider-Man 2 I was thinking, the only way to go is up, but Spider-Man 3 plummets. It will definitely bring in a big box office, but it is the worst ending to a trilogy I have ever seen. I am saddened by this because I want to own the trilogy, but I can't force myself to watch this movie again. If you like cheesy lines and underdeveloped story, then this is the movie for you. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, as always. But seriously, think twice before going to see this movie in the theaters, you may want that 2 hour and 20 minute period of your life back, I know I did."
"jameselford","4","2","5","5 May 2007"," Third Time's a Harm
","The first time I saw Spiderman in the cinema, my jaw hit the floor at least ten times. The effects weren't just mind-bogglingly beautiful, they had heart, and served a purpose: to drive the story. You could practically FEEL what each character was going through---and empathise---even whilst cheering them on in each well-choreographed fight scene. For the first time, a comic-book-based film had a heart, had a story to tell, and deserved a standing ovation at the end for daring to be vulnerable.<br/><br/>The other four times were just as rewarding.<br/><br/>The sequel had more troughs than peaks but oh boy, when it reached the highs, it came close to scarring the atmosphere. Emotional context was the key---each and every character stood to lose so much more. And again, a first: a bad guy who could be empathised with. Unlike the Penguin in Batman Returns, Doc Ock could be understood and sympathised with and when you see him descend into the murky depths at the end, you can feel the anguish.<br/><br/>Throughout both films, the love that grows between Peter Parker and Mary Jane helps to both strengthen the plot line, and make both characters vulnerable to the action around them. It also helped to ground the story a little.<br/><br/>3, unfortunately, took all the restraint and discipline and shot them out the window in a blaze of over-enthusiasm. Raimi seems to have taken all the energy from the other two films---and the countless plot threads---and instead of taking each one on succinctly and entertainingly, he aims for the Big No-no: Simultaneous Crash. Batman and Robin did it too. Too many bad guys spoil the broth. So do too many half-baked ideas, too many dollars, and not enough sense.<br/><br/>This, I fear, is the end of Spiderman as we knew it; and the beginning of what seems like an epidemic of empty, hopeless video game-wannabes that kill the braincells with far too many images and not enough vision. I desperately wanted this film to astonish me. I deliberately went in with low expectations, after being made all too aware of its over-the-top style by countless headlines web-wide (pun absolutely intended). Yet even with my hopes so low, it succeeded in only one thing: proving that the dollar signs glowing in studio exec's eyes clearly outshine the bright luminous imaginations of today's writers. Why have one nemesis when you can have three? Especially cos that means more toys, doesn't it? More soundbytes and snippet-images to force-feed on us through TV and the Web. More to sell, more to profit. And hell, Venom is more wasted than Tim Allen on a weekend. Fifteen minutes devoted to an interstellar symbiotic menace capable of destroying Spiderman.<br/><br/>What a shame that this is the final bow of Spiderman. And so much more the shame, that this new version of Spiderman---the one that more closely resembles a Power Ranger---has done what Venom also does: Taken over what we loved, absorbed it, flushed out the good, and all that remains is a dark and horrible lifeless thing.<br/><br/>Dramatic, yes, but when Raimi showed everyone else what real superhero films should be about, he seemed to be aiming away from this train-wreck-style movie-making. Seems I was wrong.<br/><br/>James Franco and Thomas Haden Chruch were almost leftovers of a forgotten script, and yet they were on top of their game in this one. Despite their ruined plot lines and rarish appearances on screen, they still outshone their colleagues, and brought the script quality up a notch. <br/><br/>Too bad they were stuck in a quicksand no-one could escape."
"charchuk","3","2","5","5 May 2007"," Massive disappointment
","It's got so much potential, but it just wastes it away. It throws in everything including the kitchen sink, trying to end the series on a high note, and it does not work at all. You've got Harry and Sandman and Venom and emo Peter and Gwen and MJ and it's all just thrown together, and very little of it sticks. Parts of it are good - pretty much the action sequences and the Venom stuff - but so much of it is incredibly laughable and borders on self-parody. I could go on and on with the stuff I found ridiculous, but I would take up an entire review with that, as there's just so much junk. I'll stick to the highlights.<br/><br/>The stuff that works is the entire church sequence - by far my favourite scene in the movie - and, to an extent, the action scenes. The final battle is quite cool with the four heroes/villains, but it's unfortunately punctuated by a terribly annoying newscaster + reporter explaining everything and Mary Jane screaming. The fights between Sandman and Spidey are very well done, and the Harry/Peter fight was pretty terrific. The Venom origin scene (in the church) is very cool and very dark and it works very well. But it's about the only perfect scene in the film. The rest is just bad, bad, bad.<br/><br/>The stuff that doesn't work is, well, everything else. Emo Peter doesn't even make sense, because, though he's got the emo hair, he doesn't act emo at all. He's like the cockiest jock at school with a terrible haircut. It makes no sense. Every single character, outside of Peter + MJ, disappears for like 20 minutes on end, and nobody notices! Gwen is brought up and then dropped, same with Marko, same with Brock, same with every other side character. It's extremely frustrating. Meanwhile, Harry gets amnesia (!) and a butler shows up out of nowhere to recap the last two movies (!!). Very random and very (unintentionally) hilarious.<br/><br/>The acting is almost uniformly terrible, with only Topher Grace occasionally impressing me. He was a hoot at times, but very meh at others. Still, he's better than Maguire (silly), Dunst (melodramatic), Franco (cheezy), Church (bland), and Howard (hot but not much else). Scenes which were supposed to be sad were instead laughable because of the terrible acting. It's truly painful to watch at times. The editing is simply atrocious - none of the scenes flow together, everything is jumbled up, it seemed like some scenes were missing and others were out of place. The effects are very stunning at times and rather not at others. And then the ending; to top it all off, we get multiple false endings! Just the cherry on top.<br/><br/>It's not a dreadful movie. It's got some good stuff in it, but it's overcome by the sheer weight of its lunacy. It's quite entertaining (if only for the unintentional hilarity) and rarely boring. The action scenes are top notch. But, as far as story and characters go, it's on the level of Batman + Robin. Really. A massive disappointment for me, and I'm not even a huge Spider-Man fan."
"kyleprohaska","6","2","5","5 May 2007"," Shouldn't Have Been Bad...but....
","There was way too much packed into the 2.5hr timeframe. There was way too many pacing ""mistakes"" and awkward moments that ruined certain scenes. The joke with the camera and the kid during the end battle was one of them. It was funny sure but putting it inbetween the dramatic ending and having it last almost a full minute didn't fly with me at all, it took a lot away from what was already building in the scene.<br/><br/>I don't have time to write a full review but basically it was crammed, felt rushed, villains didn't have enough time to develop, certain lines were bogus, awkward scenes that shouldn't have existed, roller-coaster ride with Harry, MJ, Gwen (who served almost no purpose), and Peter which I think confused a lot of the folks I saw in the theater. They were together, they're on the rocks, they have issues, they break up, they get back together, make up ur mind. MJ needs Prozak from the looks of it. There was also more cheese to the film than I would have liked, it had a lot of it and most of it was the excess stuff I was talking about, jokes that were funny but perhaps too long, weren't needed, or just broke the before and after scenes apart. Overall the pacing just had me offbeat the whole time.<br/><br/>Sandman had a good storyline, but I felt they didn't give him enough time, same as Venom. Eddie turns to Venom then all of a sudden goes looking for Sandman?? Not only that but it was very random for him to just swing down and go hey ""yea I wanna kill Spiderman also, lets do it"" It was so wrong and out of nowhere. The ending scene was so rushed and forced. It was normal then all of a sudden ""hey a hostage situation is happening,"" no build up really just all of a sudden it was going on and Peter had to spring into action.<br/><br/>Idk there is a lot more to write but I don't have the energy. It was fun to watch but it was a mess to say the least.<br/><br/>Lots of money, good CG, potential but put together badly. Basically it shouldn't have been bad but the way it was put together, it was."
"sinncross","5","2","5","5 May 2007"," About time for a costume change...
","A current Hollywood trend is to scream the likes of trilogy, trilogy, trilogy... if only it were that simple. As these series bank on their final act, one would expect the finale to always be of the best quality. But both past and present attempts have proved that this is not always the case.<br/><br/>Spider-man 3 slings off soon after the events of it's prequel: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is ready to propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and New York is buzzing from Spider-man fever. Yet everything turns haywire as various problems begin to arise. J. Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is playing with the idea of giving Peter's position at the Daily Bugle to Eddie Brock (Topher Grace); Mary Jane feels that Peter and herself are on different wave lengths; Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to avenge his father's death; the murderer of Peter's uncle is revealed to be Mark Flinto (Thomas Haden Church); and Peter undergoes a personal struggle of revenge.<br/><br/>Spider-man 3, while not convoluted by any means, contains a variety of complexity in regards to its overall storyline, which is the first of many mistakes that inhibit the film: there is too much happening and Sam Raimi can never seem to control it. With this comes the lack of character development and depth of the existing plots. Of all three villains, the new Green Goblin is perhaps the best handled, with the rift between Peter and Harry widening. This story arc had to be completed, and is done so with a definite, if not sad ending. The next of the villain is Sandman, who yields an intriguing story. He was part of the murder of Peter's uncle, and is desperately trying to save his daughter from an illness, but as the film continues, it's the former which takes precedence over the latter factor of his story. This only goes to make Sandman more of a villain and less a sympathetic character as he ought to have been. The last of the villains, while a fan favourite, is poorly integrated into the film. As quickly as Venom appears, does he as quickly disappear. While an extension of Brock, Venom never has time to grow to allow for a convincing villain. Venom's position is similar to a lesser villain, and better used at opening the film, instead of concluding it. While the romance between Peter and Mary Jane is the most positive in terms of story development, this arc is not faultless, especially with the introduction of Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard), who seems to be thrown into the mix at the last minute, as her role is underused and pointless.<br/><br/>Also, the overall vibe of the film is lacking. There's no flow between scenes and every action comes across as very coincidental and linear. Also ridden in the film are oddball scenes, which bring nothing to the film or its characters. Such scenes contain Peter dancing at a Jazz club, or a kid muttering 'Wicked cool' during a fight scene. These are amateur at best, and really downplays the credibility of Sam Raimi: these scenes add to the overall length of the film, but while their exclusion would help pacing purposes, it serves to emphasis the lack of depth apparent throughout. If anything, Spider-Man 3 should have been told through the course of two films to help character development.<br/><br/>Most of the overall cast do not go about helping matters. Sadly, it's the main characters who provide the least, with Dunst never fully completing her character, and Maguire never being able to show the evil side of Spider-Man without comical results. Grace and Hayden play their parts with mediocre success: they show that they can act but their characters never reach actuality and there are nuances of dialogue problems which come across as rather questionable.<br/><br/>The most memorable performances come from Howard and Franco. Howard, while in a limited role exudes an energetic spunk which is omitted from the rest of the film, even the action scenes. Franco, however, continues to show that he does possess ability to act, and he is easily a character who many will be able to feel for. Franco represents the emotional capacity of his character who is dealing with the death of his father, the believed betrayal of his friend, and the obsession for revenge. Even by the end of the film, in a sad moment, Franco keeps up his act, to bring about a villain who is not entirely heartless. On a last note, Simmons, like the first two Spider-Man films, is still superb as the aggressive and hilarious editor of the Daily Bugle.<br/><br/>If the problems for Spider-Man 3 could not get worse, they sadly do. For a movie which cost in the vicinity of $300 million to create, it sure does not look like it. The CG, like before attempts in the trilogy, are forgivingly lacking and unrealistic. Sandman is somewhat impressive towards the end of the film, and Venom is far too cartoon looking to hold any real menace. The special effects are not entirely unlike anything seen before, and the musical score is not the most impressive. It's a wonder where all the money was used for even the action scenes, for the most part, are uninspiring. While its never a problem that a director tries to make a film an epic, it is a problem when all efforts are unprofessionally executed.<br/><br/>With a mess of a storyline, odd placed scenes and dialogue, underdevelopment of villain characters, and a general lack of energy, Spider-Man 3 becomes the very thing it was toted never to be: an utterly horrid film experience. And any positive elements are so far and few, that they themselves cannot effectively be of any help. Spider-Man 3 attempts to be two films, but only proves to be half the potential of one.<br/><br/>--- revised short version ---"
"das417","6","2","5","5 May 2007"," The worst of the three movies, Spider-man 3 fails in almost every way
","Spider-Man was released in 2002 to much fan fare and excitement. One of the biggest movies of that year, it couldn't help but create a sequel which was just as popular if not more so. Spider-Man became the latest of a series of movie sequels where ticket sales were driven up by excitement over every planned sequel. Spider-Man 3, rumored to be the last in the series, will most likely make as much, if not more, then the last movie because of die hard movie fans who enjoy seeing the same hero in a new movie.<br/><br/>However, the problem that movie series face is that eventually the series will run out of creativity and direction. Spider-Man 3 is the latest series to end not so much with a bang but with a whimper. Directors and writers can only carry an idea so far before any series becomes dry. Villains, CGI effects, and special effects overall do not entertain if there is no solid story or plot. Spider-Man 3 shows what happens when too much is placed on eye candy and nothing else substantial.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 opens up with the exact opposite of Spider-Man 2. Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) is enjoying the fame that Spider-Man now enjoys from New York as well as high grades at university. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), however, is finding her acting dreams tarnished after being removed from play. Her jealousy over Peter's fame as Spider-Man only makes it worse as Peter begins to let such fame go to his head.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn (James Franco) plans his revenge against Peter and eventually confronts him as the New Goblin in a blurry CGI battle that ends with Harry losing his short-term memory and his hatred for Peter. Peter himself takes advantage of this and even though he saves Harry's life he has no plans on reminding him of the past hatred Harry had for him. It almost seems, for a moment, as if his old friend from high school has suddenly returned. <br/><br/>In the background is the rise of Sandman, aka Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a petty criminal who finds himself altered after a particle experiment. Driven to find money that would cure his daughter, Flint is later discovered to be the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and thus drives Peter on a mission of to avenge his uncle's death. Discovering that Flint now has powers of his own makes that mission even more difficult.<br/><br/>As if there wasn't enough conflict already, the arrival of a strange meteor releases an alien life form that later adheres to Peter during sleep one night. Peter finds both his powers, and personality, changed by the life form as he goes from a mild manner individual and hero to one who is more emotionally driven and aggressive in almost every way. Peter's later rejection of the alien leads to it's takeover of Eddie Brock (Toper Grace) who was once a rival at the Daily Bugle until Peter exposes a series of false pictures that ends his short lived journalist career. Using the hatred he has for Peter, the alien transforms Eddie until Venom who as we all know is perhaps the most famous of all Spider-Man villains and one who many wished to see in this movie.<br/><br/>The problem that Spider-Man 3 faces is trying to get all of these sub-plots to end in a quick and nice way. Often it feels rushed and lacks the tension and drama that the last Spider-Man movies had. Peter bounces from one conflict to the next but there is no real satisfactory ending to them. Sandman gives the sob story about his sick daughter before Peter forgives him for his uncle's death, Harry dies after a melodramatic scene that was almost amusing in it's absurdity, and Venom is only in the last half hour in the movie before his death which makes me ask why he was even included. These characters have so much depth built into them that the let down is in the end where we have no real answer to the conflicts they create. Oh, Peter and Mary Jane's relationship appears to heal at the end of the movie though we have no real way of knowing if this is true.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 tries too much at once and suffers because of it. The humor of Peter dancing and trying to hit on women only adds to an air of desperation/bad writing and directing. Too much time is wasted on so many sub-plots that no real stand out plot on it's own is created. Again, resting on villains and CGI is not an excuse to ignore stable plot creation. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 learns this lesson too late.<br/><br/>6/10"
"mariazipetphilange","2","2","5","5 May 2007"," Definitely Not Worth All The Hype.
","I will admit that like every other person I shelled out to go see Spider-Man 3 so I wouldn't be left out of the loop. However, even though my expectations were low, I was still disappointed by this movie. I'm not even sure exactly why I was disappointed but I noticed that there was something wrong with it.<br/><br/>The parts that I know that I was upset about were when Harry died and when Peter decided that all of a sudden he'd dye his hair black, or at least it looked that way, and become another Emo kid. The dance was extended for way too long and I found myself laughing at the scene than with it.<br/><br/>But, I did like Eddie Brock and the further development of Harry Osborn in this film. Not to mention Bruce Campbell's part as Maître d'. Venom wasn't used until the end of the film which made me feel cheated. Coming from someone who really likes Venom. <br/><br/>Overall, it made me feel like I was scammed out of my money. Definitely not even close to the genius that was the first two Spider-Man's. <br/><br/>So take my advice and save your money, folks."
"kstina5","5","2","5","4 May 2007"," Just When You Think We're Safe...
","Another politically charged ""kid's"" movie. This time, for the more conservative crowd. Spiderman has always been a stand up guy, ""with power comes responsibility"" and all that. Peter Parker is consumed with low self esteem and guilt, but it works for him. Except here.<br/><br/>Midway, or maybe 2/3 of the way, through this unnecessarily long movie Peter Parker/Spiderman becomes some Hollywood version of emo. His hair is darker, he's dressed in all black. His bangs even graze over one eye like that guy from that band. The typically shy Parker becomes a ""suave"" flirt, and a, how can I put this, daring dancer. *OVER OBVIOUS MESSAGE TO KIDS* emo is BAD children, now cut your hair and get some nice clothes. PS-the symbiote that causes the emo craze is thwarted by ringing sounds...kinda like music...I found it ironic.<br/><br/>How 'bout something red, white, and blue? Kinda like the flag our forefathers fought to protect. You know, the one behind Spiderman once he comes out of the throws of emoness-er-the symbiote, I mean. *OVER OBVIOUS MESSAGE TO KIDS* being American makes you better than everyone else! Besides the glaring conservative messages, this movie is just too full. There's three villains (if the symbiote counts once for Spidey and Venom), five plot lines, and erroneous dance numbers. I would have rather sat through a Spiderman 4 than this ""epic"" monstrosity. The fight scenes are spectacular. Hints from movies such as ""The Mummy"" and ""The Grudge"" come to mind. Digital is wonderful.<br/><br/>In a discussion during the ride home after wards I realized that while FLASH! BANG! is cool to watch, it doesn't beat characterization, plot, and heart. Isn't that what superheroes are all about in the first place?"
"SourGreenapple42","5","2","5","4 May 2007"," Some good thrills, but not as strong as the first two..
","The 3rd installment shows our hero (and apparently others as well) in many different situations. Many which are visually stunning. However, a number of questions are brought up. The biggest one that came up in my mind was why is this relevant to the story in the first place? The plot has Parker dealing with 3 villains this time. Harry Osbourne (of course), but in addition, there are 2 new villains. This is where the problem begins to unfold. The first new villain is called ""The Sandman"", an escaped convict who gets trapped into a sand experiment, and develops super natural powers that involve sand (Hmm, we've never seen scenario this in the first two...). This is the most visually amusing part of the movie, and Thomas Haden's acting is very good (he looks so big you could barely tell it's him), ironically this is probably the least relevant villain. We don't find out what his motives are. He doesn't want to destroy the world, nor does he want to actually kill Peter Parker, it doesn't seem he has much relation to the trilogy is. However, we find out in the beginning that he was the man who murdered uncle Ben in reality, which is the perfect plot device to throw him in (though this does impact a fairly good message at the end, though I won't go into that.<br/><br/>The 2nd villain is called Venom. He is somewhat more relevant to Parker's daily life, but the problem here is turning him into a villain. He is originally portrayed as the goofy, nerdy photographer competing with Parker for a job. A good role that seems fine and well fit for a comedic and likable actor like Topher Grace. He is humorous, and inept of course. It seems awfully awkward to see him become the villain later on in the movie. How does he become one? Well, we find out there is this dark germ of some kind (again, unexplainable), that attacks people and turns them into bad guys. This initially attacks Peter at first, which sets up for an idea ""Superman 3"" practiced over 20 years ago, in which Peter becomes the bad, aggressive guy. This sets up for another strange sub-plot, including Peter becoming the lady's man, as well as ruining other people's lives, which in turns leads to trouble for him later on.<br/><br/>It doesn't end there! The movie puts in even more sub plots! Mary Jane and Peter's relationship is focused in here, and is tempted by Peter kissing Topher Grace's girlfriend, and Mary Jane as a failed Broadway actress, as well as a love affair between Mary Jane and Harry. Harry also suffers from long term memory loss, which makes him forget Peter killed his father, but only for a while.<br/><br/>Are you lost with all these plots? I don't blame you. While not necessarily confusing, the movie has way too many pointless plots. As previously stated, there doesn't seem to be so much of a major conflict. After a while, you start to realize why the first two are so much better. They stick to one plot, and make it easier to follow and build on. It is hard for them to maintain a good plot and good characterizations with so many things going on, especially when these things are short and irrelevant to the plot. It lacks depth, and innovation.<br/><br/>Now, the positive with the movie. It has it's ups, for sure. It is visually very well made, with great special effects, and good action scenes. They actually do make you root for the characters. This really does save the movie from tanking all the way. It makes a 2/10 movie, into a 5/10 movie. The effects in the scenes, really do make you root for characters, and keeps you on the edge, even if plot isn't so great. It also has a very good sense of humor, equally, or maybe even funnier then the first two.<br/><br/>However, the best part of the 3rd film, is it's ending, and message. Now, I can't say what happens, but it takes an ultimately non-violent resolution and has a good message with forgiveness and doesn't take the typical, cheesy violent action packed way out (I won't tell you what happens though). This also does really help the overall impact of the movie.<br/><br/>At it's best, ""Spider Man 3"" is visually effective, humorous, and thrilling. At it's worst, it is clichéd, uneven, overlong, overly complex, abstract and formulaic. It ultimately can't top the first 2, and it is somewhat disappointing, though it is a decent movie.<br/><br/>I give it 5/10."
"XAEEM","10","2","5","4 May 2007"," Best of the three but not flawless! :D
","This was a brilliant piece of entertainment, it had drama, romance, horror, thriller, adventure, action and comedy (lots of it).<br/><br/>The film starts slow, putting the audience up close to the characters, getting us used to them again and putting us in their world and their family to help us understand their bond. Then the action is kick started and we get a glimpse of how good the next action scenes are going to be. <br/><br/>James Franco gives a very good performance as angry/evil Harry, i was surprised that such a young actor could be that convincing, though for a few split seconds i did think he was over acting.<br/><br/>Tobey is even better in this one than in the previous films, you actually believe that he's a grown up peter parker and that he's not so much of a nerd anymore and he's coming to terms with his identity. He plays the arrogant part very well as well.<br/><br/>Tobey (again) when 'possessed' by the symbiotic goo is again very convincing, you can see a total change of character while still getting glimpses of the underlying 'regular' peter parker. He excels in the scenes where he has to be 'bad'.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst wasn't all that good as her eyes don't seem to act much, her face has pretty much a basic set of expressions except when she cries. Wasn't happy with her but it was forgivable seeing as she played the distraught actress part quite well.<br/><br/>Church was wasted i think, he was SO good in the few scenes he had as normal flint Marco, i wish they'd shown more of him in human form.<br/><br/>Grace was wasted as well, not enough screen time, he definitely could NOT have been a main and only villain but he should have had as much screen time as Church did so as to establish his back story, not enough was done in that respect n i was disappointed.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard was very pleasant on the eyes as Gwen but again her and parker's relationship could have been explored further.<br/><br/>Now back to the actual on screen eye candy. Spiderman in regular costume was relegated to the background, his scenes do stand out but not because of his acrobatics but more due to whats going on around him (crane scene in trailer is brilliant). Sandman, especially the birth of sandman scene is a beauty to watch, the sand flowing with the wind, and taking Flint Marko's shape. The special effects were really well done and i do think this film deserves an award for the CGI. Venom is TOO scarce, in the short scenes that we do see him, he is amazing, the face, the tongue, the teeth, the eyes and the muscular body, even his webbing, They hit the bullseye as far as his design is concerned, I'm a big venom fan and i am very happy with the outcome of the venom design. Topher's squeaky voice is kinda weird when seeing him talk as venom but he still does look like he's enjoying being 'bad'. What annoyed me was the fact that he became more of a gimmick and had very limited lines as venom. They could have done so much more with him.<br/><br/>The comedy in this film will blow you away. Entertainment at its purest, i haven't laughed this hard since SO long. The dance sequences and the 'aloof' peter parker are so funny & enjoyable to watch and provide good relief from the sometimes heavy drama parts of the film.<br/><br/>J Jonah Jameson's scenes also provide great comic relief especially when he's trying to control his anger, that was a hilarious moment and the whole audience cracked up during those scenes.<br/><br/>Im not going to say more as i don't want to spoil it but just so you know the ending is satisfying and ties up a lot of loose ends from the previous films and it also gives a sense of where things are going to go if they ever make a 4th film.<br/><br/>Some parts do seem to be a bit too emotionally charged, some not enough and there is also the feel that some key scenes may have been edited out as far as character relationships are concerned although if you watch closely you can guess what happened just before the current scene. <br/><br/>All in all, the best of the trilogy for me, i always preferred spider-man 1, but this one is now my favourite. Im actually more of a batman fan but i just love what Sam Raimi did with this franchise and I'm sure as hell going to buy the DVD when it comes out. Im planning on seeing this again in the next few weeks!"
"KnowOne1988","9","2","5","4 May 2007"," Best one yet
","This movie has a lot of irony in it. If you listen to the beginning dialog and then look at what actually happens in the end you will see how truly ironic this film is. I like the trilogy because it gives the audience a sense of closure. It doesn't leave you with on answered questions. This movie has all the necessary genius in the world to be the best comic book movie to date. This movie had a bit of everything. At times i was holding my stomach from laughter, and other times i was wiping my tears away from crying. In my opinion the third Spider-man triumphed over the rest. The visuals alone were amazing, even brilliant at times. This movie is highly recommend to anyone who wants to be visually stimulated and impressed beyond belief.."
"Mr_Prowse","7","2","5","4 May 2007"," look past the negative reviews and see it for the good movie it is
","First off, I will say that I walked out of Spider-Man 3 half-happy, half-sad. Though it was quite a great movie, I don't think it lives up to the greatness of Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>But most movies can't live up to Spider-Man 2 either. Besides Batman Begins, it is probably the great comic book movie of all time. Most people will go into this movie expecting it to top the last one and when it doesn't they will think it sucks.<br/><br/>Trust me, it doesn't. Spider-Man 3 has more emotional depth than the second and it boasts one of the greatest third acts of an action movie I have ever seen. True, it is uneven at times and there is a slight feeling of it being too much plot for one movie.<br/><br/>But in the end, it all works. You just have to let it grow on you. The evil Spider-man storyline is amazing, and every villain is emotionally complex. Not to mention that Raimi actually takes the time in this action-filled movie to deliver some real human drama for the characters.<br/><br/>There is a large comedy element to the film, and some people might feel that it's out of place but that is the way that Spider-Man is in the comics. It's meant to be funny.<br/><br/>So to all those that do not like Spider-Man 3, watch it again with a new outlook. You might find it's better than you first thought."
"windcriesmary","8","2","5","4 May 2007"," A Moving, Epic Film
","If this is the final Spider-Man film we'll see in some time, I can honestly say that it is a satisfying conclusion. Sam Raimi has done so well with the previous two films, that many have had doubts that he would be able to top himself with this one. He has done it. Spider-Man 3 is the best Spider-Man film thus far.<br/><br/>After the movie finished, I heard a big majority of the audience say the same thing: ""It was horrible"". We must have seen different movies, because to call Spider-Man 3 ""horrible"" is a tremendous mistake. The reasons as to why they thought it was ""horrible"" varied. One was because ""Spidey got his butt kicked too much"" or because ""too much attention was paid to the visual effects and not enough attention was paid to the story as a whole"". Both statements are inaccurate.<br/><br/>Spider-Man, in my eyes, is one of the most real superheroes of our time. He's a young guy with problems inside and outside the costume. Even when he's behind the mask, he experiences problems. Villains hurt him, buildings sometimes get destroyed, but ultimately, he comes through. For someone to say that Spidey got his ""butt kicked too much"" is ridiculous. After all, Peter Parker is still human; Spider-Man is Peter Parker, Peter Parker is Spider-Man.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, I felt as though it was the most moving and deep story lines of all three movies. Peter seems to have it all, the love of the people when he is Spider-Man, success in school, and of course, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson. But just like any normal person, he's got his share of problems too. For one, Flynt Marko wants Spider-Man dead. Eddie Brock might take his job, Mary Jane is getting tired of his ego, and Harry Osbourne is still dead set on avenging his father's death. The course in which these events unfold really does a great job in pulling the viewer in, and keeping them there.<br/><br/>No one is perfect, but that's just the way life is. You make the right decisions though, and things will come together. This is the main message behind Spidey 3.<br/><br/>There's action, comedy, romance, but most importantly, a deeper meaning. Pay attention, and you'll take away a lot more than just a fun 2 hours and 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Hats off to Sam Raimi and everyone else involved in Spider-Man 3. This one steals the show."
"al-605","9","2","5","4 May 2007"," This one remains somewhere between the first two...
","First of all, the obvious: Sam Raimi is an excellent director, the special effects are amazing, and pretty much everything that made the first two films amazing is what makes this one just as enjoyable.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, since we all already know what makes the Spider-Man movies GOOD, we should really pick out what made this one almost not. There are THREE MAIN STORY THINGS I had a problem with. And they are...<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* 1) You've heard this by now: there's a lot going on in this movie. And even though it all ties together, that still doesn't mean it didn't feel crowded, and I kept thinking of ways they could've condensed some plot elements for the sake of more action; I'm mainly thinking with the Mary-Jane/Harry subplot. Scenes could've been combined or even just cut, saving around 15 minutes for another duel or something (I'm not a brainless action freak, but this IS a Spider-Man movie, right?).<br/><br/>2) I really wanted Venom to be introduced sooner, so we could see more of him in action (which could have happened if my first point was met as well). I'm not one of the comic book fan boys who demands source purity all the way, but I still thought the dropping of the meteor to introduce the symbiote almost felt like a writer's cop out. It's literally just dropped into the story. There's one take in the ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" comics that suggests the symbiote was made in a lab on earth... they couldn't have used that here? And the death of Eddie destroys any possibility of a huge fourth-film face-off, which I kept hyping to be the point of Venom's short outing in this installment, but now found I was wrong. He was merely viewed as a supporting role in the eyes of Raimi *sigh*. Part of me believes he was adequately used when looking at the bigger picture of the three films, but if they're making a fourth, WHY KILL HIM NOW??<br/><br/>3) Finally, I didn't have a problem with Spider-Man forgiving Sandman for the murder of his uncle (some vengeful-minded viewers may have, as I heard a few ""whhaaat?""s in the theatre), and I thought it made for good character on Peter's behalf. That said, he should have at least struggled a lot more with the decision at the time of Sandman's end speech before forgiving him, just to make for good cinema. <br/><br/>AGAIN, THIS REVIEW WAS JUST TO POINT OUT MY THREE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH IT.<br/><br/>And when you think about it, that's not too bad for the movie if that's all I have to complain about! It was highly entertaining, however, because of the problems I mentioned, I feel that Spidey 3 lies between the first two films, just because the second film was just so perfectly crafted. Number 2 remains the best in my opinion (and that seems to be the general consensus, too), but that doesn't mean this film is bad. GO SEE IT!!"
"hickey-p","6","2","5","4 May 2007"," Spidy 3... The huge let down
","I am a huge Spidey fan... I have been reading his comics for awhile and have drawn a few pictures of him in the past and hope to do more in the future. I was ecstatic when the movie was coming out just to see what tricks the hero would do. I saw bits and pieces of the movie through trailers and caught a sniff at Vemon I was nuts, Venom is the ultimate villain in the Spidey-verse. Then I noticed the things that the Black suit Spidey that wasn't similar to the comics. For instance...<br/><br/>1... J.J.'s son was supposed to bring back the creature from the moon, but instead they had it fall from space in a meteorite. We were introduced to J.J.'s son in the second for a brief time and then he got the big old boot in the third. If you are going to introduce him to the fans try to keep him around for awhile.<br/><br/>2... The suit, why wasn't it like in the comics, being a one-piece suit and with the huge white spider in the front and the white patches on the back of the hands? Where were they?? It looked liked Peter dipped the regular suit in a vat of black in and the color stayed. Venom should have had the same thing. AND WHERE THE HELL WAS THE Tongue ACTION!! THAT WAS VENOM'S SIGNATURE AND THE WHOLE ""WE"" THING? <br/><br/>3... Villains. If you are going to have a movie with a superhero you need villains. Yes Spidey has some awesome villains, but if they are going to keep killing them where does that leave you? Sandman got away only after he had a change of heart. The only villain that I see that will maybe stick around is the Reptile. Why, because Peter would never let anything happen to his beloved professor.<br/><br/>I think the directors dropped the ball on this one, I hope that they make a fourth movie but leave some of the villains in the universe to keep the story interesting. Carnage better stay in the films if he is introduced, but not before the little bit of the black goo escapes and finds someone else that Peter has hurt, and Venom is revived.<br/><br/>The graphics and CGI were the only really cool things in the movie as well as some of the action."

","This movie was anticipated by all scifi/comic books fans, but in my humble opinion, it was disappointing. The special effects were OK, but the story lacked substrate, i've got bored watching it. <br/><br/>There were some weak, immature ""funny"" pointers now and then, but no real suspense, no real feeling of the movie, a weak plot, twisting a HUGE part of Spider-Man's comics history into a two and a half hours sub-mediocre nice special effects story. <br/><br/>That's the curse of the sequels, the 99.9% of them go from bad to worse. <br/><br/>It really is a kids film, with no real drama, and with a big happy cartoonish end. <br/><br/>If you are a BIG fan of the ""brand"" or if you just want to see what new cool effects can be done, then go watch it, otherwise don't waste your time and money on this.<br/><br/>You'd have a better kick out of a Spider-Man TV cartoon then watching this movie."

I usually give movies a big benefit of the doubt just for the fact it takes a lot of work, time, effort and cost to make a movie.<br/><br/>...But it also takes a lot of work to make ME not like a movie, and this one did a pretty good job at that.

"freaky28962","5","2","5","4 May 2007"," Why was this film released?
","Worst Spiderman yet. The whole film just made me angry and disappointed. I can't say that it's a rubbish film, but compared to the other two, it's just plain horrible. The music is poor and in several places it's highly inappropriate. The action is quite standard, nothing really original and exciting. The effects are great, especially on sandman, but it's hard to appreciate them with the constant dodgy camera angles. For some reason the majority of the film is done with free hand camera work so the smooth flowing action scenes are a thing of the past. Venom isn't in it enough. The actions of the character are often pretty unexplainable. Dialogue is seriously cheesy. I don't know why it has been allowed to be released, it has ruined the series for me. I just wish someone would had watched it first and said ""No. Not good enough. Go back and do it again."""

Mr Maguire, no offense, but that wasn't the least bit convincing.<br/><br/>I would have love to see the alien thing creep up and form the suit, rather than become the suit. Also, too much emphasis on Sandman and not sufficient time for Venom. Venom would have been the better villain."

","Overall this movie was not worth seeing at midnight for the opening night. Go see it once in theaters for the special effects. we all know that this kind of movie was meant to be just action and acting was always meant to be cheesy, but this was just awful. there was one too many villains for this movie, they could have done without the sandman and just developed venom more. there wasn't as much action though as the previous 2 films. i love spiderman, i read the comics and know all the stories and backgrounds on almost all the characters. the characters needed to be developed more, it felt like they were trying to squeeze 2 movies into one and they rushed through the rest of the movie. the whole emo bit was stupid and crap. they tried too hard while making this film. i hope that they can redeem themselves in spiderman 4. i did enjoy the trailer for Harry Potter 5 though."
"john_murdoch2002","5","2","5","4 May 2007"," A Disappointing Follow-Up
","Watching Spider-Man 3 the other night simply reminded me of the old saying too many cooks spoil the broth. Such is the case with this movie, where there are so many plot lines that it would make for an incredible movie, but in the end, feels like there is really no balance to this outing.<br/><br/>In this outing, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found a balance with his life, able to cope with being Spider-Man, a dutiful lover to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), an excelling college student and a capable worker as a photographer for a newspaper. Yet this newfound balance has gone to his head as Parker starts to become self-focused, turning a blind eye to the suffering of Mary Jane, who's received some pretty scathing reviews from her first major Broadway production.<br/><br/>This newfound selfishness doesn't help much when Parker learns that his father's real killer wasn't the one who died in front of him in the first part, but was a man named Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who, through pretty bizarre circumstances, becomes the Sandman, a person who's genetic make-up is made entirely of sand. Thirsty for revenge, Parker leaves himself open to a symbiote that crashed down to earth and attached itself to him, amplifying his powers through his anger.<br/><br/>Throw in a story about a wanna-be photojournalist Eddie Brock, who is developing a hatred for Peter Parker, a model named Gwen Stacey who makes Mary Jane jealous, and Harry Osborne, who experiences a temporary memory loss (typical in most comic book story lines) and feels Peter is still his best friend, all vengeful thoughts put aside. Any one of these stories, heck, even any two of these stories, would make for a great and fun summer flick, but with the movie being a trim two hours and twenty minutes (I use the term trim loosely because for all the story lines, it should be longer for the audience to have a sense of closure by the end), feels a tad rushed and convoluted whereas it follows up a brilliant sequel that took it's time to develop it's story, relate all of it's characters and give them all a good climax for their stories by the end.<br/><br/>Here, Spider-Man 3 simply seems like a bad stew, many enjoyable moments, some funny scenes (particularly one with a maitre'd who everyone should recognize), and some convincing performances, most notably from Kirsten Dunst this time around, who brings a humanity to Peter Parker's love interest, something that seemed missing from the first two parts. But with all of these ingredients, they never really blend together and the movie simply collapses under the weight of it's numerous story lines.<br/><br/>While still a good slice of summer fun, Spider-Man 3 fails to live up to it's predecessor, which was near cinematic perfection, transcending the genre of super-hero movie to becoming a thoughtful character piece. Here, the movie is simply fun, but don't look for the emotional delivery the second one had. Just sit back, enjoy the ride and don't get too attached to any characters because by the time you do, the movie will sling to another one of it's layered story lines."
"oneloveall","6","2","5","4 May 2007"," Technical proficiency will amend a disjointed plot
","Continuing this franchise like clockwork, Sam Raimi again starts off just like the others with Tobey Maguire beginning his introduction monologue. Fulfilling it's obligatory requirements in spades, Spider-Man 3 continues to provide enough action, romance, drama, and comedy to justify another family outing. This time around though, mostly in place of a steady narrative lies the littered extracts of multiple threads tied together. In place of one encompassing conflict, the compacted screenplay attempts to mold no less then three of Spider-Man's enemies into this action extravaganza. For better or worse this will make or break the film for fans. Different concentration on Spidey's multiple adversaries lends well to keeping a diverse set of cutting edge fight sequences on hand, probably outshining any of the visceral memories from the last two films. But in fragmenting his attention amongst the different villains, Raimi (who this time was actually involved in writing the script) never really brings a worthwhile conflict to the fore, instead indulging crowds with an assortment of spectacular though mostly insignificant brawls. The technology behind capturing these heated battles has obviously never been better, as always there are plenty of moments that beg to be witnessed on a theater screen, but the overall impression is a bunch of fabulous, adrenaline pumping scenes that do not add up to cohesive whole.<br/><br/>Still, it may be for that very indulgence that the film is as successful as it will most likely be. Whereas in the past I felt perhaps too much time was spent on completely clichéd wisdom, taking Parker's struggles to an unnecessary pulpit of sorts, this time around the heavy-handed dialog seemed toned down a bit, more in touch with web-slinging roots that dominate the visuals. Yes, there is another trial Parker must face within himself as he continues to identify the real person he thinks he is, but this time psychological undertones do not drown out Spider-Man's intended purpose, which would be to dazzle.<br/><br/>And dazzle it does, cutting through much of the generic repetition with some of the finest CGI technical work to date. Exemplifying the quality design this team has become known for, right from the start it is apparent the action will definitely be trying to one-up some tough predecessors. From the film's first breakneck action sequence, Raimi shows his phenomenal talent for directing at high speeds, and puts forth some truly exciting chases. Along with Maguire's newfound pleasure in taking this little walk to the dark side, lies the heart and soul of another box office smash. Raimi is just able to ink out another worthwhile story from these mostly reused elements between spectacular confrontations, fittingly ending this trilogy on an appropriate, if obvious note. One does wonder what he will have left to say, if rumors hold true and Spider-Man is given a second trio of films; most characters just feel used up from this point out."
"jaredmobarak","6","2","5","4 May 2007"," I'd give my life for themSpider-Man 3
","So here it is, the final piece to the Raimi/Maguire trilogy of superheroes and love conquering all. The first two installments in the franchise helped rejuvenate the comic book movie, making them be taken seriously and showing that a little imagination surrounded by the real world could create suspense, action, and heart. Spider-Man 3 had a lot of expectations to live up to, and not just to be cohesive and complete with three villains and a couple new faces on the side. I know I myself went into the film to see whether Sam Raimi and company could round the story out and keep true to what had come before. By the end, while not completely satisfied and somewhat letdown at times, I found that I could still come out with a smile. The arcs of our principal characters come to a close and the presentation is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, with all the spectacle, money, and talent going into it, I just wished it would have stayed truer in tone and brought a little more to the table.<br/><br/>First off, the acting is fantastic as usual; if nothing else, the trio of films showed that comic book films didn't need to be campy. Tobey Maguire proves again why he was, and is, the only choice to play the titular role. If Sony backs up their statements that a fourth go is in store with or without him, I may join the masses in boycotting it and taking a stand for artistic credibility rather than financial gain. Even when Maguire needed to ham it up (more on this later), he is the perfect mixture of geek and cool to pull it off perfectly. Kirsten Dunst does well again, showing some emotion in what is more simply a damsel-in-distress role than the previous films and James Franco is good also. Franco needs to show some huge range going from villain to amnesiac happy-go-lucky kid, and while he goes a tad overboard on the giddiness, the part works. As for the newcomers, Raimi shows once again that he has some clout and Hollywood cred, assembling one of the biggest casts with people doing very little. Bryce Dallas Howard is little more than a pawn at the expense of the plot and James Cromwell is a blink and you'll miss him blip on the screen. Even our new villains are given much less screen time than anticipated, however, they step it up and really steal the show.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church truly inhabits the inner conflicted soul of Sandman. Everything he does is for love and while he may not want to do some things, he has no problem doing them if it may bring him closer to his daughter. Church gives a layered and nuanced performance, never falling into the one-dimensional villain trap a character like this usually does. As for the long awaited arrival of Venom, Topher Grace shows why he deserves the big budget roles to go along with his more accomplished indie porfolio. The malice and manic hysteria that comes out of him is both fun and frightening and he becomes an enjoyable foe to our hero. Along with the superb acting, we are given some spectacular visual effects. While some set pieces and background animation at many times looks cartoony and unpolished, you cannot fault the sandwork or the alien symbiote creature. The amount of detail taken on these two villains definitely shows where the enormous budget went, and it is good to see it was used to great effect.<br/><br/>Where the film ultimately falls apart, in my opinion, is with the story itself. This is the first of the trilogy not to have a comic book mythology veteran behind the script. With most coming from Raimi himself and his brother, it shows a bit of a lack of stakes that the previous two had. Instead we are given a complete tonal change and a ton of slapstick and comedic moments. Some sequences, like that of Maguire dancing through the streets, confidence oozing from him due to the symbiote, really slow the film down to a crawl. The movie tries at too many times to be cute and while this might work to offset the dark and suspenseful moments in other films, Spider-Man 3 doesn't really have many rough spots to counteract. Sure the fight scenes are spectacular, but they just lack the sense of urgency from the past installments, always keeping the viewer removed from what is happening, just waiting for the heroes to be victorious. What started as a dark tale of heroism and the battle of one's own demons, with the first two chapters, concludes in a very heavy-handed and sentimental way.<br/><br/>By no means am I not recommending this film thoughI enjoyed it throughout and only in a few instances did I feel its length. It is just that with the second part upping the ante like it did from its already great predecessor, I was disappointed that this final chapter ended up being the least successful of the three. Maybe it was because so much was happening and it all had to be resolved in one film, maybe it was that this is possibly the last Spider-Man from Raimi and he needed to end it all on his terms, I don't know. What I do know, though, is that the writing is not as intelligent as it was and sappiness, along with unintentional laughs, sometimes made me cringe. However, when the fighting started and emotions ran high, you can't not be caught up in it allat least until the dust settles."

","I came in with very high expectations for this film. I thought the character development in the first two films were brilliant and enjoyed the second movie over the first one.<br/><br/>My thoughts on the third film was that this tried too hard to be so many different kinds of films. I will try not to put any spoilers into it. The film was formulaic and was full of many predictable plot points and chock full of hokey clichés. This like the Schumacher Batman sequels tried to implement too many character onto screen and could have been trimmed significantly. The visual effects were brilliant, and the acting was on par with the rest of the series, it just didn't hold the same emotional impact on me as the other did. There were also some plot holes. Perhaps I will enjoy it more on a second viewing when it comes to DVD. As of now the hype and expectations from the previous films have cast too big a shadow on this film for me. Spider-Man 3 isn't necessarily a bad movie, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. The plot could have been made into two movies if this was re-cut it could have helped it by making it Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 4. It was just too much for one movie. 6 out of 10."
"chimera-4","5","2","5","3 May 2007"," Disappointing actually
","I don't get it. Same actors, same director, the writers I don't know about but I really felt this was a huge disappointment. It feels rushed, spread too thin with too many villains and the emotional content of the first two that gave them their impact is gone. <br/><br/>The movie feels really uneven and they totally screwed up Venom which was the guy I waited nearly 2 hours to see. Venoms origin was handled OK but I HATED the way the actors face would pop through the CGI to taunt Spider-Man and basically deliver crap one liners. The first two Spider-Man movies were better than that. In the end I couldn't care less about Venom which I felt was a total missed opportunity though the look of the symbiote was spot on. Likewise Sandman, an OK origin scene, some totally lame subplot about his sick daughter thats supposed to make us give the guy some sympathy and then a totally unnecessary huge monster sandman of the week creature at the end. These guys should have admitted they'd run out of ideas and farmed the job out to someone that gave a sh*t.<br/><br/>The actors all seem like they've really had enough in this movie and likewise the direction felt lazy and rushed. To be honest Venom should probably have been left for another day, or one of the bad guys anyway. I did like how the Peter/Harry/MJ story came to an end but again it felt rushed and kind of convenient for the rest of the plot. The action scenes though were well done and give the movie it's more memorable moments but without a good solid narrative you can get behind to gel them together they're just little more than empty spectacle.<br/><br/>Why can't we have a live action spider-man series instead so we can flesh these stories and characters out a bit more.<br/><br/>Anyway I hope they pull their finger out with Spider-Man 4."
"baixiwei","4","2","5","3 May 2007"," Worst of the franchise
","*** SPOILERS *** OK this movie is not bad if you're only here for the eye candy, although in that respect I didn't find it in any way superior to Spider-man 2. (In particular I found the FX for Sandman pretty lame - if I wanted to see a big monster storming around bashing buildings, I'd watch Godzilla or King Kong instead.) I rate it 4 out of 10 because most people can do eye candy nowadays.<br/><br/>What I am looking for in a movie like this is compelling conflicts leading to dazzling fight scenes. This movie failed first of all because the conflicts were far too contrived to be compelling, and secondly because said contrivance wasted far too much screen time. I mean if you can only come up with some lame excuse why some guys are going to fight, then get it over with quickly and spend more time fighting.<br/><br/>Why not compelling? OK, let's see what are the major conflicts in the movie: <br/><br/>1. Spider-Man versus Sandman. The guy who is his uncle's real killer just happens to have remained anonymous until now (reasons unexplained), just happens to escape from prison at this time, just happens to be given superhuman powers, just happens to rob a bank just next to where Spider-man is having a press conference ... I don't really see any difference between that and just having a voice over saying ""Now Spider-man is going to fight a guy who can turn into sand because I said so"", except that the latter would get us to the fight scenes quicker.<br/><br/>2. Spider-man versus Venom. I admit I'm prejudiced against Venom because I consider him virtually the stupidest villain in the comic book. But leaving that out of it, a meteor just happens to land right next to Spider-man? Out comes a black substance which just happens to be able to change into clothing? (I mean OK it's a comic book movie, but you could at least give an explanation?) The guy who Peter Parker screws out of a job just happens to have a girlfriend in his physics class, allowing for a contrived opportunity to increase his enmity due to said girlfriend being stolen? Spider-man just happens to rip off his suit in the exact same place where said guy is praying for revenge? The guy just happens to see his face even though he's way up in the bell-tower, allowing ""Brock vs. Parker"" to transition smoothly into ""Venom vs. Spider-man""? <br/><br/>3. Spider-man versus New Goblin. OK, this conflict actually had a basis in the previous movies, so far so good. But it gets lost in the twisty turny passageways of the script. Now Harry is trying to kill Spider-man. Now he's not - memory loss! Now he is again - memory returned! Now he's trying to steal his girlfriend first, OK plot-wise acceptable, but I don't watch superhero movies for their love triangles. Whole build-up of relationship problems between Peter and MJ seems engineered solely to make it more plausible that MJ would be stolen by Harry - who just happens to be an enemy of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>4. Peter Parker versus MJ. See above. This whole aspect of the story does not stand on its own and is there only to add artificial emotional weight to the Spider-man story."

"powerfull_jedi","5","2","5","3 May 2007"," Spidey runs out of steam
","Since the movie only comes out in the US tomorrow, I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum. I waited a long time for this movie for mainly 2 reasons: because it's a Spiderman movie and it would feature for the first time, a live-action portrayal of the fan-favourite villain, Venom. We get that and 2 extra villains, the Sandman and the new Green Goblin, sounds neat right? Well...<br/><br/>Make no mistake, I had fun watching this movie, however I can't hide my disappointment over some things. Comparing the 3 movies, number 3 comes out better then number 1, but it pales in comparison to movie number 2.<br/><br/>The good part is that visual effects are top notch(they've certainly made Venom look fearsome and not goofy as some feared, Sandam also looks pretty good), the action is good enough and some of the gags are top-notch. The bad news, however,is when the movie departs from the Spiderman-style goodness to something that somewhere along the lines of a Elektra, Fantastic Four,Ghost Rider and Catwoman(I'm not joking)-style movie. Those scenes will make you cringe, something that's never happened to me before in a Spiderman movie. While the plot serves it's purpose, some plot points are simply contrived. The ending is also sligthly anti-climactic.<br/><br/>It's been a full year since I last reviewed this movie, yet sadly I can't help but too feel disappointed.<br/><br/>Since the movie is well known to the public here's a more detailed spoiler-loaded review. Our friendly neighbour Spider-Man is now pretty much a full blown hero having earned the respect of the entire NY community. Saddly for some reason, Sam Raimi chooses to focus on Mary Jane's carrer troubles with an actress whom I feel has worn out her welcome. Saddly, that's how felt in the entire movie, the actors look and feel tired, new characters are introduced with very little for us to root or boo them. One of the main character's death in the end of the movie is clearly saying: ""I'm tired of this!"".<br/><br/>The director probably shouldn't have caved in to fan or studio demands to incorporate a villain to which he doesn't really like, in the end, Venom ends up pretty much like pointless fanservice to which has served his purpose at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>They should've kept Venom for a latter movie setting up a more complex battle, because either way, none of the three villains in the movie have actually any major motivation to fight our hero(well, maybe just the Green Goblin), but as I mentioned before, James Franco must've been too tired to carry on in these types of films.<br/><br/>The story itself, is exceptionally weak and with some rather ambiguous morality issues that even a character like Spiderman should be above.<br/><br/>The story feels very episodic, as if I'm watching 3 episodes of a TV show, none of them very compelling. It doesn't help that once Peter's finished with Harry, we're treated to some very embarrisingly bad and corny scenes of Peter seducing women and dancing around the streets with eye liner make-up. One has to dig deep into the Super hero movie catalogue to find worse scenes then that and frankly I can only think of Catwoman and Batman&Robin.<br/><br/>I've already seen the movie on sale on DVD and not surprisingly enough, it's already at budget price, word of mouth did not have a good impact on Spiderman 3. And Marvel should really get their act together, because as a Spidey fan, I feel burned."

"towards-the-within","6","2","5","3 May 2007"," A 'good' movie. Not a 'good' spidey
","--Possible Spoilers--<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that I am a spiderman fan. Even since I was a young boy about twenty years ago, I've always kept in touch with Spiderman and its various comic adaptations. More or less its had its own variations but some things remained the same, and in my honest opinion, gave our hero its unique taste as compared to other super beings. Making Spiderman more 'mortal', more 'human' in comparison to other famous heroes like Superman and Batman. Villains, were always very important to Spidey's life. Most importantly, Harry's GG and Venom were always his arch-rivals in the comics. Both due to power clashing, but also due to psychological reasons. <br/><br/>The reason for this small intro, is to better explain to me why this movie would be fan to watch as a 'standalone' adaptation, had we not seen the previous two spideys. I think it suffered from the same thing X3 suffered. Too much to tell, too little time, too propagandistic at times that does not befit a hero like spidey (too many messages, too many notations, too much patriotism). Worse of all, it took Spiderman life's most important characters, like MJ, Harry, and Venom and minored them to sidekick level. the movie builds, and builds, and builds up quite efficiently but then it runs out of time. And hurriedly throws everything together. Not explaining a thing about venom neutralizing spider's sense. Not a thing about the depth of Harry's confused state for Peter <br/><br/>(never in my knowledge did such an ending come on Harry. Instead, the two always mind-twisted one another using each one's past traumatic experiences)<br/><br/>Spidey's adaptation of his darker self was a bliss though, and Jona was amazing as always. Pity they didn't' give him more time.<br/><br/>Overall, a 6/10. Too cliché, and too shallow at certain points, but still a spiderman. And at certain moments, performances save the day."

","OK, so I definitely enjoyed this movie, but it really has its flaws. But, personally, I've felt that all the Spidey movies have big flaws. And their biggest weakness is their ability to adhere, in tone at least, to their source material. Spiderman has always had the worst dialog imaginable. Atrocious. In all mediums. And the trend continues here. Cheesy line after cheesy line are a constant source of irritation for me. But, I can get past that. Its other things that I found bothersome, and many things that I found to be fantastic. First, The Bad. When Pete acquires the simbiote (I hope I'm spelling that right) he becomes a much meaner and darker person. Or rather, a bad emo characterization of an actual person. Dancing greasily down the street? Hitting on every woman he sees? What the hell? Cant Raimi & Friends make a genuinely dark character? Apparently not, they turned Pete into some bad Emo band ""I'm 17, depressed and want to kill myself, but only because it sells records"" idiot. This segment of the film lasts for some time, and really drags down the pace. Also, not enough time was devoted to Flint Marko/Sandman. Thomas Hayden Church excels in the role, or the little he's given. Most of his characters time is spent as a hulk-like sandstorm. What little he does have is devoted to the worst writing in the film. Yet, still he pulls it off well. I wish they would have dropped the Emo stuff and spent some time on him. Now, the good. Tobey is good as always, as is the rest of the cast. I even enjoyed Topher Grace as Eddie Brock. The CGI is good, but for the $300,000,000 they pumped into the flick, I was hoping for a little better, but now Im just nit-picking. Venom looks great, and spideys fights with the Goblin are fantastic to say the least. Easily the best action of the film. Overall, this was exactly what I expected. Good, not great with some awful dialog's and some great fights."

","While the first two Spider-Man films from Sam Rami were great, this one does feel like a bit of a step-down. It is good, but it does have its flaws.<br/><br/>The plot, for starters, is a problem. Too many things go on at once, to where it all ties in towards the end. Peter Parker is still continuing his life with college, seeing Mary Jane, and of course, being Spider-Man and saving the city. There is a guy named Flint Marko (played by Thomas Haden Church) who gunned down a man and is on the run from the police. He falls into a particle accelerator that binds him with sand, and transforming him into the Sandman. Peter then finds out the actual killer of his uncle, Ben, was Flint Marko. He then gets nightmares about it, and then this strange creature, known as Symbiote, bonds with Peter and turns him into a bad person. He now must make the biggest decisions of his life now that he has more power than he has ever had.<br/><br/>This was pretty much the main plot. Other stuff added to it is Harry Osborn becomes the New Goblin to avenge his father's death by killing Peter, but he fails and gets amnesia. There is also two new characters, Gwen Stacy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) and Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace), who are in a relationship that later on gets ruined because of Peter being a bad person. Later on, Peter gets the symbiote suit off because he realizes he has been hurting people left and right. He takes it off and it goes on to Eddie Brock, and because Brock is filled with revenge, it turns him into Venom. Peter now must save Mary Jane from being killed and escape the clutches of Sandman and Venom.<br/><br/>The plot is basically the biggest problem of the movie. I know I gave some spoilers, but only to thoroughly tell the plot in detail since there's a lot of stuff going on when really there should of been just at least one or two story-lines.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was Venom. He didn't get much screentime (as he appeared in the last 30 or so minutes of the movie), he didn't look that good (he is supposed to look a lot bigger and stronger, and it looks like he went on a diet here), and Topher Grace wasn't a good choice to play him. He is an alright actor, but for Venom? They should of have a bigger and more intimidating guy to play him. But, oh well...<br/><br/>Another issue I had was Sandman. He just felt unnecessary to have in the movie. Thomas Haden Church did a great job, but Sandman could of just been erased easily from this movie and not make him as Uncle Ben's killer. The guy that Peter let roamed free with the money in the first movie was, to me, the TRUE killer.<br/><br/>One last issue I have with Mary Jane. She was WAY worse here than she was in the second film. Again, it wasn't Kirsten Dunst's fault. But she was incredibly rude to Peter and turned him down after he has saved her in two movies and just treats him badly.<br/><br/>Other than these issues, I can watch Spider-Man 3 and like it for what it is. I do think the special effects and action are really good. The acting from Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Bryce Dallas Howard, J.K Simmons, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church were great. Topher Grace was alright as Eddie Brock, but not as Venom. The pacing is also solid for 2 hrs and 15 mins. I've seen it quite a bit of times. and it always does go fast for me.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man 3 is flawed, but it is good and watchable nonetheless."

","First of all, it was a much more actiony film than the other 2 nets.We've seen two bad characters at the same time one of them is Venom he is a most populer villain in spiderman at the same time added the Sandman it is great.
I like how Sandman story intersects with the uncle Ben<br/><br/>I think I can say the best movie in this series, even my favorite spiderman movie I think"
"T-ZER0","6","2","6","24 August 2019"," Third Movie, Three Villains, Three Times the Danger
","This is the most hated of the trilogy, but I prefer to watch it more than the other two, that's because it plays off what made the other two bad. This is the only film so far that we have Symbiote Spider-Man, and that deserves praise whether you hate it or not. Bryce Dallas Howard is still my favorite Gwen Stacy. Yeah, I said it, she was the prettiest. Better than the Spider-Verse one and better than Emma Stone.<br/><br/>The whole transformation scene of Peter is cringeworthy of course, but this time, it's more hilarious that cringeworthy. The story of Sandman killing Ben Parker could've been handled a lot better, and how Harry found out the truth about his father could've been done better too. But we still get to enjoy Peter going nuts when he fights Sandman. The way he yells at him is so unreal, which makes it hilarious.<br/><br/>Mary Jane still sucks on this movie. Complaining about how Spider-Man kissed Gwen, ""That was our kiss"". Oh, you mean that weird looking kiss in the first film that made me vomit?? Her calling Harry to hang out with him was clearly so she could hit on him, have the other Spider-Man females been as loose as this one?<br/><br/>Peter should've stuck with Gwen (Sorry Eddie! But you need to be a villain!) but of course, he was still in love with MJ. Which of course, is what this trilogy won't get rid of, no matter how dumb it is.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church looks a lot like Sandman from the comics I will say, and I see why people hated this version of Venom. But I don't personally care, the new Venom movie wasn't that good anyway.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is the soundtrack. I LOVE the song ""SIGNAL FIRE"" by Snow Patrol, and it truly is the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>This is the only Spider-Man movie I would probably get on Blu-Ray from the original trilogy, but the others. I would forget."

","This film was release five years ago and it still makes my blood boil. Coming off the back of spiderman two which i thought was one of the best superhero films ever made i thought there was noway they could miss. a great film before it and using one of my fave characters.....VWNOM. The hype for the film was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>from the get go this film is utterly painful the forced patriotism as he poses in front of the American flag .....AGAIN hes done it in every film, give us a break we get it, hes American.<br/><br/>the sandman storyline was so forced, i felt no sympathy for him with his sick daughter, and revisiting the uncle Ben story was so un-needed. Mary Jane, although i am a fan of Miss Dunst this was one of the worst performances I've seen from her. Harry was watchable but still added nothing really to the storyline. the Butler telling him however many years after his fathers death that it was his own glider killed him was such a stupid bit of the plot i actually nearly cried.<br/><br/>onto the thing i was most psyched for the Symbiote. while in, what i shall call goo form, at some points looked very good, others looked like flubbers black cousin and at one point looked like a guys hand in a bin liner. When we met Eddie Brock, immediate thoughts was he was way to weedy. the guys tiny and Brock/venom is meant to be huge. the transformation into venom was brilliantly done and was straight out of the comic / cartoon. loved that part. but when he was venom, again way to small and he was just a black spiderman, ,no trademark white spider no trademark tongue, in fact he just kept peeling the face back so we see Topher Grace with bad vampire teeth talking to us all the time. guys, this is something the spiderman fans have been looking forward to for years. And you have made it nothing like the source material.<br/><br/>now I've been gentle in this review and haven't even mentioned Emo Peter Parker doing the Saturday night fever down the street or dancing in the bar, all ill say on that is this.....how many people worked on this film? and we have to believe at no point did anyone put there hand up and say ""What the hell are we doing here?""<br/><br/>This film was terrible from start to finish apart from the venom transformation for Brock.<br/><br/>but this question still remains, which is the bigger piece of crap....this ....or Batman and Robin?"
"elshikh4","6","2","6","16 December 2010"," Too Many + Too Much = Too Bad !
","_Too many storylines: Spider-Man vs. the thief Flint Marko (after turning into Sandman), Spider-Man vs. the photographer Eddie Brock (after turning into Venom), Spider-Man vs. his friend Harry Osborn (after turning into avenging new Goblin). Spider-Man vs. Spider-man (after turning into evil). Spider-Man vs. his love Mary Jane (after turning her back on him), and Spider-Man vs. The killers of his uncle (after turning around the investigation). That caused a spider web which the movie, and us, fell into for too LONG time (139 minutes to be specific!).<br/><br/>_Too many unnecessary matters: Spider-man deforms his friend's face; while he could have injured him only! The evil photographer is dating the chief of police's daughter; so why is that?! That girl herself, a model, is the chief of police's daughter for what exactly? Spider-man's friend loses his memory?! Ahhh, I know the answer for this one; a cheap way to postpone his battle for later. Right? At least it has a possible answer!<br/><br/>_Too many coincidences: The evil photographer is in the same church that Spider-man goes to randomly, right in the middle of the last's conflict with himself. The chief of police's daughter, that Mary Jane hates, is in the same restaurant that Spider-man goes to, right in the middle of his proposing to Mary Jane. The thief Marko runs from the police into a governmental lap, right in the middle of doing a nuclear experiment. Sandman, in his first attack, hides in a lorry full of sand, which appears accidentally right in the middle of chasing him by the police. A catastrophe hits of all the buildings the one that has the chief of police's daughter, right in the middle of her photo session, and in the exact moment that has her father in the same street too! The old butler, of Spider-man's friend, suddenly gets his memory back, telling his boss the clue which exonerates Spider-man from murdering the father, yet not before being right in the middle of Spider-man's desperate battle with the evil guys. OK, this is not drama anymore, it's unbroken chain of jokes, knowing that I didn't write ALL the list of coincidences that I noticed as well!<br/><br/>_Too many laughs in the wrong places: of course the look upon the friend's face, deformed face, when the old butler remembers, VERY LATE, to say the truth; it's priceless, looking more like ""Do you have any final words before I eat you?!"". However, the bigger moment is when Spider-man goes to see his old buddy dies, saying: ""Hello pal, how are you doing?!"" OH MY GOD, I erupted in laughter! Now here's the one that you nearly killed his father, stole his love, caused him a memory lose, deformed his face, and he got stabbed instead of you, to die miserably, and you just come to him with a very VERY stupid smile upon your face, saying happily; ""Hello pal, how are you doing""???!!! This has to be the greatest unintentional comic moment in history. Strangely, the true ""intentional"" comic moments in the movie (the editor in chief's secretary, the restaurant's receptionist,..) were totally unfunny!<br/><br/>_Too much repetition: didn't you notice that in all Spider-man's movies to date, the third act HAS to be about kidnapping Mary Jane??!! What about aunt May for god's sake?! Kidnap the hag for once you fools!<br/><br/>_Too much silliness: and naturally I mean every single second that has Tobey Maguire on screen, and the matter of killing the first thief that attacked Spider-man's uncle, how Spidey would get away with that? Ahh, blame it on the black evil material I guess!<br/><br/>_Too much disbelieving: a loose metal pillar can pull down *floors* in a skyscraper?? Many CG images were so fake and childish. And I, Ahmed Abd Alreheem; a simple human being from Egypt, declare it, as high as a scream: If the entire world believes, I DON'T BELIEVE, during 3 movies already, that the man behind the mask IS Tobey Maguire! Terrible matter in a superhero movie to know, all the time, that the hero isn't super at all!<br/><br/>Although I loved the special effects of the moving evil material; especially the scene with the car hanged over a building by endless black rubber-like ropes, and the sincerity towards the oldies on the soundtrack; with ""I'm Through with Love"", ""Stormy Weather"", ""L-O-V-E"",.. etc. But compared to all of the above, this is too little!<br/><br/>It's clear that the movie wanted to deliver an action scene for every 7 minutes, and it did. It's clear that it wanted to make a Spider-man epic, and it did an inflated, so ridiculous, and forced one. And it's clear why the makers of the (Superhero Movie) chose Spider-man to be the main laughingstock for their parody one year later!<br/><br/>They should have called it (Who's Evil Now), and not due to its story. When 5 write it, to make not Spider-man 3, but almost 3 Spider-man movies in one; then this is venom. Yet, paying 258 million dollars on that script itself; is like falling into shifting sands. See who's evil now.. and dumb!"

Gwen Stacy acting so well in this movie. i like this part better than part one and two because part 3 is more actions than both parts. part 4 should be better too"
"Elswet","9","2","6","8 May 2007"," Clearly the Best...and Hopefully the End
","When it comes to Spider-man, Raimi clearly knows his business! I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the black suit. I already knew that the Green Goblin 2 would be involved, there was the back story and sub-plotted love triangle romance between Parker, MJ, and Osborne, Sandman was cast, and the black Spidey-suit clearly indicated the Venom storyline (a fact highly debated here on the IMDb boards, but I KNEW ;) ) Subsequently, I was afraid Sam was going to try to do too much with this film.<br/><br/>My worry was for naught. This movie skillfully meshes the complete, intricately woven web of intrigue, suspense, action, drama, and romance into one beautiful gossamer masterpiece, with the exception of the dysfunctional relationship element. I know much of the lure to Spiderman is that he is a regular guy who makes mistakes in the relationship department, can't hold a job, has an awkward relationship with his only living relative, and makes other mistakes too many to mention, but the dysfunctional aspects were too heightened here to garner appreciation and sympathy towards the lead character. In fact, they were a put off to this work.<br/><br/>There IS one other aspect I can't say I loved: The CGI treatment was discernible. I think when CGI is prolifically used, it should be used well, and not be blatantly obvious to the untrained eye. In several places in this film, it was just that...not used well, and blatantly obvious to anyone looking...but again, it was only in places. It wasn't enough to bring down the whole movie. It DID serve to distract, however.<br/><br/>I won't detail the plot as so many have done. Suffice it to say that this was the perfect ending to this franchise. End it now, before it can suffer franchise sickness and bad installments. This was pure perfection. Let's leave it to graze majestically.<br/><br/>There has been some buzz around Hollywood concerning Spider-man 4. Frankly, this movie closes all the necessary gaps and winds things up in a satisfactory conclusion. I see no reason to continue this franchise. End it on a high note, and let it go in glory. Please. But, Raimi seems to have moved on to other projects. He has recently sold a M4TV movie idea to Terry Goodkind, concerning his widely popular series, ""The Sword of Truth Novels,"" namely ""Wizard's First Rule."" And, if the rumors are true, Raimi has been approached by New Line's Bob Shaye concerning direction of the impending Peter Jacksonless Hobbit endeavor. Let's hope Raimi has the sense to pass on that one! Half the world would hate him! At least, Jackson fans would, and that equates many, many movie-goers to boycott that work.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

I didn't think that they would be able to give us such a story in 3 hours but they did and it was SUPERB !!!!. The Opening credits set the stage for the movie. (and boy did it ever deliver.)<br/><br/>I was glad to see they picked this movie up right after the events of movie 2 . Instead of 2 or 3 more years had past.<br/><br/>Their were a lot of story lines in this one (most of them were focused on The Big Three (Peter Parker - Mary Jane Watson - Harry Osborn .) I'm glad Raimi took the time to tie up all the lose ends from the first two movie dealing with the Character growth of the Big Three.<br/><br/>Tobey really improved a lot from the first two movies . His Acting was much more believable this time around . And he kick ass as Black Symbiote Spider-man & Emo Parker .<br/><br/>I liked Kirsten acting in this film (much better than the first two), Loved that her hair was freaking Red again (not the blast ugly orange from 2) also she's got a beautiful singing voice . <br/><br/>All the actors casted as villains were prefect .<br/><br/>Topher pull off Eddie & Venom. His Eddie character was perfect and represented that same cockiness that Eddie has always had. His Venom was wickedly cool . Loved The Voice <br/><br/>James really step up and did an outstanding job as Harry Osborn/New Goblin . Every scene with him from the beginning to end was Spectaular .<br/><br/>Thomas was Fantastic as Sandman . Boy did I feel for his Character, both his performance and his story was just amazing .<br/><br/>Loved the Symbiote storyline, It was better than I thought it would've been .<br/><br/>Finally a spider-man movie that had a lot more comedy , (their were so many funny scene in this movie as well as funny moments.)<br/><br/>For Comedy JK. Simmons does it again as JJJ, as does Bruce Cambell .<br/><br/>The music for Symbiote spider-man was cool as was The Theme for Sandy .<br/><br/>All the action sequences kick mega ass . The Battle Royale was the best .<br/><br/>I love the movie version of the Black Symbiote suit .<br/><br/>New Goblin's suit as well as glider was wicked .<br/><br/>Finally I thought this movie wrap up the trilogy with a bang . I can't wait to own this on DVD .<br/><br/>Well done Raimi, cast & Crew. (This movie was so worth the hype & my money)"

I mean the previous two parts weren't that exciting and entertaining. This movie involved some humor, fun, emotions and everything along with its MINDBLOWING action scenes. Also in all the parts Spiderman is shown as a nerdy person, but in this one it also involved the cool side of him when he is wearing black spidey suit. And we simply can't IGNORE those superb dance moves. Wow, everyone from the audience were clapping for it. Generally some movies are enough for the first time you watch it but this one is like you can keep on going to theatres to watch this movie again & again. Hats off to this movie and I am so.............. excited for another one to come out(hope it does). Also I am waiting for its DVD to come out the moment it hits the stores."
"jennaabetty","10","2","6","6 May 2007"," OK honestly people,
","look here. it wasn't the best spidey movie and it wasn't the worst i have ever seen. it was worth the money, but if your looking for some hardcore action you got from the 2nd one, eeh so you might be a little disappointed. overall, it wasn't a must see, but i loved it personally. it had the mussy romance problems, mixed in with the confusing, yet destructive villains ( a little many, may i add) yes, there were three of them. basically, venom, sandman, and ozzie osborn. then you have that inner battle, which quite frankly is a little scary and corny funny. walking around the new york streets with a really dorky emoish hairstyle waving your arms around at all these chicks and basically making an idiot of himself at a jazz club, thats evil? i expected more action, but hey, the end was terrific, although we didn't see the traditional American flag. loose ends were tied at the end, although i would have rather seen some characters actually live? ozzie, venom (brock), and did the sandman actually die or just blow into the wind? whats up with that? overall, it wasn't what i actually expected, but it wasn't bad at all. people have opinions, but this was by far better than the first and also poor acting as well as spectacular special effects, kinda give mixed feelings toward the film.

(I've seen it three times already!) From heart pumping special effects and action to emotional scenes where struggles that Peter faces in the movie(struggles against people around him, especially MJ to struggles in himself.)this movie was great, and I would love to watch it again and again.<br/><br/>Right after you watch, if you feel entertained, I think they did their job."

Not a great movie but it was good. The character development was great. I knew everyones background, I knew why they hated each other and who they loved.

The acting was horrible and cheesy, the scrip was pretty lame and clichéd, the graphics were pretty cool at some points but totally junk at others. I have never heard an audience laugh openly and yell about how bad a movie was until I went to see this, and it wasn't just a few people, it was more than half the crowd (myself included). Don't waste your money, unless you want some expensive sleep, because it dragged on forever. Extra thoughts? The evil characters weren't well thought out and they just sort of randomly came out of nowhere. The evil characters were also pretty boring and got old quickly, and the method of killing them was fairly basic and unentertaining."

","I sat in a cinema full of kids - and often found that there were far to many quiet moments - not much of a surprise that the kids started misbehaving during these sequences, which were far too frequent during the film. The pacing of this film basically sucked. They should have stuck to 2 spidey films and not bothered with the 3rd.<br/><br/>The 'love' scenes, the 'personal dilemma' scenes and the long slow pan and zoom shot scenes didn't captivate the kids from what I could tell - my t-shirt being full of popcorn down my back by the end of it suggested that this film couldn't hold their attention - and I wasn't seeing the film in a chavvy part of London, it was upmarket Clapham. Worrying.<br/><br/>There were bits where they attempted comedy - something I recommend that Tobey M never attempts again! Kirsten Dunst didn't really seem to care that she was in this film (and her interview on Jonathon Ross confirms this). Worth seeing for Tophey Grace's performance and the sandman actor chap (although his character story is suspect). <br/><br/>Seriously - If you've got kids take them to a shorter film - they will get bored in this and start fidgeting far too much."

Most of the acting was OK, though none of it was as good as in the previous two movies. In fact, the only stand out moment for me was Bruce Campbell's five minute scene. All in all, a disappointing evening. At least there were some great previews. And we do still have Pirates of the Carribian and Harry Potter to look forward to this Summer.

"allinasunday","2","2","6","4 May 2007"," O.K. Movie if you AREN'T a fan of the comics/cartoon.
","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>I came into this movie with huge expectations especially after the amazing first movie and even though the second one slacked off a little bit, it was still good. I watched it yesterday at a pre-screening with one of my friends whose Dad owns a cinema near here.<br/><br/>The CG was great for the sandman and venom. Spidey actually lacked in some scenes but overall was OK. I thought that some of the scenes in the movie were greatly overdone and would have been better left out, the scene with Tobey strutting down the street doing pelvic thrust every five seconds for instance. These were flaws, but next are the problems I have with the plot and storyline variations<br/><br/>Venom was huge in the comics and cartoon, in the film he was the same size as spidey; even Eddie Brock was a large guy, not the kid from That 70's Show. The suit is supposed to be near impossible to get of, yet Parker is able to do it with ease. Brock seems to have control over the suit i.e. removing the face a lot, and in actuality, the suit is supposed to have control over him. The only time it looked like a good venom is when it was without a host trapped by the metal rods spidey had driven into the ground. Harry's Character seems to have been completely added for theatrics because spider-man never had a goblin-like partner even for just one fight. I know that I am being strict on the movie, but with the first two sticking closely to story lines I was just letdown that is all. If you aren't a huge fan, you will probably enjoy this film. It will still gross huge, and will probably have a fourth installment. I just hope that the fourth is less predictable and focuses more on the action and doesn't have any stupid dance sequences in random places in the film."

"dsvfunnycolours","4","2","6","4 May 2007"," Am I the only person disappointed by this movie ??
","Without ruining the experience, or sounding like a bigot, I will try to keep this review short. To start, I disliked this movie. Not so much the ideas conceived, as much as the execution.Most of the problems I had with this movie rest solely on the shoulders of the director, Sam Raimi. Now, lets get one thing out of the way. I like Sam Raimi. I like his movies. I understand that he disliked the idea and concept of bringing a character like Venom to the big screen. It truly shows his heart was not in the character as most of his time was clearly placed in the Sandman character, and it does show. In my opinion, Sandman could have been easily left out of this movie entirely. His character only bogs down the story. Sam Raimi publicly stated he only wanted to include SandMan this time around. This also shows. <br/><br/>I really hate bashing this movie. A lot of it I liked, but the sub-par music started to annoy me early on and the movie itself is aimed directly at children. These villains, especially Venom, seem far too sympathetic and sappy. They should be mean, any fan of the vintage Spider-man, including the Symbiote story know exactly what I am talking about. The villains are supposed to be much tougher, much grittier. Spider-man 2 was aimed more at the adult fans then solely at children; again this was not the case. Too much information was thrown out with no depth; characters were briefly introduced, but no follow through or resolution. It reminded me a lot of watching the third Xmen movie, again excellent ideas, poor execution. <br/><br/>I got a little off point. The music. Yes, that music. I love Danny Elfman. Nearly every single one of his scores are made to perfection. Haunting, yet very distinctive from other composers. Mr. Elfman left this picture to make Charlottes Web. He was really missed. It was simple to tell where his original themes ended, and the below-average composer Christopher Young's score took over. It started out as a small annoyance, by the end of the movie, I felt like scratching my nails against a chalkboard. It just didn't flow or fit in the movie at all. I don't want to hear sappy pop jazz music while a crucial fight is happening on the screen.<br/><br/>I'm just about through, so much that I won't bother sharing what i think are the good things about this movie. Go see it for yourself and decide. This is my verdict: Fans and children who liked and have only seen the movies and don't know the comic book history will love this movie, loyal Spider-man fans will be very Disappointed.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading.

"veggiefan16","4","2","6","4 May 2007"," Three times the spidey = three times the disappointment
","This is one of the weaker wide-release films to come out in recent memory. Even X-men 3, a series notorious for a lack of character development and depth, managed to make a more effective thematic statement than Spiderman 3. From predictable plot twists to campy dialog to repetitive emotional ploys, Spiderman 3's success will be limited to its box office gross and the admiration of middle schoolers and comic-book lovers. Sure the fight scenes are great, but the rest of the movie is painfully forced, like the writers had to invent new ways to make Peter Parker seem awkward.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, but adjust your expectations accordingly."
"Sligh","4","2","6","4 May 2007"," Worst Spider-man movie to date
","-Never before have I seen a movie which has evoked such anger. There are no words. I'm not usually so violently disappointed, so it's taking me a long time to digest the whole thing. I wouldn't have felt so betrayed if the first and second movies were of this same substandard caliber, but they were quite good, making this abomination truly incredible in comparison. I left the theater in a frenzy of swear words which I don't ever recall hearing before. -The experience of watching it was surreal- I couldn't believe my eyes for a great portion of the middle. -For some reason someone felt it necessary to squeeze in as much over-the-top camp as conceivably possible, rendering me stunned- I was laughing, but AT the movie, not with it. These silly scenes were markedly out of place, and just too ridiculous for words- the scene in which Peter takes his date to the bar left me flabbergasted. -It was eerily reminiscent of Superman III on more than one occasion. Watch both for your self if you can- it's scary. -There were simply too many subplots. Part of Spider-man II's charm and success was in its relative simplicity- not a whole lot was going on plot-wise, giving the film time to develop characters in meaningful ways. This time a path following in the God-forsaken footsteps of the Fantastic Four was chosen, selling out what had such truly great potential. -The high budget was for the most part invisible- perhaps the actors soaked up most of it, but for the price tag attached, I expected better choreography, special effects... and the dubbing for Mary Jane was noticeably poor. 4/10- How could you, Stan Lee?"
"katsifasp","9","2","6","3 May 2007"," Better
","Just one word. Better. Better than Spider-Man 2 witch was already better than the first. More drama, more action, more of everything that made this franchise successful. The studios know that they have the golden goose in their hands and I don't thing that they are going to let it go. I just can't imagine a sequel without any of the participants of the previous movies. Any complaints. Perhaps a little bit too complicated although not a short in time movie, but felt very rush some times. Many stories, a lot of drama but also a lot of action to keep everyone happy. I suppose it will be even better with the second view! 9 out of 10 and waiting for the DVD."
"SajeevaS","8","2","6","3 May 2007"," Brilliant Third Installment -lets hope this is it though..!
","Every Spiderman movie brings with it the extravagant hype, and this was no exception. The dark satire that was to be expected, probably caused a lot of concern to fans, who would have wondered where the franchise was heading.<br/><br/>This definitely shone is terms of maturity. Mary Jane Watson's character has been transposed from girl to woman, and Kirsten Dunst provides the movie with a solid performance, shedding the 'girl next door' image. Unfortunately this cannot be said for Tobey Maguire. Spiderman's character has to remain uniform through-out the franchise, but when Maguire becomes Peter Parker, the same kid is conspicuous form the first installment. This has the writers to blame, cause there were a few scenes, that dealt with Peter's evil transposition which could have been scripted differently. James Franco shines with his charm and his on-screen presence, making his character quite lovable. The same could be said for Bryce Dallas Howard, who shocked me with her portrayal of Gwen Stacey. We see in this instance an actress (whose only mainstream role has been a blind girl in 'The Signs') starting to explore diversity at arguably a commencement point in her career.<br/><br/>A brilliant third installment, however lets hope it stops here..! this offered much more than the second installment, and gives a good end to the franchise."
"satishnaidu2000003","7","2","6","2 May 2007"," With great money and publicity comes great responsibility
","With great money and publicity comes great responsibility, responsibility to entertain and not to take the audiences for granted. To say that I was overexcited, to say that the only thing on my mind for the past two days was Spider Man would be an understatement. I am a huge fan of the earlier two movies; I saw the first one four times when it was released in the theatric and have lost count on how many times on DVD. Ditto for the second. The third installment is ten times the spectacle of its two predecessors; in fact it dwarfs the first installment. The romantic angle is much deeper than the second one; I guess these are the main reasons why most of us loved the first two movies. Well, I had a third, I loved the mythology. The two movies were an intelligent mixture of being funny and serious, but the superhero status of the character was always maintained, a superhero who would go to any lengths for the benefit of others, and of course for no selfish reasons. SPIDERMAN 2 got that spectacularly well and my personal favorite among all the superhero movies ever made, BATMAN BEGINS got that the best. But here, to my utter disappointment, every damn thing is personal. Spiderman here is not the superhero we know of, he is just a guy doing everything for his own self. I hate to admit that I hated it, absolutely hated it and that was the last thing I expected the movie to falter on. Watching the movie, I was reminded of two other movies, STAR WARS: RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE GODFATHER III. When compared to other superhero franchisees excluding of course BATMAN BEGINS (one of the greatest movies ever seen by your's truly, at least a 100 times), SPIDERMAN 3 stands head and shoulders above. But we never were comparing it to other movies, were we? THE GODFATHER III ought to be compared to its two illustrious predecessors and although it is a solid motion picture, it comes across as considerably weak against them. I guess the same would stand for SPIDERMAN 3. And as for watching it again, I am not exactly over the moon right now.<br/><br/>*******SPOILER ALERT: THE BELOW PASSAGE MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS***** Well, my first grudge is the romantic angle. It needlessly drags the movie; the love story actually seems forced. I for one thought that the romantic angle has been done away with and it is now for bigger things, one less thing for Spiderman to worry about. But SPIDERMAN 3 is all about the romantic angle between MJ and Peter and believe it or not, it is a love quadrangle.<br/><br/>As a result of that, the pacing and the psychology of the movie are as inconsistent bas they get. At times, SPIDERMAN 3 is pure magic, especially the sequences involving Spiderman/Peter Parker and Eddie Brock. Topher Grace is just fantastically wonderful and his is the best performance of the movie. The actions sequences, the ingredients that have the responsibility to give Sony its huge sum back are wonderful, to say the least. I wouldn't divulge anything about it but the last fight, Spiderman and three villains- Goblin, Sandman and Venom is one of the finest moments in superhero movie history and that includes the climax of BATMAN BEGINS. It is arguably the closest thing to comic books fun ever put on celluloid. The three-villain strategy could so easily have gone into BATMAN AND ROBIN territory (arguably the worst movie of all time), but Sam Raimi does a fantastic job to make it the movie's strongest moment.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the script. Everything seemed so real in SPIDERMAN and SPIDERMAN 2. Here it is all silly and the characters are thinner than paper; Venom and Sandman are instruments to bring effects into the movie and have no business in the movie other than that. That is a shame from a franchisee where Green Goblin was so strongly characterized and Doc Ock was simply out of the park. All this when Venom is such a strong character. SPDIERMAN 3 feels more like your usual summer action blockbuster, watch it for action and get the hell out of there, it isn't worth your attention. One thing that SPIDERMAN 2 and BATMAN BEGINS taught the superhero franchisee is that there's no compromise on weak characters. SUPERMAN RETURNS failed because everything was so black and white. SPDIERMAN 3 is exactly like SUPERMAN RETURNS, dull, bloated but interspersed with absolute moments of magic. <br/><br/>What were Bryce Dallas Howard and James Cromwell doing there by the way? Absolutely wasted, both of them. <br/><br/>The ending is a pathetic, to put it best. I just don't get it as to why everybody concerned is considering this as a trilogy when it is supposed to be a franchisee. I mean, there is deliberate winding up done at the end, a la LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING. It absolutely bets the hell out of any hope that the movie would end on a high note. A point to be noted for all people out there making a series; end it on a high note. When MJ says, ""Go get'em Tiger in SPIDERMAN 2, it brought a million goose bumps on me. When Gordon shows the deck of cards to Batman in BATMAN BEGINS there were whistles all round the theater. And when Gordon says,"" I never saidThank you"" and Batman turns and replies,"" And you never will have to"" and Hans Zimmer's score goes into a crescendo, everyone got up and clapped. That is what is going to put bums on the seat the next time around. But Sam Raimi doesn't seem to be too keen on extending the franchisee, well to hell with that. Sony would find a new director, who could do a better job. I just hated the way they ended it."
"Movieling","6","2","6","2 May 2007"," Spider-man is not trying to climb further!
","I meant by that a comparison with the previous spider-man movies. The plot is not as deep as spider-man 2, in which- among other things- spider-man had to deal with his inner conflicts between his love and his responsibilities. Such a plot depth is replaced in spider-man 3 with more characters and more villains, which leads us to the point of the movie not having enough character development. Too many characters+ too many villains lead to that you don't get to see enough of each villain, for me that was the case with venom and sandman, i really wanted to see more of these two with more fight scenes with spider-man.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good, and the acting is excellent.<br/><br/>Overall it is an entertaining and enjoyable movie."

","This is by far my favourite spiderman movie. And I like Peter parker be more dark like this one"
"lythis-love","2","1","2","27 February 2019"," One Hero Three Villains... is a bit too much.
","I really wished for the spiderman franchise and the fans to have at least one decent movie to got with. But it's just not meant to be...<br/><br/>After the horrible ending from the second part, where MJ left her own wedding for Peter I was really nosy to find out if they eventually made it together.
I certainly looked like it in the first 5 minutes of the Film. I wasn't sure at first in which way the plot will go as the they introduced some escaped prisoner who by accident fell into a science testing sandhole (!?) just right out of NY or the meteorite who hit the earth coincidently next to Peters moped.<br/><br/>MJ and Peters Love wasn't that strong it seemed as MJ annoyingly, as she always is, now gets jealous about Spider-Mans popularity. I mean she really wasn't that much of a bummer when she stood on the stage... I wonder what she actually expects from the world? Spider-Man saves lives everyday in NY for GS and she ... well... MJ portrays such a weak, helpless character. The movie came out 2007 when women are strong and independent, but her role throws that topic back into 1960! OK I would have been angry too, if on stage my boyfriend would kiss (french!) another women. Just for the photos. I mean she was in a relationship, too. Why on earth should they even kiss when he gets to be citizen of honor?<br/><br/>I ask myself why Peter never got around to take the cachectic daughter from his landlord? She is all over him, nice, simple and really wants him. There would have been one plot less to answer and we would be spared out at last with MJs never-ending screaming. I think they might have even recorded her screams and played a loop all over the actions scenes.. horrible.<br/><br/>They also managed to solve Uncle Bens death after 3 Movies. Amazing, great they finally got all the clues together. I admit, I already was satisfied with uncle Bens Death Scene and there was no mistery to be seen for me. But they needed a plot to make Spidey angry so they introduced another criminal. The scene was actually so stupid: I mean this Flint had like the same T-Shirt on when uncle Ben was killed and three years later when he became Mr. Sand? Was there not enough money to give him a second shirt?
I have to really, really criticize that stupid fighting scene between the houses. Green Goblin jr. vs. Spidey. It was an endless fight, and looked SO BAD edited. They improved with the CGI so much in the last 2 films, but here it seemed, they've let the intern finish the scene. Even when Spidey eventually got the Goblin, he tried once for CPR... gave up and they tried to reanimate him in hospital which surely took over 20 minutes to get there. In that case he would have been dead for sure. I already felt, the filmmakers think the audience is completely stupid and has no common sense.<br/><br/>I hoped for there main plot, when Spidey is possessed by venom! Amazing. I loved the transformation and the minutes he enjoyed his new life. Until: He looked in the mirror, full of rage... and flipped his streak of hair over his eyes. This was when he became Emo. But in such a bad way, I could Imagine his missed this phase out when he was 16...
Tobey Maguire doesn't have much expressions in the first place right, but here he lost it all. I liked it though, how he turned all his friends down. That was like a bit of acting, that suited Tobey. I actually enjoyed it how he blowed away MJ with the blond girl. But of course, Peter fought this new force in him. Which was a shame, as this plot ended to quickly in my opinion. They should have left it with this one! The sandman, the goblins revenge could have been completely left out.<br/><br/>But as the movie lacked with a good story they had cram in that other villain stuff to fill the movie. But it was to much. As as standalone Film I wished they would have explained more about that meteorite and venom. The name venom never fall actually,.. where he comes from or what he was up to anyway.<br/><br/>Inbetween all those complications MJ decided to try to go back to Harry. Comon MJ!? You had so many guys and chances already.. switching her love and heart like I switch my underwear made her an unlikeable person. How could Peter still fall for her? This Lovestory is complete joke. I like a good and healthy love story in super hero movies. But honestly, the times when the loved, helpless Girl gets in trouble were over already in the first movie. They continued this horror however.<br/><br/>My favorite character in the movie was Harry Osborne. He did his job so good. Being confused, back in love with MJ, even showed he was happing not remembering his past. That was some solid and great acting. Thanks Franco! My 2 stars got to you.<br/><br/>The way Harry died.. I didn't like it. He hated spiderman for 1 3/4 of a movie and then he died to save him? No way. Also, he just pierced in the chest like his father? I could accept that if it in comics, but I haven't read them thoroughly.
Yet another funeral and yet another speech about life lessons from peter ended this mess. Eventually."

","Spider-Man 3 is really two movies crammed into one, the first of which is a lot better than the second. Spider-Man 3 starts out strong but before it finishes, many viewers will desperately wish it had called it quits an hour earlier. Compared to the other two movies in the series, this one is a misfire. It's for completists only, and even they are likely to feel let down. Spider-Man and the first sequel were breezy adventures - easy and fun to sit through. Spider-Man 3 is a chore. The effective moments require a lot patience to uncover and some of what has to be shifted to get to them is not worth the effort. People love trilogies because it's said that good things come in threes, but this series would have looked better and felt more satisfying had the filmmakers stopped at two."

Those points being mentioned there are some amusing parts and although overdone the special effects were groundbreaking for 2007.<br/><br/>Spiderman has seen so many incarnations over the years, each trying to outdo its predecessor - although this version broke the bank in terms of budget, it fell short on all perceivable aspects."

This movie was fun and didn't take itself too seriously. Maybe that was why it didn't live to it's full potential. Wait.... this is exactly why this movie bombed. A darker tone and plot would have been a good recipe for this movie. When I first saw the black Spidey my jaws dropped, I was drooling. People are very critical of this movie, especially of the scene where Peter is grooving but that to me was the least disappointing thing about this movie. Venom was a weak villain with not enough screentime and miscast. Goblin was a joke, he shouldn't have even been in the movie. Sandman was portrayed by the perfect person I feel, he looked the part. Sandman was trying to do right for his daughter. I will see this movie many times again because my inner child loves it, all three Spider Man movies with Toby I love.

"andrewnmiller","7","1","2","25 June 2018"," Unbalanced, cluttered and unfocused.
","Following the financial and critical success of Spiderman 2, director Sam Raimi sought to use the third movie to bring an end to Harry's Green Goblin arc that the first two films had set up as well as using Sandman and Vulture as the main villains for the movie but producer Avi Arad had other ideas. He began pressuring Sam to include Venom in the movie in order to set up for his own spin-off but Raimi was reluctant to do it due to him not being a fan of the character but Avi kept insisting until Raimi caved. In addition to that, Gwen Stacy was also shoehorned into the movie at the request of the studio and Harry's story arc was expanded to make him a supervillain. What started out as a more personal story that dealt with issues of forgiveness had quickly turned into a bloated and overcrowded story where Spider-Man was battling 5 separate villains as well as dealing with a mostly one-sided love triangle which resulted in a story that was compromised by having too many hands in the pot.<br/><br/>Now, I never saw Spiderman 3 in theaters when it came out in 07' as I didn't watch many comic book movies at that time and given the backlash it received upon its release from the fans, I decided to stay well away from it, but early last year, I finally decided to watch it in preparation for Spiderman Homecoming and upon finishing the movie, I didn't think that it was as horrible as some of the fans were making it out to be as there are certain things I enjoyed like the action scenes and most of the acting, but the story, writing, characters, and tone left a lot to be desired in my eyes.<br/><br/>The film starts off three years after the previous film where Peter Parker is finally about to propose to his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson. After attending her debut in a Broadway show, Peter and Mary-Jane go to a park and while stargazing, a meteor falls close by and a strange black liquid craws out and attaches it to Peter's moped. Meanwhile, convicted criminal Flint Marko escapes from jail and hides in his family's house only to be pursued by police into a testing site. On his way back to his apartment, Peter is attacked by a masked figure who reveals himself to be Harry but before he can kill Peter, Osborne is injured and develops amnesia as a result, causing him forgot that Peter is Spiderman. After learning that Marko was actually Uncle Ben's killer, the black symbiote bonds with Peter changing his outfit as well as his attitude and behavior. Now, with this new entity processing him, Peter begins to alienate his girlfriend as well as having to battle several new enemies and dealing with his own worst enemy: himself.<br/><br/>Now given my love and admiration for Sam Raimi and what he did on the first 2 Spiderman movies, it's truly mind-boggling how many incompetent and moronic decisions he and the crew made when making the film or how there are so many little inconsistencies that could have been fixed before the movie was finished. Now, I'm well aware that not everything in the final film will be perfect nor am I looking for problems in the narrative but I do expect things to make sense and not leave the viewer confused or scratching their heads: why is Mary Jane being given 3rd billing in a Broadway show and why does she have the opening song? The symbiote leaps onto the back of the moped as Peter and Mary Jane leave and neither one of them bother to even look on the back of the damn bike? When Parker arrives at the apartment after dropping MJ off, where has the symbiote gone, did it turn invisible? After Parker leaves his aunt's apartment and is attacked by the New Goblin, where does the moped go? Does it hit something and burst into flames and where in the hell does the symbiote go, shouldn't it still be attached to the back of the bike? As Harry pursues Peter through a narrow alley, Peter shoots a piece of webbing between two buildings, how come when Harry does see the webbing why doesn't he just duck under it or cut it? How could anybody still be alive after taking the kind of fall that Harry just had and why is Peter still hanging around after Harry has been injured? Why isn't he running away in the other direction? When Marko climbs a fence to escape the police and ends up in a testing facility, there is clearly a sign that says keep out, why did he not stop to even read what the sign said? Why do the scientists inside the testing facility not even bother checking to see if that change in the silicon mass is really a bird? Why does Peter have a change of clothes when he arrives at the hospital, how did he get home to change and where's the moped? Why is Peter's apartment door still not fixed? When Mary Jane leaves Peter's apartment, the symbiote is seen climbing down a lampstand. How did it come to be there? Did it arrive with Mary Jane? Why does Spiderman leave after saving Gwen, he still has a crane to stop. How did Sandman learn how to fly? Why did Peter feel the need to kiss Gwen right in front of Mary Jane? The number of inconsistencies and incompetent decisions in this movie are nothing short of idiotic and it just ends up doing more damage to the movie.<br/><br/>Not only does the movie suffer because of massive inconsistencies and plot holes, but unlike the first 2 movies where a straightforward tone of being fun at times but still maintaining a sense of seriousness worked so well, Spiderman 3 has a serious tone issue as it can't decide what it wants to be. Throughout the course of the movie, there'll be moments of fun then a serious scene will pop up causing the movie to grind to a halt resulting in an extremely jarring experience that just leaves the viewer confused and disappointed by the movie's end. Given the fact that Sam and his brother Ivan had a hand in writing the screenplay, it's no shock that these two shouldn't be writing any script as the dialog is cheesy in a lot of areas and down-right cringe-inducing at times, making the movie come across more like a soap opera rather than a comic book movie which shows just how in over their heads the Rami brothers were when helping Alan Sargent write the screenplay. <br/><br/>Much like X-Men 3 and The Amazing Spiderman 2, Spiderman 3 also feels the need to throw so much into its 2 hour running time in order to try and please the fans which results in both the story at hand and the characters suffering due to the overstuffed narrative and the fact that there isn't enough time for each character to really shire unlike a movie like The Avengers nor does it allow any character growth resulting in the viewer having no investment in any of them as well as the movie having too many subplots that go nowhere. <br/><br/>Sandman aka Flint Marko is a convicted felon whose motivations revolve around having a sick child and that's what compels him to steal which is supposed to make the viewer feel sympatric about his plight but it mostly just comes across as weak and melodramatic and fails to make us care about Marko or his daughter. Just because you give a character in a movie a child or a family doesn't make them sympathetic unless you take the time to make us fee for them, this kind of emotional heartstring pulling didn't work for The Patriot and it sure as hell doesn't work for Spiderman 3. Also infuriating is the recon of Sandman being Uncle Ben's killer. Now I do understand why Sam Raimi did this as he wanted to have the film's story be about Peter learning to forgive Sandman for murdering his uncle which is fair enough, but the way it's handled when Marko explains to Peter that he accidentally killed Uncle Ben comes across as forced and unearned as well as incredibly sappy rather than heartfelt and while the Martha scene from Batman V Superman is far more stupid, the scene in Spiderman 3 just feels like the ending of a cheesy soup opera rather than a genuine emotional finale. Much like Sandman getting a piss-poor character, Mary Jane Watson also gets a character assassination by going from a determined and career-driven woman in the first two movies to being a self-righteous and sobbing attention hog here. Since when was she ever interested in becoming a singer? In the first two movies, it was clear that MJ wanted to be an actress, but what was the reason for making her a singer? It makes no sense in the slightest. Not to mention the writers completely miss the point of who Mary Jane is as a character as she's a fun-loving, cheeky, high-spirited young woman who helps Peter to burst out of his nerdy shell and have fun while in the movie, the writing makes her come across as a whiny pre-madonna who bursts into tears just because of one bad review and doesn't even tell Peter that she was let go from the play for not being able to sing worth a damn and when Peter tries to give her some words of encouragement, she rebukes him and continues to whine about her career ending throughout the rest of the movie, hardly a character worth caring about. Thanks for that, Sam, Ivan and Alan. As for Harry Osborne, his arc is just as stupid and nonsensical as the other characters arcs in the movie. Besides becoming the next Green Goblin, Harry still wants revenge on Peter for supposedly killing his father in the first movie which could have been averted if Peter could have just explained what actually happened to Norman briefly back in the last movie rather than wait until now but what's even more stupid is how during the first battle between the two of them, Harry suffers a concussion resulting in him getting amnesia and yet doesn't remember the events prior to his accident, another example of how lazy the writing is here. After that, Harry is pretty much useless until he regains his memory in the most paretic way imaginable. Even more nonsensical is towards the end of the movie when Harry's butler tells him what really happened to his father causing Harry to go and help Peter even though Peter tried to kill him earlier in the movie and apparently Harry is perfectly forgiving of Parker and shows no sign of anger towards him."
"Prashast_Singh","10","1","2","29 April 2018"," Spiderman 3: Quite underrated, much better than expected.
","I remember watching the film some 11 years ago. In the present time, I didn't remember anything much, so I decided to watch the film today, in the highest quality (4K). I was surprised to find how underrated it is, and with this, it's pretty obvious that I loved the film.<br/><br/>SPIDERMAN 3 has a great depth if seen carefully. There's nothing really disappointing about the film. It's entertaining, dark, funny, emotional, thought provoking and enthralling apart from being action-packed, thrilling and visually striking. In this film, Spidey is something like never before. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire has actually done a great job, and he impresses in every single scene he's present. His other side has been explored very well. The other actors have done an excellent job too; every single performance clicks. Emotionally too, this film is very gripping. <br/><br/>The visual effects and action sequences are simply one of the best ones ever. 
The climactic action block is one of the best ones ever. The cinematography is remarkable, while the sound effects too are phenomenal. <br/><br/>Another great thing is that there's a lot going on in the film, and none of it feels unnecessary. There's a lot of visible depth in the screenplay, and it doesn't just focus on one character. This too makes the film an impressive one. <br/><br/>And I must not forget to say, I somewhat loved Black Spiderman even more and found him a bit cooler, even though it's the original Spiderman who's my favorite and remains unbeatable. I really loved Peter's dance too!<br/><br/>Films like SPIDERMAN 3 are often underrated but they are nevertheless worth watching and collecting. This isn't just a great superhero film, but also a thought-provoking, heart touching action film."

","Once again the critics are too harsh on a fun, action packed movie! This is BY FAR the best Spider-Man Movie Out Of all 6 Of them!

The critics often call out the ""emo Peter"" scenes for being to silly for a superhero movie, and I agree with them in that regard, but other than that this movie is fantastic.

"Moviefan-Two-Kay-Four","7","1","2","13 March 2018"," Very Problematic, But Not Horrible...
","After the worldwide success of the first two ""Spider-Man"" films, director Sam Raimi and the cast decided to take a break. The first two had been shot almost back-to-back, with very little ""down time"" in between. So, in late 2005, about 18 months after the release of ""Spider-Man 2"", Raimi began fleshing out ideas for a third storyline. For this chapter, the director wanted to teach Peter Parker about forgiveness; to do so, he'd need a villain with personal ties. The problem was that, besides the Osborn family and Otto Octavius, no villains in the comics had such a huge connection. Raimi didn't want to contradict a well-established character, so he sought one out whose backstory had never been fully realized: the Sandman, whose literary incarnation was little more than a random thief. Connecting the character to the death of Ben Parker gave Peter a huge obstacle that needed facing. Wrapping up Harry Osborn's story was also necessary, since Marvel wasn't sure if James Franco would agree to more chapters in the franchise. The addition of Gwen Stacy (who in the comics, was Peter's first love) was done mainly for the fans, and to create a conflicted love triangle with Peter & Mary Jane. Satisfied with his concept, Raimi told his plans to Marvel Comics; the result was less than expected.<br/><br/>Marvel CEO (at that time) Avi Arad liked the story very much, but he had one concern. Online polls had been screaming with fan theories and guesses ever since the second film's release, wondering who the next villian would be. Arad was concerned that the Sandman wouldn't attract a big enough audience alone, so he asked Raimi to include a fan favorite: Venom. When Raimi intially refused, Arad pressured him. Raimi eventually agreed, and so the black suit story from the comics' ""Secret Wars"" arc was simplified and added to the script.<br/><br/>Therein lies my biggest problem with ""Spider-Man 3"". I liked the Venom character as a kid, but in all honesty having 4 villains in the same film (Harry, Marko, the black symbiote itself, and eventually Venom) was just too much at once. From the standpoint of a fan, I'd have preferred that Venom be saved for a future entry, so he could have taken center stage. By having him alongside both Marko and Harry Osborn, the story became rather confusing for many fans, and the film's box office suffered as a direct result. Overall, this film made less money across the board than its predecessor...all because of corporate greed.<br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoy the film on many levels, but knowing what caused the multi-arc story makes some moments bittersweet. The actors clearly enjoyed this ride, but something in general seemed a bit lacking. Looking back, I realize it was the Venom character. The fact of it essentially being forced into the narrative only made the tale confusing and hard to follow. It became one of those films many people have to watch more than once, just to understand it...and these days, audiences don't have a lot of patience for films with too many angles. Rightfully so, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire, slipping into the spandex suit for a third try, really shows his acting range here, even more so than his diverse performance in ""Spider-Man 2"". From intense love to seething hatred (and everything in between), he really brings his game up to a whole new level. Kirsten Dunst shines again as Parker's star-crossed love, Mary Jane Watson. I liked her performance very much, and her singing in the film is beautiful. She's less helpless than in either prior entry, and far more confident. Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of acclaimed director Ron) makes her first apearance in the franchise as the bubbling, exuberant, and gorgeous Gwen Stacy. I liked her character, but felt she didn't have much to do in the long run.<br/><br/>James Franco does an equally-remarkable turn, finally completing the journey that began at the end of the original film. He gives Harry a blend of jealousy, mystique, and severe determination. He also revisits the lighter tones of his role, for the scenes where Harry has amnesia. And in the finale, he shows that in his heart, Harry was truly a hero. Thomas Haden Church gave Marko both sentiment and menace, and turned what was originally a two-bit thug into a far more interesting character. Topher Grace played the ""creepy"" card as Venom, and gave Eddie Brock a know-it-all arrogance that makes you almost feel disgusted.<br/><br/>The effects in this film took another leap, but not towards our web-suited hero. Instead, animators studied all sorts of dirt, sand, and dust to make the Sandman truly convincing. Doing so meant pushing every effects boundary that existed at that point, so far as making Sony Pictures Imageworks add more computers to their setup. The team also studied serpents and worms to get a feel for the crawling done by the symbiote, and layered large amounts of black slime on Topher Grace's costume to have it appear living.<br/><br/>The music this time was two-fold. Danny Elfman originally refused to return, citing uncomfortable relations with Sam Raimi during the second film's production. So, Raimi brought in scorist Christopher Young, who used some of Elfman's memorable themes while creating a few of his own. Eventually, Elfman returned to assist Young, who recieved main score credit for the film.<br/><br/>Aside from the criticisms surrounding Venom, I honestly didn't have a lot for this entry. Mary Jane is no longer in a water-drenched position (thank God!), so I was very relieved. I guess my main concern was one of a spiritual nature, when Eddie visits the church, asking God to kill Peter. That struck me on an emotional note, since I know that God would never do such a thing. Otherwise, I guess my only real complaint would be Gwen Stacy's cleavage. There's a few moments in the ""crane rescue"" sequence where you can practically see down her shirt. It's not as blatant as Mary Jane's situations in the first two films, but I still felt it was inappropriate.<br/><br/>All in all, this film gets a 7 out of 10, for the spiritual issue, cleavage shots, and confusing story."
"hektorkanta","9","1","2","6 March 2018"," Why so many bad reviews?! This is the best Spider-Man movie of the trilogy!
","Now, I know that most people think that it is all over the place and that it takes thing too fast, but I honestly think that the script was written masterfully. It may just be a matter of taste, but I much prefer this one than the first two, or 'The Amazing Spider-Man' movies. The thing that this movie gets the best is a sense of overwhelming chaos, both of internal struggles and external; it is true also that the plot rushed itself towards the end but that just gives the finale that Grand feeling which this franchise really deserves!
This movie also does really well in connecting all of it's predecessors together while maintaining that fresh feel. If you like Spider-Man movies and/or the comics you wont be disappointed! I don't know how the villain's origin(s) stayed true to it's original sources because I didn't read much of Spider-Man, but they surely work for this movie.
The plot was rich in it's diversity and not a one scene feels boring or out of place. 
I sat there for over 2 hours in aw the whole way through.<br/><br/>Now this is not a professional review but I still think that this movie doesn't deserve all the criticism that it receives, much like the 'Avengers'; it is just a really ambitious flick that tries to appeal to all the demographic resulting in a controversial must-watch."

","'Spider-Man 3 (2007)' is certainly a step down and 'Emo-Peter', or more specifically his arrogant dancing, is as cringe-worthy as his reputation would suggest (though when viewed on their own these scenes are funny to say the least, it's just that as a part of the overarching narrative they are entirely out of place), but despite its problems this is still a relatively enjoyable picture that has some entertaining sequences and even some nice character moments (some of the stuff with 'The Sandman' and his daughter is quite well done) sprinkled throughout the over-cluttered and generally messy narrative. The action feels a little less impactful than before, mainly thanks to the blatant surrealism of the antagonists who are actually less believable in concept and execution than our spider-enhanced hero and the villains of the prior films, and most of it is too big and too silly to ever feel like our heroes are ever really in danger. It can be fun at times, though, and does have some lasting consequences, leading to an ending that's surprisingly sombre. 6/10"

"jaredpahl","8","1","2","23 November 2017"," Spider-Man Unhinged. Raimi's Trilogy Capper is a Big, Trashy, Deliriously Entertaining Superhero Soap Opera
","I've realized over the years that I have not been watching the much-maligned Spider- Man 3 the right way. The first time I saw Spider-Man 3, I came in with expectations that Sam Raimi could somehow pull off the impossible, and hit three straight home runs. Needless to say, Spider-Man 3 did not live up to the insurmountable standard set by the first two films. The precarious balance of tone in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 had slid too far into the comedic, the effects had leaned too far into the digital, and the story had lost focus. I didn't like Spider-Man 3 the first time I saw it. Watching it now, my feelings have changed. Maybe it's the dreary-as-a-cubicle Amazing Spider-Man movies that have made me appreciate Raimi's gonzo energy, or maybe I've just come to terms with the fact that Spider-Man 3 is not the comprehensively perfect comic book adaptation its predecessors were. Either way, I can now enjoy Spider-Man 3 for the big, trashy mess it is.<br/><br/>You've heard the big complaint before, ""Too many villains"". It's almost become synonymous with Spider-Man 3. Any time a movie tries to cram more villains than needed into its story, it pulls a ""Spider-Man 3"". It's the rallying cry for Spider-Man 3 haters, but you know what? It doesn't bother me. Sure, Harry's ""New Goblin"" is an uninspired design, but his character arc demanded he take his revenge on his friend. Sure, the controversial Sandman retcon partially negates the impact of Spidey's origin, but his presence teaches Peter forgiveness. Sure, Venom is shoehorned in, but his story is directly tied to the symbiote suit and Peter's out of control ego at the heart of the film. To not have any of the three villains in the movie would have felt like a cheat. And individually, the villains work. James Franco does what he can with his role, even if his Harry Osborne is infinitely more interesting than his Goblin. The Sandman is an inventive digital creation and Thomas Haden Church gives a solid performance as Flint Marko. And yes, I like Venom. It was, and still is jarring to see Topher Grace's dorky face emerge from the snarling monster, but his Eddie Brock is a good character, developed over the entirety of the film. His transformation into Venom doesn't come out of nowhere. <br/><br/>So what are my problems with the film? Well, generally it comes down to the details. There are a lot of little contrivances and coincidences in Spider-Man 3, and a few big ones. Some, like Harry's amnesia or Bernard the Butler's late-game bombshell, I can take in stride. It's part of the heightened soap opera drama of the best Spider-Man stories. Others, like Sandman's phantom reason for wanting to kill Spider-Man, or the corny news broadcast as a framing device for the final fight, are harder to swallow. Spider-Man 3 is a movie in desperate need of another run through the typewriter. The whole thing feels rushed. Raimi was infamously saddled with studio interference and a firm release date deadline, so it doesn't surprise me that the script is so sloppy, but if you ask me, the best way to handle a sloppy script is to double down on the entertainment value. The biggest sin Sam Raimi could have committed was to make a boring movie out of this material. <br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is anything but boring. This movie is pure entertainment on every level. The action scenes are clearly the best reason to see Spider-Man 3. Down the line, they pack that signature, high-flying, kinetic, Raimian dynamism that makes his scenes punch harder than most anybody else's. The special effects, on the other hand, are all over the place. There are times when Spider-Man is swinging through the New York skyline, and it hits like an air-born ballet. Then there are shots where the CGI looks shockingly, inexcusably rubbery and fake. Even so, accounting for the inconsistent digital effects and accounting for the fact that we've seen the same type of stuff twice already, there wasn't a moment when Spider-Man was on screen and my eyes didn't light up. The action is sumptuous to behold. The visuals, sound effects and direction of Spider-Man 3's action scenes are world class, and let's be honest, it's hard to complain about anything in a blockbuster that can deliver not one, not two, but at least three showstopping action set-pieces. <br/><br/>Between the action, things are almost as lively. Raimi is not interested in subtlety when it comes to the story's dramatic moments. Make no mistake, this is a soap opera. Relationships flip and flop, characters scheme and fight, and plot details turn so dramatically you can almost detect a faint ""Dun, Dun, Duuuun!"" on the soundtrack. The whole thing is so outrageous, that while yes, it is hard to take seriously, its rather easy to enjoy. Even those jazz scenes everyone complains about. They're funny. Whether the humor is intentional or not is irrelevant. Tobey Maguire going full tilt emo and dancing to old school jazz music is fun to watch, context be damned.<br/><br/>There are two ways to watch Spider-Man 3. You can watch it in comparison to the soul-affirming classiness of the original two movies, and lament the fact that the franchise has fallen victim to the ""Bigger, better"" curse that hits all franchises at some point. Or, you can give into the zaniness of the whole thing. This isn't a prestige picture. It's drive-in pulp. And it's some of the most action-packed, flat out spectacularly entertaining drive-in pulp you'll ever see. It might take a few viewings, but if you can get yourself to surrender to Spider-Man 3's giddy charm, it's well worth it. When it comes to summer blockbusters, give me too much action, too many villains, and too much humor, over ponderous, self-serious safety any day.<br/><br/>84/100"

","I honestly, don't think this movie was bad at all I love how there were three (two later on in this film) villains in this film instead of one this time. I also laughed at a few scenes when Spiderman had the black suit on.<br/><br/>I actually had a bit of a crush on Mary Jane when she was a waitress in this film even Gwen Stacy when she was on a date with Peter.<br/><br/>Okay, this film even showed me to trust people and put what was in the past behind. For example, in this film, Spiderman was blamed by Harry that he killed his dad but it wasn't and Sandman killed Uncle Ben in this film.<br/><br/>Like I said on my Spiderman and Spiderman 2 review this is a good film for the new generation of Spiderman fans.

"ryanskywalker-87402","7","1","2","3 July 2017"," ""None of that matters now, you're my friend""
","After the brilliance that was Spider- Man 2, this movie was a big step down in terms of quality. The main problem being that there is just too much going in in the script, that it all comes out as rushed, half baked, and often cheesy and contrived.<br/><br/>All the main cast are back again. Tobey Maguire does get to deliver some good scenes, like his anger over the Sandman/Ben connection, and his conflict with Harry Osborn. But he also delivers some cringe worthy stuff, notably the dancing stuff.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is absolutely dire as MJ. She irritates, moans, criticizes, and cries her way through the movie. She is truly unlikable in this movie. She commits so many offenses in this movie. From her hypocritical behavior over the Spidey/Gwen publicity kiss, to giving into Harry's empty threat to break Peter's heart, to her constant whining about her fading career.<br/><br/>James Franco is probably the best actor of the movie. Although his character falls short in some areas. For starters he is not a Goblin. He is a guy in a black jumpsuit on a hoverboard. His grand revenge plan is nothing more than a silly break up of Peter and MJ, which made no sense. He spends a lot of the movie as a nice guy with amnesia, too. That said, he does deliver some great stuff. Notably his gloating to Peter about breaking him and MJ up. And that mansion fight was superb. His death scene was also emotionally great.<br/><br/>Then we have Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church, an actor who is utterly wasted in this movie. Sandman seems like an out of place element. He is a poor thief, who just wants to steal some money to help his sick daughter. But he's got a backstory. Turns out he's the guy who actually shot Uncle Ben. The other guy from Spider-Man 1 was just an accomplice. A horrible and needless contrived connection of Sandman to Peter. Sandman's is a visually pleasing villain (his birth scene is incredible), except in the scenes where he grows to giant proportions, and comes across as a retarded version of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Church is a fine actor, but he is just a cog in a CGI machine. He has so little dialogue. <br/><br/>Topher Grace plays the third baddie in the movie's trio of villains. He is Eddie Brock, a cocky and sleazy photographer competing with Peter for a permanent staff job at the Daily Bugle, who eventually becomes the symbiotic villain, Venom. He is even less used than Church. The script leaves him very little room to even become an important element until the climax. <br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard plays iconic Spidey girl, Gwen Stacy. She's sweet, charming, pretty....and pointless. She is an object of Eddie Brock's affections, but this is only mentioned in ONE brief scene between them. She is simply a plot device to make MJ needlessly jealous. A darn shame, because Howard was ten times more likable than Dunst's MJ.<br/><br/>The supporting cast like Aunt May and Jonah Jameson unsurprisingly have less screen time, but are still solid in what they are given to work with. Especially Aunt May, when she lectures Peter over the evils of revenge.<br/><br/>The whole symbiote storyline was also excess baggage. Just look at how the symbiote is introduced. It falls from the sky, and randomly decides to hitch a ride on Peter's scooter. Why? <br/><br/>The movie was supposed to be the darkest of the trilogy as it dealt with the whole theme of revenge. But it actually has more cheesy jokes, campiness, and off color jokes than the other two movies.<br/><br/>But a lot of this was down to Sony, as they saddled Sam Raimi with characters that he didn't want to use: The symbiote storyline, Eddie Brock, and Gwen Stacy. I give him points for doing the best he could in a difficult situation.<br/><br/>The movie has it's faults, but the good out weighs the bad whether it be the conclusion to Peter and Harry's arcs or the fight scenes. Spiderman 3 is a worthwhile watch."

","The third & final instalment in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Spider-Man 3 is an absolute trash that gets every single thing wrong from start to finish and it's difficult to believe that it is from the very filmmaker who brought this Marvel Comics character on the film screen in a truly fascinating manner and then went on to raise the bar for superhero flicks with an even more superior sequel.<br/><br/>Set months after the events that transpired in the previous chapter, the story of Spider-Man 3 follows Peter Parker who has finally managed to balance his two lives which is once again thrown into turmoil when new threats arise. Harry Osborn is after him to avenge his father's death. A petty criminal & real killer of Parker's uncle is transformed into Sandman following a freak accident while an alien symbiote brings out Peter's dark side after bonding with him.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 3 is marred by numerous things that were never going to work in its favour. Too many subplots, overdose of characters, complex narration, whole lot of plodding, terribly handled character arcs, weak villains, half-assed attempt at humour & too much melodrama definitely account for its downfall but Raimi's inability to balance all the various aspects into one complete whole is what hurt it most for the directed messes up real bad this time.<br/><br/>Most of the technical aspects aren't much of an issue but they fail to work in harmony with each other. Set pieces & camera-work is good, Editing is simply horrible for the plot is highly convoluted in its own mess, Visual effects feature more CGI shots than previous films and many of these effects heavy sequences aren't refined enough to hide the artificial elements, and Christopher Young replaces Danny Elfman as the film's composer and even his music, just like other plot elements, is all over the place.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast of Spider-Man 3 comprises of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, J.K. Simmons & others with Topher Grace, Thomas Haden Church & Bryce Dallas Howard being new additions, and all of them deliver forgettable performances. The character arc itself is poorly written for both the new & returning cast and the actors fail to add any interesting dimension to it. None of the villains are intimidating, including Venom who's given a much too less screen time to leave any impression.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Spider-Man 3 is without a doubt the weakest of the three films and also ranks amongst the worst sequels ever made. The whole movie gives an impression of being shot in a hurried manner during production with both cast & crew having no idea of where it is supposed to be headed, Raimi's direction lacks the energetic vibe that made his previous two features such a fun & enjoyable ride and every single aspect seems to be lost in its own realm for none of these elements come together to provide the much-needed smooth flow to this unnecessarily convoluted mess.<br/><br/>P.S.

","OK, the movie wasn't that bad as people have been saying, except the overall plot was a mess. The whole problem was incorporating 3 villains into one movie. It was a near impossible task because each character needed an ample amount of screen time in order to get established and work together. If one was left off screen for too long then the whole point of them being in the movie started to fade. <br/><br/>The butler coming in and telling Harry that ""Peter didn't kill your father, it was his own blade that killed him"" was a bit out-of-nowhere and hasty (this previously unimportant butler character all of sudden found the answer to Harry's father's death and he's an expert in identifying wounds?). It's like the writers needed to find a way to change Harry's villain status so that it wouldn't complicate things in the end, which does make sense in a way. <br/><br/>So while the Sandman and Venom are attacking Spider-man, with MJ hostage, here's come Harry on his glider who helps fight off the two villains and is now loyal friends with Peter and then dies at the end. Peter cries over his dead body, which was kind of awkward and silly but maybe I'm being a little harsh, his ""best friend"" died. But didn't Harry try to steal MJ away from Peter and now Peter acts like it's no big deal? The whole friendship thing between the two was a little too late to be believable. <br/><br/>What I also didn't understand was how the Sandman asks Peter Parker/Spider-man to forgive him for killing Peter's uncle because he did it for money and his daughter. This comes only a few minutes after Sandman was trying to kill Spider- man and now all of a sudden he's come to heart with his feelings.Give me a break! <br/><br/>There were some cheesy moments in this film, especially the part where the ""possessed"" Peter struts and twirls down the street like in Saturday Night Fever, to no good avail (he looked like an idiot). And Harry and MJ dancing to the Twist in the kitchen while making breakfast was really unnecessary. At times, I thought this movie should have been called ""The Notebook: Spider-Man Edition"" with all of this love affair and musical stuff going on, taking away from most of the real action. And the singing in the Jazz Club, Peter playing the piano (rather good) and after about 10 minutes away from the action I was like ""What happened to Spider- man?"".It turned into sort of something out of ""Cassanova"" which quickly died and became rather stupid. With a little more thinking and a much sturdier plot this movie could have been so much better. I felt like it was all over the place and couldn't concentrate on one thing for very long like a kid with ADHD. <br/><br/>And can someone please explain to me where that black goo came from? Outerspace? And why was it so interested in Peter Parker? The whole hype about Peter Parker becoming this evil Spider-Man didn't quite live up to my expectations. Sure, the black suit demented his personality but shouldn't this movie in the trilogy have been placed second, so as to give the viewers a feeling of darkness falling over Spider-Man and everyone else? There could have so much more to play off from an evil Spider-Man who has to work his way back from the ""dark side"" (yep, Star Wars reference) and the last movie could have been of enlightenment and Spider-Man returning back as a hero. Of course, that's been done too many times before."
"johnnymacbest","3","1","2","22 July 2012"," Spider-Man 3 and the comedy of errors.
","I must admit when I saw the previews for it back in 2007, I wasn't all that enthusiastic about it and for good reason: I had a gut feeling that it wasn't gonna be as good as the previous films as sequels have a tendency to falter and fall after their second installments(I'm looking at you X-Men 3) so with all that I went in to Spider-Man 3 and words cannot express how utterly disappointed I was. Having recently re-watched it on DVD, I can see the MAJOR problems with it which I will list numerically.<br/><br/>1. Too many villains. Remember way back when Spider-Man 1 and 2 had only 1 villain? That's how focuses the films were. You got into their heads on what they were feeling and their evil plans were and etc. But they were also well-developed characters and the audience cared for them as things went along. Sandman was the only character that was developed and was simply awesome. Too bad the same can't be said for Venom and New Goblin; they pretty much was window dressing.<br/><br/>2. The acting. Thomas Hayden Church was wonderful as Sandman and did a great performance but the most laughable part is the emotional scenes between Peter and MJ. Stiff, fake, constipated is what comes to mind with these scenes; hell, it might as well have been scripted for a sitcom.<br/><br/>3. The humor. Spider-Man 1 and 2 had great sense of humor. Not this time. It's more on the lines of ""McHale's Navy"" kind of humor. The kind that makes you want to bang your head on the table or against the wall if you're so inclined, which I don't recommend you do or I'll be blasted for promoting self harm.<br/><br/>4. Peter acting like a doofus instead of being the bad-ass, evil villainous persona when he's under control of the symbiote. Venom was NEVER like that in the comics or animated series. In Spider-Man: TAS, he was very close to his comic-book counterpart. This version of Venom in Spider-Man 3 is more of a creepy Pee-Wee Herman rather than a alien symbiote.<br/><br/>5. Gwen Stacy. Though I liked her in this film as well as the reboot, I felt she was unnecessary in this. She didn't do much in the film and after the dinner scene at the restaurant, which was admittedly funny, she was completely forgotten about; never to be mentioned again.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this movie that I simply can't list them all. If you liked this film, fine, more power to you. But this one's a stinker for many of the reasons stated above. I'm glad that they rebooted the series after this because studio interference, NOT Raimi, ruined this film. It made a lot of money at the box-office but to be honest, Spider-Man 3 is nothing more than a comedy of errors."
"elliotminorjosh","5","1","2","9 May 2012"," Three Isn't The Magic Number For Spidey
","Sam Raimi has lost his touch here. He made two masterpieces with Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 but this threequel doesn't impress much. It is clear that the $250,000,000 has been spent on making the effects amazing but at times they're very shabby, not what you'd expect from a film with so much money spent on it. But one of the main problems is the ultimately vital character driven story. Well...there really isn't one. Tobey Maguire has become more soppy than a reviewer's tissue after watching Titanic II. The script makes Peter what he shouldn't be- a guy who's full of himself. At least Thomas Haden Church gives a great leverage to the plot. His role as The Sandman is very emotional and has a lot of feeling to it. And James Franco finally does what fans have waited for and gone to the psychotic and dark side his father went to. After seeing this, there's no wonder Spider-Man 4 was pulled."
"Nuz_Reviews","5","1","2","4 August 2011"," The first two were great! What happened?!
","In spirit of the new reboot Spidey coming out next year, The Amazing Spider-Man, I just thought I'd re-watch the original trilogy. Here's just my thoughts on the third movie.<br/><br/>Having liked the first two Spidey films, I still cannot decide if having a third Spider-Man was the wrong decision or if this was just poorly made all around. I'm leaning more towards my second thought. The movie seemingly picks up right where the second one left off, but then it just gets weirder and plain weird. The whole emo-Spidey was just bizarre and didn't work in any capacity. I'd rather have him just kill some people to show off his evil side once the symbiote entered his body. I enjoyed the Sandman as a villain, played by Thomas Haden Church. I did not enjoy the 20 or 30 minutes of Venom. I'm sorry, actually I'm not, but Topher Grace does not appear to be a Venom-type actor. Horrible casting on their part. Perhaps if Venom had a bigger role in the film or if they had redone their cast to not feature Topher for the part.<br/><br/>5/10 Stars."
"GreenGoblinsOckVenom86","1","1","2","30 March 2010"," This movie wasn't that great.
","I was disappointed by a lot of things. 1) Sand Man turning out to be Uncle Ben's Killer. That was wrong! Sam should've been able to think of something else to do with Sand Man instead of that. Then at the end he explains that he killed Uncle Ben by an accident. This completely screws up the entire origin in my opinion. It should've just been the robber who stole the money. Nobody else! 2) I think the symbiote/Venom story could've been done without breaking up MJ and Peter. They shouldn't have done that. Of course MJ and Peter would've been married if it weren't for the Studio, Avi Arad, and that female producer who I can't think of. They forced the Venom/the Symbiote in along with Gwen Stacey who was a dumb blond instead of smart like in the comics. They shouldn't have been forced in. Especially since Raimi absolutely hates Venom. You shouldn't force a character that the director hates into the movie. Which is obviously why Venom was only in the movie for about 10-15 minutes. Venom. He is one of my favorite villains outside of GG, Doc Ock, and Kingpin (who unfortunately couldn't be used. I would've rather he have been forced into the movie instead of Venom/the symbiote and Gwen Stacey. Then we could've had Sand Man as a henchman for the Kingpin which would've been so much better). The symbiote/Venom needs at least 2 movies to really work. This movie is proof of that. I guess I can't blame Raimi that much since he didn't even want to do him. I blame the studio and the two producers who should've known better. I believe they should all lose their jobs because of what they did to Venom in this movie (the Studio and Avia Arad and the female producer). 3) Then there's Harry who suddenly who doesn't get enough screen time and attention as he should've. I did like that Harry teams up with Peter at the end. Anyway this movie would've been better without all the stuff that I've mentioned."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","2","9 August 2009"," Oh, what a tangled web we weave
","I base this upon the 2-Disc Special Edition. That's not sand choking you... it's the three plots that could easily each be a movie in itself. The writing has already been mentioned. It's impossible to do justice to that much content, and while it is a mess at times, it doesn't do as bad as could be expected. This has fewer cringe-inducing moments than the first two, but what there is is potent. For the first time in the trilogy, I actually laughed when I was meant to(and quite a few times where I wasn't). I wouldn't object to every single frame that contains singing and dancing in this to be excised, and possibly torched. The action is engaging and cool. I never found Maguire threatening. The added characters are underused, not developed enough and kind of a waste of a lot of fantastic comic material. Like the second flick, this didn't have a finished script ready when production began, and oh boy did it show this time. They managed to work it out on that sequel, not with this one. It still looks excellent. The effects are astounding. There are memorable sequences in this. The cast is all great. Grace obviously doesn't make an impressive, well, if you should know what he plays, you probably already do, so to avoid spoilers, I won't put it here. I get why they gave him the role, and his performance isn't ""poor"", as such. It's unfortunate that the decision was made to jam so much into this one, when it could be better if split up. All in all, this is entertaining, if not as dramatic and epic as it would like to be. There are several featurettes, most of which I will review at their respective entries on this site, photo galleries, trailers(for this and other flicks), a music video and two commentary tracks, a Raimi & actors one, and a film-makers(producers) one. I recommend this to those looking for a fun follow-up to the first two, that tries for, and generally succeeds reasonably at, being as deep and interesting as its immediate predecessor. 7/10"

","Spider-man 3 is the only film i've seen in IMAX.It was the top film of 2007(money-wise). Some people thought it was a huge disappointment. I can see why people could think it was a disappointment, some of it was, at least. For instance, Topher Grace plays Venom, who is actually a big villain. Venom is one of my favorite villain, and he made a small appearance. It's hard for a great director like Sam Rami to make a sequel to the fantastic Spider-man 2. That was my favorite film of 2004. I didn't hate it like everyone else, but it had it's flaws. I found a bit of the film to be silly. When that stupid model chick( Bryce Dallas Howard)is falling out of the building, she grabs onto a phone. There's no way that a phone is going to save you. Thomas Haden Church plays the Sandman. I like Thomas Haden Church, but the villain idea is pretty stupid. There's now way that sand could actually kill someone, unless it blinds them. The final thing. Spider-man irritates me in this film... I wouldn't of minded if he did die. But I liked Spider-man 3 despite it's flaws.I think it's better than the first film.Though I actually was convinced that The Green Goblin was a villain. I was right too... because Willem Dafoe has made an appearance in every film. Spider-man 3 is pretty cool and entertaining. It was a cool IMAX experience."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","8","1","2","29 July 2009"," Good
","The Spider-Man films are the zenith of comic book filmdom, and, save for a bit of middle filmitis, and too many villains (but the screenwriters almost reconcile this flaw anyway), this film comes damned close to being the best of the three. Its comic book sensibility (not striving to be 'too' real), its writing, acting, and even special effects, add up to an enjoyable experience. Is it Antonioni, Bergman, Kurosawa? No. But, as a comic book film, it doesn't have to be (and, likely, it simply constitutionally could not be, for it is based on an art form for juveniles). Still, it's significantly better than its critics claimed, and this is likely because there is a tendency to subconsciously anticipate failure in such a successful series. The difference between bad critics and great ones is that they don't just anticipate failure, they long for it. I put my expectations aside, let the film play out, and was rewarded. What a concept!"
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","2","22 July 2009"," Handles too much but nevertheless a funnier and enjoyable adaptation
","Peter Parker (McGuire) is enjoying his fame as Spider-man which distracts his attentions from his unappreciated girlfriend (Dunst) and new villains Venom and Sandman.<br/><br/>The sequel to the then most successful box office smash of all time brought an exciting prospect for all Spidey fans in two of the most recognized and established villains from the comic book series: Sandman and Venom.<br/><br/>Now that the films were an established brand and anticipation could rival any other big name release like Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean this was a worldwide smash, and with good reason.<br/><br/>The trailer broke minds and fans flooded in to see a collection of fantastic action sequences, intriguing characters and a collaborative story of love, drama and good vs evil, so why doesn't this film match the previous two releases? Spider-Man 2 brought around the unfortunate villain Dr Octopus and with that one of the most stunning graphically enhanced action sequences ever seen in a comic book adaptation: the train sequence. Absolute brilliance in all terms for adrenaline, visual and shock. The story wasn't bad either as Parker debated his purpose in life.<br/><br/>Trying to follow the bonds of its predecessor Spider-man 3 takes a sentimental issue of friendship and love whilst juxtaposing real life with some tough villains.<br/><br/>Yes, there is an awful lot happening here. Parker's fame, Watson's career, Osborn's loyalty and there are a host of new protagonists to contend with. So at a good 2 hours 20 minutes there should be sufficient room to cram everything in? Well this is where the fabrication and good intentions to fulfil fan's expectations starts to unwind. There is simply too much going on with little focus on the significance of situations. Everyone has their own story to tell, which is fair enough but when mingling them all together everything just feels too perfect for the story's own good. Like Marco's involvement with Ben Parker. Like Peter coincidentally in the same place as Eddie Brock with Venom. It all fits too perfectly to be unrealistic. Not to mention a vast majority of the dialogue is clunky and cheesy.<br/><br/>But this is not all doom and gloom. If you forget the clunky scripting you see some well choreographed fighting, some established visuals and perhaps the funnier side of any of the films in the series. Whether you are a critique or a spider-man fanatic, there is no denying the spectacle of this Raimi picture. It is enjoyable and an obvious watch if you enjoyed the first two releases.<br/><br/>Raimi is once more on form and handles the script as best as he can. The early shot of MJ and Peter on the web looking at shooting stars is a bit awkward romantically but the unfortunate crane sequence is well handled.<br/><br/>Despite the plot this is a sharp fun film with once more stunning action and fantasy."
"freemantle_uk","7","1","2","30 June 2009"," Needed more Venom
","Spider-man 3 is the weakest of the Spiderman films, but it is still an entertaining superhero film.<br/><br/>Set a few years after Spider-man 2, Peter Parker's life is on the right track, he is doing well in University, he is going out with Mary-Jane who is starting in a Broadway Show and Spiderman is loved by New Yorkers. But they are problems on the horizon, Harry Osborn had found out that Peter was Spiderman and blames him for his father's death. He takes his father's formula and found his equipment to make him the Green Goblin Jr.. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a petty theft, has escaped from prison and after running onto a scientific base he becomes the powerful villain the Sandman. As well an meteorite clashes into Central Park, releasing the symbiote, that gives Spiderman extra power but makes him explore his dark side. In Peter's personal life they are also problems. He has a new rival at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who has eyes on Peter's job. Peter himself becomes more self-centred and thinks more about himself then Mary-Jane, who herself is depress after loosing her role in the show.<br/><br/>The Sandman turns out to be the man who really killed Peter's Uncle Ben, and as Spiderman sets out to gain revenge. Harry Osborn wants revenge against Spiderman for his father's death and after being unable to match Spidey physically, takes him on emotionally. Eddie Brock ends wanting revenge against Peter after he looses his job and girlfriend, blaming Peter.<br/><br/>Spider-man 3 lacks the emotional depth and character development the first two films did, but they still is some, and in tone to the previous films, compared to another superhero threequel, X-Men: the Last Stand. The cast do they best, James Franco has more to do then he did in the previous films. Thomas Haden Church made a good Sandman. Topher Grace was sadly miscasted as Eddie Brock, but he does his best. Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty hot as Gwan Stacey. They are good action sequences and so was the CGI, the best in the series. There are excellent fights between Spidey and Green Goblin Jr., Spidey and the Sandman in the subway and the final fight scene. Venom and Sandman looked impressive. Also, James Cromwell, an excellent actor has a small role in the film.<br/><br/>The two big problems are they are too many villains and the characterisation was just all wrong. By have 3 (4 if you count the inter-demon), make the audience lost at times. They should have been one or two villains just to make the film more manageable for be the makers and the audience. The Sandman was portrayed also to the point that he was a sympathetic character, ruining the character. Venom, one of the most popular villains in Marvel Comics is cruelly underused. He should have been saved for the next film, being set up at the end of Spider-man 3. But the director Sam Raimi, disliked the character, hating his lack of morality, but that's why he is such a great villain. In the comics they is more to Venom, Eddie Brock blames Spiderman for the lost of his journalist career and he was committed Catholic, hating killing and even protected a young family. Raimi shouldn't have been forced to use Venom in the film.<br/><br/>Other minor problems are that the film is a little two long and they seems to be a small continuity problem, how could Mary-Jane be doing well as a stage-actress in plays, then go to Broadway and then just become a singing waitress. Finally, the symbiote just happens to crash in the middle of Central Park. It would have been more realistic if the film shown the symbotic crashing to Earth in the Space Shuttler like in the cartoon in the 90s or being studied at the University as another opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, Spidey 3 is a decent, but not a great film. I personally hope the Kingpin is used as a villain in Spider-man 4 and that Venom is done properly after Raimi's reign in the director's chair is over."

","I will admit that this film is not as great as it's previous movies. However, it is still Spider-Man. As a fan, you have to watch this movie with a open mind. And watch it as a Spider-Man fan, not a critic. As a Spider-Man movie, it is just fine. Great action, great spidey action, great special effects, the usual drama between spidey, his friends, n villains, good music that goes along with the scenes, and pretty good comedy. They showed what Sandman can do, and can't do. They showed what the black suit can really bring out in someone, even silliness. They showed that Marry Jane, and Peter Parker (aka) Spider-Man aren't really ready for marriage. And they also showed Harry Asborn (aka) Green Goblin Jr. is not a true villain, and in the end he is a true friend.<br/><br/>This movie is sizzling. There are a few scenes that I will admit that are goofy and un needed. For example when Peter Parker is walking though the city n giving hand jesters to almost every girl. Or the jazz bar scene where he gets up and dances to show off for Marry Jane. And I will admit that without those scenes they could have shown a few more minutes of Venom. But other then those two scenes, I think, I believe this film deserves more credit then what everyone else has given it. It is a fun, and exciting movie to watch, and it is fun as a Spider-Man movie to watch. It is a great addition to the franchise, and all I have to say is, Bravo, Bravo."
"tburke85","4","1","2","18 May 2009"," Spider-man 3 A Major Let Down
","With the success of Spider-man 1 and 2. I had high hopes for Spider-man 3 which in my opinion was the worst of the trilogy. It was somewhat entertaining but the movie ended up being a big disappointment. I'll start off with the good before going into what I think went wrong with Spider-man 3. It starts off great with a blistering Ariel fight/chase sequence between Peter and Harry who has taken his father's Goblin persona. I thought the whole cast did an admirable job in their roles Tobey Maguire is good as Peter Parker and Spider-man. Kristen Dunst is okay as Mary Jane although she's not given much to do except look angry and whine, James Franco is solid as both a hero and a super villain who's finally given something to do. Thomas Haden Church gives an equally impressive performance as Flint Marko but unfortunately he's not in it all that much considering his CGI counterpart takes over for large parts of his scenes. Church doesn't have much dialogue either. Topher Grace does his usual thing as Eddie Brock but he makes for a terrible Venom no offense. I just couldn't buy him being a sinister super villain. Thomas Haden Curch actually would've been better in that role or maybe Vin Disiel. Bryce Dallas Howard does her best as Gwen Stacy in a role that seems to be entirely wasted and the rest of the cast turn in good performances including J. K Simmons who continues to steal every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-man 3 had everything going for it then about an hour into it things go from bad to worse and it goes downhill from there. Now to the bad it feels like Sam Raimi who is a fantastic filmmaker tried to put too much into one movie. Peter Parker's turn to the dark side because of the symboite had potential and did bring much comic relief to the film but it wasn't as interesting as it should have been and the humor started to get a little silly after a while. Also the introduction of three villains was a bit much (The New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom not to mention the enemy within himself). With the exception of Harry's Goblin who was well developed, Sandman and Venom lacked development and screen time. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment about Spider-man 3 is Venom. Director Sam Raimi had stated he disliked the character but was coerced to include him in the film. Well his disinterest in the character shows. I'll admit I'm not the biggest Venom fan but I do know he's one of Spider-man's most iconic and dangerous villains. I was pretty excited when I found out he was going to be in this film but I ended up being very disappointed considering he gets at the most 8 to 10 minutes of screen time. He doesn't show up until extremely late into the movie and only gets one fight with Spider-man at the end that lasts probably about a total of fifteen seconds since Venom disappears for much of the final battle at the end. He's easily defeated and wasn't that much of a threat like he was in the comics. If the film had cut out Sandman leaving Harry and Venom as the main villains the movie to me would've been a lot better considering except for Harry, Sandman and Venom are just poorly developed. Overall Spider-man 3 is a decent film with some okay action sequences but they never last long except for the first fight between Harry and Peter and then the anti-climatic battle at the end. But the movie failed to live up to my expectations and was a major disappointment. Maybe Spider-man 4 if they do indeed make another one will give us the Spider-man movie we've been waiting for with a compelling story, well developed characters, menacing villains, and more action."

Down the street and all! Then there was Mary Jane who was soooooooooo annoying and whiny through the WHOLE movie. I hated her. Topher Grace was probably the worst character in the entire movie. He made Venom so unbelievable that it wasn't even funny. Many scenes were also pointless, e.g Aunt May explains how she met uncle Ben. WHO CARES!

","I really liked the first Spiderman Film, and thought the second one was lacking. If anything I was hoping that the third Spiderman Film would be like the first and not the second and be a great film. I was disappointed big time.<br/><br/>A lot is going on in terms of the plot. Harry flies around on a flying disc as the New Goblin and gets his short term memory messed up after Peter Parker throws him into the ground. Parker then decides he wants to propose to Mary Jane. Meanwhile, a runaway jail escapee gets mixed up with sand molecules and becomes the Sand Man. An evil symbiote from Outer Space merges with Parkers Spiderman suit and creates an eviler symbiote version of Spiderman that is all black. Also, Mary Jane has issues with Parker, the true identity of Ben Parkers killer is discovered, and Parker gets sharp competition for his photography job.<br/><br/>First of all, I think the plot and story was bad. It had good parts to it, I think it is interesting how the Symbioate merged with Spiderman. ALso I liked how Parker decided to try to propose to Mary Jane. But there seemed to be too much going on. There were too many side stories and lame parts in the film that seemed to not need to be included.<br/><br/>In the second SPiderman film I complained that Parker was not Spiderman enough in the film. In this film I think that is an issue once again. Spiderman is not seen enough. It is all about Peter Parker once again, that was OK I guess for one film but it really disappointed me how in this film Spiderman does not show up enough again.<br/><br/>The Villains I think were too underdeveloped in this film. The Sandman gets an OK explanation, but not good enough. The Sandman was an interesting choice but I did not think that he had a good portrayal. You hear about his family and his motives resulting because of his family but it just seemed like something was lacking. Also I think that there were too many villains and with no development that is a major issue for me.<br/><br/>Venom also appears in this film. I like Venom a lot and he really is one of the greatest villains ever in Marvel History. Actually I think he is the best. But he should not have been second fiddle to any villain let alone THE SANDMAN as he is in this film. Venom should have been a major villain and in this film he is not in it enough. I liked what he looked like, but the guy playing him did a bad job I think also.<br/><br/>I did like how the Symbiote infected Spiderman and made him do bad things. But they should have built on that idea more.<br/><br/>THe action was OK at times also. Like when Spiderman was fighting the Sandman the first time it was pretty cool. Also I thought the fight with Venom looked cool at times. But nothing too spectacular.<br/><br/>So, I think this was a disappointment for the most part. It was OK at times, but should have been so much better. All I can say to finish, is that I hope that Venom gets to be in another film so that he gets the film depiction that he really deserves.

","Spiderman 3 doesn't out-do the original but its still a worthy enjoyable action flick. We see more then one villain in this installment, the Green Goblin returns, The Sandman makes his debut and the Venom enters the mysterious world of Spiderman. But, the movie has its down-falls, one of them its utterly failing cheesy effects. It was those scenes that made me give this movie a mediocre rating, it wasn't funny nor enjoyable to watch, it was totally inappropriate and not needed and tends to get plenty of negative attention. But, the rest is good; nice action, a good in-depth plot, and some very suspenseful scenes."
"long-ford","Null","1","2","25 February 2009"," A satisfying watch despite its flaws
","I surprisingly enjoyed this sequel despite its many flaws. The plot negates the first film by contriving a new killer for Peter Parker's Uncle Ben, and there's an inexplicable lapse in logic late in the film. Still the opening action scene is exciting and the birth of Sandman is memorable. The CGI is generally impressive. Only the climactic fight scenes feel incomplete, almost straight out of a video game. The acting is uniformly good. People have panned Tobey Maguire but I found his 'bad Parker' scenes quite funny. Topher Grace is good but Venom isn't given enough screen time. A satisfying watch despite its flaws.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"
"curren-waters","7","1","2","11 February 2009"," Under appreciated
","Spider-Man 3 is totally under appreciated, though it does have its ups and downs. My first gripe is with one of the villains, Venom. For one thing, Topher Grace is just way too campy to play him. Maybe if Thomas Haden Church, the guy who played Sandman, played Venom, it would've worked out a lot better, but looking at something like That 70's Show, I think Topher Grace was too silly to play the part.<br/><br/>Speaking of silly, this movie attempted to be a lot more funny than the other two, which I'm guessing is supposed to make the movie less boring; not that it was ever boring to begin with, but I guess they were just widening their range and trying to appeal to a whole new audience, kind of like what Nintendo did with the Wii. Now, judging by your taste, you either hate the silliness, or you laugh your ass off; I personally LMAO. There's nothing wrong with going silly; Spider-Man doesn't have any reputation of seriousness IMHO; it always had a reputation of action, so unlike Batman, it wasn't a bad idea for Spider-Man to go silly.<br/><br/>Speaking of action, the action in this movie wasn't disappointing. But there were some parts that seemed kind of improbable, but that happens with a lot of movies, so it doesn't really matter to me.<br/><br/>The Sandman is a very interesting villain; he's not a maniac, and he's not seeking revenge; he's just desperate to get a crap load of money to help his sick daughter. Also, the way he shape-shifts is quite interesting; it's kind of like Clayface from Batman, or the robot from Terminator 2.<br/><br/>The black suit concept is obviously the last full-length movie concept they could take from the comics, but I honestly think that it's a little too much to fit into one movie. Here's how it should've worked; the meteorite crashes down, the alien goo gets to Peter, it gets onto his Spider-Man costume, he wears it under his day clothes, acts like one of the popular guys, and then, he convinces himself to get rid of the costume, then it gets onto Eddy Brock, he transforms into Venom...... then the movie ends right there, and we wait for Spider-Man 4. But sadly, they tried to fit it into 2 1/2 hours, and Venom was just a quickly used character that we'll never see again.<br/><br/>So, Spider-Man 3 has its problems, but it's still enjoyable. Was it better than the other two Spider-Man movies? No. Was it better than the other crap we got in 2007? YES, YES, HELL YES!!!! 7/10"
"faruk7221","4","1","2","1 January 2009"," Sucks!!!
","I unfortunately saw this movie in cinema. About one third of the people there were children. I would like to know whether this sequel aimed to attract just children and adults who are mentally not more mature than children. In whole sequel emotions, messages, characters are not beyond the complexity that a ten year old can easily understand. Especially in this third movie these are more easy to see. Look how inner turmoil of spidey is depicted: he wears black clothes, changes his hairstyle, and joins the dark side. Was all these arranged so just to explain the change in spidey's character to seven year old boys? Seeing those scenes people in the theatre could not help laughing. I am sure that Sam Raimi knows well that even a teen experiences his turmoils far deeper and do not wear black when he changed some of his opinions. especially upon seeing the dark knight I am sure that this man do not aim to make a respectable film of our hero but he just wants to exploit him to make money easily. He knows the children are not like adult cinema-goers, they will certainly come when they hear that a new spidey is shot and furthermore each child will bring his parents together so making the film for children is really profitable. This is why he even did not try to make a serious, respectable film out of spidey. To sum up all three movies suck and among them especially this third one."
"Agent_Bauer","8","1","2","26 December 2008"," The Perfect Blockbuster
","The spider-man movie series is simply the best superhero movie series ever. The first instalment was great, the second was even better. This third movie is the best of them all. Blockbusters nowadays often turn out to be huge letdowns. You get a flashy trailer with all the best bits and basically that pretty much is the whole film. Spider-man 3 has it all action, thriller, romance, comedy, drama. This is certainly a bit darker than the other movies but it has some light moments. There's a great cameo by Bruce Campbell and J K Simmons chips in with his magnificent portrayal of editor J Jonah Jameson. You wouldn't be wrong in assuming that he was born to play the role. The story moves at an electrifying pace and the massive runtime seems to just whiz by with hardly a dull moment. Hardcore spidey fans are complaining that venom hardly got any screen time and it is true as Topher Grace has only about 3 or 4 scenes in the movie but thats what the producers wanted. Venoms story is not told in as much detail as fans would have liked but incorporating that would increase the runtime by at least another hour, which for a blockbuster would be quite ludicrous. Everything has been packed into the 2 hours 15mins or whatever it is but everything works really well when you consider that spider-man is Peter Parker's story. The whole movie is about him and his trials and tribulations in becoming the greatest superhero ever. The movie has good moral values and messages but other than that, you can switch your brain off, sit back and enjoy this blockbusting experience."
"TheCloaker","2","1","2","18 October 2008"," God awful.. But you have to see it to believe it.
","The only true problem with this movie.. Lets see. Probably the Marketing. If the marketing had said we would be dealing with Parkers inner most Emo, or terrible acting, it would have been more true to course. But for some reason the Marketing department for this movie marketed a different film.. One that made you believe you were going to see the epic battle between Venom and Spider-man. Instead we find a 3 hour mess of plots that should have been broken between 3 movies.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, the director wanted to make a quick buck, and in doing so may have damaged an amazing series of movies. Spider Man 1 was surpassed by far with Spider-Man 2, and following the trend people believed Spider Man 3 was going to be EPIC. I myself found myself outside the doors for the opening of spider man.. First in line, hours early with my 8 month pregnant wife and my In Laws.<br/><br/>I am just sad that I took them to see a different movie than the one I saw in the previews.<br/><br/>Now if we are going to grade the trailer..

Peter Parker loses all hope until his suit turns black and becomes stronger and faster but effects his behavior with a darker attitude. Also we finally get to see Venom (Topher Grace) on the big screen after long awaited! This movie is alright but not the best out of the whole series. I really think that putting Sandman in this movie wasn't necessary, I thought Venom should have had more screen time and I thought this movie had too many sub- plots to it. Plus I didn't like it how they made Peter Parker so emo to the point where he acted like a little whiny bitch. Other than those nit picks, I thought the movie was alright but if they're going to go for a fourth movie then they need to not make so many sub-plots and stick to the main story."

","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has everything going well in his life. He has wonderful if struggling actress/singer/girlfriend Mary Jane Waston (Kristen Dunst), loving great-mother (Rosemary Harris), doing extremely well at college, still working at the newspaper job posing pictures of himself as Spider-Man but he has problems with Harry Osborn (James Franco)... his former best friend. Which Harry still believes that Peter/Spider-Man killed him. But now Peter faces new problems, when an escape convict (Thomas Haden Chruch) is molecularly transformed into The Sandman, an ambitious photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace)... who's after Peter's job and Peter finds himself addicted to an alien fungus that turns Peter/Spider-Man to the dark side.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, The Gift, A Simple Plan) made an entertaining if plot-heavy sequel to the ever popular ""Spider-Man Series"". The cast are good here... especially Dunst, Chruch, Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard (Who appears in a memorable small supporting role). Director Raimi has fun making Peter Parker an insensitive jerk half of the time... especially when Peter turns into a sleazy (Probably Emo) stud muffin. The main problem with ""Spider-Man 3"" is the screenplay by the director, his brother Ivan Raimi (Army of Darkness) and Two Time Oscar-Winner:Alvin Sergent (Nuts, Ordinary People, What About Bob ?). There's too many storyline, some are never truly satisfying (Like the Eddie Brock or Venom character), the film could have been better written or fleshing out the new supporting characters even more... so the movie could be longer.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two enjoyable commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director and cast members:Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Chruch, Grace & Howard. Commentary two is by the filmmakers as in producers, editor and special effects supervisor. DVD also includes an music video, bloopers (some are extremely funny) and an photo gallery. ""Super-Man 3"" is the least entertaining of the three movies so far but i have to admit, it does improve after repeated viewings. It was the highest grossing film of 2007... especially considering the $259 million budget! ""Spider-Man 3"" is still worthwhile. But i think ""Army of Darkness"" also known as ""Evil Dead 3"" is better than ""Spider-Man 3"". B-Movie Cult Star:Bruce Campbell has an terrific small bit in his cameo as the Maitre 'D. Super 35. (****/*****)."
"Chrivhec","7","1","2","18 August 2008"," A fantastic film that surpasses its two originals.
","Where do I begin? It's not easy to write a comment after seeing a movie that (due to the special effects almost literally) blew you away. But I gladly do it anyway. First of all, it has to be said that the current IMDb average of 6.5 doesn't give this movie the credit it deserves. It deserves a lot more than that. In no aspect is Spider-Man 3 a disappointment or just a bad movie, not by a long shot. It's a film that will be remembered as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.<br/><br/>Obviously, the 250 million dollar budget served the movie extremely well. The special effects are simply amazing and go beyond anything we have seen before. But the fact that the film is great isn't only due to those effects. If there's one thing that's indisputable, it's the high quality of the acting. Tobey Maguire again proves his talent and his capability of performing as well as possible in every role he accepts. Knowing that some scenes involve blue screen, it can't always be easy to act like it's the real thing. Nevertheless, he did absolutely great. Like in the previous two movies, Kirsten Dunst is just about perfect as the beautiful M.J. and gave another great performance, just like James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Bryse Dallas Howard and Topher Grace.<br/><br/>Unlike the critics, I disagree that the film would have too many story lines to tell. During the entire film I had absolutely no difficulties with following the story, I even thought the stories came together just fine. Personally I really like the concept of Spider-Man having a battle within himself and also realizing that he is not above the bad people he tries to stop. That's why this is such a good sequel to Spider-Man 2, because in the second movie Peter realizes that he can't walk away from his destiny and that it's the right thing to believe in yourself and in what you are doing, whereas in this film, he knows that his destiny is to be a hero, but he struggles to learn what means he should use to do so. So Sam Raimi isn't only a good director, but also a fine screenwriter. <br/><br/>I'd give this movie an 8.5, but since that's not an option, I gave it an 8. The reason why I haven't given it a 9, is because there are a few (very few) things that I disliked, or I rather had seen them differently. It would have been better if it was explained where the meteor and the symbiote could have come from, although it's clear it's not of this earth, but still. And although I was watching with full enthusiasm when Harry chose to team up with Peter to fight the Sandman and Venom, I thought it was such a shame that Harry had to die. On the one hand the fact that Harry, after wanting to kill Peter for a long time, sacrificed himself for his friend is a very strong concept, but on the other hand it's just a shame that that character had to die. It would have been very interesting, Spider-Man having an ally, and maybe a very small cliffhanger for a possible fourth film. But then again, if Harry hadn't died, maybe the ending wouldn't have been as good as it was now, which was still pretty strong, I think. Peter and M.J. can still find hope and are willing to have faith in each other once again, after everything that has happened. Now that's what you can call a strong ending.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film very much, and whether or not there is coming a fourth movie, I wouldn't mind if there isn't, because this film was a fantastic conclusion."
"retroguy02","7","1","2","11 August 2008"," Spider-Man 3's $256m budget buys it all the action-fest glory, but an effective story requires brains
","I went in Spider-Man 3 expecting at least a few sacrifices in the character development since there are three major villains along with a substantial supporting character (Gwen Stacy) crammed in a 150-minute movie, and because of that I wasn't very disappointed, even though commonsense would have been to limit the scope to no more than two villains. Honestly, I don't think Spider-Man 3 could have been a lot better than it already is with the overbearing challenge it takes on.<br/><br/>Of all villains, Venom gets the least character development, despite having the most star power. Even worse, Eddie Brock seems deliberately overacted to the point of self-parody. The Sandman gets more character development, even if it's not a lot better, but due the cumbersome and sluggish nature of his character he's not as interesting when it comes to wham-bam! action.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that Harry Osborn as the high-tech New Goblin is the best villain, mainly because he's already had some great character development in the previous two movies; unfortunately, he is ridiculously killed off at the end while trying to 'help' Spidey against the other two villains (don't ask why). Unfortunately, Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy, especially the latter, are almost ignorable in terms of their contribution to the story.<br/><br/>The action sequences are superbly choreographed as usual, with each movement being well-defined, clear and thrilling. Early on, there is a dizzyingly paced aerial battle between the New Goblin and Peter Parker that takes place mostly in narrow alleys. It's worth mentioning that in a battle sequence so fast and during nighttime, it's hard to properly define every movement, and Spider-Man 3 does this amazingly well.<br/><br/>After witnessing the New Goblin battle, the climax feels a bit sluggish, but nonetheless entertaining and action-packed. Unfortunately, the storyline that preludes it makes it seem less credible; I mean, how do you create a Sandman and Venom union with a one-liner? The Spidey and New Goblin union is even more ridiculous, thanks largely to the Osborns' butler.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly stiff from the main cast, except for Topher Grace, who goes over to the other end of the spectrum almost comically. Tobey Maguire tries to make the best of a hodgepodge script, and gives an overall decent performance, save for a comically ridiculous bit where Peter apparently turns 'emo' under the symbiote's influence. J.K. Simmons' comic relief as J. Jonah Jameson is top-notch as ever and wildly entertaining. Aside, Spider-Man 3 is generally lighter in mood and less serious than the previous two Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>While Spider-Man 3 is a considerable step down from Spider-Man 2 in every aspect, and even the first Spider-Man movie in terms of story, it does a decent job of concealing its predictably inadequate character development with its thoroughly enthralling action sequences. RATING: 7/10"
"kalendra274","8","1","2","27 July 2008"," Throughly great, but not excellent
","I thought Spider-Man 3 was going to be the best of the three, and yes it was, it was great, but not excellent. I felt that their were too many characters, which makes the movie confusing and let's say, I was a bit confused.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, a young college student, has a special secret, as we all know he's obviously Spider-Man. New villains come to town such as, ""The Sand Man"" and ""The Venom"", and Peter a.k.a Spider-Man has to save the world from villains, even stronger than you have ever imagined and try to go through the stress he is facing especially with his true love (Mary-Jane Watson).<br/><br/>The performances by the cast, scored hundreds of points for the movie, they were all realistic and phenomenal, especially by Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker a.k.a Spidey) and Kirsten Dunst (M.J Watson). <br/><br/>The plot, like I said, had too much dialogue and too much characters. Which is very confusing for the audience, especially if they're not familiar with Spider-Man, so to make it better, throw all the unnecessary chunks of the movie out and shorten it a little and try to have it with no more than 10 characters.<br/><br/>The special effects were out-of-this-world! It definitely saved the movie from being a disaster and I believe, next to the performances, the special effects were the best thing about this movie, so well done.<br/><br/>The costumes, settings etc. were great too, the idea of making the setting be in different parts of Modern Day New York was clever, because it builds an effect that not all Superhero movies should be in some fancy place like ""Translvaynia"" and that the movie stars Spider-Man living two different lives in a normal American city. The costumes were a positive point to the movie as well, the new black suit for Spider-Man was fantastic, it really fits in with the new Peter, and all the other costumes for the rest of the cast were all splendid, they don't wear fancy clothes,(only their in some sort of play or date or even fighting against villains) they just wear clothes that any else would wear.<br/><br/>To bring it to a conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie, with great performances, special effects etc. but what needs improving is the plot, which is too much for the audience and it sometimes gets boring and pretty confusing, but other than that it was an absolute joy to watch, I can't wait for the fourth movie, I'm sure it will be as well as this! <br/><br/>8/10"

","Spiderman 3 would be a better movie if there hadn't been so many things happening at once. Sandman, Green Goblin, Venom and Spiderman's dark sidehow many things? In my opinion, they should have toned it down and put some stuff in spiderman-4. My sister ( was disappointed that Venom (arch nemesis) was killed so easily. BUTAlthough all of these conflicts seemed overwhelming at times, I felt that this movie was taken in the best way with all of those conflicts. Anyways, Richard Corliss (Time Magazine) accurately commented on how the male characters in this movie were more ahem* sensitive than usual. I daresay that Spiderman cried much more than all the women put together in the movie and at the end his sobbing became so intense that my cousins started laughing. Maybe I am weird, but Peter Parker seemed so emotional and boyish to me that I was happy when he turned into the tough and insensitive guy for a change. Sandman also shed many tears, sinking this movie to an unusual depth. Although I found this male crying thing different, I'm not sure whether it aroused tears or snickers. I guess it's different for everybody and you'll have to decide for yourself"

However things get out of hand, a criminal named Marko Flint (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison as he accidentally finds himself as he was the true killer of Uncle Ben in a testing range where he accidentally finds himself in the middle of a experiment involving radioactive sand that makes him into The Sandman.

It somehow changes his personality and he has been having an affair with beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) making MJ jealous, not only that but new photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) becomes Parker's rival. Later as Peter rejects the costume, it absorbs Brock turning him into a sharp-toothed grinning Bizarro version of Spider-Man called Venom whom join forces with Sandman on a diabolical scheme that only Spider-Man can stop.<br/><br/>A very weak but entertaining entry of the popular superhero franchise! nowhere as good as the first or as great as the second, this does have good and bad points. The bad points for example is the goofy dance sequence where Parker acts like Jim Carrey's The Mask, three villains instead of 2 or 1, and a complex storyline that can go over the audience's heads. The Villains were not deep or hard enough like the first two movies where they were actually developed, but there's good points like some of the returning cast like JK Simmons with Rosemarry Harris back with appearances by Bruce Campbell, Stan Lee, William Defoe, and Ted Raimi. It does have Sam Raimi's trademark direction with stunning special effects even with Venom and good action sequences.<br/><br/>Yes it is the weakest of the series but does have good entertainment, i hope the fourth one coming out in 2011 will improve on this one."

"malmroes","8","1","2","4 July 2008"," Good movie, but lacks that joy from the old days
","Spiderman gets pinned by nothing less than three villains this time. It is clear that many have complained about this. One can agree that there is a risk of the different character's plots of getting too shallow, but we already knew the story of Harry Osbourne and why he is angry at Parker, so that is one less to be concerned about. Now Sandman, as I recall, was a whole new character that Raimi made dedicated entirely to the movie. Personally I did not mind him getting involved in the plot in the way he did (I will not go further into details for the benefit of readers who has not watched the movie yet,) but some might also think that it ruined a lot of the initial take on the story, which was created in the first movie and furthermore that they abandoned the concept in the early cartoons and Graphic Novels (which I am a bit, but not much acquainted with). This is of course a huge let down especially for the fans of the original Spiderman stories. The bit I was looking forward to in the movie was how they had created Venom and what their take on him would be. I remember sitting in the living room watching Spidey on the TV fighting this weird substance from Mars, first because it was going to take over his personality and later Brock who attained it. It became my favorite villain in the series. I did not quite feel the satisfaction of Venom's personality in the movie though, mainly because it did not quite fit the story in the TV series. The CGI is a complete other issue, and I believe that they graphically made Venom just like everyone had imagined. The thing with today though is that graphics are not all and people are famishing for some good stories to the animated characters. Today many companies make animated movies and CGI and it has become so standardized that you can not exceed the barrier of the audience just by relying on technology. On the other hand if the animation lacks because of the standard expected today, people are disappointed as well, but we will save that for some other time. As many other people I also agree on the fact that Parker was ridiculed in the most extreme way as possible. First of all his character does not fit this kind of persona, and secondly, Tobey did not manage to convince me of Parker having changed due to the new outfit. It was a bit misplaced in the movie, but it was quite obvious to see what the director wanted with those scenes. You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out I might add. But besides that incident the movie was quite appalling to me and it could definitely have been done better, but many sequels end up being minor movies in which many people might think that it was just made due to commercial reasons. I did enjoy the moments in which one could recognize some of the original ideas, for instance that Venom is vulnerable to high pitched sounds and I do believe that Spiderman 3 had other moments. The soundtrack in Spiderman 3 pretty much sticked to the kind of music played in the other movies and one did not doubt which movie the music belonged to. The same theme song in the start of the other two movies also played in this one, so that was satisfying.<br/><br/>So to sum up: The CGI was amazing and the way The Sandman forms is very thoroughly made and you are not the least doubting which character you are looking at when Venom is on the take. Spiderman as usual also looked pretty good and the animation in the combat scenes did not falter much either. The story line could have been more thorough and for the more critical fans it might even have been a disappointment. Since I am a fan of Spiderman I decided to give it 8 stars instead of 7. It could have been better, but compared to other sequels it was quite good."

The action is great. 6.Sandman, to my eyes looks similar to what he did in the comic books. 7.I like spidey's black costume. 8.It has an interesting premise. 9.It is dark. 10.It is good to watch when you are bored. The Bad: 1.There are some cheesy scenes and if you have scene the movie, then you probably know what I am talking about. 2.The dialogue is not that good but hey, it is a Spider-Man movie, not a Shakespeare play. 3.Not enough of Venom. I wish they could have made it a bit longer to show more of venom because Venom is my favorite Spider-Man villain. 4.The acting is not as good as the acting in the first 2 films, but hey, at least some of the acting is alright. 5. Even though I liked the black Spider-Man suit, it does not look like the way it did in the comics. Well, now I will talk about the reason why this movie is not for everyone. There are some scenes that are silly. Some people say that it has to many villains. To those people who said that, did you guys ever see Batman The Movie(No, no, no, not the 1989 film, the 1966 film based on the TV series) It had 4 villains, was it cheesy, yes, but enjoyable. I thought this movie was like a comic book on the big screen(yes, I know I stole that from the angry video game nerd). I know that some of you are going to say to me your stupid but, keep in mind we all have different taste. If you listened to the reviews, then I say go rent it, you might think it is the best of the series, you might think it is the worst of the series. I thought this one was the best one yet. So my overall rating for Spider-Man 3 is 8 out of 10 stars. Enjoy the ride. Thank you. Well that was probably the longest review I have ever written so far."
"MLDinTN","9","1","2","9 June 2008"," I thought it was better than the second sequel but...
","still not quite as good as the first Spiderman. It's just not as funny as the first, but I liked the story lines. The movie had several so it kept you entertained. As expected, the special effects were great in this. Sandman may not have been visually as striking as Doc Oc but it was very well done. I liked it when he would just melt into sand. Jealously plays a big role in the story line. MJ is jealous of Gwen Stacy, a girl in Pete's science class, who gives a key to the city to Spiderman as well as a kiss. MJ gets back at Pete by hanging out with Harry more. And Gwen's ex, Eddie Brock, is jealous of her hanging out with Pete.<br/><br/>There are 3 villains. Harry is the Green Goblin again and is out for revenge. He doesn't care that Pete is Spiderman. There is neat fight between him and Spiderman and he loses his memory for part of the film, so he and Pete become friends again.<br/><br/>The Sandman is an escaped convict whom turns out to be the man who really shot Ben. So, of course Pete wants to hunt him down. Several great fights with Sandman. And then Eddie Brock turns into Venom by getting some of the black alien sludge on him. The sludge is like a parasite that takes over the host and influences aggression. It tries to do the same to Spiderman but on a smaller scale. Venom is cool and should have been in the film earlier.<br/><br/>The way they get rid of Sandman was a little silly. Is he really gone, he could come back in a future sequel.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Great superhero movie even if not the best in this franchise. It was still a lot better than Iron man, the superhero hit from the first part of 2008. Definitely a must see."
"ctomvelu-1","7","1","2","8 June 2008"," Good sequel, with problems
","S-M 3 is a decent sequel, with Spidey (Tobey Maguire) facing no fewer than three super villains: Sandman (Thomas Church), Goblin Junior (James Franco) and Alien Spider-Man (Topher Grace). Spidey's love life, involving a plan to propose to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), is complicated by the arrival of a new gal pal, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Howard). Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is still around, and in the film's most touching moment gives Peter her old engagement ring to give to MJ. Life at the paper goes on as well. As has been the case with the two previous films, the best moments are the quiet, non-costumed ones. The moment the costumes go on, the movie takes a jarring turn into computer-designed cartoons. And while these cartoon sequences are an improvement over those in the first movie, they're still just cartoons. I guess the kids don't care. Now for the real problems: Macguire is a one-note actor, so some of his most dramatic moments, like being spurned by MJ and when one of the main characters dies, are singularly unconvincing. Also, Dunst acts like she wishes she were anywhere but in yet another Spider-Man movie. And three villains, plus a running time of well over two hours, is just too, too much. Nevertheless, the film was put together by a master hand (Sam Raimi) who has guided the series from the beginning. So, unlike many of the sequels to films about Superman, X-Men, Batman and Robocop, which were often directed by others and frequently mishandled by their studios (you should read about the butchering of ROBOCOP 3), this second Spider-Man sequel lets us continue to have an interest in Peter Parker and his constant travails. I have no doubt a fourth film will happen, and frankly I wouldn't mind seeing Topher Grace replace Maguire. Grace out-acts Maguire at every turn here."

","Usually in movie franchises ( particularly superhero ones ) the third film is the one where it starts to run out of steam. This was certainly true of 'Superman 3' and 'Batman Forever' - though a very enjoyable movie - was not as good as the two preceding it.<br/><br/>So it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch 'Spider-Man 3'. The first two were excellent, so how would this compare? Very well indeed, I thought. Picking up on a plot strand from the last one, Harry Osborn is told by the ghost of his dead father that Peter Parker killed him, and that he is Spider-Man. Harry decides to carry on the family legacy by becoming the new Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, a criminal named Flint Marko breaks out of prison and takes refuge in a secret testing area where he is exposed to radiation. As a result, he now has the ability to turn his body to sand. I remember 'The Sandman' from the comics so it was good to see the character being visualised so accurately, even down to the green striped shirt.<br/><br/>Spidey's problems are not over yet. A strange creature from outer space attaches itself to Parker while he sleeps and creates a black version of his costume which, when worn, brings out the dark side of his character, enabling Tobey Maguire to have some fun with the role.<br/><br/>Parker sees the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson, in a new musical play on Broadway, and makes plans to ask her to marry him. But that day will have to wait...<br/><br/>These diverse plot strands converge at the end in a breathtaking finale. Its pointless describing the action scenes but needless to say they are exciting indeed. The giant-sized Sandman is a truly terrifying creation. As Spidey wryly observes: ""where do these guys come from?"".<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Durst turn in their usual fine performances. The presence of 'Gwen Stacy' did startle me somewhat though. I found myself muttering: ""don't go near any bridges!"" whenever she was on screen. Stan Lee makes his usual brief cameo - nuff said! What makes these films special though is not so much the C.G.I. but the love and care with which Sam Raimi has brought to the material. You get the impression they are not made simply for the money. At times you can almost see the comic-book pages being turned. As someone who read the Lee/Ditko originals as a boy, I was pleased with this movie.<br/><br/>I do not know whether any more 'Spider-Man' films will be made, but if this turns out to be the last, the series has ended on a very high note indeed."
"Zombie-Kermit","7","1","2","13 May 2008"," Very Flawed.... But Has Its Qualities
","Ever since the release of Spider-Man 3, I have basically seen nothing but hate and anger over the movie. But this is not a review about how other people felt about it. It's a review about how I felt about it. Spider-Man 3 was one of the most hyped movies of all time. Everyone was so excited about the inclusion of Venom as a villain. And huge hype can often lead to a huge disappointment. But I wasn't really as disappointed as most people were. Sure I felt a little unfulfilled by the end, and it was not really what I hoped for at all, but there was still good qualities to it.<br/><br/>There were still some good fight scenes, which is always good. The Sandman/Dark Spidey fight in the train tunnels was truly awesome, and was one of the high points of the film. The New Goglin fights were good, and the final battle was pretty cool in my opinion as well. Not to mention the always great Bruce Campbell and Stan Lee cameos. JK Simmons was awesome as Jonah Jameson... of course. And of course the special effects are incredible. The best parts of the movie are clearly what came from the original script.<br/><br/>Some of the main problems were the way it was paced, and the way the symbiote was handled. I really didn't want to see Peter spend an hour being a tool. Also, Venom seemed very underused in the movie. I also felt that the characters did not receive enough growth, which was a huge issue for me. MJ's character came across as a little too annoying and Peter didn't seem to behave much like he usually does. And yes, although I like Topher Grace, he was very miscast in this film.<br/><br/>I get really sick of every discussion about this movie, or about the Spider-Man franchise as a whole, always comes back to the scene with Peter dancing. So he danced for 30 seconds, it's been a year, it's time to move on people, it's not worth trashing an entire franchise over, it's doesn't mean you can make dumb personal attacks on Sam Raimi, and it's certainly not worth acting as if forty years of comics was just about a little emo kid. Because that is what I'm seeing. And it has grown old. I am glad that I got to share that.<br/><br/>I don't understand why people say the Spider-Man series is dead. And I don't get all the hate for Sam Raimi. He made two great Spidey movies and on adequate one. I hope that he will direct the 4th with Tobey still playing Spider-Man. There is still a lot of potential for the series, and I can't wait to see the next movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't say this was the disaster people are making it out to be, but it still could have been better. I think too many people have bought into the hate and it really stops you from being able to enjoy a movie. People may call me stupid for liking it, but why should I have to apologise for being able to enjoy movies other people can't? It's an awesome trait to have. People with it enjoy themselves a lot more. I like the movie and I've watched it a few times.<br/><br/>7/10"
"DarkVulcan29","1","1","2","23 February 2008"," They say the third time is the charm, sadly not in the case of Spider Man 3.
","I was hoping for it to be as good has 1 and 2. I mean the black suit story of Spider Man is the most popular one of all. I mean they had Sandman(Thomas Haden Church), Venom(Topher Grace), and the new Goblin(James Franco). But 1 and 2 are considered masterpieces, compared on how bad this film was. The acting brought nothing to the table, I mean Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst gave great performances in the first two. It's like there acting was just wearing thin. I had a feeling they were growing weary it there roles as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, you just kind of see it in there performances. The effects were great, but that just kind of wore thin also. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman, was not badly acted, but badly written. Topher Grace seems to bring some light in this. Will there be a Spider Man 4? After seeing this film I certainly hope not."

","I usually love going on and on about films- adding as much insight and comparing and contrasting as much as I can to prove my points...but I find I should comment on this movie in short. There is only one fatal flaw to this film:<br/><br/>There's more stuffing in this turkey than the turkey could possibly hold. .<br/><br/>This franchise was building to a satisfying conclusion, and for some reason it decided it's loyal audience didn't deserve the ending it expected. It explodes with disappointment, and does not allow Peter Parker or SpiderMan to come full circle in life or as an individual.<br/><br/>For action it's still a fun film...but it's the intellectual dud of the 3.<br/><br/>sin-surely,<br/><br/>RF"

I enjoyed the villains and thought they were all great but the final fight between all four guys could have been a lot better. One thing I did enjoy was the Peter Parker and Mary-Jane love triangle with Harry and how they all struggled in their situations as if to show a much more human side to these super heroes, making it so we can relate to them. There is plenty of action for the fans of action and a good deal of drama and humor and romance for other fan of that. All together I say the movie gets a 6 1/2 stars out of 10."
"DavidSim240183","8","1","2","18 January 2008"," Spider-Man 3 tangles itself up in its own web of story lines
","The successful Spider-Man trilogy has been completely overseen by director Sam Raimi, unlike most superhero sagas that start out with one director and then eventually get replaced by others. This has afforded Spider-Man a very impressive level of continuity, especially since most of the principal cast are still very much intact.<br/><br/>I thought the first film was a bit disappointing. It felt that all the pieces were in place, but Sam Raimi lacked that certain something to push the film into classic territory. Spider-Man 2 on the other hand was a complete polar opposite. Everything about the film worked. From its excellent direction to its wonderful script. That was a classic!<br/><br/>I enjoyed Spider-Man 2 so much it left me hopping about on pins and needles waiting for the next chapter. And when I finally did sit down to see Spider-Man 3, was I as impressed? Yes and no. I feel a trilogy should be a continually developing saga where each film is progressively better than the last. Pt 2 was certainly better than Pt 1. But the problem with Pt 3, is that while its just as good as the last one, its not better.<br/><br/>Its certainly the most ambitious. The first film's major flaw was its very lack of ambition. Spider-Man 2 broadened its horizons immeasurably, but I think Spider-Man 3 may have taken it to an absurd extreme.<br/><br/>Where the previous two had one villain apiece, this film has not one...not two...but three villains! As well as two love interests. And at the centre of it all...Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Including so many new characters has a bit of a crippling effect on Spider-Man 3. It sadly reminded me of the way the Batman series destroyed itself. How it started out rich and filled with psychological textures, and thanks to Joel Schumacher's incompetence, razzle-dazzle and an overstuffed story choked the life out of it.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 never gets Batman & Robin dire. It juggles its story lines well enough, but you can sometimes see the seams barely holding them together. And there are times when they seem very stretched.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are a happy couple. She knows he's Spider-Man, and he's getting ready to propose. The people of New York have embraced Spidey as a hero. And he's even getting the key to the city. But before long, Spidey's up to his web-shooters in trouble.<br/><br/>First off is Harry Osborn. Harry's a regular chip off the old block. He's become the Green Goblin, just like his old man. And he's out to kill the one who offed his dad. Spidey (or so he thinks). Then Flint Marko, an ex-con accidentally becomes the Sandman, a living creature of sand. Peter becomes infected by an alien symbiote that brings out his dark side, which then takes over rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), and becomes Venom, Spider-Man and Peter's arch enemy.<br/><br/>There were times during Spider-Man 3 when I felt it was a jumble of self-contained stories rather than an actual film. There is so much going on here. Something I praised the last film for, but here Raimi seems to have gotten a bit carried away.<br/><br/>He helped co-write the script along with his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent, and they've crammed in everything but the kitchen sink. Pt 2 had a wonderful organic feel as it flowed through each individual character arc. Pt 3 only achieves this intermittently.<br/><br/>Its not a bad film. Its a worthy addition to the series alright and it has a lot of good ideas. But where some of them are acted upon, others are shuffled aside.<br/><br/>Also, I think the film could have done without Sandman. He seems so negligible. The film attempts to tie him into the whole Uncle Ben mythos, which I felt didn't work at all. It only adds unnecessary complications to Spider-Man. Still I did like the scene when he first becomes Sandman, trying to regain human form. Watching him try to do something simple as pick up a locket and fail is quite heartbreaking. Its a beautiful scene and shows you what CGI can do when done with patience.<br/><br/>Venom is much more interesting, and given decent motivation by the film. Topher Grace, who first impressed me in 2004's In Good Company does well in the role. The photographer who gets humiliated by Parker, and when possessed by Venom, becomes a monster. The special effects work is excellent. In fact Venom often resembles the Alien. If Brock had made appearances in the previous two, it would have made his vendetta even more credible.<br/><br/>James Franco really comes into his own, but I wish the film hadn't resorted to a corny old amnesia plot device. Its hoary as anything, and recalls the limited scope of the first film. Still, he's improved greatly, and his death scene is surprisingly moving.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire gets to have fun as the Dark Spider, but Raimi's take on it feels a bit ropey. Parker comes off as confident and arrogant, no doubt amplified by his growing self-esteem. But having Maguire sport a cowlick, swagger and smirk feels simplistic. There's none of the darkly driven urges you're expecting. Although I loved the scene where the Dark Spider is stuck to the side of a church like a gargoyle. Its beautiful, and reminds one of the extraordinary operatic heights of Tim Burton's Batman.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst gets a bit sidelined but she's often touching when her acting career suddenly takes a nosedive. And some of the action scenes are wonderfully gripping. Especially the fabulous climax on a construction site.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is definitely epic, but it could have done with a little less. And a bit more of Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons. Spider-Man 3 is a good film. But its hard not to think that Raimi's diluted the series by trying to do too much."

","Spidey Volume 3. The most hyped up movie of the year? For good reasons though - the first two films were simply amazing & a treat to any of his comic lovers. 6 years on after the first film - Does Spidey still have his groove? Critics say no, but it's funny as the same amount of people disagree. A very ""Love or Hate"" film you might say.?<br/><br/>The start credits were as fun & suspenseful as ever - comic book drawings popping up with a spiderweb red background and a picture of one of the last 2 films every few seconds. Unoriginal after so many films have done the same thing but still you got to love credits which actually get you thrilled & geared up for the film.?<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of Spider-Man 3 don't blow you away too much - staying safe with just a follow-up on how Peter Parker's life has been since Spider-Man 2. Much like the entrance to Spidey 2, but now Peter loves his life. The way every core character is introduced doesn't amaze & the whole few scenes have a certain 'cheesy' undertone to them but that doesn't differ from the following 120 minutes. ?<br/><br/>We see MJ has a rise & fall music career, Peter is still underpayed & unrespected but is as happy as ever with his strong relationship with Mary Jane, in fact so much that he is about to pop the question to her which he seeks Aunt May's advice on. Suddenly, we are given an inside look on a mysterious new character who looks to be a runaway convict as he has a certain 'sandy fall'. We also see a still-distraught revenge-seeking Harry as Peter begs for forgiveness which he is not granted (right at that moment at least).?<br/><br/>3 villains. Too much of an overkill? Perhaps for the critics & small-flaw seekers but not for me, just makes it that much more exciting. Your core villain in the first-half is Sandman followed by Venom in the second-half. The Green Goblin Jr comes & goes as he pleases (and remembers!) The resolution to every villain is extremely satisfactory & somewhat predictable, but oh well!?<br/><br/>Good parts? The action parts are entertaining & the end is extremely pleasing, also the rise & fall of PJ's relationship is entertaining & surprising. Bad parts? The start is weak & the middle feels like a huge gimmick where it just focuses on the Venom-struck Peter.?<br/><br/>Following on from my complaint of the middle, just as we think the Sandman storyline has ended, Venom gets more involved & takes possession of Pete's body causing him to take revenge & act on his feelings of anger. During this film period, it feels like you've exited Spider-Man 3 & walked into a film spoofing it. Simply awful, too cheesy to be true! But don't panic, it kickstarts it's glory once again in about 15 minutes.?<br/><br/>The end is the best part. Predictable yet amazing ties. Sad, relieving, surprising & even heartwarming when we see the films big message involving forgiveness, mistakes & choices.?<br/><br/>So the big question is was it as amazing as it's 2 prequels? Some will say no & some will say yes. My opinion: Some parts of the film are mega, quite phenomenal & very satisfactory while it also disappoints at places. I can see where the critics are coming from, but do feel the film is overlooked & people should just take it as a comic-book film. I'd say it's not as good as Spidey 1 but better than no. 2, needless to say I loved every film in the trilogy & I highly recommend this film"

","While I start out with a rather unprofessional title here, I assure you, it's exactly what I thought of this sickly, pathetic new addition to the 'Spider-Man' series. It is obviously crucial that I start out the review by mentioning that I liked the first two films (both 8/10's). I think Maguire was terrifically cast, the special effects are terrific, and I liked the sweet, loving relationship between Peter and MJ. But the third film in the series is like gasoline poured into your favorite glass of milk. It fails utterly and miserably.<br/><br/>I am awarding it a 4 out of 10 for one reason only: the stupendous special effects. Although the effects will no doubt be beaten by the likes of 'The Golden Compass' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End', the Sony team does a stellar job of bringing Venom, the Sandman, and Evil Harry to life.<br/><br/>Now. Let's talk crap.<br/><br/>The dialog and relationship between Peter Parker and MJ is grossly miscalculated. When Peter missed poor dear MJ's play in the second film, I actually felt distressed about it. Now, when MJ is ordered by Evil Harry to break up with Peter, it's a barely painful scene to watch. By now, Peter has become so whiny and predictable, I wish he would just hook up with Ursula and be done with it. Just kidding.<br/><br/>But still, it gets annoying after a while. I feel like I would rather have someone like Jake Gyllenhaal playing Spidey now. Maguire is tired out.<br/><br/>And there's also one awful, inexplicably and shockingly stupid scene involving Spidey and his nearly erotic connection to his new black suit. It seems as though the suit not only makes his greedy and extremely powerful, but it also serves as a tool for lusting after beautiful women. This leads to the formerly mentioned awful, inexplicably stupid and shocking scene where Peter/Spidey decides to go onto the sidewalk and dance the day away. Literally, dance. And make suggestive gestures as attractive women.<br/><br/>I chuckle as I imagine the stupefied expressions on the audiences faces as they watch this unbelievably idiotic scene.<br/><br/>But hey, cheer up. There's one scene in the movie that works perfectly. It's after The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church overacting) escapes from prison, and meets up with his angered wife and still-loving daughter. That scene is sweet and realistic, and it works very, very well.<br/><br/>But the rest...just doesn't. Resist the temptation of that shiny cover, and instead pick up the DVD copy of 'Waitress', a much more funny, touching, and real movie than this one.<br/><br/>1.5/4"

Well I was right, it didn't work out. Venom was on screen for about 15 minutes and got his behind throttled the whole time. I mean, Venom is supposed to terrorize Spider man, TERRORIZE= ruin his life! One scene does not officially terrorize anyone! This franchise is dead to me, to one day be revived probably 10 years later like the Batman films.<br/><br/>To the makers of this film. You had one of the coolest villains of all time at your disposal, and you completely wasted him. You butchered one of the best superheroes ever created.

And then this, and then the other and look, we've made a ""movie"" almost 2:30 hours long! Doesn't matter if there's no plot, no coherence and no logic, the producers perception is that the public has the memory skills of a goldfish and will only care for what happened during the last minute.<br/><br/>Maguire and Dunst are absolutely awful. No chemistry, no acting skills. I'm focusing on them simply because the rest of the cast just didn't have enough lines to join the list. This is a crappy movie you should get only on a hi-def format to enjoy the effects. And this is also the only reason it gets a 4."

","Sad to say out of all the Spiderman films this one lacked thematic focus. It's not that you can't have light-hearted comedy mixed with drama but the light and dark were so contrasty it tend to hurt ones eyes.<br/><br/>First things first, you have Peter Parker as a main character as well as his alter ego, Spiderman. Right there you have two threads to follow. His personal life and his superhero life. Add two villains each with personal lives and villainous lives. Add Harry Osbourne Jr.(James Franco)who flips back and forth between good and bad, Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as a convenient love interests.<br/><br/>This in itself is a feat to maintain any level of consistency while tying together a meaningful plot. What seemed like a good idea, was to give everyone a real human conflict that was magnified by their alter-ego. That way we could connect to everyone, and no one at the same time.<br/><br/>Because let's face it at the end of the day this movie personifies everything bad about the comics 'kids' used to read 30 years ago. Comics have gotten better...I just don't know why nobody is paying attention.<br/><br/>There were parts that were soooo whacky that I really believed Jerry Lewis was going to step into the scene screaming, ""LAAAADY!"". Granted those scenes in and of themselves were sometimes very funny (J.J.Jameson especially) but man...not the right movie for it. There was no spine to the story and too many cooks in the kitchen.

Anything but good anyway.<br/><br/>The film was packed with so many unnecessary subplots that it was just a mess, some dodgy CGI in places - that chase scene near the start with Peter and Harry in the air? Horrible! Wooden acting, too many villains and cringe-worthy attempts at comedy - J. Jonah Jameson wanting a camera gag? Peter dancing in the streets? I can see why people would enjoy it (senseless, campy fun), but I just felt they made such a mess of it. I think they tried to cram far too much into one movie. It would have been perhaps better if they only introduced the Venom idea at the end of 3, and then developed that into Spider-Man 4 instead of having Venom, Sand Man and Harry in the one film because so much could have been done with the Venom/Symbiote thing that it could have been a whole movie. Unfortunately, in was all crushed into the one.<br/><br/>For me, there were only two redeeming qualities: Raimi's masterful direction and Bruce Campbell's genius cameo. Still, these aren't going to help this horrible wreck of a movie. So many missed opportunities. Spidey 4 better be an improvement... but to tell the truth, that won't be hard."

","I have finished watching ""Spider-Man 3"" for a second time after my initial viewing when it first came out. I must admit, I have a greater appreciation for this film once I watched it more intently.<br/><br/>Like many others, my initial impression of the film was that it was filmed half-hazard. There was too much going for there to be any development; the Peter-Harry conflict was pushed aside in favor for an appearance of Venom; the Sandman's involvement in killing Uncle Ben being a terrible subplot and made the events of the first film void; and the horrific Peter dance. All of this made me despise ""Spider-Man 3"" when I first watched it.<br/><br/>However, with my second viewing, I decided to watch the behind-the-scenes concept work to understand why the film was made the way it was. I watched the film afterward more objectively to see what I could interpret from the film.<br/><br/>Having done that, I have come up with this observation: ""Spider-Man 3"" completes the trilogy in that Peter Parker finally becomes a man. In the previous films, Peter is tested in upholding his motto ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and succeeds in doing this while winning the heart of Mary Jane Watson. In ""Spider-Man 3"", Peter becomes confident with his success and feels that he is ready to marry his love and be a mature, understanding husband.<br/><br/>However, Peter demonstrates his immaturity by letting his confidence become pride. As a result, Peter acts with ignorance and selfishness: he is ignorant of Mary Jane's need for his understanding and feels confident that he doesn't need any help to keep him on the right track. The events of the film and how it negatively affects those around him result from Peter giving in to the temptations of power and success, the evil stemming from it manifesting in the form of Venom.<br/><br/>There is a large amount of character development on the part of Peter Parker as he recognizes his own immaturity and decides to confront it. Harry Osborn likewise realizes the faultiness of seeking revenge. Eddie Brock becomes a victim of his own ambitions when he favors the power given as Venom in light of his personal failure, resulting in his demise. The only superhuman character acting unselfishly is Flint Marko, whose motivation for committing crimes is to save the life of his daughter. Mary Jane Watson and Aunt May act as the medium through which Peter Parker obtains maturity, albeit after his downfall.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there are several aspects of the film that are unnecessary. However, upon understanding the deep moral message driving the events of the film, I find that ""Spider-Man 3"" is a surprisingly mature film that needs multiple viewings to appreciate.<br/><br/>Rating: ** 1/2 - Fairly Good"
"aars28","9","1","2","18 December 2007"," Spider-Man 3 definitely delivers
","I went to see this movie with no expectations and was blown away. After reading the negative comments I was disappointed the movie didn't deliver for everybody. I agree with the fact that they were trying to put way too many elements in the movie, this required you to keep constant attention and be able to grow quickly with the storyline. By knowing the previous installments this could be easily maintained since you are more aware of the style of directing. I also liked the fact that Raimi included the slow romantic moments to let you analyse what just happened, while still enjoying the scene.<br/><br/>Future movies will only be faster and will include more stuff since evolution in film is inevitable. That makes me wonder how many things they will include within 2 hours of film by the time I am 50 years old :P.<br/><br/>I definitely believe the director did an excellent job on SM3. It just wasn't well interpeted by his audience. It also had to life up to his predecessors which created way too much hype.<br/><br/>9/10 excellent!!"
"kollinbaer","7","1","2","16 December 2007"," 3rd time's a charm
","Its always been hard for the third movie of a trilogy to receive the attention that it deserves, mainly because Spider Man 3 was no where near the movie that Spider Man 1 was, and for that fact Spider Man 2. The fact that the Sandman, Venom, and the Hob Goblin, or ""New Goblin"" were all fighting for film time was the main cause for the down fall of the flick. Maybe the word down fall was too harsh, after all the movie was somewhat decent, but just could not compare to that of Spider Man 1 or 2. Sam Rami hyped up the movie too much for the content, it just did not live up to it's title. Maybe Spider Man 4 will pick up it's slack, if there will even be one. If there is, hopefully they will slow down and speak more with Stan Lee about the true character of Spider Man, but the fact is, any third movie is hard to make, so I give the movie credit."

"pswanson00","7","1","2","6 December 2007"," entertaining allegory
","I like this film pretty well -- much better than installment 2 -- but it has FAR too many story lines. I appreciate subplots and intertwined stories which converge and come to fruition together, but there are too many in this film. We have: a walking gravel pit for whom we feel compassion; an extraterrestrial sludge spider which alters the personalities of people it touches; M.J. vacillating among commitment to Peter, Harry, and her career; Harry brutally coercing M.J. into crushing Peter's feelings; Peter succumbing (temporarily, of course) to the intoxicating power of the sludge spider; Eddie Brock succumbing to the sludge, being rescued from it by Peter, then diving back into it at the worst moment. Cutting a couple of characters completely would have made this a much tighter film. <br/><br/>I DID enjoy thoroughly the depth of the supporting cast, especially J.K. Simmons' over- the-top portrayal of Peter's editor. To put it simply, he's a hoot. Also, the cool, aggressive Peter Parker, diddybopping around town with the Black Spider suit under his clothes, did so exactly as Normal Peter would've done it, with the slightly spastic style of a dancing nerd, rather than Travolta smoothness. It worked for me. <br/><br/>While M.J. was stranded in the dangling taxi, it occurred to me that she was awfully helpless for a young woman of the 21st century. I felt much better about her character when she chucked the concrete block onto Eddie Brock, then had the presence of mind to dive out of the car when the truck was falling toward her. She vindicated herself nicely. <br/><br/>I also was delighted to learn that the gray-haired guy who had one line -- obviously a cameo -- was Stan lee, the creator of Spider Man. I'm glad that those who are interpreting the stories for modern audiences appreciate their origins. <br/><br/>To sum up: it's decent entertainment, and that's from a guy who hasn't read a Spider Man comic in 35 years. Rent; enjoy! P.S. The outtakes on the DVD are hilarious, so don't miss them."
"ajm1701","5","1","2","1 December 2007"," Could of been sooooooo much better
","I watched this film again last night, hoping that on this occasion, unlike at the cinema were i just thought it was OK, i'd find it to be a much more enjoyable experience. I was wrong. The film is just sloppy. Lots of very good scenes but overall a mess.<br/><br/>(CONTAINS SPOILERS) <br/><br/>1. Every villain in the trilogy is tied in with Peter Parker somehow (Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Goblin Jr. & Venom), but not Sandman. So to drag him into Peter Parker's personal world, he's re-conned into being the killer of Uncle Ben. Why! One of the tragedies of being Peter Parker is that he could of stopped his uncle's killer before he killed him, but chose not to, and now he has to live and learn from that. But not anymore. Would it of been soooooooo bad if this super-villain just didn't have a Peter Parker connection? And why mess with an important part of the Spider-man history.<br/><br/>2. Too many villain's and not enough time to develop them sufficiently. One good villain would of vastly improved this movie, and the sub-plot of Harry could of been left simmering throughout ready for the next film.<br/><br/>3. The butler telling Harry that his father was killed with his own glider??? Putting this in at this late a date is insulting our intelligence. Surely better for the butler to of discovered this after seeing into the hidden back room and recognising the weapon that killed his father near the end of this movie.<br/><br/>4. Too much soppy falling out, getting back together with MJ. Not bad in itself, but it already been done to death in the other two films.<br/><br/>5. Very convenient that Eddie Brock just happened to be in the church as Spider-man gets rid of his black costume. At least if he'd followed him in it would of removed the stupid co-incidence.<br/><br/>6. Aunt May's function seems to just be there to lay on the guilt and moralise, a waste of a good character.<br/><br/>7. Why do the film makers have Peter Parker remove his mask at every available opportunity, that's just dumb. Just one photo took of Spider-man without his mask and his secret identity is blown forever.<br/><br/>There were of course good things in this film, and lots of them, but they just got swamped. I did wonder while watching it if they could of edited out some of the scenes in this movie to give it a sharper narrative, and then hold these already filmed scenes back for the next movie, which would of helped both productions."
"leveller0@yahoo.com","3","1","2","25 November 2007"," Hope it is the last one
","I don't know why I still watch this series of underwhelming films. As in the best tradition of superhero films, they go slowly downhill from the first film, and then start accelerating towards the depths of Batman & Robin, Rocky 5 and so on. This was a muddled adventure. Half of the movie resembled teenage tantrums with superpowers added in. The other half had a mish-mash of perplexing action scenes. Almost every scene is predictable. Aunt May is not so much a character as a string of clichÃ©s. I don't understand what happened to the Sandman - why didn't he sit down and chat to Peter Parker earlier and save the need for the last hour of the film? Does he know that he can fulfil his aim by voting for the Democrats next year for universal health care? Evil/Emo Peter Parker was just bad, not evil. Three villains is a silly idea, and not one of them is memorable or outstanding. Hostage scenes, friend/family-in-hospital scenes, innocent-victim-being-rescued scenes - all been done before and have even been done in the Spiderman series itself!! In the end, I haven't bothered to structure this review and make it sound coherent, much like the scriptwriters for the movie itself."

","OK,I liked Spiderman 2, but i thought that it was a little attention losing in some parts. Spiderman 3 though has got to be the best one of them all! Everyone else might think it's not as good as the others, but i beg to differ, because it was by far the top of them all! The effects were one of the best effects of any movie of the year of 2007, and the story line was pretty good itself. The Black spiderman was pertraed so well, it made peter parker look darker with the awesome make up on his face and the way they did his hair. Venom, do i have to say it. They made him great compared to the comic books and TV shows, and i was worried how they would do on him,lol. ""You always have a choice"", and my choice is thumbs up spidy!"

Rant: Too many closeups with blank lifeless looks from the key actors. Very disappointed. Thank goodness for Redbox, I only spent $1, so I don't feel that bad. So so special effects, too bad sand effects was used in another movie, good use of sand nonetheless. Also, you'd think by 3 they'd figure out how to make Spidey look more realistic when webbing from building to building. Where do they go from here for number 4?"

Without a doubt, the best out of the three, but like any other movie on the planet, it had its ups and downs. First of all, it had a lot more positive things than negative things. Here's my list, starting with downs.<br/><br/>1. It had a couple of cheesy quotes 2. It had three-too-many villains (including spied's dark side) 3. It was sort of long 4. It was kind of mushy with the love story between M.J. and Peter 5. HARRY DIES!!! UPS: 1. It was by far the most action packed 2. All of the actors and actresses (Toby and Kirsten especially) proved that they could pull off being dramatic 3. The special fx were the most realistic and stunning 4.

Maybe the fact that the second film blew away the first one gave the director Sam Raimi an impossible job to top that film I think if there is one liability it is Kirsten Dunst, who is hands down the WORST actress working in Hollywood today!!

"ninie_san","9","1","2","3 November 2007"," A good, entertaining movie, undeserving of all the negative feedback
","I have nothing to add that wasn't already said, but I felt the movie could use a little support. Yeah, it had it's flaws, and it was far from perfect, but I think the people who feel like bashing it at every opportunity only had too-high expectations, especially concerning Venom. <br/><br/>I know next to nothing of the comic books. If you think, because my only link to Spider-man is the movies, my opinion isn't worth anything, then I'm sorry, and don't bother reading. I will say what I thought was good, what I thought was bad, and what I would I done.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all three movies on their own, and I think Spider-man 3 was a very good sequel to the also very good Spider-man 1 and 2. <br/><br/>It had it's corny and cheesy parts, but it wouldn't have been Spider-man without this, would it? It is know for it's cheesy speeches, after all. And it wasn't close to being as cheesy as the first one, in my opinion. The acting is kind of over-the-top in some scenes, but frankly, I didn't mind at all. It's the type of movie that actually makes it work. The only thing I felt unnecessary was the American flag thing; I'm not American, and it made me uncomfortable, as if it meant the movie was made only for the American audience to 'connect' with. <br/><br/>Emo!Peter was great, and his dancing so funny! Peter Parker has been a 'dork' from day one; a lovable, nice-looking, heroic dork, but a dork nonetheless. I was amazed the writer(s?) managed to keep this dorky side of him even though he turned 'bad'; I think, if he had suddenly become all bad-ass, cool and darkly mysterious, this part wouldn't have been half as great as it was. It would practically been a waste of time, like introducing a new, useless character just to please shallow audiences. I liked watching the dark-side take over; it shows that Spider-man isn't perfect; like everyone, he can be selfish once in a while, and he has his bad days, too. <br/><br/>The butler part should have been different; I think Peter could have told Harry about his father one last time before running off; then, Harry could have finally thought about it and what it meant. The Butler then could have encouraged him; Harry need that, I think, to hear that at least one person loved him. Then he could have gone to fight on Peter's side. Other than that, Harry was perfect. I really, really enjoyed watching his development during the series. I'm sad that his story has come to an end, but it was needed. It would have been wasted if it had dragged on too long, or worse, have no conclusion at all. I actually cheered for him at the end, and his collaboration with Spider-man was one of the best parts of the movie for me. <br/><br/>I think they could have elaborated more on the other two villains. If they had planned from the beginning to make a Spider-man 4, they shouldn't have ended Eddie/Venom's story; it should have gone a bit slower, with Eddie's hate for Peter having more time to grow, and his last part (or one of his last parts, at least) in the movie should have been his 'infection' by the symbiote. Venom shouldn't have appeared; he should have been kept for the next movie. The way he was shown in the movie was more to give form to Peter's dark side. It was good that way, but still, it's a lot of potential... not wasted, but not used as well as it could have been. <br/><br/>As for Sandman, a more complex story would have been great, too. I haven't read the comics, as I said earlier, but I'm sure there was more to him than what was shown in the movie. He had really good potential, but most of it was ruined because he lacked some aspects that Harry and Eddie had, and thus wasn't as interesting as they were. He didn't have the subtlety that make a good villain. <br/><br/>Mary-Jane was great in this one; she seemed so natural, so human. I liked how her appearance, while nice (she's Mary-Jane, after all!), wasn't always picture-perfect. Her emotions, while sometimes selfish, were understandable and human. Gwen was fine too. I enjoyed her! We didn't see her much, but she wasn't near as bad as she could have been. I have nothing too add about Aunt May; saying corny speech is her role, but I personally thinks she kicks ass despite what she is supposed to be. She's a wonderful, beautiful woman. I only hope I can be half of what he is when I grow old. And, as usual, Jameson was side-splitting funny! I really like the part with the desk in the beginning. <br/><br/>While I don't claim this movie was perfect, it wasn't as bad as most people say. And everyone who, like me, enjoyed this movie (or people who haven't seen it yet) shouldn't get discouraged by the negative critics. There are as many, if not more, people who actually liked it; they just aren't as loud as the 'bashers'. <br/><br/>Over-all, I give a solid 8 1/2 on 10 for this one. For the entertainment it provided with its awesome action and fights scenes, I'll make it a 9. Good job!"
"jack7","1","1","2","3 November 2007"," worse than Grease 2
","Special effects were the only thing worth watching in this movie. It was chock full of plot holes and scenes leaving questions and suggestions completely unanswered. The acting was awful. The secondary characters were absurd and completely unbelievable. The comedic scenes were completely out of place. It burns me that people get rich from making this kind of thing. Why would Stan Lee be involved in this? This crime of a movie was made by very bad people who had no problem wasting potential or the time and money of the viewing public. A grenade that blew up next to Harry's head barely left a scratch? but it completely disintegrated Topher's character and the alien? What the heck?? This alien, laughably unexplained in and of itself, of all places on earth just happens to land in Spiderman's back pocket? Sandman and Spidey are in tears together, and then...what? he leaves? turns himself in? What? How does the Sandman fly? So many things unexplained to other characters in the film. What was it Harry had on MJ to make her leave Peter? She had to do it because why? She was sure Spidey couldn't win in a fight against Harry if she didn't? No confidence in the tiger? Huh? Wha-? What happened to Spidey sense? Never used, in so many ways. Just an awful, awful pile of shite."
"rob7140","1","1","2","3 November 2007"," Pitiful
","Why does Hollywood feel the need to attempt to combine three generations of story lines into one flick? Where do I start, Gwen Stacy was Peter's first love not a fling, she was killed by the original green goblin. Sandman did not kill Peter's uncle. Eddie Brock was not some skinny twirp. Mary Jane was a gorgeous model. Harry was the hob goblin not green goblin JR. and he would never help spider-man. Venom arrived on earth on a shuttle that JJ's son was piloting not as a meteor. Why does spider-man have his mask off so often? Not much worried about the secret identity. Venom does not attack innocents or team with other super villains. Sorry but I am a fan of the comics and this movie does them no justice. If you are going to make this movie then come up with another name because this movie is in no way associated with Spider-Man."

","It has taken me a while to watch this third instalment of Spiderman and I can't say it was worth the wait.I found it to be definitely too long,cheesy and also a bit on the childish side.It lasts for over two hours and that is at least 20 minutes too long.One thing that I have never been convinced about with these Spidey films is the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker.He comes across as just too much of a geek.His relationship with Mary Jane is also very tedious and has always slowed the films down way too much for me.<br/><br/>It isn't all bad.Thomas Haden Church gives a fine performance as Sandman and the CGI of this character is excellent.Some of the action scenes are well done but a film needs so much more than that nowadays.I felt that the story dragged far too much at times and the scenes where Peter Parker becomes a macho man were just plain embarrassing.<br/><br/>Maybe this is one Spiderman too many but my guess is that there will be another one.It needs to be better than this effort."
"Confidante77","9","1","2","17 October 2007"," Does spider-man 3 live up to the hype or fall victim to the threequel curse?
","It seems almost an unwritten law that the final part of a trilogy often collapses into a clichÃ©d, trite and hard to follow mess. Particularly with Suprhero movies ( *cough* Batman Forever *cough*).<br/><br/>After the literal waves of both critical and fan acclaim for Spider-man 2, this sequel immediately had a lot to live up to. However the announcement that this instalment would have three villains pushed concerns with some fans.<br/><br/>ever since the movie's release, a mass of negative reviews have surrounded it, with IMDb users split on either side.<br/><br/>But despite the harsher critical response than to its predecessors, and the vast amount of controversy surrounding the film amongst fans, Spider-man 3 is a hugely enjoyable, engaging and breath-taking spectacle.<br/><br/>Where previous instalments have eased us into the action with smaller, and in the long-run unnecessary set-pieces, Spider-man 3 begins with a fabulously kinetic battle between Peter and his revenge-obsessed old friend Harry. Moving at a faster speed than any of the franchise's previous fight scenes could muster, it also has a powerful emotional edge.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this first action sequence is never quite trumped, but several other set pieces come close.<br/><br/>However the Spider-man films have never been simply about the action scenes, but also about character progression. the film serves as a great bookend to the character of Peter,as with each film he goes through a different stage on the struggle caused by his abilities- First the struggle to emerge, Second the struggle to be accepted and in this film the struggle with arrogance and one's own darkness.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire once again captures the essence of Peter Parker flawlessly, and in a highly unique, Saturday-Night Fever inspired sequence, puts an entirely new spin on the character.<br/><br/>As eve Sam Raimi proves himself one of the great modern directors, skillfully mixing jaw-dropping special effects with moving human story lines- take for a example an extremely profound scene showing the birth of Sandman- literally like a newborn he struggles to stand up but keeps falling, eventually succeeding through sheer determination. Though the scene is entirely computer-generated it is a heartfelt portrayal of the character's birth.<br/><br/>This time round, Raimi's direction of the more emotionally engaging scenes has a far defter and much more accomplished touched and as per usual he mixes plenty of humour in- Bruce Campbell's cameo in this one absolutely blows away his small roles in the previous two, and once again J.K. Simmons makes maximum impact out of a small role.<br/><br/>However there are many points where Spider-man 3 come dangerously close to falling. The appearance of the symbiote is dealt with clumsily and at times the screen feels cluttered with villains. Also an otherwise excellent final showdown is marred by a ridiculous reporter and a young girl selling Jameson a camera.<br/><br/>But the main point of the film is to entertain, and it does so superbly while still keeping an emotional integrity that never goes over the top or outstays its welcome. Raimi and his cast walk a thin line but keep balance most of the time, with many inspired and refreshing scenes (The previously mentioned Saturday night fever scene and a surprisingly light cooking scene) more than making up for most of the shortcomings.<br/><br/>Again an excellent cast, with James France shining in particular along with great villain performances from Topher Grace and Haden-Church, this Spider-man is, at least in my opinion, the strongest of the three, for the first time making clear its highly important theme and moral message- ""To err is human. To forgive is divine"" Spider-man 3 - 9/10"
"Netscape_Navigator","6","1","2","14 October 2007"," well, the trilogy is now RUINED
","I loved the first two, I gave them both 10s. It's amazing how much of a joke this is compared to the first two. Although this one isn't completely terrible, the quality level is nowhere near the others, this one just feels so sloppy. There's three main reasons why this movie was a joke compared to the first two: <br/><br/>REASON 1: It lacks all of the humanity that made the first two so great. The first two movies had great characters that were well written, and had motivations for everything they did. Nothing that the Green Goblin or Doc Ock did felt arbitrary. Their very existence was written in a very believable way, and all their actions and crimes had purpose to them to achieve some end goal. Tell me again, WHAT exactly was Sandman up to again the whole time?<br/><br/>REASON 2: Humor was too over the top. This series has always been known for its tongue in cheek type campy humor, and it worked great in the first two. Here it felt so forced, there were so many cringe inducing scenes. From the overplayed gimmick of that desk buzzer ringing loudly at J. Jonah Jameson's desk (it's funnier if you do it just a couple times... not ONE HUNDRED times), to the absolutely horrific child actors and the terrible lines they were made to speak, everything was so over the top. During the climax of the movie, they completely slowed the movie down by putting in what felt like a 5 minute scene of Jameson asking that little girl for her camera, as she replied with all the acting talent of 2007's Bionic Woman. It's crazy that someone consciously put that unnatural scene in there. The whole thing is just so wrong.<br/><br/>REASON 3: Too many subplots. I guess this pretty much ties in to Reason 1, the very reason why every character was shallow and paper thin was because this movie had one too many villains. Neither of the villains got enough time to be developed, and every time they show up it all feels so disjointed. They should've taken out one of the villains, and went much much deeper into one of the subplots, such as Peter's inner struggle. It would've been very interesting to see a truly dark, evil Spider-Man, and not an eyeliner wearing dancing buffoon. <br/><br/>Scenes that were poorly written:<br/><br/>**When Peter was looking at the ring in his hand, and Mary Jane unexpectedly knocks, why was he fumbling around as to where to hide the ring, only to eventually put it in his pocket? Wouldn't his pocket be the FIRST choice?<br/><br/>**The scene where Gwen Stacy perilously hangs off the building, as her boyfriend and father look on calmly and talk to each other. I'm at a total loss of words here.<br/><br/>**The butler dude that out of nowhere, all of a sudden deciding to tell Harry that his father's wounds came from his glider, so THEREFORE the wounds were self-inflicted. Was the script writer on CRACK here??<br/><br/>**You could really tell the writers had no idea how to justify the meeting of Venom and Sandman with the way they had them just conveniently meet by chance, and say, ""we both hate him, wanna team up real quick?"" That should be a felony to write something like that.<br/><br/>**I think this is more of an opinion based on my own understanding of the world, but I'm completely confused about how Peter could kiss Gwen Stacy in front of his girlfriend and not realize it's a big deal?<br/><br/>**The ending of Sandman's story arc. He might as well have just stayed home if he's just gonna pathetically wisk away like that in the end with nothing resolved. What was that?<br/><br/>This could've been a great movie had they tightened up the script, trimmed off the fat, left off one of the villains, and focused on the core of the story. Instead they made it into a cartoony, childish extravaganza that trips over itself trying to do too many things. I waited 3 years for this movie to come out..."

I almost cried when Harry forced MJ to break up with Peter. I thought the Sandman was done for when he got thrust into the sewer. I was constantly sobbing at Harry's funeral after he was killed. The part on the church where Peter was trying to get the black stuff of and it go onto Eddie Brock was also pretty cool. Then when Harry got short term memory loss was kinda sad.

So i watched the movie again. And i loved it, OK maybe we could have seen more of venom but thats it. The film reminded me of the comics, with multiple stories. i loved this film and i'm not lying fun for all the family. but don't listen to me make your own decision. <br/><br/>Happy Watching <br/><br/>A.C.Madgwick"

","Spider-Man 1, follows the comic book Spider-Man 2, follows the comic book and Spider-Man 3 follows the comic book. Whats is wrong with Spider-Man 3 i mean it has Venom,Sandman,and the women who turns into Blackcat and it is not racist for goodness sake.They say that on Spider-Man 4 Lizard would be on there and it possible for Venom to make a appearance. Well my vote is super great because Venom looked real every thing looked good.I can't wait for the DVD and Venom's origin on special features.I hope they make 4 more with every villain and heroes on it.If you like bad movies look at Underdog,Baby Geniouses,Because of Winn-Dixie,Spirit,and The Cable Guy.well thats all i wanna saw about Spider-Man 3."

","The Spider-Man franchise has done well. Both previous movies were good and stayed true to the comic story line. Most people didn't like this third installment out of the many to come (possibly 8 total), but I'll tell you why it was good.<br/><br/>This movie took the storyline elements of the Spider-Man comics to the fullest here and introduced very important characters, like the Stacy family and Eddie Brock, and continues the life and times of Peter Parker in a short but well done way. The love interests Peter has in both Betty Ross and Gwen Stacy are portrayed well and get the point across, though not exactly like the comics.<br/><br/>Forgiveness as the theme and moral of the story is put across directly and powerfully. Character conflict with Mary Jane and Peter is especially good and dramatic. Acting is successful and real like in the previous films and the action is fantastic, as always.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film was too busy. Too much was going on with two villains and the drama. The excess of content lead to less character development, which left the villains not being as omnipotent and invigorating to the story as the other films. From a fan stand-point, Venom not being emphasized while attached to Parker or Brock was the most disappointing thing. <br/><br/>All-in-all, this Spidey film is a good addition to its predecessors and is worth the watch despite its short comings."
"MatinosMeansPeace","10","1","2","7 August 2007"," Spider-Man 3 gives the run for Spider-Man 4
","Spider-Man 3 is truly the cream of the crop when it comes to the Spider-Man films. Since I was a little kid, I always wanted to see my favorite comic character, Venom, on the silver screen, and I finally got my chance. I had almost no issues with this movie. People's main complain was the transition between action and story, in which we see the battles of Spider-Man, and the love life of Peter Parker being interchanged in the story, but most these film critics haven't bothered to read a Spider-Man comic ever, I wager, because that is exactly how the comics went. Spider-Man 3 leaves us at a decided end, so help it that the filmmakers no longer wish to continue, but its already been called for Spider-Man 4. Finishing some story lines set from deep within the first movie, and leaving possibility's for new ones, Spider-Man 3 does its job better than well, and the third time must be the charm, because the echo's of Peter Parker's Uncle Ben saying ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" is never truer in Spider-Man 3. The movie has one on the edge of their seats, and with something for everyone, with more special effects than before, tons of true-to-the-comic stories for nerds like myself, a great story, which leave one for the next story in not only the test-proved greatest comic book movie, but another epic story in the life of Peter Parker, also known as the Amazing Spider-Man"

Now, i never read the comics, but i have hear Venom has always been a major character in the spiderman series. this being said i would love to see him in future films. but back to this spiderman. it was dark, action filled and a decent story. some good villains, an amazing cast, and amazing effects. yes its good, but it could of and should of been a lot better than it was."

","When Spiderman came out i watched it when it was released on DVD considering it would be a movie for kids i didn't bothering going to watch it on big screen, but boy i was wrong. The day i watched it, i regret for not watching it on BIG screen. Then came Spiderman 2, but for some reason i couldn't watch it in theater and had to wait for it to come on DVD, although i got it free on UMD when i purchased my PSP. Beside Spiderman 3, my fav one is Spiderman I because it was absolutely fantastic, the second one was good but doc has never been my fav villain and perhaps thats why spidey 2 was not as my fav as the first one.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 was the first spidey flick that pushed me out of my couch and put me in front of wide screen between hundreds of spider-man fans to enjoy it. I was so excited to see this black spidey flick and must say i enjoyed it and now it has been in my fav spidey movies list. The goods you all know, but bad is what i will talk about.<br/><br/>The movie itself is more than 2 hrs long, but even that time is not enough for what is going on in the movie. The movie had too much going on, Peter-Mary Jane love, then Mary Jane failure in her career, then Harry revenge as new Spidey black outfit story follows along with a man suspected in the killing of uncle Ben, named Fint Marko AKA Sand-Man and at last the Venom.<br/><br/>Don't know why but this movie could have been great with just Sand-man alone as a single villain, or maybe with Harry Osborne. Sand Man is a great character which need a lot of character development which this movie definitely lacks, not just for Sandman but for all, even Venom. The makers could have had only Venom in the third installment of this spidey flick as well if they wanted to save Sand Man for future spider man movies but looks like they wanted it all at once like it was end of the world. Unfortunately it didn't quite well worked. Before you even enjoy Sand Man, Harry comes, then the love story, and after that comes black spidey and at the end Venom. Before you enjoy one character, another comes and eventually movie ends. I loved both Sand Man and Venom but due to lack of time both didn't get enough screen time. In fact Venom comes in the last 15 min of Movie, so character development was missing on a massive scale.<br/><br/>The visual effects are awesome, especially that of sand man and venom. Harry had some nice gadget to show off too. <br/><br/>Overall, even though too much was cramed into one movie, the third spider man flick did not disappoint me and can say is one of my fav in the series. I hope makers will not put too much in the next spidey flick."

"alex-c-3","10","1","2","14 July 2007"," Say what you want. Best Spider-man movie so far !!!
","I love Spider-man movies. When the first part came out I was so excited about one of my favorite Marvel heroes. I was so happy and pleased with number one saga of ""human spider"". Actually, that's the first time I've ever heard for Tobey, and saw how perfect he is for that role, with his shiny, pure boy-face. Sam Raimi made it right in target. Kirsten Dunst is so sweet, I think i'm in love with her. William Daffoe couldn't be better bad guy.He is simply the genius as Green goblin. James Franco was always one of my favorite actors,and also he could got Spider-man role too, and it wouldn't be mistake. Great action comic film, and i have seen it four times so far.<br/><br/>Second part of the saga was even more greater. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus was brave choice to make. Well done Sam. Harry (James Franco) turns into sad, furious young rich man, who will do anything to kill Spiderman and revenge his father, refuse to see the truth. And Peter gets emotionally confused,because he must make a choice between love and justice. Perfect movie, great acting, phenomenal end.<br/><br/>That's when I thought it's the top of what great movie should look. Until now.<br/><br/>I'm really not sure why bad reviews or marks on this movie. It has everything: plenty of action, great drama (that makes me cry), even greater bad guys, while the rest of them improved their acting even more. We have Peter Parker going in two directions: good, pure guy like he always was, and cynical,bad Peter (under the symbiotic influence). And because of that influence, he will do some things he regretted later... K. Dunst was still there, not only to support the movie. His role is always bigger in every part of spider-man... We have some new roles: 1.Thomas Haden Church (I enjoy watching him in comedies)as Sandman. He isn't bad guy actually... Situations caused him to be what he is... 2. Topher Grace, funny Eric(that 70's show)turns into real evil and dark enemy of Spiderman, Venom. Unlike Sandman , Venom enjoy in his evilness. Last, but for me, most important character in Part 3 is Harry Osbourne. His emotional transformations are amazing, and he's a real scene stealer in Spidy 3. Most action and drama scenes are around him. And he is in the middle of final countdown, even more than Peter. But....<br/><br/>Four thumbs up!!! Enjoy"

","Wow! What a really excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed sequel! That is the main thing that I can say about SPIDER-MAN 3. Anytime Spider-Man/Peter (Tobey Maguire) was being treated with disrespect, I felt sorry for him. I could particularly relate to how he was feeling at the very beginning of the movie. You'll have to see the movie to know why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. I must say that she was a really good singer and actress. Venom (Topher Grace) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) really made me jump when they appeared from out of the blue. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed sequel that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a fast and wild ride. I guarantee you you'll be taken on a fast and wild ride."

"stewienator","Null","1","2","28 June 2007"," Review 2: Spider-Man 3
","Spider-Man 3 is different from its previous sequels. More or less, some people will love this movie while others will not. It is a different Spider-Man movie, one maybe more darker and longer. This might be because Sam Raimi has the most control on what goes on in this movie and lets face it, Raimi specializes in horror movies. For directing Spider-Man, he does a pretty good job. For writing it, he might need some practice. Spider-Man movies are completely different than horror movies (like said in another review I wrote). I think some parts of Spider-Man 3 are memorable, but some are failures. The movie begins with Peter Parker finally having his alter ego Spider-Man being accepted. Peter's connection with Mary Jane is also going swimmingly and he is going to ask her to marry him. Just then, Peter is attacked by his friend Harry, who is trying to avenge his father. This conflict grows bigger as the movie goes on (but I'll get to that later). Meanwhile, a man, Flint Marko, has escaped prison and is trying to get money for his sick daughter. While on the run, he is mutated in a sand mixture and becomes the Sandman. With his sand like powers, attempts to steal money, and being the real killer of Peter's uncle, Peter cannot stop thinking about having revenge on the Sandman. Then suddenly, Peter wakes up with a new black Spider-Man outfit that is made from a substance that links itself to a host. This Spider-Man costume makes Peter darker and stronger. With it, he fights the Sandman and thinks to have killed him. Then things start to go wrong with M.J. and Peter. M.J. has lost her job and starts to think Peter isn't there for her. Eventually, she dumps him for Harry. Peter than becomes as dark as his feelings for revenge and hurts Harry, M.J., and Eddie Brock (a person who works for the Daily Bugle). Eddie seems to hate Peter more than the others and finds Peter trying to take his black spider man suit off in a church. The black substance from the suit falls on Eddie and he becomes the new Spider-Man villain Venom. In the end, Spider-Man 3 entertains us, buts lets us down with some bad dialogue and to many plots. It would be better that in the future, that if a Spider-Man 4 comes out, David Koepp or somebody from Spider-Man 2 should write it. The results of what people might think of this movie are split into three sides. Some will love it; some will find it different (me), and little will find it bad. So overall, this movie gets a B- from me.<br/><br/>-Ben Russell"
"refusetobeenthused","6","1","2","26 June 2007"," Does everything a sequel should, but overzealous
","SM3 compounds on elements from the first two films, is the most visually stunning (Sandman's birth--classic), and had a decent moral attached to Peter's dilemma this time around, but falls short on the villain side, the first two movies' strengths. I have no doubt Church and Grace would have turned better performances had each of their characters been in separate movies, but here they are mashed into the already dry story of MJ and Peter's off/on relationship, something I personally felt was wrapped up fine in SM2. Gwen Stacey has a fair introduction, if a bit awkward in this continuity, and I think they squeezed she and Capt. Stacey into the story far better than Sandman and Venom. Church has the worst dialog, but the best visual effects, while Topher is the most amusing character but lacks a good amount of screen time. Prior to the Raimi-confessed producer ""pointers"" made towards fitting in Venom ""at the fans' demand"" (but not at the cost of a decent movie, dammit), Raimi had in mind a simpler, better-flowing plot with about three or four less characters, which would have smoothed the choppy storyline. Sandman's motivation for crime was unbelievably lame (a sick daughter???) and his ties to Peter are revolting, it just all reeks of studio intervention to sell some black-suited Spidey toys. Venom as the embodiment of Peter's struggle with vengeance makes sense, but Sandman as the catalyst? Several fans were advocating Flint Marko's murder of Peter's uncle as a hallucination induced by the symbiote, which would have heightened the drama and better expressed the threat of the symbiote (where were the producers then?). Harry's character came full circle. No disappointments there except for the costume, which, after the first film, I stopped caring about as Raimi makes the characters work anyhow. I especially loved Harry tormenting Peter emotionally, ""attacking his heart"" as the first Goblin aimed to.<br/><br/>It's definitely the most ambitious and worst of the three films as it tried to juggle so many story lines that somewhere along the task of tying them together it got really ridiculous. I'm not suggesting the villains have to be the focal point of the story like the Burton Batman films, but SM3 lacked the nice balance the first two had of Peter's growth as a person, and the villain's story. I'd say overall it beats X3 and every other recent, sub-par superhero film, even though it has nearly the same kinds of problems--poor, strictly expository dialog, lame or underused story elements, and a plot not worthy of the visuals associated with it. Raimi barely holds it all together."
"vsilly25","7","1","2","26 June 2007"," Please let there be a 4th
","7/10 stars for me is bad for a Spiderman movie. I would give the 1st and 2nd ones 8 and 9 stars. Don't get me wrong this is a good movie by itself. But compared to the previous installments, it just doesn't have that extra something that made the other ones great. Maybe it was too much talking not enough action. Adding some drama is great, especially when the drama is backstabbing and betrayal, but there wasn't a great action scene. The first had the great Parade and bridge scene, the second had the train scene, the bank scene (which still gives me chills seeing an old woman falling off a building only to be saved seconds before) and the final dock scene. Compared to these, the Harry vs. Peter scene and the construction sight just don't cut it. And just like the second, there is a scene of awkward walking and facial expressions that is just unbearable. This is a good movie no doubt, but it leaves us dangling for a 4th installment."

"funkyfry","6","1","2","15 June 2007"," Decent conclusion to a good series
","Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" isn't as good as you hoped and it's not as bad as you might have heard. It is a solid conclusion to the story initiated in the first installment, and (unlike most other recent sequels) if you enjoyed the other 2 films in the series I think it's safe to say you won't be bored with this one.<br/><br/>There simply aren't any villains in the Spiderman comics as exciting as the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, so perhaps in compensation this film gives us 3 different villains. It also asks us to ponder what becomes of an innocent love like that of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) when one of the lovers is highly successful in life while the other meets bitter disappointments (in the case of M.J., a weak Broadway debut singing an old Irving Berlin song). Parker has become so comfortable with his girlfriend that his treatment actually becomes unintentionally callous, as when he kisses a blonde he knows from school (Bryce Dallas Howard) in an imitation of the ""trademark"" kiss with M.J. from the first film. I don't think, for example, that it's a coincidence calls her the familiar (and gender-neutral) ""M.J."" while more attentive Harry (James Franco) calls her ""Mary Jane"". Unfortunately Harry's still harboring affection for his old man, and only an improbably bout of amnesia keeps him from donning his armor as the ""New Green Goblin"" through most of the film. Spidey is also confronted with the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), the film's most sympathetic villain, a would-be thief who wanders into a disintegration chamber and becomes a shape shifter, and he struggles with his dark side after an alien organism bonds with his body to produce a new black suit that draws out his arrogant side. The 3rd side villain is Venom, who starts out as Spiderman's rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace).<br/><br/>So let's just take the villains in order. I think James Franco's performances have been improving and I'd quite like to see him in something where he can stretch his muscles a bit more. He's got that wicked grin that reminds you of ambiguous bad guys of the past from Jack Nicholson on down through Lon Chaney. I liked him in the movie, but his character didn't get that much attention and the whole amnesia angle was pretty contrived even if it did manage to advance the story along. The film's weakest scene is a cheat, depriving us of judging the extent of Franco's talent  he's saved from making an important and painful decision about whether to kill Spidey by a lame dues-ex-machina confession from the butler of all people! Church gave the best performance and had the most interesting character, even if his stand-issue-melodrama sick child was just as contrived as Greeney's amnesia. He really managed to connect with the audience to a remarkable extent especially considering how few bones the writers threw his way. Also the effects sequences with Sandman's initial rampage were the most impressive and engaging in the film. A lot of the other effects scenes become too ""noisy"" or crowded with movement and it detracts from the emotion and suspense of the scenes, particularly the nonsense scene where hundreds of cars are for some reason on top of a half-finished skyscraper waiting to be hurled at Spidey by Venom and Sandman, who've joined forces.<br/><br/>Venom was the weakest villain, but only part of the blame belongs to Grace. He was actually very effective in the scenes where he played Eddie Brock  he looks and acts like a slightly better and more glamorous version of Peter Parker, which is just perfect. But the character ends up being poorly written when he makes the transition to supervillain. First of all, it's understandable that he'd be angry when Parker exposed his scam with the photos but I didn't buy that it would send him on a mission of vengeance. And for another thing if he was going to put on the suit and become Venom they should have given him that choice and let him make a decision instead of having it appear to be an accident. The effects for Venom were also a huge miscalculation IMHO  once he was Venom, Grace's voice should have sufficed to establish his identity. Continually peeling away the Venom mask to reveal Grace's face every single time he delivered dialog was a bad idea  it just didn't look right somehow and also felt repetitive. It was a lazy solution to the problem of keeping Grace's interpretation of the character front and center after he put on the suit.<br/><br/>That's about all I have to say about the film. I thought it was fairly interesting because it got into themes of the dark side of heroism and success, something I haven't really seen in serious action films too often. Some of the action scenes were very good, others were just kind of over the top. I liked the development of the triangle between MJ, Peter and Harry. It's definitely not as good as I was hoping it would be when the first film came out, but it's a reasonably satisfying conclusion to the ""story arc""  and maybe I'm the only one but I felt it was better in general than the second film in the series."
"worst_address_ever","6","1","2","11 June 2007"," I really don't know what to say...
","I have to be honest, I was waiting for this film since of heard of it being written, I could only think nothing but good things when I heard venom was in it, as he is my favourite character of all time. But I'm sure you've read this on almost every other comment made, in every magazine, on every website, and on every TV show. Spider man 3, tries too hard, that's just it, all the critics want to see more character development in films, but this film shouldn't have had it. EXCEPT FOR VENOM. Venom is one of Spider-mans biggest enemy's and he had about 20 minutes of screen time. Whilst Sandman and Spiderman fought threw the whole film quite viciously, and at the end it's all solved by an apology. That I didn't like.<br/><br/>My first comment. The synviote that falls from the sky in what can only be described as a small asteroid and lands suspiciously close to peter parker, without him noticing. It's wrong. JJJ's son (an astronaut) brings to synviote back from mars originally.<br/><br/>My objection to other comments made. Yes Parkers spider sense didn't go off, anyone who has ever seen a Spiderman comic book with venom in it should no that venom is invisible to Spiderman's spidey sense.<br/><br/>The dancing scene. OK ill agree it was over blown a bit, and it just seemed an excuse to me for the actors to, well act. A few critics said before it was released that there was high hopes that it wasn't all special effects. Well it wasn't, and looks what happened. In defence to the scene, that actually happens in the comic books (the dancing and showing off) it is necessary to show how parkers character has changed, he's now an arrogant self absorbed fool who's willing to go to any lengths to make MJ feel bad because of what she did to him.<br/><br/>The crap dialogue. When Spiderman showed up to the final battle, two kids watching from the street say<br/><br/>""Wow!"" ""Awesome!""<br/><br/>Now ill agree not the most exciting or well acted lines I've ever heard, but those of you that complained, ill ask you to remember.<br/><br/>This is essentially a kid's film, although a 12, its still a fantasy.<br/><br/>Same goes for when he lands in front of the huge USA flag, yes it was so patriotic it made me bleed, but Spiderman is an American hero.<br/><br/>Although it may sound like I've done nothing but defend this film and then gone ahead and given it only a 6 out of 10, like my title says, I rally wasn't sure about this film, I watched it on the opening night, maybe I was expecting o much, My girl friend who hadn't really thought about the film before its release, absolutely loved it. But didn't understand the bell thing with venom at the end, and other things you wouldn't get if you didn't know the comics.<br/><br/>It's a shame really, if you no the comic books you'll look forward to the film to much, and if you don't you'll love the film but you won't understand it.<br/><br/>I hear there's going to be at least another 3 movies, let's hope there at the same standard as the first one shall we?"

","This movie sucked. Half of the movie was peter and MJ talking about their relationship. I thought it was a good idea to have 3 villains, but its how they got their powers that was the stupid part. Sandman got his powers by getting spun around with some sand, whats that all about, why were they spinning sand. and there was no scientific explanation for that(getting some sand in your finger wouldn't give u sand powers, maybe if there was some radiation in there or something it would of made more sense. And Venom its a big coincidence that a meteorite containing some black goo (wich also had little info given on it, the whole movie i was wondering were it came from)just landed next to Spider-Man, out of anywhere in the world. And Venoms weakness, a bell! i mean who's the guy that thought up his weakness to be a bell!!! and Spider-Man did not use his spidi sense once in the whole movie, like when he was riding his scooter and suddenly the green goblin came and attacked him,what the hell happened to his spidi sense? Spider-Mans whole reason for becoming Spider-Man was because he let the robber from the wrestling get away, who later killed his uncle. But once he finds out that it was actually sandman that killed his uncle that left him with no motive of becoming Spider-Man. So this movie sucked and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

","I mean it-- bangs and all. The Spidey franchise takes a cue from 1983's heavily underrated ""Superman III"" by making the hero go bad. This time, it's thanks to black alien goo and the results involve neither the Leaning Tower of Pisa nor the Olympic Torch. Spidey dons a black suit and styles his hair in the emo fashion before strutting down the street like a '70s-flick gigolo, winking and snapping at girls as he goes along. Harry (also the Hobgoblin here) dances, MJ (Kirsten Dunst, still without acting lessons) sings, and Topher Grace (as Peter's rival photographer Eddie Brock) prays to God for the death of Parker. However, the film actually rises above its two predecessors by keeping the drama (however overdone) above cheap 3-D thrills. Several of the gags are quite memorable, and it's always fun to see Spidey in action. Good or evil, Tobey Maguire still wears the suit well after five years."

","What a sad way for the franchise to end, and after this I hope it ends. But if it does well they will make another, but the next one won't get my box office dollar.<br/><br/>Seriously, stay away. Poor plot, poorly acted, too much SF not enough story to keep anyone over the age of 8 interested.<br/><br/>Two stars, and I'm being nice. MJ and Spidy love story made Anakin/Padme seem like Romeo and Juliet. I don't get the Topher Grace role, and Sandman added nothing to the plot but an excuse for SFX. Wow, lots of tears from Spidy as well, get ready to cringe.<br/><br/>On the bright side, it does end, and the lights go up."
"victorwitte","Null","1","2","7 June 2007"," Spidey 3, Hmm
","Today I got home from a friend with a dirty hangover en decided to see Spidey 3..finally! There's a lot to say about this movie, it's a very fun flick with lots of action en lots of girls too :) what you diddn't saw in the first two movies. Beautifully shot and nice camera work especially in the action scenes, when spidey fly's through the streets, or should I say, spiding? The characters are also a big plus in this third one. There are 3 baddies this time: the Sandman, Venom and New Goblin. The first two are the most fun to watch and just kicking' ass. Sandman has something to do with the Uncle of Peter and fits right in the story. Venom is actually a co-worker of Peter Parker at the Daiy Bugle en has some business to finish with Spidey. Venom is a kind of species out of space and attaches to a body, in this case to Eddy Brock/Venom but earlier in the film it attaches to Spidey's suit. It gives Spiderman a lot more strenght but also gives him dark powers en Peter struggles with his good side and bad side which is a nice subplot to the movie. Harry Osmond plays a much bigger role in this film and still wants revenge for his dad. Besides the cool acion and the art of filming the overall feeling of the movie is a bit cheesy, and thats a big flaw! Peter gets a bit cocky and makes himself pretty ridiculous and some one-liners should have stayed in the closet. And of course there's MJ, Peter's big love, she has kind of a story on her one which isn't bad at all and gives the film more space to breathe. Overall i't's a fun movie with enough for everybody, not as good as the first two parts but definitely not a waste of time and money."
"revival05","7","1","2","7 June 2007"," More complexity, less coherence - still a lot of fun
","This is my first, spontaneous reaction of Spidey 3, and I guess I have yet to see the film again, preferably on DVD, to see if I missed something.<br/><br/>First of all, the previous 2 films made me cheer like a fool since I am a child of Marvel and even though I have not touched a Spider-Man comic book in any significant way since I was twelve, they did blow me off my seat in a mix of nostalgia and well, a sense of having that same old fun, fun, fun again. As many others, I felt that while the first film was an impressive adaption the second did kick some serious butt. All I needed from there was Venom, and I'd be sound as a pound.<br/><br/>The third Spidey takes on a somewhat new direction. Claiming that it's ""dark"" would perhaps be to overdo it (after all, Spidey will never be no Batman), but the intrigue this time is filled with a lot of complications and characters feeling fairly miserable. More importantly, I feel the film takes on a symbolic coherence in it's thematic department, something that the first two films had no interest in, since they were mostly about buttering the popcorn. Spidey 3 is in many ways a film about symbiosis and duality. Naturally, we have the alien gooey stuff which turns him into a ""bad"" spider and creates Venom out of Topher Grace's nicely played Eddie Brock. But overall, the film is filled with situations where two images or personalities are standing in between each other - Harry's memory loss, the truth about the murder of Peter's Uncle Ben - and not to mention characters with fatherly angst going up against each other. For me, this is the most surprising and interesting element of the film and it sets it apart from the other two in a reasonable way - after all, what can you add to the near perfection of ""Spider-Man 2""?<br/><br/>The critics have a point or two, even though I don't see why now's the time to be picky. The film is uneven and way too long, it has a lot of plot holes and have a lot of things going on instead of just tying together a couple of good tight few ones. It's perhaps trying too hard. But these films are often more interesting than more conventionally structured ones. I like the playfulness and the elimination of predictable dramatical events. This is not a film where the plot follows Aristotle like clockwork - it's almost passionately rough, constantly being all over the place. It could be a flaw, but I kinda like it nevertheless. A bigger problem is the slow parts in the middle of the film, where it feels like the soap opera of Parker & MJ is fairly routine stuff in the hands of Raimi & C:O (noticing Bruce Campbell is however a treat, as always). I also have some nerdy comments, like feeling that Venom is given the Darth Maul-treatment and furthermore having a hard time taking Topher Grace as Eddie Brock - he does a fine job, but it annoys the heck out of me that the physically more suitable Thomas Haden Church is stuck with Sandman (which he does splendidly as well, so I realize my comments here are pointlessly subjective).<br/><br/>Needless to say, the action and special effects in Spidey 3 is just plain ""rocks off""-splendor. But there is also a kind of intensity, and even intelligence, in Spider-Man 3 that the two previous films did not have. On the other hand, they definitely felt more solid in structure and pace. So, in general, I had just as much fun watching the third entry as I had watching the other two."
"stukylemulkey","8","1","2","7 June 2007"," I just don't understand
","I don't understand why people loved the second spidey movie so much and didn't like this one. I am completely opposite, I thought the second one was the worst of the series and this movie was amazing. I loved the inner turmoil that existed within Peter and how Mary Jane was overwhelmed by his arrogance of being Spidey that she couldn't even talk to him about what was troubling her. I thought that James Franco did a terrific job of pulling off the sneaky New Goblin but coming to terms with his fathers death in the end. The villains in the movie were the best yet. Sand Man was much more conveyed and emotional in this movie than the wonderfully done green goblin of the first one and the disappointing act of the doc ock of the second movie. Thomas Haden Church brought with him a sense of reason to being a villain. I realize the way he became sand man was a little far fetched but it worked for a super hero movie and the special effects on that scene and any scene with the sand man were done spectacularly. The other villain of the movie, Venom, was also done very nicely. I will agree with other people that he didn't have enough screen time but what I can say to them is enjoy it while it was there because when Venom was on screen it was amazing. The look that the movie had with Venom really was wonderful. Venom looked like the old version that everyone from the comics and cartoons loved but at the same time it had a new style to it that made him much meaner and darker. (which is hard to do) I am not a huge fan of topher grace but he really came through on this role and pulled off Eddie Brock in a very convincing way. The black suited Spidey scenes were very interesting although it could have used a little more exploration, it didn't really move the story forward until he wore it under his clothes and became John Travoltas backup. I loved that scene and my friend and I laughed throughout the entire time he was gyrating his hips. It worked perfectly. The whole emo look thing was a little over the top but acceptable. Over all, this was a great movie with a ton of unexpected twists and turns. I highly suggest seeing it"

Yes the plot has holes in it, yes it's long but....It keeps you interested for 2hrs+ The CGI was great and the story was good enough.

"antoniofnikolai","7","1","2","25 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 needed to have more care as a movie
","I believe that the movie Spiderman 3 needed to have more care because it didn't show the what we had used to the first two films. I also think that the character of Venom should be introduced into the movie, with a more different way. The film also gives us questions of whether to be a new movie, because Spidey wants to marry Mary Jane. The part I liked in the movie, was there where Sandman hits weakened Spiderman who can't move because of Venom and Harry Osborne/Green Goblin comes to the rescue. I didn't got the change of the killer of Spidey's uncle, because it changed what we knew in the two first movies. Finally I believe the fans of Spiderman should show a little mercy to the director because he has made an excellent job and even if the movie has some problems it's a good show."
"deddy-kresnoputro","7","1","2","24 May 2007"," Nice realization of spiderman... poor storyline...
","I didn't mean to make this comment as a representation to the whole Spiderman series (from 1 to 3), but first, i need to let you know that from the first movie, i don't feel like to buried my self in the story, because the storyline is not what I, as spidey loyal fans, expected. Although if I didn't know the comic book storyline, I would think the story is well produced...<br/><br/>The third story even worse, by entering Gwen Stacy character which supposed to be Peter Parker's high school sweetheart, and uncovering uncle Ben's murder mystery like that... Agreed with scott's review, that the movie has too many villains to deal with and the problem Spidey facing is just too much... although as Mary Jane told Peter, ""Even Spiderman needs help sometime..."", but the help he receive in this movie in my opinion is only for dramatical reason...<br/><br/>Great visualization of Venom, although for Spidey black suit, i prefer the suit to stand on its own instead of blending in with the original suit. The suit should be just plain black without the web outline, it will make spidey meaner... And the point of having the suit blend in with Peter's attitude, is to make him more rough and violent, not make him looks stupid...<br/><br/>Many people complaint about Peter Parker crying too much in this movie, but I think that's OK, since Spiderman is human after all...<br/><br/>Over all, good work for the whole cast and crew, even the writer, but hopefully in the next movie, we can get a clearer picture of what happening, not just scattered picture on how great Spidey is..."
"deadly_pestilence","2","1","2","23 May 2007"," Huge, Huge Letdown
","**************MAJOR MAJOR SPOILER ALERT******************** I for one, being a Spiderman junkie, couldn't wait for the third movie. I constantly checked the website for updates, I counted down the months...<br/><br/>My husband and I went to see the first showing here in Biloxi, MS the first day it opened, boy was I in for a shocker.<br/><br/>First thing I noticed was how the Spiderman music in the credits seemed off... I was like, okay they changed the music a bit, no big deal. <<; I'm a huge fan of Danny Elfman, and the score in this movie was not like the other ones, A lot of the times the music would blare so loud and over the top that it was annoying. <br/><br/>Then you see the beginning of the movie, MJ is singing, Peter goes to see her performance, and he's watching her sing, and mouthing the lyrics. I was like yay dopey Peter! Then the camera pans to Harry, and as usual he's his grouchy self, and so on.<br/><br/>I'm sitting there waiting for the action to happen, and voilà, fight scene with Harry! ""You knew this was coming, Pete!"" I had to roll my eyes several times, the camera was shaking so violently constantly it annoyed me. I could hardly tell what the heck was going on the whole time. <br/><br/>Harry gets injured, and loses his semi-recent memories, (his father dying), and becomes... nice. I was shocked.<br/><br/>Peter on the other hand constantly brags about himself, which made me talk out loud in the theater a lot asking when the heck he stopped being a humble nerd. He would brag to MJ, not give a crap about her problems at all. (Drama drama.)<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy gives Spiderman ""The Key to the City"" and he even says to give him a kiss because the crowd ""will love it!"" So, Spiderman and Gwen Stacy kiss like he and MJ did in Spiderman 1, she pulls his mask down, revealing his lips, and kisses him, RIGHT IN FRONT OF MJ! I was like, NUH UH!<br/><br/>Later this evening, he wants to propose to MJ. Which is one of the only scenes I sort of enjoyed, thanks to Bruce Campbell. Mj walks in, obviously majorly depressed about her singing gig, and Peter kissing that other girl.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy walks in, and starts putting her hands all over Peter whilst talking to the both of them, and then asks if Peter could get her a picture of her kissing Spiderman. When MJ confronted him about it, he acted like it didn't even matter.<br/><br/>What the hell happened? One minute he worships her, and now it's like he couldn't give a crap about her either way.<br/><br/>Soon Peter dons the Black Suit, and starts the Emo Peter Act. You know he transforms because he pushes his bangs down over his forehead, and somehow he's as scary as a.... kitten. <br/><br/>Impressive.<br/><br/>He walks around the city, dancing in public, hitting on women... It drove me insane. He acted so stupid I was too shocked to even laugh.<br/><br/>Now don't get me started on the villains but, oh well, here goes. We're introduced to Thomas Hayden Chruch's character. He has a sick daughter that is apparently behind all his money thievery motives... We never learn much about her, or why she's sick, so naturally I never cared. Poor scriptwriting there. Half the time I didn't know whether to feel sorry for Sandman, or hate him.<br/><br/>Venom, he had only like 15 minutes of actually screen time, and he teamed up with Sandman to take on Spiderman... That was lame as hell.<br/><br/>Fight scenes were short, and not impressive at all in my opinion. There weren't many, that made it worse. There was so much drama I thought I was in the wrong theater.<br/><br/>Now if all the ""drama"" was actually a real plot, I could forgive it. But so much crap was happening at once, with Harry turning nice, Peter into a jerk, MJ mad at Peter, wanting Harry for comfort... My head was spinning. That isn't plot, that's an episode of Dawson's Creek on steroids.<br/><br/>Now, we all know Harry has been suffering because he thinks Spiderman killed his father. WELL, towards the end of the movie, after all the stupid useless tripe.... Spiderman asks for Harry's help to fight Sandman and Venom, and save MJ. He says no, blah blah blah. THEN we have the wonderful Butler to walk in, and tell Harry how he cleaned his father's wounds the night he died, and he was killed by his own glider. WOW!! THANKS FOR TELLING HARRY NOW AFTER WATCHING HIM SUFFER! That felt thrown in, and that annoyed the hell out of me!<br/><br/>Then you have super cheesy death scene with Harry... It's like the writers knew that Harry was annoying, and did a desperate attempt with memory loss to make us like him, so we could actually care a little when they kill him off.<br/><br/>I wish I walked out. My husband fell asleep halfway through.... =|<br/><br/>Huge, huge letdown -breathes-"
"dunmore_ego","9","1","2","21 May 2007"," Really Swingin'
","What an adventure! *Spiderman 3* is a swingin' soirée; a chill-er thriller lady-killer that tops both its previous incarnations with smooth-headed, web-spangling adventure and vibrant, flesh-colored emotion. Heroes tainted by evil, villains infused with poignancy, lovers circling in triangles and Topher Grace as the meanest metrosexual this side of *American Idol.* Writer-director Sam Raimi bats it out of the super stadium with this spider.<br/><br/>Spiderman is now to New York what Superman was to Metropolis  an actual ""hero,"" despite J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) crusade to discredit him through *The Daily Bugle*. And self-absorbed Peter Parker aka Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) lets his hubris blind him to his flame-haired squeeze, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) having lost her baby fat and consequently her unconditional support of his heroic antics. Whereas at the conclusion of *Spider-Man 2* (2004) she exhorted him, ""Go get 'em, tiger!"" reality has now settled like a gargoyle on her syrup-flavored romantic notions of being hero-worshipped by a hero and, like every woman whose designs to ""change a man"" don't pan out, restlessly looks further afield for the fantasy eunuch she thought she had found in Peter.<br/><br/>Enter Harry Osborn (James Franco), MJ's ex and Peter's best friend. The first love-triangle is set in motion (two guys and one girl).<br/><br/>Though I chided Franco's talent in *Spider-Man*, *Spider-Man 3* forces a re-assessment of his prowess as actor and character  I stand corrected, sir! No longer nutless or translucent, James Franco is the embodiment of nuance! His dual role as Harry Osborn and New Goblin is the most challenging of the film - that of hero's friend driven to hate, then amnesiac friendship, then friendship pretense masking evil intent, then sincerely offering friendship once more in a compelling Marvel Team-Up situation, ultimately meeting his end by saving Spiderman's life in the same way that his father, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), tried to take it.<br/><br/>As one villain falls, another rises.<br/><br/>The origin of the Sandman (an in-shape Thomas Haden Church, with his sad Jagger lips and famous green-striped shirt) is epic and heartrending all at once: after good ol' 1950's radiation comes to the rescue as Plot Device and irradiates Flint Marko into a sentient sand-being, he finds he cannot grasp his daughter's pendant without exerting an incredible force of will to cohere his molecules into solidity. The CGI visualization of the distraught Sandman's sandy complexion is desolation boulevard; the best CG sand effects you will ever see in motion pictures today. He maintains, ""I'm not a bad person. I've just had bad luck."" <br/><br/>Spiderman lore is audaciously breached when the film's writers make Flint Marko the real killer of Peter's Uncle Ben (as opposed to that doughy guy with the frosted hair who killed Uncle Ben in the 2002 flick), to raise the emotional stakes, giving Peter further reason to de-sand the Sandman.<br/><br/>As if this revelation and his breakup and his rent being late aren't bad enough, Spiderman must face his own inner demons when an alien goop from outer space changes his costume black and his personality to Buddy Love (Jerry Lewis version). (Don't even ask - there are too many years of comic book doctrine for even the movie to exposit this goopy thing properly). This is the only point where it almost gets irretrievably silly: Peter Parker becomes so outlandishly arrogant he struts the streets like Travolta with women sniggering at him like he's, well, Tobey Macguire <br/><br/>Thus the second love-triangle coalesces (two girls and one guy), putting a crimp in MJ's first love-triangle, as Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) oozes on Gangsta Peter, planting an upside-down kiss on Spidey in public, giving MJ license to whine like the spoiled byoch she is.<br/><br/>In my review of *In Good Company* (2004), I opined, ""One day Topher Grace will learn that ""acting"" is not behaving like you're making one big apology."" That day has come. In his role as unctuous photographer Eddie Brock, Topher flies way past the meridian on apologetic and slams into Jugular Deranged in his transformation into one of the fiercest creatures ever to try biting into Spiderman's roundish head  Venom.<br/><br/>The greatest stunt that Raimi pulls in this movie is to imbue both heroes and villains with a wrenching poignancy; amongst the creatively spectacular battle sequences, his human protagonists have not been forgotten. In fact, the most touching scenes involve the Sandman, whether he's tragically seeking forgiveness from his own family or explaining to Peter how he accidentally shot Uncle Ben - look up Sob Story in the dictionary, there's a picture of *this* guy. By the time his Oscar moment rolls around and Peter, teary-eyed, absolves him, we are also weeping into our plastic pizzas (well, at least I was).<br/><br/>Movie is long, but doesn't flag  except for the ACTUAL flag that Spiderman lands directly in front of; an obvious ""Go USA"" moment that is perfunctorily used in trailers. You want inspiring? Forget the flag - bring Danny Elfman back (music for both previous films); composer Christopher Young sparingly uses Elfman's grandiose horn line and it is sadly missed.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell in a hilarious cameo speaking Monty Python French; James Cromwell underused; Willem Dafoe as creepy mirror reflection again; and Stan Lee's best cameo in a Marvel film ever.<br/><br/>'Nuff said!<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"
"bustin_skullz","8","1","2","22 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 was good, but a bit disappointing
","Spiderman 3 was a lot of fun to watch. I was so excited to watch it because of the drama and action which was going to take place. When I watched it, I still left happy. I still talked about it with my girl friend and family. We all loved it. We all agreed that there was a little ""too much"" put into it to fully love it. Like many people say, it sort of lacked the brilliance of spiderman 2. Spiderman 2 was awesome! Spiderman 3 was good. See the difference? Besides all the ""Too much"", I was looking for a lot of involvement with Venom. Lets do a little history, Venom is spiderman's worst and deadly enemy because venom has his exact same powers but more deadlier, spiderman can't use his spider senses, and he is a major threat to spiderman. It really lacked those options. It would've been nice if we saw Spiderman and Venom web slinging in the town and fighting each other. That didn't happen, sadly. :( .... The movie could've honestly left out sandman and use more of venom, or vice versa of using sandman throughout the whole movie. (which ever will make u smile) In the movie, we never got to see why venom was such a threat. The only thing we knew was he had powers like spiderman.<br/><br/>Another thing which sadly ""sucked"" was spiderman kept getting his butt whoopped or ""served"". In Spiderman 2, Spiderman was an awesome fighter, and we could tell Peter learned new moves and learned more of using his abilities. Spiderman 3 failed to prevail that to us. Spiderman was just web slinging and not much action until his black suit came on. It leads to the question, does spiderman know how to fight? Spiderman is supposed to be a better fighter, and be more smarter and wiser.<br/><br/>We know Spiderman has spider senses right? Well, it wasn't in the movie. There was not a scene where spiderman had a prediction and moved as quickly as possible. It sadden me when I notice this. Spiderman could've been like batman, but he knew how to shoot out a web. This movie was kind of rushed and missed key important figures.<br/><br/>However! Peter Parker does an amazing bad boy act. People criticize it, but I thought it was funny and fun. OK. Peter Parker is a dork right? He is nice right? Well isn't that suppose to be reversed because of the transformation which the outer-space creature does to him? Tobey Maguire did a great job at it. We never expected him to do anything of that nature. Tobey Maguire in general is a mild manner guy, and isn't knownfor a ""bad boy"" attitude. He made it fun, and showed us a sign of acting. Stop messing him! He did a great job.<br/><br/>The movie picks up very well! It doesn't go into a whole new chapter and has no relativity. Spiderman 3 picks it up very well, but just misses a few figures which doesn't top em all. The action was great and so was the effects. You gotta them credit for the effects. They are as real as they can be; however, it doesn't have a whole new jump start like spiderman 2. I hope if another one is made, the next producer can bring venom back and do some more work. The sandman showed it's purpose. Venom did not. Venom is like dark side with Superman. Dark side is more powerful than Superman, and Superman has to use everything he can to win. Venom didn't serve his same purpose. We saw how spiderman was no match, but we want more. That's it. Spiderman 3 is still a great sequel; sadly, not many movies has a 3rd film to pick up all the rest of the films. It would've been nice to see it, but sadly it couldn't compete. Again, the movie is good or great however you want to say it. Many people criticize because they aren't spiderman fans. Any Spiderman fan would love it. It lacked a few figures"
"tonyhurl","4","1","2","21 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 sucks.....
","What happened Sam Raimi? The first 2 Spider-man's are exceptional. This third one barely even qualifies as a Spider-man movie. More like a daytime soap opera with a cry baby protagonist going out with a self centered egotistical failed actress while trying to handle 3 poorly executed villains with no back-story or explanation whatsoever jumbled into one overly long, self indulgent, massively contrived hollywoodized corporate propaganda of a film. I hear remnants of a failed Batman franchise. Here Spider-man is being driven directly into the ground at no less then 140 minutes of screen time. Please for the sake of the fans, don't make Spidey 4,5,6,7 as originally planned before sitting down with a pad and paper and actually try to figure out how a good Spider-Man movie can come about. (see #1 & 2) On the contrary, not everything about the movie was complete garbage. The few minutes Venom (real Venom, not just the black suit) is on screen (I think 5) is extremely exciting and Bryce Dallas Howard is gorgeous as Gwen Stacy. Other then that don't waste your time. Wait till it's at Publix for a dollar rental."

","I did just see it. Most of the complaints about it are true-to an extent: overlong, way too stuffed w/ lazy writing devices(the Butler, Harry's constant switcheroos, tacked on ending), too many baddies(More Sandman/deep six Venom), strangely truncated Gwen Stacy role(Cameo! say wha-?), etc. So sure, I can understand the bitching here. It's also too long, and some of the Emo Peter stuff was lame and for the birds. But you know what? Though it suffers from Lethal Weapon III-ness, it DOES work, despite itself. Sandman's great. Spidey/Gobby II fights ditto. JJJ is a hoot, as always. The whole Saving Gwen routine w/ the crane from hell was fun. I did think they over did the 'combat/heroics while falling' stuff over-much, and yeah, once again, you had MJ doing the damsel in distress routine at the end, but it was still pretty good. I did think the Dumping Petey on the bridge after being threatoned by Harry part was the low-point of the whole movie, for what it's worth-none of that worked. The much-abused butler was lame too but you can live w/ it. I actually got a kick outta the whole 'Twistin in the Kitchen'/'Stayin Alive-the Spidey remix' routines, but they do seem to have come in from a neighbouring set, ya know? <br/><br/>This was clearly meant to be the last of a series, let's hope if they come back to it-they trot out new writers and let the Lizard/Electro do their things. Raimi seemed like he was stretched here. I liked it though, FWIW--pretty entertaining, if you set yer sights lower and don't expect coherence in some of the Gobby's actions etc--it's worth your time.<br/><br/>*** outta **** just because it's fun."
"jwbrooks60","6","1","2","20 May 2007"," Love, Morals, and Some SPecial Effects
","High Budget super hero movies tend to be chock full of special effects, but often times have very little human interaction or story line. It is obvious that this movie has grand ambitions, it wants to give it all to us.<br/><br/>So this movie should be titled Spiderman A Jack of All Trades. We have a love triangle, and a plethora of nasty villains, all rolled up in a nice casing of morality. I left the theater comfortable in knowing that I always have choices that I can make.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie. However it simply isn't a great movie. You can get good food at the buffet, but there is rarely anything at the buffet that is the best you ever had. The love triangle and conflict isn't terrible, but it isn't especially compelling. The action scenes are fast and furious, but they seem to have little or no closure. Not terrible, but not really satisfying either. I want a roller coaster ride where I say ""wow"", and I never really felt ""wowed"".<br/><br/>At least the Peter PArker character is maturing. Finally we are seeing this character come out of his shell, as you would expect the influence of Spiderman to carry over to Peter. Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson character could use a little more assertiveness, that character really hasn't grown very much now through three movies.<br/><br/>This movie left me wanting more. The potentiall of this sandman character left me wanting more. What exactly can this guy do and no do? What are his weaknesses? CAn he be killed? I guess the lack of closure here gives us a basis for Spiderman 4.<br/><br/>Where are movies heading? There are soma man sequels coming out this summer. Is it simply enough to spend some big bucks on special effects, come up with a few cute lines of dialoge, and not really have much of a story? I guess maybe it is."
"RamirBorja","4","1","2","20 May 2007"," Too much melodrama but didn't deliver on a tight story and character development.
","The worst in the series, it didn't live up to its hype. Too much melodrama but didn't deliver on a tight story and character development.<br/><br/>It lacked focus, so many villains but none came out interesting. We have Sandman who has a boring backstory and his motivation lacks depth. Then there's Venom who I understand is supposed to be the arch-nemesis of Spiderman, but makes his entrance too late in the movie and was given too little screen time. And easily dispatched too, what a waste. Then the new Green Goblin, Harry Osbourne, is not central to the story and was put aside for most of the movie due to amnesia, only to be entangled with Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson's lovelife. That lovelife bit btw turn out to be very dragging, they really overdo it this time.<br/><br/>""The greatest battle lies within"", says the poster. I'm really interested on what it is about but Peter's dark side turns out to be emo, funny for a while but not what I'm expecting.<br/><br/>The script really tries to narrate so many threads, resulting on some very lame deus ex machina. One example is the butler who just decided to tell Harry, after all this time, what really happened during his father's death.<br/><br/>The film turns up some good special effects. Watched this is in IMAX, too bad it's in 2D, but I say the fight scenes are more kinetic than the previous two. Still, I've seen nothing new and the scenes are really forgettable.<br/><br/>A mediocre superhero movie, a pity since the first two are well done. I don't think I'm inclined to watch this again."

I loved when he took his new costume and his life and the way of seeing life changed<br/><br/>I didn't really liked when he hit MJ but the rest of it was absolutely great. Great work.<br/><br/>Really great movie<br/><br/>I look forward to see the next one"
"erindg22","3","1","2","20 May 2007"," My plot summary of Spider-Man 3 *WARNING- SPOILERS*
","Where do I begin on this one? So the very handsome and manly *gay* Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is smooching on his love, MJ (Kirsten Dunst) *icky icky eww*, when an evil parasitic substance crashes into Earth from a meteor *huh?*. Meanwhile, the dumb guy from WINGS *really?* escapes from prison to care for his ailing *someone big in the studio had to have lost a hand of poker and had to cast his buddy's kid- she looks like she got in a hatchet fight and lost her hatchet* daughter, but it turns out that he did or did not kill Peter Parker's uncle, and then he gets chased down by the cops and hides in a pit where they are trying to change the molecular structure of, apparently, sand, *Oh my God, they hate this sand!* and the dude from WINGS is all like, ""I am the sand guy, watch out Spidey, cause I am all gonna like totally rob some guys while you are getting handed a key to the city and kissing a girl that isn't MJ and then I'm gonna like turn into sand again cause my kid is ugly and needs surgery"" or something like that.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter Parker's best friend, the cute guy, Harry or something, hates him and tries to kill him, but then he hits his head and Peter Parker gives him CPR and he gets revived and doesn't remember anything, and he's all like ""Oh, I love you Peter Parker. And I am gonna cook up some bad-ass omelettes and try to bang your girlfriend,"" but then his dead dad speaks to him and tells him to get back at Peter Parker. It's OK though, because at the end Peter Parker is all like, ""Dude, come fight the sand guy and photog with me and I love you and we will pretend that we are doing it for MJ and not because I want to play hide the tip with you, you pretty pretty boy you"" and Harry is kinda like ""OK"" and then he dies.<br/><br/>Before that, though, the creepy black stuff gets Peter Parker all mean and stuff, and he likes the power trip, and he starts trying to act butch and he oils up his hair and puts on guyliner, but then he is mean to MJ *Snaggletooth Dunst* and so he has to take the stuff off, but there is some photographer guy (Topher Grace) who had coffee with some chick who Spidey saved when a crane was crashing through the building where she was modeling for a copier ad (and the police chief tried to turn the power off to the whole block, because you plug cranes up to the nearest outlet) and Peter Parker called him out on a simple Photoshopped picture, and the black stuff gets on the photog guy, and he decides to kill Spidey (even though his two-timing hussy has a thing for both Spidey and Peter, but hey, let's not focus on that plot hole) and he turns into some black thing with crazy teeth that is actually kinda scary, but the dark side overtakes him, and he gets blown up by a green orb (same make and model as the green orb that only slightly scarred the pretty boy).<br/><br/>So then the sand guy from WINGS is all like, ""Oooh, I'm gonna get you Spidey"" and the black suit guy is all like ""yeah, I'm gonna get you good"" and the pretty guy is all like ""Yeah, and I'm really gonna hurt your feelings, Spidey"" and there is some French guy in a restaurant that is actually pretty funny and then PP takes his guyliner off and the pretty guy gets stabbed and dies in the sunrise and I'm not sure what happened to WINGS but I know that PP forgave him and then the credits come on."
"sbishop1","2","1","2","20 May 2007"," Hilariously bad
","In the days leading up to the mega-huge day and date release of this movie around the world, some bad buzz leaked out. I heard things like ""Spider-Man 3 sucks"" or, among critics, ""Third time's a yawn,"" and ""Raimi thinks he can do it all by himself."" I was trying to get my hopes down and not expect much. For reference, I thought the first installment was an okay film with 6/10, and SM2 was really a brilliant movie with 9.5/10. I did not see how it was possible to mess up. The ending of SM2 left such a great plot open. I wasn't expecting much though, after hearing many bad things about the movie.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to clarify, to dispose this notion, is that I'm not a comic fan. I've never read a Spider-Man comic in my entire life. So, please, remember that not everyone who hated this film was a comic fanboy.<br/><br/>All right. I go into the theatre. I wait TWO DAMN HOURS since every show until then is flat sold out. I finally get in, and the opening logos come up. The opening credits were phenomenal, I thought we were in the clear. I thought that this movie was going to be an underrated sequel, ala Godfather 3 or Batman Returns. Then...the movie started. The first line in this movie is, ""It's me! Peter Parker, your friendly neighborhood...you know."" As soon as I heard that coupled with the cheesy music, I got a sinking feeling. That sinking feeling never left. I kept watching though, and I heard crap dialogue after crap dialogue spoken by Peter/Spider-Man. Such gems included ""I'm so nervous,"" and ""That's my girlfriend!"" So then Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane arrives on-screen, who sings a musical number, yes that's right a song in Spider-Man, and then whines about her atrocious singing. Following is the worst scene transition I have ever seen, then we see a delightfully lame and cheesy fight scene. Amnesia and alien plasma being used as plot points only made me laugh more.<br/><br/>To my amazement however, the film kept getting worse. The first villain is introduced, played by Thomas Haden Church, and is developed with a personality and storyline for a whole of two minutes. He is only more unrealistic, and he is supposed to make the audience feel sad for him. It's quite hard to give a damn about the being made out of rocks when you know nothing about him.<br/><br/>After this, something(not going to say what for fear of spoilers) that was accepted as fact in the first two movies is just discarded and a new explanation is given and the viewers are supposed to blindly idiotically accept this as fact now. Peter is angry at this thing, and then he turns badass. However, badass in this case suddenly includes a dance scene where we can't see Peter's head who makes a complete moron out of himself. Sam Raimi then expects us to believe this repulsive scene which I honestly thought was a fantasy the whole time.<br/><br/>I'll stop describing the movie here, because that would be 'spoiling' this piece of garbage for you. However, you should be warned of the following. There is a super cool villain who is barely shown in the movie, a really boring climax fight, a moronic British female reporter, and BY FAR, the WORST CONCLUSION I have EVER seen on how to handle a villain's 'weakness'.<br/><br/>I left the theatre, trying to deny what I just saw. It didn't work, and I'm scarred for life. The entire cast was either baked or freaking tired of these movies when they were on the set because I've seen better acting from my little brother in the 3rd grade rendition of The Ugly Duckling. The dialogue was an abomination, and the crew of this movie pretty much deserves to be shot on sight just because of that. The story lines are cluttered, and character development has become a forgotten concept apparently. The film editing is the worst I have ever seen. I must say I'm ecstatic that it's disappointing in the box office.<br/><br/>The Good: A couple jokes that made me laugh, nice art direction, prettiful sets.<br/><br/>The BAD: Dialogue, acting, over the top tone, cluttered story lines, out-of-character script, lame effects, zero character development, nothing from the previous two movies, really sh-tty film editing.<br/><br/>Overall grade: 1 out of 4 stars D 3 out of 10<br/><br/>Recommended: NO"

"Pierre_D","7","1","2","18 May 2007"," The ""Me Decade"" has found its heroes.
","Spider-Man 3 is a film with its moments, both in action and script.<br/><br/>However, the parties involved all come off as self-obsessed, either for the careers, personal lives or whatnot to notice what is really going on around them. Now...I realize we ALL are to a degree, what with our life being the most important in some respect, but when Spider-Man fails to come off as 'heroic' and can't see obvious warning signs you have to wonder.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is a shining light in this one as the Maitre D'...offering some sorely needed comic relief and spark to a film that has too few great moments of pathos.<br/><br/>One of these, however, is the transformation of a thug into the Sandman. Running from the police after a robbery, he leaps into a pit where testing is going to happen. The scientists are oblivious to human presence and thus our villain becomes disintegrated into the sand. His first reactions after this are touching.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's transformation into Venom and his subsequent machismo is at times frightening and at times laughable (when he struts in the street for example, or tries to be a ladies man).<br/><br/>Eventually he cooperates with the Green Goblin's son to bring down a greater foe.<br/><br/>A good movie, but not a GREAT movie as Spider-Man 2 was."

","This third flick of Spider man is as good as the others two previous films. Always critics will wait for something better in every chapter of a series, a better script, effects, performance..etc. That's not important at all, you can enjoy this film as well. I'd always said that Spiderman's character must have been represented by a different actor, but, after watching it, my point of view..changed, let me say that Tobey Maguire made a really good job, stunning!, this guy improved his roll-acting with this movie. The rest of the team did good as well. The plot had a lot of emotions and the time passed to fast while I was seeing it. You will have a good time if you see it, it's a good attempt."

","My roommate and I went and saw this movie in the theater. I have never really liked the casting of Toby Maguire in the first place, but the casting choices in this third installment were atrocious all around. Bryce Howard as a romantic rival to Kirsten Dunst seemed an incredibly ridiculous notion, not because she doesn't have the looks, but Kirsten Dunst is what you'd call a teen female ""heartthrob"" and Bryce Howard isn't. She looks so out of place it's distracting. Topher Grace as Venom is ridiculous. Period. I've liked him in other things but it was almost like he was trying to be worse than he had to be. I realize Sam Raimi makes horribly cheesy films but Topher wasn't even good cheesy. Just ridiculous cheesy. It's possible that Thomas Hayden Church, while not really suited to be a super-villain, did the best acting and character work in the entire show. I was disappointed with just about everything else in the movie with the exception of J.K. Simmons who has been consistently dynamite since the first installation. Pretty depressing turn of events for Spider-man fans if you ask me."

","well... after reading so many negative comments around the internet, i was skeptical and was contemplating on watching spiderman-3. But I decided to watch the movie anyway and wow, the movie actually rocks! It's true that there's not much time allowed for character development especially on harry's side as the green goblin. But I think the villain Sandman was pretty cool and he is not your usual villain and somehow i pity him. The only villain they should not include in is Venom. They should include Venom in Spiderman-4 ! What a big waste here ! But all in all, it's still a very entertaining movie although there are some dull moments here and there.

"kalay","5","1","2","16 May 2007"," You Feel Lucky If You Missed
","Honestly, I could not classify Spider Man-3. Was it made for children, was it a comedy movie or was it action movie? There is one reality that Spider Man-3 was made just for money. To earn money does not mean that it is a successful movie. Story was rather poor and full of blanks, players especially Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst acted in middle range, action scenes were not sufficient. Tobey Maguire was not colorful and charismatic; Kirsten Dunst seemed very poor and not interesting.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes were captured from other movies such as Mask, Alien, weak Matrix and September 11th cases in the accident at the top of skyscraper. New Goblin, Sandman and Venom were seems to be created forcefully. Previous series did not support the last one. Enemy-Friend duality for New Goblin, good-bad habit Hulk style sandman, alien style Venom created not in skillful manner. To enrich the story spider's enemies increased in number on the other hand typical enemy concept was missed.<br/><br/>In some part of dialogs, director tried to effect our emotions by using love, drama but clearly these dialogs were pathetic and funny. Church and Flag concept are depicted again and again. Spider find the right way in the church in front of USA flag, absolutely there was a speech at the end which was full of wisdom and full of suggestions. This sequence becomes bored and routine. We would like to expect more interesting endings. And please do not tell us how to behave to be a good citizen. To tell you the truth we know better than you.<br/><br/>I am sure you will feel lucky if you missed the Spider Man-3. If you ask me for Go/NoGo I say NoGo."
"sirkevinho1","5","1","2","15 May 2007"," The film is trying to do too much and I am greatly disappointed.
","I really believe this is the worst film in the series. The series should get another producer/director and go another direction. The film, simply, is trying to do too much. The director should have just stuck with one major villain, like the previous two films, instead of three. That way, the movie would feel less rushed and better developed. Right now, the film has too many angles, themes and story lines to be one coherent story. It is actually frustrating to watch.<br/><br/>The most disappointing part of the movie is how under utilized Venom is. For such a major character in the original comic book series and a character with so much potential, his screen time is laughable. I want to see more of him than the last 30 minutes of the film. It is understandable that the director is using the alien symbiote (since it brings out the bad side in people) to create an internal conflict in Peter Parker; however, having Sandman as Uncle Ben's original killer is enough (not so in the comic books). Venom would be better served if he is in Spiderman 4, and be the only villain in the story.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of the film is the impressive CG (computer graphics) and the last battle scene. That is money well-spent. Everything is smooth and realistic; it feels like a steal to pay only ten to fifteen dollars to witness such marvels in technology. Still, the battle feel a little bit too short. I wish it could have been longer.<br/><br/>The plot is only worth a 3 out of 10; however, with the technology, I would bring it up to 5 out of 10. It is an entertaining movie, but not an award winning movie."

","Man, I'm really sad to have to write a bad review for this movie. After all the hype and excitement you step back into the real world and there really was not much to say! The action was incredible, but you wouldn't expect anything less from Sam, the problem was many of the ""acting"" scenes were SO contrived! When Toby is bebopping down the street and the whole jazz club scene was ridiculous to say the least. Not to mention the fact the Kirsten Dunst looked like she would have had more chemistry with a brick wall. The character arc's were weak and unsupported and the villains just kind of appeared. There was just TOO MUCH! You didn't have time to process one villain before another one appeared! Venom (who was never even properly ""introduced"" was by far one of the coolest things about the movie and I really wish Sam had just concentrated on him instead of having the sand guy and Harry (whose character development was laughable at best). I guess the problem is that today's audiences expect more from action movies... we want good stories and good actors and amazing effects, one out of those three is just not enough. There was no real resolution at the end and the whole experience kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. P.S. who told Toby that it was OK to let himself go for this movie?! You are playing a superhero, granted Toby is perfect as the dorky Peter Parker, but physically he was just NOT there in this one. Really, really disappointed:("

","Unlike Spiderman 2, this third installment had a threadbare storyline which they successfully distracted us from, through their pretty incredible special effects.<br/><br/>It was quite dull and pointless as evidenced by the film's need to have Peter Parker dance like a moron, hold every intense look for about 10 seconds too long and have him dressed like soccer mum who'd been crying all week. <br/><br/>Very gauche,and just barely worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was the waiter in the restaurant.

"zehnten","6","1","2","11 May 2007"," Fair
","There are three major ways to look at this film.<br/><br/>Comic book point of view, entertainment value and finally at a sequel.<br/><br/>From a comic book point of view the film was a bit of a let down. MJ doesn't sing she acts, spidey hasn't whipped out any sarcastic comments, since when does harry reconcile with peter? and venom did not have enough... well venom. However, realistically one cannot and must not judge from a comic book perspective, since it is not an adaptation of the comic, but inspired.<br/><br/>I know the typical let downs in the film as a sequel. Too long, stories banged heads, comedy was a bit too cheesy, tobey could not pull off a 'bad' and 'mean' spidey, venom only appeared at the end, Kirsten lacked and looked bored, confusion with sandman, brock not well done by topher and so on and so forth. However this is not the case.<br/><br/>As entertainment value the sequel had a couple of very nice action scenes, and in my opinion all the characters stepped it up a notch, all except for tobey, to no fault of his own since the script simply lacked punch. It's a shame venom was introduced so late and they should have dedicated an entire film since the beauty of venom is that he HAUNTS spidey not beats the crap out of him. That said, I think topher stole the film. He was exactly what he was told to be and did his part extremely well! Osbourn also improved, even though the story line clashed a bit and it ended slightly twisted, but the whole amnesia arc worked well. Aunt may was definitely better and sand man was incredible. MJ was weak, and through out the entire three films has been weak, but there was a slight improvement in the character, more of the mary jane comic fans are used to. Sand man being portrayed as good works well in the comic book world since as such he is good and eventually changes sides so no real complaint there.<br/><br/>With all the hype it is understandable that fans were let down, but in the end it was a good and fun film and some comedic timing was very good. Even though most laughs came from peter crying on the bridge.<br/><br/>The final draw back was that there was a bit too much emotion. The final scene/s were a bit too much and the audience seemed bored of the characters' tears.<br/><br/>STILL despite the uproar among fans, it was a good and enjoyable film which I would recommend to anyone"
"RCWjr","6","1","2","14 May 2007"," Not quite bad, not quite good enough.......
","After the 2nd film broke the chain of sequels always being inferior by in many ways surpassing the original, the 3rd installment shows signs the creative forces are tired.<br/><br/>There are many elements that make the film enjoyable. The thread of emotional struggles between love, hate, revenge, jealousy, envy, pride, etc, are fun to watch. But with so much going on and the tidy clean up at the end, you feel cheated somewhat.<br/><br/>The bad; too many villains and too many subplots. This was not the time to introduce TWO new villains. I would have been content with just the introduction of either Venom or Sandman rather than throwing them both into the mix. The Sandman story needed much more time to develop, yet ends up taking too much time away from this film which ultimately causes the film to merely brush over the whole Venom storyline. I have to agree with many that the special effects seemed a bit too......well, like special effects. I found myself many times being taken out of the moment by sub-par character effects. <br/><br/>The good; Gwen Stacy. I thought Howard was great. She is gorgeous, so much so that Kirsten Dunst looks rather plain compared to her. Jamison and all the supporting cast once again come with their A-game. Tobey is very good as is Dunst, though she by far is saddled with the least appealing character this go around. <br/><br/>In the end, Spider-man 3 fell victim to the curse of putting too much into one story in order to accommodate some producers desire to sell more toys."

Like the scene were emo Peter dances down the street doing corny gestures at all the girls and getting his groove on after buying some new threads(totally contrasting the geek getup with the little red scooter helmet) is obviously a joke. And the whole Fawlty Towers bit with Bruce Campbell and getting a young comedy actor to play Venom, HILARIOUS. There's even a big part of the movie were Harry Osborn, who is supposed to be one of Spidey's most dangerous enemies, is the comedy relief guy(after being a stiff and mean spirited brat throughout the entire series).

Now personally I like superhero films, so i guess my opinion is a bit biased, but even if you don't like superheros and the like, its still worth watching. What I really liked in the film, is that about half way through the film I could feel for the characters. The special effects were spectacular, which gave it the edge over the other Spider-Man films. To top it all off Topher Grace was in it.<br/><br/>Most of the actors did a good job, but in my opinion the best was Topher Grace. It was great to see him as Venom! So what if Parker goes a bit too far with being Black-Spidey, overall a great film, I highly recommend it to everyone, its just slower moving than the other Spider-Man films, so be prepared."
"clsjtce1","7","1","2","14 May 2007"," Thrilling, exciting, Spidey fun, oh...hello Venom, didn't see you there.
","The Spider-man movies for me have set the example in comic book adaptation for all other filmmakers to follow. The first one introduced us to the lovable Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-man superbly, brilliantly capturing the normalcy and rather uninspiring life of Peter Parker before his dramatic transformation, this being one of the chief reasons for the comic books' widespread appeal. The second movie went that stage further: more action; more humour; a fantastically portrayed Doc Ock (who's excellent CGI made for some breathtaking action sequences) and a more engaging plot. The internal battle within Peter was the most wonderful thing about the second movie, where he came to understand that the right thing is not always the easiest, but it is his responsibility to still follow the right course, whatever the personal sacrifice.<br/><br/>As a consequence of these two brilliant forerunners, there was huge anticipation for this third installment. The question is: has it delivered? The answer is not a simple one. In many ways it does deliver and in some it doesn't. The idea of internal struggle which made the second film so compelling has been employed again here, where the mysterious symbiote causes adverse changes to Peter's character. Just as in the second film, we can again relate to the idea of a darker side to our character; which thankfully most of us choose to subdue. Whatever people may say about the third movie exhibiting too many villains and multiple story lines, there is one thing that cannot be denied: the black suited Spider-man has been adapted down to a tee. The darkening of Peter's character and the power the new suit brings, with the personal difficulties Peter is experiencing and the emergence of Sandman, truly makes for an engaging storyline with some truly hilarious moments mixed in. The friendship of Peter and Harry Osborn (Green Goblin) is put through the ringer again in this movie, where Harry, all kitted out in his new Goblin gear, seeks revenge for the supposed murder of his father. The strength of these two estranged friends' relationship is shown, making for a climactic but in truth, rather disappointing final scene, although this is more down to the rather uninspiring Venom than anything relating to Harry. Indeed, the Harry-Peter storyline is quite simply excellent. The character of Sandman, although having a rather clichéd misunderstood I'm a good guy really back-story, is done well, and helps to bring closure finally to the Uncle Ben saga.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are problems, relating particularly to one single character. The main criticism of the this movie is quite simply that the character of Venom, who in the comic book is considered Spider-mans' greatest enemy, indeed his arch-enemy, who possesses all the same powers but is quite simply better, is portrayed exceptionally poorly on screen. As the villain and character everyone was so excited to see, Venom is a total disappointment. Not only is he given very little screen time, but the character development is lacklustre, the motivations for his intense hatred of Spider-man, though shown, are uninspired, and the taunting and general attitude of the comic book character has been wholly bi-passed, to allow time for Sandman and the Green Goblin. I therefore have to agree with critics who say that there are too many villains. Venom is such a complex, rich and above all significant character, as he essentially represents the darker side of Spider-mans' character that he has dispelled when ridding himself of the symbiote, that the attention paid to him in this film is totally unsatisfactory. I would have far preferred to see the emergence of Venom at the very end of the film, ready for a fourth installment. It almost seems as though Sam Raimi felt as though it was his last chance and the demand for Venom from the fans was too great so he simply decided to cram as much in as possible. In the end, one thing apparently failed to register: less can sometimes be more.<br/><br/>For a film which is primarily concerned with revenge and forgiveness (for Uncle Ben's murder, for Norman Osborn's, for Peter's spat with Mary-Jane and vice versa), it succeeds. However, the rather disappointing end and the ease with which the crucial character of Venom is defeated, leaves a rather sour taste in the mouth as you get up from your seat and exit the movie theatre."

","SM 3 is just as explosive and fantastically entertaining as we had hoped for, everyone is back for another bunch of emotional labyrinths and mind-blowing excitement. Sam Raimi did an amazing job making the first two, and with him being the captain of the ship once again you really couldn't help being very thrilled and very eagering to watch this third outing.<br/><br/>With Peter and Mary-Jane floating on a big sky of love, Harry Osborn has fully developed his father's alter ego, the Green Goblin Mach II. With him eagering for revenging his father's death, another breed of terror rises; Sandman. Spider-Man faces two villains as his relationship with Mary-Jane starts fumbling due to his dedication as Spiderman. Soon Peter/Spiderman and his aunt May finds out that Sandman was the original killer of their beloved uncle/husband Ben, now Spiderman gets heavily attacked with a alien-power making his mind focusing on vengeance over his uncle's death; his powers grows stronger and his persona takes a radical turn... will Spiderman let the outer-space revenge take him over to the dark side? Will Mary-Jane loose all hope for her relationship with Peter? And will three villains (four including himself) conquer even Spiderman? Spider-Man 3 does have a bit too much to tell, though it isn't hard to keep track it gets a bit hysterical and you can't avoid wishing that Raimi had gone with two villains. Venom could easily have been dropped as his appearance is way too short in the final chapter, Venom deserves more screen-space as he is Spiderman's number one nemesis in the comic books. Sandman on the other half, is simply great; well chosen actor and impressively looking CGI effects makes him nothing but a stunning feature as his sympathetic character creates emotional bits to his brutal features. Kirsten Dunst does a great performance as her career as an actress fails and she feels Peter fading away; James Franco's Harry shines more than ever as his bump in the head makes him go back to the beloved Harry from the first movie (one especially memorable scene features him and Mary-Jane twisting) and Tobey Maguire is once again absolutely stunning; with all this said Spider-Man 3 is a bit lengthy and could have, as said earlier, been more thoughtful about the chose of three villains. Raimi packs it with so much action and excitement that I felt a bit exhausted after watching it, and felt the same feelings as after I had watched Pirates 2; it was almost too much for even this brilliant cast and production to handle. Still, Spider-Man 3 is better than Pirates 2 and is a great third act as it will surely entertain everyone watching it."
"kardykush","6","1","2","14 May 2007"," Three major downs
","I want to start by saying that I love Spiderman.I love the comics,the cartoons,and the first two films. But this one is just not working out.I have found three major faults,and a lot of smaller ones that I won't be mentioning,while watching.<br/><br/>1)Two words.Tobey McGuire.He's bad.Dear,he's bad.I don't know who ever decided to make him an actor and thought it was a good idea.He does the exact same act for every part he plays.In the first two films,it didn't bug me that much,but now it's a lot more obvious.A lot of actors out there would deserve to play Spiderman.<br/><br/>A note:While mentioning actors,a small part for our lovely Mary Jane Watson... Ah,Kirsten Dunst...or shall I maybe say,Claudia?What a wonderful development of a career,isn't it...Starting off staring with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt,I mean,come on,I repeat,Tom Cruise AND Brad Pitt,carrying on with The Virgin Suicides...Now she's only an inch apart from being a teeny-weeny American sweetheart,like so many are.The only thing that prevents this is that she's good.She really has material.<br/><br/>Anyway,back to the subject. <br/><br/>2)The way they tried to squeeze in too many sagas and characters in one film,which makes me think that it's probably Spiderman films no more.It's a two hours movie,why trying to put everything in it at the same time?Work on one and develop it.<br/><br/>3)Why does Peter always takes off his mask while fighting?And how do the NYPD can't find out who he is?Come on,they can identify Mary Jane from hundreds of feet above,Peter was there all the time,fighting,for some reason,with his mask OFF,how can they not figure out it's him?It's sillier than the way no one recognises Sailor Moon as Usagi.<br/><br/>OK,so I'm taking three starts away.For the minor things,another one.It's 6/10. Better next time."

","After being excited about the movie ever since I heard the main plot of the symbiote and then watching the actual movie, I had mixed opinions. Good news is that Topher Grace was a good Eddie Brock. You can't really say he was a bad Venom because technically A) It wasn't him as Venom, but CGI; and B)Not his fault the production crew didn't lower his voice while he was Venom. I agree with everyone else that Sam should've waited for Venom until the 4th and not add him into the already overpacked Villain list. The 15 minutes of screen time and the end of the movie proved that even more so by making Venom (one of the best Spidey foes) short and scrappy work (the end I will get to... deserves a whole other review if you ask me). <br/><br/>The other villain (Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church) was just so-so. He's never been a good villain in my eyes, so seeing him in the movies instead of Doc Connors turning into the Lizard is a huge disappointment. The movie portrayal was better than I thought it would be because they went into a little bit of background and I really started pulling for him more so than any other of the characters (including Peter, but I'll get to that in a second). I really don't anything to say about him except why was he picked to be a movie villain with other great villains in the Spidey Universe out there (personally, Shocker would make a great movie bad guy I think.) <br/><br/>The last villain on the list is one that has been developing throughout the series... the tragic story of Harry Osborn (James Franco). I have to say, his gear was fly. I would take the surfboard over the hover craft. All his weapons were the same. His suit changed and really they could've done without the mask for him seeing how he never really used except for a total of 2 minutes throughout the whole movie. The coolest scene that involved him was the fight with him and Emo Peter in the mansion, where he same how survives a direct pumpkin bomb blast with a lot of other pumpkin bombs around him (that didn't explode with that one did which was really confusing) with just a half scared face. His man servant, the mysterious Butler who kinda came out of no where, decided to wait until the very last moment to pop in and say, ""Hey I've been here a while and seen some stuff that I dare not speak of..."" He tells Harry that Spidey didn't kill Norman... yatta yatta yatta. <br/><br/>The biggest disappointment of all had to be Spiderman (Tobey Maguire). First off, why take off your mask every time you stop... NY is a big place and more than likely people saw you without the mask and now know who you are. Props though for the kiss on Gwen Stacey (definately would choose the movie Gwen over the movie MJ anyday of the week). This isn't the worst of it though. Somehow, instead of the suit bonding with Peter like it does in the comics, it just bonds with a spare Spidey suit and Peter takes it on/off whenever he pleases, which is ridiculous. Another key factor to tell Peter has been corrupted is the invasion of Emo Peter. Look out folks, now every emo person you see can now be explained that they too have been taking over by a symbiote. Professional jazz dancers aren't safe from the category either. <br/><br/>The other main character, Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) really wasn't that important in the movie. Basically she lost her job, become a singing waitress at a jazz club, kissed Harry, and breaks up with Peter on a bridge (since neither her nor Tobey can act, watching them trying to cry act is by far the funniest part in the movie). <br/><br/>Now the review of the last 15 minutes (perhaps the worst part of the movie). Don't get me wrong, the ending wasn't horrible... it just was't long enough and everything either resolved too quickly or left you hanging and scratching your head at the end. I guessed the end sequence as soon I saw Harry get the bump on the head in the beginning of the movie. I remember leaning over to a friend and saying, ""Final sequence: Sandman and Venom vs. Harry and Spidey."" I was hoping I was wrong and that this cliché filled movie would not turn into a Batman Forever. Sadly it did. Fight scene occurs, Sandman and Harry square, leaving Venom and Spiderman to duke it out. This whole thing was a let down. <br/><br/>As soon as the blades came out of the board of Harry's, I knew his fate had been sealed. I'm just glad it happened the way it did, giving Venom something cool finally in the movie. But the cool was short lived as Spiderman put up poles that resonated like bell tones and forces the symbiote away from Brock. Then the writers added the most asinine thing: throwing a pumpkin bomb at the symbiote and having it fuse back with Brock while it had it, ruining any chance of him being in the second one and having a kickass showdown with Spidey against Carnage in a future Spiderman movie (like how it went down in all the other adaptations). After this happened, and this movie apparently being the ""darkest"" Spidey movie, I really hope Carnage isn't in the movies, or at least make it to where he's the only villain. Every superhero movie that has more than one villain has always been a big letdown (the Batman movies show dividend to that). All in all, if you haven't seen it... see it. Its not a waste of movie as long as you can in with low expectations."
"davulture","6","1","2","13 May 2007"," Not as Good as the Other Two
","The first two Spiderman movies were something of comic book greatness. For almost 3 years the most anticipated movie has been Spiderman 3, and when the movie opened in theaters I can surely say that it was probably one of the most disappointing movies of the year (especially under the hype) and failed to match the creative level of it's predecessors. The movie almost immediately starts off after the Second one where Peter Park narrates about how his life is so great! Things only go down from there as he gets relationship advice from his grandmother. Basically what is supposed to be an action movie is just pure boring banter for the first twenty minutes. Then a nice fight sequence between Peter Park and Harry Osbourne (AKA The Green Goblin) it ends up with him somehow getting amnesia and forgetting his hatred toward Peter. The movie completely strays into absurdness after that, with a story about an Ex-Criminal looking for medicine to save his kid (who only appears in one scene) and somehow ends up in a weird machine that turns him into Sandman! Then there is a mysterious alien symbiote comes from outer space and soon takes over Peter making him into an emo-wannabe with a cool looking dark suit. Along with an slimy journalist named Eddie Brock whose hatred toward Peter Park manifests after he gets him fired and how yet he gets the symbiote attached to himself. The movie is a hodge-podge of information pretty much left for a two on two fight sequence (which is probably what the writers wanted from the beginning). The movie is over sappy especially Peter Parker (He's supposed to be funny not a lover-boy). Probably a big problem of the movie is that Spiderman's life is going so well that his girlfriends starts to fall apart. But since Mary Jane isn't a Superhero it really isn't that interesting. Overall disappointing movie, they should have followed the comic book outline (where the symbiote comes from outer space and attaches itself onto a spaceship that Spiderman stops) and eliminated the Sandman totally he served almost no purpose. Good fighting sequences but the movie just wasn't enough."

","The many strengths of this film are the story telling & pacing. The opening credits go back to the old fashioned listing the cast but listing them in an action scenario sequencing that make the list seem like an action film in itself. This film knows very well how to develop characters and story line. It slows down when it needs to and speeds up nicely for the action sequences. When it employs flash back sequences, they are short & effective in fitting in with the current story.<br/><br/>Thomas Hayden Church is by far the nicest surprise in the film. His acting in a dramatic role is by far the best performance. He has come a long way since WINGS. He proves he can do dramatic roles as well as comedy.<br/><br/>This film is well over 2 hours but with it's pacing and great special effects it seems shorter. The ending leaves the next film open for a lot of stuff as Sandman is not destroyed & Spiderman & his girlfriend (Dunst) are still not engaged to be married yet. If the films continue to have such strong story telling, this could become a long successful series. This film is much more than special effects.<br/><br/>The weakest point of this film is why & how the dark entity sought out Peter Parker first. Nothing is explained besides us seeing the meteor hit & then the thing come after him right away when he is leaving the scene with Dunst on his scooter. It does hop on his license plate when he is leaving but the scene is so dark it is hard to see that."
"cam61247","6","1","2","13 May 2007"," I liked this film a little
","I thought this film was an OK film, sadly due to its predecessors OK was never going to be enough. I liked what this film tried to do, which was to try to be bigger than ever before, long running time (I feel i get more of my moneys worth and I am quite happy to sit there for three and a half hours). 3 villains and therefore an inevitable 4 way showdown, which cinematographically looks amazing. But if I speak honestly, they've taken on too much and fail to really develop Flint Marco(Sandman) and Eddie Brock's (Venom) characters, we're never absolutely sure what's wrong with Marco's daughter, how have him and his wife become so estranged (bearing in mind that his cause of robbing millions of pounds to cure their daughters apparently very expensive disease isn't that bad news for her). Why does this venom form outer space only give spider-man a suit of evilness (which at first is easy to remove at will and at the second time of asking it clings to him) and Eddie Brock is turned into a big mouthed monster? <br/><br/>The last point I will mention is Spiderman's descent into evil which amusingly is represented by an emo look, it is a very amusing and surreal montage and caused me and those around to laugh and wonder if we were watching a comic epic anymore... But I took it as a bit of lighthearted fun and hope the film makers meant us to laugh, <br/><br/>My recommendation? if you care? Go see it, it'll be alright, but please don't come back complaining it's not great and no it doesn't absolutely follow the comic but there's much worse out there."

","Most of the critics says this movie is not that good. Okay, they are long scenes, but just watch the two first movies that you borrow in a video club before seeing this one. The rhythm of the movie is about the same, and what's new is Peter's new born arrogance, which goes with this black goo that comes out at the beginning of the movie...<br/><br/>I would say this is three episodes of Spider-Man rolled into one. Tobey Maguire does his job right, so is James Franco, but the one who steals the show here is Thomas Hayden Church as the Sandman. Topher Grace has his moments too, but sincerely, I found Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy much more better than the tormented Kristen Dunst. Even Ursula and Miss Brant are better looking...<br/><br/>And oh yes, Bruce Campbell does it again, this time even funnier...

","I was worried about this third chapter. After and exciting initiator (with an unforgettable kiss) and a magnificent second installment, the chance to see a total crap and a drain on one's resources was really plausible. And, on the contrary, it isn't so: there are many flaws, but the film is very agreeable. The figures of Eddie Brock, funny swine, and of Gwen Stacy, a bit silly goose and rival of the mythic Mary Jane, are only touched (but they'd deserve a considerable investigation), whereas Flint Marko/Sandman is rather unlikely. Peter Parker's dark side is not so dark, and the risk to have an headache after the screening is quite high. But sometimes it's therapeutic dreaming in the dark of a movie theater with a popcorn bowl by the hands: cinema is also this."
"JoeKarlosi","5","1","2","13 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 (2007) **
","I enjoyed the first film, and even the second, though maybe to a lesser degree. But this third one is easily the least of the group and leaves my brain rattled. Where to begin? Well, for starters there were too many villains crammed into it, and no clear cut story but rather a series of back and forth jumping to all sorts of unrelated business which left me bored: let's throw in a disgruntled Harry Osbourne as the new Green Goblin (with yet another tiresome love triangle between him and Peter and MJ), then toss in the new Sandman adversary too, then cough up a token appearance by Venom later on for good measure, and also have Peter Parker contending with a strange and unidentified black substance from a fallen meteor which comes to take him over.... There's so much reliance on trying to squeeze in many various plot devices that there winds up being not much of a plot at all in the end. And the video game-like and cartoony CGI ---- what a mess! A classic case of over-abundance with fake looking Road Runner-ish chases and phoniness. Moviegoers today are supposedly less wowed by yesterday's more ""primitive"" special effects, so how do they eat this crap up when it looks so artificial? I will concede, however, that the CGI was best put to use in the character of the Sandman, and it was probably the best way to render him (ditto for the ""spidey alien suit""). Incidentally, the Sandman's back story had the most potential and he could have been quite the sympathetic villain, had the script opted to concentrate solely on his story rather than trying to wedge so many different elements together.<br/><br/>I really have never liked Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane and it didn't change with this film either. Even worse, this time we get stuck having to hear her character sing badly.. and oh, yes, she still has that annoying habit of running off to flirt and ""Twist"" with whatever other guy floats her boat any time her relationship with Peter Parker hits a bump for a second. I'm so sick and tired of her and her petty jealousies. I wanted her snaggle-toothed ass dead when she was caught dangling high above from that web and Spidey had to save her yet again! Do ya hear me? Dead!! I really wish Peter would get his act together and hook up with blonde Gwen Stacy instead. <br/><br/>So now let's address Peter Parker. I don't recall the comic book Parker being quite SUCH an extreme geek as in Sam Raimi's three film incarnations ... a real nerd, always crying his redundant tears, always whimpering. In the new film we get to see a welcome ""bad"" side to Peter with his black alien suit morphing onto him, but while it's refreshing, there is no rhyme or reason to what that strange black gooey substance from space is in the first place, or why it's even around. It's just another of many endless plot contrivances. And count me in with the viewers who shook their head in embarrassment and disbelief when Peter starts acting like John Travolta while doing his absurd disco moves and idiotic ""cool guy"" dancing schtick. This was completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Did I mention that the film is needlessly overlong and feels like it? I couldn't wait to get the hell out of the theater and for this aimless montage to end. When the film ended, a dad in his forties in front of me yelled: ""I want my money back!!"", and I couldn't agree more. Another MAJOR disappointment for me was that this new film takes the liberty of changing the events of the first SPIDER-MAN, where it's suddenly revealed via repetitious black and white flashbacks that the guy who killed Peter's uncle Ben was not the right guy after all ... now it's supposed to have been the Sandman! How lovely. So now this completely ruins the effect of the original movie, and all those bits of business with Peter going after that first killer in Part One. Patooey!! ** out of ****"
"ryancharlescarter","6","1","2","12 May 2007"," Spider Man 3 ?
","OK so let me get this straight, this is a movie based on a character from a comic book. Maybe I'm too into comics and the story or there's something wrong with me, but this movie jumps around too much like a frog. Let's face it Marvel and Sam Raimi were looking to make money and how else but another movie. Please hear me, Sam Raimi leave the writing to someone who can write a well rounded story, not looking to put butts in the seats. How does a crew based on capitalizing on a story and a trend kill off one of the books top character, Venom. This movie was like the Venom commercial, a few minutes long. And Toby dancing around and being overtaken by the symbiotic suit was more of a joke than almost anything other than trying to pack all the new villains into this film. So Sam if you can here me concentrate more on the story than your fancy CGI. Please Sandman wasn't awful but towards than end he lost most physical characteristics and began looking like a heap of something for the final fight. And the only way to bring the Sandman as the real killer of Uncle Ben was ridiculous, and just so we had another character to lose track on with the jumpy story line and lousy plot. The only thing these films seem to truly follow off of the comics are the cash register, i.e. the characters names. Everything else is a sloppy job of a story. From experience as a director Raimi should have learned where to develop the story rather than trying to cram ten pounds of sh!t in a five pound bag. My only other disgust with this film is it set records for money making since America is dumb and naive enough to sit and watch this crap. Way to go Raimi, Marvel and America!"

","I saw this highly anticipated film that I was waiting for 3 years. I have been keeping in touch with the development of the movie, seen all the trailers, but when I saw the film, it seemed less exciting than what the trailers seem to promise. I remember watching the trailers for Spider-man 2, and when the film reeled out I was blown away. Somehow this blown away feeling did not exist for Spidey's third outing. Something was missing. It is strange because the film had more funny moments, sad moments, villains, beautiful women, action scenes and it seemed to focus more on the side shows, but that tried to steal the heart of the film....Spider-man! I mean, where was he? I did not get to see enough of him in this film. I remember in Spider-man two within the first 5 minutes we see him flying around delivering pizza and saving kids on the street. This film by itself is a much serious version of the lighter, snappier prequels we have been treated to. So when the film makers decided to make a difference with this film, somehow it was not what the viewers were expecting. If there was no Spider-man, and Spider-man 2 films to compare with, this film would have been excellent. It is not a kid's film, for sure. I had many questions as to why Spidey behaved the way he did even before the changes in him took place.....too many questions in the film were left unanswered, a few scenes were kind of hurried, some scenes did not make sense. Also because there were many characters in the film, each scene was too short to be remembered. Overall, this is a good film, but does not live up to the built-up hype. Looking forward to a better Spider-man 4!"
"marine_invader","5","1","2","12 May 2007"," Too much allows for too little to be developed; Spider-Man gets trapped in his own web.
","When I heard that this movie was not as good as Spider-Man 2, my heart sank. Why? Because Venom is in this movie. If you can't take Harry Osborne (Who SHOULD have been the Hobgoblin, not some conflicted antihero), the Sandman, AND Venom, Spider-man's worst nemesis ever, and make a good movie without KILLING EVERYONE AT THE END, then you have no business being in the movie business.<br/><br/>This movie is written by Sam Raimi, who also directs it. In case no one is surprised by what I just said, let me take a second to remind you that Stan Lee wrote the first two movies. Therein lies the problem. Sam Raimi, like all guys, wants it all in one shot. So he shoots for the moon, but falls all the way back to Earth. The Sandman is underdeveloped, and he's the most developed of the three villains, in this movie alone. Harry Osborne acts like a depressed shut-in with the occasional Random Acts of Violence, and Venom.........well......doesn't show up until the movie's almost over. Instead, we get emo peter parker and alternate color spider-man for the whole movie. The symbiote is not even explained, and all of it's intricacies and cool characteristics are cast asunder since there's too much else in the movie to underdevelop.<br/><br/>Instead, it shows up in an asteroid, disappears for an hour, latches on to Peter, Spider-Man is black for an hour, and then Venom says about five lines, screams a bunch and gets blown to smithereens. While the effects are amazing (and I mean, amazing) there's really too much in this movie to wince at, like Peter Parker crying when MJ dumps him, he looks like he's actually going to laugh maniacally. <br/><br/>The problems with Spider-Man 3 are all in the character portrayals and the superficial and hollow feel of the movie left by the failed attempt of trying to do too much all at once. Unfortunately, those are the things that you REALLY don't want to go wrong with your movie. The effects save this one, 5/10."

Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Dylan Baker, Bill Nunn, James Cromwell, Bruce Campbell, Cliff Robertson. Directed by Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>Terribly disappointing sequel that had been highly anticipating since the release of the impressive ""Spider-Man 2"" in 2004. Peter Parker's life is going well in New York City. He's the on top of his classes in College and he is also still in a strong relationship with his high school sweetheart Mary Jane Watson. His former best friend, Harry Osborn, still holds a grudge against Peter about being revealed of who his father's real ""murderer"" was. Following in his father's footsteps, Harry has now become the New Goblin and will stop at nothing to kill Spider-Man. This time, Spider-Man must also deal with two more villains, one of which coincidentally is responsible for his Uncle's death (Sandman) and the other who is a photographer also working for the Daily Bugle (Venom). The meanest villain of all is one that isn't even human - the black symboite that takes Peter's costume over and leaves him in a change of personality that he must fight. So much expectation from many fans of the series thinking it would be the strongest part of the series like ""Return of the King"" was for ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" was for the new Star Wars trilogy. Problems with the storyline and characters are really what makes the film go down. Everything seems so rushed and sloppy compared to the first two films. Maguire's performance is less than impressive, as all he seems to do on the screen is either to act like a jerk or cry over Mary Jane. James Franco is really the only performance I actually enjoyed, but even he can't make up for all of the other performers. Sam Raimi must really have a tough time thinking of new ideas for the film because we still have the same sub-story lines regarding Uncle Ben's death or Peter and Mary Jane's on-and-off relationship. The second film was fresh because there was a completely different villain and Peter's personality was very understanding for him not wanting to be Spider-Man in order to live an every day life. Here, watching Peter is about as likable as hanging out with Rush Limbaugh for a day. The ""dancing"" scenes are especially stupid, and his ""new look"" is just painful to look at. That being said, the special effects are at least decent and there are a few funny scenes and enjoyable action sequences. Overall, I just think that it could have been a great film had the director put in the effort to develop it. In the end it just looks like he wrapped it up like a teenager working on a high school book report at the last minute."

","I really enjoyed the first 2 installments of this comic-book franchise. Unfortunately this is one of the weakest films I have seen in a long, long time. It is contrived, ridiculous, annoying, cringe-worthy and to be honest I nearly walked out about half way through. Some of the effects were incredible and this is the only saving grace in an otherwise weak film. I'm not a 'fanboy' expecting perfection, but I do love movies of all types. I have rarely seen a third installment of a franchise that is actually good but seriously, this is so poor it's not even funny (X-Men 3 was actually a lot better than this and that was extremely mediocre). I left before most people and I haven't read any reviews so I am basing this on my own feelings about the film rather than 'hearsay' or jumping on any sort of bandwagon. I would still expect this movie to do very well at the box office, but I must believe that for once Raimi missed the mark completely. The best part of the movie was Bruce Campbell and he has about 3 minutes of screen time. In a word disappointed."
"AlbusDumbledore","7","1","2","12 May 2007"," Very entertaining but I hope this isn't the last one...
","After the scope and setting up of the first two films they decided to go down a more personal route with Spiderman and the villains with a humiliation/revenge theme running through the movie.<br/><br/>One of the scenes I related to was when MJ - Kirsten Dunst - seems to tell Peter that he doesn't understand her insecurity regarding her acting career. It was almost as if she was forcing the issue rather like a bored girlfriend gets and she wants to take it out on someone. This builds up in the movie even though I thought that Peter was supporting her with the ""you have to pick yourself up, get back on the horse and look how my life's improved"" speech.<br/><br/>This part of the film reminded me of a previous girlfriend who was going through a similar ""I can't cut it at work and what am I doing with my life it's all a tragedy and you don't understand me even if you think you are I'm just gonna be bloody minded and take it out on you"" phase.<br/><br/>Indeed it was a cathartic experience. It seems like she's jealous of his Spiderman alter-ego which in this film is becoming more popular to the people of New York. Which in turn related to my cheerful, positive and hopeful outlook on life and my girlfriend's resentment of that.<br/><br/>Anyway back to the film. There was a particularly enjoyable scene with J. Jonah Jameson being ""bothered"" by his secretary regarding his medication. Harry Osborn didn't really become the New Goblin i.e. a villain at all - he just used/upgraded some of his dad's stuff and wound Peter up about MJ. Although Parkers and Harry's fight scenes were cool but not overwhelming.<br/><br/>The Sandman transformation was good and seemed to be the only mature i.e. sensible character in the movie. The Venom character was played well by Topher Grace/CGI. His Eddie Brock character reminded me of James Spader in Wolf. But I have to agree that there were too many character developments in this film to give them any depth esp. the evolution of Venom - a parasite which can't be killed so I've heard - which was a bit rushed. Maybe Venom will return. Spiderman forgiving Sandman was a bold move, maybe they'll team up in the next one.<br/><br/>All in all an entertaining film for most parts although Peter Parker as a bad boy worked ironically if you think of it as him trying too hard esp when you see the bemused looks of women he scopes as he walks down the street in some scenes. I thought that part was quite funny.<br/><br/>But as I said at the beginning, I hope this isn't the last one."

","Well... that certainly was a movie. I would have to first say that i am sick of both comic book rip offs and repeated sequels so i obviously went into Spider Man 3 feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Given that, I am happy to see the way in which the writers have set up the pre-cast characters of their choice (Given that everyone Peter Parker ever touches becomes a bad guy they had a wide range). I found that they took a way to comedic approach to a movie that is supposed to be a boy gets girl thing. I mean, come one! They did know that scene walking down the street was the text book definition of over kill, didn't they? That said, they did a good job on the Goblin, Venom and The Sandman. The composer has done an excellent job even with his supercilious lot. The different themes for the costumes and music for the 'new look spidey' scenes. I have to commend the final battle but i was hoping to see Harry wear his father's mask and therefore redeem the Green Goblin but whatya gonna do? In closing i am disappointed that the writers have not taken this seriously enough yet i commend their work with characters."
"Deccomajor","6","1","2","12 May 2007"," Oh dear what was that!!!!!
","I was really looking forward to Spiderman 3, i loved the first one and enjoyed the second one so i was waiting for the day Spidey 3 to be released, i got my copy and sat down with so many expectations.......... they didn't come, i was so disappointed with this film and everything was so rushed, the writers should not have had so many story lines and villains in this one film, they could have easily got 2 hours plus out of Harry's and Peter's feud with MJ as the sideline, three villains and so any gaping story lines just dragged this film on and on and on.<br/><br/>For me the whole MJ/Peter romance dragged on, Venom should have been put to one side and done as a complete 4th film, Sandman should not have been made to be a bad/good/bad/good guy and should have been killed off at the end. Also the whole crane scene was badly done, okay spidey rescued the girl ( Gwen ) but what about the crane, the guy in the crane and the falling bits of office block, plus what did Harry say to MJ to turn her off Peter, the whole scene where peter was taken over by the bad suit and he was walking down the high street to music was watching something from Saturday Night Fever, oh and where in good's name was Spidermans spidey sense's? surely he would have sensed half the things that were about to happen in this film.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but this was a waste of a good superhero film."
"Bing5253","9","1","2","12 May 2007"," Great film but a bit soppy
","Don't get me wrong, Spider man 3 was a pretty great film but I have to say that this sequel was too soppy. Too many moments where (if it were on e4) you would hear a track going 'aaaaaaaaaaww' when what they should be saying is 'woah!'. This was definitely the funniest of the three spiderman films with Tpbey Maguire's new look and hilarious personality.<br/><br/>Great performances by most actors - mainly James Franco as Harry Osbourne. Excellent baddies throughout the film (there were many) including Sand Man (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace).<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a 9/10 but for it to get 10/10 they need to cut down on the soppiness."
"sampj","7","1","2","12 May 2007"," Good but could've been better.
","Spidey 3 was good enough to earn my satisfaction,but what the hell were they thinking making Tobey MacGuire(Peter Parker) act like a drunken idiot on screen.Tear level was too high.I hated the bit where Parker beat the total crap out of Harry Osbourn.Kirsten Dunst wasn't that great but i did like James Franco and Tobey Macguire when he wasn't possessed.I also liked Parker's dancing in the bar and the bit where Parker says ""Good Riddance"" when he thinks he's defeated the Sandman.Special effects were pretty good,but as i said Parker's act of stupidity in the middle of the movie wrecked it for me and quite possibly other people.I didn't agree to the fact that Venom(Topher Grace) was only there for a short time.I would've liked to see him come into it half way through.Overall I liked it and in my opinion it's worth paying $8.50 to go and see it.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"BigPimpinTom88","7","1","2","12 May 2007"," I'm glad I let all the bad hype sink in before I saw it
","Everyone seems to be griping about how bad this movie is, especially in my circle of friends. I didn't end up seeing it opening weekend, which was plenty of time to take it all the negative hype and imagine every possible way this movie could be as embarrassingly bad as people have claimed. The particular scenes that were the most heavily criticized, surprisingly, did not bother me. The scenes that did, however, weren't mentioned by anybody I know. Here they are.<br/><br/>Betty Brant's buzzer that alerted Jameson about his blood pressure was too comical and over-done. I did, however, find his forced calm demeanor very funny.<br/><br/>When Sandman grew into a huge monster and growled, it took away all of his sympathetic human qualities and made him too over-the-top unbelievable.<br/><br/>The brief shot where Peter brushes his hair down into his forehead with his hand is all that truly sells the ""emo teenager"" thing that everyone complains about. Without that shot, it would not have come across as such, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the second, out-of-costume fight between Harry and Peter. But the scar that it left Harry with for the rest of the movie looked really fake. It was too small given the damage he sustained, and too bubbly.<br/><br/>I thought the news coverage of the construction site standoff was cheesily done (it came across like a reality show) and unnecessary. The commentary was not needed, and it was a weak way to establish what was happening. They added an extra element of unbelievability by referring to Flint Marko as ""the sandman""- the only time in the movie any villain is referred to by name- thus grounding it in the realm of the comic book. And, during the scene where spidey is getting pummeled (which would have been emotional if sandman wasn't a giant monster), the news anchor's commentary stripped the scene of it's intimacy.<br/><br/>There were spectators close to the battle, and during the fight, it would cut to them and some comical moment would ensue. These comical moments took away all suspense, and I found it surprising that none of the people seemed frightened by what they were watching, but more content with spouting one-liners. And during the wide shot with the giant sandman, the spectators were so close to him that it seemed like a staged circus show.<br/><br/>The battle was too big and too public. I understand that it was Venom's intention to ""humiliate"" Peter Parker, but it was such a personal fight that it didn't need either element.<br/><br/>Harry having a change of heart and joining the battle to help Spidey didn't seem to fit. It was the less 'obvious' thing that could have happened, sure, but it didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>But overall it was really good. Not as good as 1 or 2, but a better 3rd movie than X-Men 3 (which I still liked, but was similarly hated). People are often citing the sillier, more comical and light-hearted moments in the movie as what's wrong, but keep in mind that the first and second movies weren't dead serious either. That said, given spidey's core struggle in the film, this one should have been the most serious of the three."

"turgeon77nfm","8","1","2","11 May 2007"," A movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and I'm just fine with it.
","Okay, let's start off with I can definitely understand why many patient fans have been frustrated by this film. Mainly because the symbiote just seems to be thrown in without any real explanation as to why and while, yes, it is a bit random, I believe it's important to point out that this movie may not have been intended to begin an entirely new story arc but to close on the pervading story from the first two movies. That being said, the lack of character development in fan-favorites such as Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy is somewhat understandable even forgivable. This also makes the close-ended...ending (I couldn't think of anything better) acceptable: Peter forgives the Sandman, reunites with Mary Jane and ends the movie as himself, Peter Parker, not Spiderman, almost as if he's come full circle.<br/><br/>Still on the topic of character development, the Sandman was definitely the central villain here. He is the only additional character given a clear-cut background and his creation scene is one of the most tragic that the trilogy has to offer (especially when he cannot grasp his daughter's locket). Plus, I think that the amazing special effects and Thomas Haden Church's great performance really make the character worth the time he gets.<br/><br/>Now onto the other things...after viewing the movie twice, with great pleasure I might add, I have come to the conclusion that both the symbiote and Brock are simply metaphors for revenge consuming an individual, the power of anger and so on and are not supposed to act as intricate characters on their own, a minimalization which I'm sure is very disappointing to most Venom fans, I being one. However, I thought that this motif fit very well in this movie especially with the addition of Sandman, Uncle Ben's true killer. Peter's realization that his first act as Spiderman - indirectly killing his beloved uncle's supposed murderer - was unfounded drives him mad and understandably so. And it is only when these emotions develop fully within him that the symbiote attaches itself (the recurring images of Uncle Ben being shot, Marko demanding the car, etc. show that Peter's newfound call for revenge is consuming him). As for Brock, he lost everything: Gwen, his job, his dignity, all at the hands of Peter Parker who seems in every way arrogantly contented in his work. In fact, the last thing we see Eddie do before his transformation is call on God's help to kill Peter (their confrontation at the Daily Bugle probably made Brock aware that he was not strong enough to do it himself). So, like Peter towards Sandman, Brock becomes completely transfixed on the idea of repaying Peter in kind for what he's done, ergo, the symbiote finds him. And although this excruciatingly long paragraph may not have clarified anything, I just thought it was important to view Venom/Brock as an extension of Parker instead of an independent character - sort of like Parker gone wrong.<br/><br/>But enough about that, let's get on to the comedy, which appears to be the major source of resentment in most fans. I'm sure that heading into this movie, given the hype of Black Suit Spidey and the advertising campaign of ""the battle within,"" most fans were expecting an intense, dark drama as a result of the symbiote not a superhero version of the Nutty Professor. Now, while Raimi's comical take on Peter's shift in personality isn't exactly true to the original story, it is fitting and VERY funny. I mean, come on, Peter Parker, lovable as he is, is not a bad-ass, he never will be a bad-ass and I seriously doubt he was ever meant to be a bad-ass. In fact, the allure of his character is that he's a complete and utter dork, that's why we root for him. Therefore, when he tries to be a bad-ass or cool or a jazz star, I think it's appropriate to laugh at the guy in the same way it is to laugh at a friend who completes the same personal 180. And though it hurts to be duped by a million dollar ad campaign yet again, I don't feel it detracts from the enjoyment of this movie one bit. Oh, and Bruce Campbell and JK Simmons are awesome as always...just thought I'd throw that titillating fact out there.<br/><br/>In short, I felt that the acting in this movie ranged from very good (highlighted by Thomas Haden Church) to kind of corny (Venom pointing at Mary Jane's backside, Peter's dance scene, etc.) though never offensively bad, which some have vehemently proclaimed. The direction was good. The score wasn't too bad and the special effects were incredible (definitely the highlight of this installment). Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth seeing and give it an 8 out of 10, which I did...as you can plainly see...from the stars...okay.<br/><br/>And for those of you bored out of your mind or just plain confused, maybe even angry after reading this thing, I just want you all to know that it sounded a lot better in my head (as most things tend to)."
"spahnrancher","8","1","2","11 May 2007"," Expectations Met...and then Some!
","I really thought this movie would be terrible with so much going on. There is a tremendous amount of story telling mixed in with the superb special effects. The most expensive movie ever made? You can see why. It is a little exhausting to watch at times if you are not a patient movie goer. I think that Sam Raimi has a way of fitting in his comic wit and splicing it with the emotive touch just enough to make the characters seem more viable. Otherwise we could care less about anything but seeing a funny red and blue (or black) suit flying about on screen. The twists and turns and plots jumps can seem to be confusing...and may well be for the young ones, but it is all worth it. Go see it!!!"

"Mr_Hardcastle","7","1","2","11 May 2007"," Enjoyable, but nothing special
","~Plot/Writing/Direction~ Under this heading comes our first, and biggest problem: There are too many story lines going on at once. I mean, you've got 3 villains, plus each of their backgrounds, MJ's troubles, Harry's numerous changes of heart, 2 different Spidermans, competition between Parker and Eddie Brock at the newspaper, Gwen Stacy, and more. What was great about Spiderman 2, was that the plot was much more visible and focused; all you had to deal with was Parker's inner struggle, and his relationship with MJ, and his fight against the villain, Doc Ock. Additionally, I thought the writing was a tad flat and uninspired; perhaps a surprise considering it was written by veteran, Alvin Sargent (although he wrote Spiderman 2 alone, but co-wrote 3 with Sam and Ivan Raimi - so maybe that had something to do with it).<br/><br/>~Cast~ Really, no stand-out performances among the main cast. The character of MJ is a bit of a useless brat in this film, and I never much liked Kirsten Dunst, who doesn't make any of her feelings in the film look genuine. Tobey Maguire was competent, but was painful to watch during Peter Parker's eye-liner-clad bad boy scenes (yeah, what was that all about anyway? Talk about losing the plot!). Franco was annoying as he was in the previous two; but that's mainly due to the kind of character he had to work with. Still, he didn't make a convincing villain, and the same can be said for Topher Grace, who was irritating before he became the vastly under-written Venom. Much better were Thomas Haden Church, who succeeded in bringing us a villain for whom we had an ounce of sympathy. Bryce Dallas Howard played her part well, as did J.K Simmons (yet again). The highlight of the film, however, had to be Bruce Campbell as the Maître d'. Hilarious.<br/><br/>~Music~ Bit of a mish-mash score here. Danny Elfman was hired, as he was for the previous two, but had a falling out with Sam Raimi and left the project. Christopher Young was brought in to score the film, but film chiefs thought he did a poor job and replaced some of his work with snippets of music recycled from previous Spiderman/Danny Elfman films. Still, the sentimental moments worked, and Christopher Young did a decent enough job. Even so, I think Elfman's scores, while they do the trick, have never been phenomenal in any respect.<br/><br/>~Other~ For a film with a $260 million dollar budget, the effects didn't blow me away as I had much expected them to. The visuals in both the first two films weren't overly impressive either, so it didn't bother me all that much. The best parts (with regard to visual effects) were undoubtedly the Sandman's scenes.<br/><br/>~Summary~ Well it kept me entertained for its lengthy running time. Solid cast, a plot that was overcrowded but enjoyable enough, and a lot of polish, owed to it's huge-ass budget. Should certainly appeal to the masses, and is likely to go on to be one of the most financially successful films of all-time. But after the great Spiderman 2, I can't help but think Raimi has let the side down a little."
"moutonbear25","8","1","2","11 May 2007"," What a Tangled Web We Weave
","As far as I'm concerned, you can drown those pirates at sea and banish that ogre to a land even further away because there's only one sequel that matters this summer. SPIDERMAN 3 has finally swung through oncoming traffic and in and around the tallest buildings to land in theatres as the flagship film to launch the box office into summer. Legions of Spidey enthusiasts have had their tickets for weeks while critics have been waiting to review the latest installment in one the most successful and well-received film franchises in history. With expectations this high, its hard to imagine how Spidey could possible satisfy anyone fully. Yet despite the increasingly loud whispers of disappointment waiting to welcome SPIDERMAN 3, this critic slash Spidey enthusiast had himself one heck of a web slingin' time and he's not afraid to say it.<br/><br/>In the third, and what is sadly not likely the last in the Spiderman series, your friendly neighborhood Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) finds himself on top of the world. New York loves him; Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) loves him; and subsequently, Spidey ends up loving himself a little more than he should. High on his own ego, he decides to make everything perfect in his life and ask MJ to marry him. Simple enough a concept but things get a little sticky when he has to deal with his uncle's killer escaped from jail, his best friend's obsession with getting revenge on him for his father's death, having to compete with a new photographer at the Daily Bugle and MJ's increasingly disastrous acting career. Oh, wait. I forgot that he also has to deal with The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace), the newest enemies to emerge in New York City, a city where freaks apparently flock to. It's a lot for one man to handle, let alone one man with super human powers. Ultimately, it proved to be too much for another super human to handle, namely returning director, Sam Raimi. Taking over script duty with his brother Ivan, found a lot of interesting themes like revenge and ego woven into the Spidey web but so much going on leaves so little to fully develop. Scenes that would seem pivotal, like when Venom and Sandman decide to team up, end up feeling rushed while scenes that are entirely disposable, like when Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, finds his ""Saturday Night Fever"" groove strutting down the streets of NYC, seem to go on forever.<br/><br/>While the first SPIDERMAN film, written by David Koepp (rumoured to be returning for SPIDERMAN 4) brought me to tears more than once, there is plenty to enjoy in SPIDERMAN 3 that allows forgiveness for the script problems. People seem to have forgotten that Spidey is here to entertain us. Sure it would be nice to be affected by the words being spoken as well but when the action is as tight and the special effects as vast as in SPIDERMAN 3, it is a pleasure to tune out for a while and enjoy the ride. With three enemies to fight off at any given moment, Spidey finds himself constantly reevaluating his approach. With the New Goblin (James Franco), Spidey has to fend off a very aggressive attacker that he doesn't truly want to hurt. The Sandman, who enters and exits in a flurrying sandstorm that is a visual kaleidoscope of grain, is at times an insurmountable force. The fact that Spidey can't effectively hit him only further shows how much energy is wasted on revenge (as he was the man who actually killed his uncle in his pre-Sandman days). And Venom is just plain frightening. Being under the control of the tar-like substance that transforms cocky photographer, Eddie Brock (Grace), into this fanged fright, amplifies all of your aggressive, negative behavior. For Spidey, fighting Venom is like fighting all the parts of himself that he tries so hard to leave behind.<br/><br/>When SPIDERMAN hit theatres a few in 2002, its energy was infectious. Hopes were high and the goods were delivered. Genuine admiration was formed for the hero but like any hero, people eventually want to tear them down out of jealousy. How quickly we forget the love and allow our expectations to be set so high that no one, not even a man who glides gracefully through the sky, could surmount them. Better than the second, not as good the first, SPIDERMAN 3 is falling prey to the audience's need to be constantly wowed with something bigger and better that eclipses accomplishments that are already awesome. Sure Raimi got himself tangled up in his own overcomplicated web but there is no one who can spin it like he can. And if Raimi, Maguire and Dunst don't return for future installments, you'll all be wishing you hadn't squashed this spider so quickly."
"turboshark","7","1","2","11 May 2007"," Pure fun! But doesn't live up to the expectations...
","Like many other Spider-Man fans, I had been anticipating the release of the film that would contain my favorite villain, Venom. Before it's worldwide release, the IMDb rating was over 8! I was looking forward to being very pleased with this third installment.<br/><br/>However, I came out of the theatre somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong - it is a great movie, immensely entertaining, packed with awesome special effects and ridiculously funny. So funny in fact, that even some of the scenes that were supposed to be sentimental or serious ended up with laughs. I'm sure I am not the only one who thinks that Tobey Maguire doesn't have the best 'crying' face, as the audience busted out laughing every time he did. Poor Tobey. He should have been directed more gracefully during those times.<br/><br/>Another reason I was so excited for SM3 was the introduction of Gwen Stacy, who was Peter's girlfriend in the comic books. Plus she was being portrayed by the absolutely talented Bryce Dallas Howard! I wish she had a larger role in this, but perhaps they saved that for the fourth film? There are too many stories meshed into this film. The murder of Peter's Uncle explained, Sandman, Eddie Brock and Venom, Peter and Mary Jane's relationship on the rocks - all in all not as good character development than the second film, which I still consider to be the best as a whole. Some say you must read the comic book to appreciate how perfectly it was adapted, but films and graphic novels are entirely different mediums. I do think Raimi did this the best it could be done.<br/><br/>OVERALL - I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I think to come in not expecting anything would have been a better experience for me. Worth seeing in the theatre, especially hearing all the comments the audience makes - Peter's hair when he wears the symbiote, the dancing, Harry back to normal - you know what I'm talking about. I'll be looking forward to the DVD release. 7/10."
"Foot_Freakin_Master","8","1","2","11 May 2007"," Maybe the most debated, but probably the most fun of the three Spidey movies.
","Hmm, I wonder what everybody expected. I can't remember many times when there were so many expectations about what a movie should contain, with the movie judged on that. I try to think about objective ways to judge Spidey 3.<br/><br/>In general, should a comic book movie be fun? Should it have action and effects? Should it have interesting characters? Should it be Shakespeare? My conclusion is that this movie was fun, had great action, and had interesting characters. Did it have flaws? Sure.<br/><br/>It could have been tightened up a little, with some judicious editing.<br/><br/>Uh...I can't think of much else that was a real problem, and is not just personal expectation.<br/><br/>A villain not getting enough screen time. A problem to some. To me, it worked fine, with a reasonable potential for his return in a future film.<br/><br/>Too many villains. A problem to some. To me, I thought it added to the fun. Who would Spider-man have to fight next? I liked the team ups.<br/><br/>Silly situations. Well, this is about a comic book hero. To me, it blended humor with drama. It actually had more adult drama, with career disappointments, jealousy, and egotism included. Freud would have loved it.<br/><br/>A few too many plot elements. Maybe. I could accept them, even if I really didn't need all of them. A few of them were a stretch, but then real life can be even stranger.<br/><br/>Too little character development. To me, this was a non-issue. I didn't need to know all the nuances of each villain. I already know Harry, plus I thought Peter and Mary Jane actually had more depth in their development than in either of the first two movies.<br/><br/>Acting. Well I thought Toby thankfully had more to do than just act like a nerdy, shy kid. Kirsten looked strained, but that worked with a person encountering career, self-esteem, and jealousy issues. I think most of the characters worked well with their parts. Were they developed well? I did not need them all developed in-depth. I thought, for instance, that Gwen and Miss Brant were just fine in their parts, with the potential to provide more competition for Mary Jane in the future.<br/><br/>Here again, I have heard comments that the movie was stupid. That's astounding considering the number of truly stupid movies I have encountered. I am usually the worst critic. I went in reading reviews and thinking this would be a disappointment. I liked the movie because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It was able take chances and blend humor, drama, and action. I can accept the few minor flaws. I will say that I hope the next Spider-man goes a few different directions with the characters and situations.<br/><br/>What else can I say? It blended wonderful, enjoyable silliness, adult issues, and rousing action and effects. It probably lacked the freshness of the original and the technical qualities of the second. For me, it will be remembered as what a good comic book movie should be: Great fun, with surprising depth."
"high_rollin2-1","4","1","2","10 May 2007"," Good, not great.
","I think Spider-Man 3 will be placed into the category of ""Bad third installments"", along with X3, Godfather 3, Batman Forever... etc. Because it's just not as good its two predecessors. <br/><br/>That's not to say I didn't like it. There were several enjoyable moments, and I was entertained. But it didn't strike the same chord that Spidey 1 and 2 struck. The first movie was entertaining and enjoyable, and had great drama that had a good resolution, and left you wanting more. The second movie gave you more, and didn't disappoint. It had even better action than the first movie, an even cooler villain, and darker drama that led exactly where the story needed to go. But Spider-Man 3 took a couple steps back. Yes, it had cool action, but it wasn't as cool or intricate as Spider-Man 2, and didn't quite pack the punch that the first movie had. And there was a lot of drama as well, but it didn't feel as powerful as Spider-Man 2 did. <br/><br/>SPOILER: And there is one particular plot-point that is handled absolutely terribly, IMO. Harry finally finding out that Peter really didn't kill his father. Why... oh why... oh why did they have Bernard do this??? Why couldn't they have had Peter finally break Harry, and finally explain it to him in that scene when he asks Harry for help. I thought that's what was going to happen... but no, Peter leaves, and then Bernard does it... terrible. Talk about a stupid resolution. Talk about an anti-climax to the Peter/Harry story. With all that's happened between them, its Bernard that finally fixes it all. After the movie, the only thing I could think about was what the hell is wrong with Bernard? He's known the truth all along... he's watched Harry obsess about it. And he only tells him now? If I were Harry, I would have been, ""Y'know, you could have told me that a long time ago. See the face?? Before that happened would have been REALLY nice!""<br/><br/>They could have so easily avoided that horrible bit by just having Peter explain it to Harry. Simple as that. Why they didn't do that is something I'll never understand. <br/><br/>SPOILER: The other major thing I have a problem with the introduction Venom. I don't think they chose a very good time to have him appear. They should have just introduced Eddie Brock, and established him. Maybe end with a cliffhanger of him becoming Venom. Having him appear and then get defeated in such a short amount of time wasn't very effective, and pretty disappointing. Even if he does re-appear, I think it would have been better to just save him for the 4th movie. And if they had to bring him in during this movie, then why have him get destroyed? Maybe just have him get over-powered by Peter and Harry, and then flee. Leaves a better cliffhanger, its reminiscent of a cartoon episode, and doesn't kill off Eddie Brock. And if they do bring him back, it spares us the moan of the old 'He's dead.. NO, HE'S NOT!!"" cliché. <br/><br/>I dunno. I'm not entirely sure what would have been better, but I know that Spider-Man 3 isn't as good as it could have been. Still enjoyable and entertaining, with some pretty good parts to it... but some pretty bad parts as well. I hope if they make a 4th, which I think it's confirmed that they are, then they do a better job handling the story lines. Whatever frame of mind they were in for the second movie... get back into it.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this a 6 out of 10. While the first got about an 8, and the second was either 9 or close to 10."
"viperxx-1","6","1","2","10 May 2007"," spider-man 3
","I am a great fan of Spider-Man in of its self and I have seen the two previous films. That T LOVED!! I have to say as much as I do like Spider-Man this film was not as good as the first two. Watching the T.V show and reading the comics when I was younger when I heard that they were truly putting Venom in the next film I thought it would be Amazing! But it kind of turned out to be a disappointment. Spider-Man with the symbiote suite on should be a lot more powerful then he is without it. In Spider-Man 3 it is not shown at all how truly powerful he should be with the symbiote on him. (Unless you count the fact that he pulls up a guard that leads into the sewer) This was disappointing because it would have been very cool to see the black suite Spidey in real action. The symbiote also should have been able to change Spider-Mans appearance at will changing into what ever he felt like wearing as well as having an endless supply of webbing. (This is not a big deal because he already has that from the start of the films.). The suit should have also been using Spider-Man at night when he went to sleep would go on to his body and take control and when he awoke would seem more tired then he went to bed. This is another that easily could have been added to the film but was left out. Another part that was disappointing was the fact that they had no explanation of how or why Spider-Man went to the bell tower to get the symbiote off of him. Myself watching the T.V show and reading the comic new that the bell would take the alien off because in the comic he goes to the Fantastic 4 they do some tests and the find out its weakness. They did not have to add the Fantastic 4 into the movie but they could have easily have made Dr. Connors do the tests and give the reason of why Spider-Man went to the tower to make the alien come off of him. But no, he just happens to be at a bell tower when he tries to rip the suite off. Besides all of these things if just felt like they were craming too much into one film. Each of the films before only had one Villain and they were both great! But this one too much was going on and in truth each villain could be made into a different movie. The movie was not at a totally loss but I think the good parts did not out way the bad. They could have definitely done a better job with this movie."
"ljung8erg","6","1","2","10 May 2007"," Well... it was okay...
","I used to read the comics when I could as a kid and loved the animated series. The first two movies did a great job of conveying the spirit of Spiderman, whilst taking liberties with certain characters and story elements. I let things slide because the movies looked great, were cast well and well... it's Spiderman!! So it goes without saying, even though I am about to say it, that I was supremely looking forward to seeing Spidey again. The character of Venom was one I liked from before. Not that I liked the guy, I just liked the transition, the Black suit, Eddie Brock etc... But in Spidey 3, I just wasn't buying it. A meteor ""conveniently"" lands near where Peter and Mary-Jane are making out and making me throw up (a huge element that also bugged me about this movie, I'll get to that). Something black crawls out of the tiny meteor and attaches itself to Peters bike back to Peters' apartment... then it does nothing for like 45 minutes... what was it doing? Messing with the door knob? So eventually we get the Black Spiderman, but do we? What does he do as Black Spiderman that makes him so mean? Break a camera and wet some sand? Ooooooh he's so mean. Most of ""black"" spidey isn't black spidey at all, it's black Peter Parker. All floppy hair and unnecessary dancing. So I was holding out hope for ""Venom"" or as he's know in the movie Topher Grace with bad teeth It almost seemed to me that they were rushed post production and because if I was disappointed with Black Spiderman, I was disgusted by Venom, sorry, Bad Teeth Topher. Don't get me wrong I like Topher Grace a lot, I just don't think he was right for this role Especially given the fact that it was so poorly executed. They should have introduced Eddie Brock in the second movie, given that rage time to simmer, make him more likely to wanna see Parker dead over a period of time rather than a couple of days. <br/><br/>The movie should have revolved around Spiderman, the Black Suit and Venom. Not Peter Parker and Mary-Jane, come on!!! Who cares?! We wanna see mind blowing special effects here, killer action with carefully thought out character building. They had enough time to put it all in but they put way too much into making us wish Mary-Jane would fall out of that cab. We got BTT (Venom) for the last 10 minutes but 90% we saw Eddie Brocks face, why? We know who it is.<br/><br/>*Possible spoiler* One more gripe (that I'll mention here anyway), what was the butler waiting for to share that little chestnut with Harry? An invite from the Queen? I hate when they throw convenient things into movies to help move the plot, really gets my goat! *Possible spoiler ends*<br/><br/>What did I like? I like the crane sequence. I liked Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman and the character of Sandman as a whole. He was portrayed well but didn't need to be in this movie, which is unfortunate. I like the special effects overall although some of the action was too close up and I could hardly tell what was happening.<br/><br/>Oh wait, ONE MORE GRIPE!! What the hell happened to Spiderman's ""Spidey Sense""? A lot of what happens in this movie could have been avoided if he had remembered to turn it on. Oh wait it's always on? And even Eddie Brock knew about it? Hmm now that is odd?<br/><br/>I gave Spiderman 3 a 6, but that may go down after writing this Oh dear"
"IrockGswift","Null","1","2","10 May 2007"," Weak and disappointing
","First I would like to say if you expect this film to be a fight to the finish between Spider-man and his arch enemies than your'e badly mistaken. Spider-man 3 was a 2 and a half hour rushed movie. This new villain/rival Eddie Brock came out of nowhere and eagerly wants to step on Peter Parkers toes and become a up coming photographer for the Daily Bugle. Flint Marko A.K.A The Sandman also comes out of the blue as a fugitive on the run and is coinceindentally responsible for Uncle Ben's death. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that the producers try to add more comedy to this film which the Spider-man element is action,adventure,and some romance. In the past Spider-man is known to make some pretty witty comments. The scene where the black suit takes over Peter Parker personality and he's dancing along the sidewalk could of been left out. That scene in my opinion was so corny and out of place. Mary Jane is confused as ever in this third installment,at first she in love with Peter and when things don't go her way with Peter she look for Harry Osborne for comfort. Didn't they date in the first movie (Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborne) and it didn't work out? But to be honest I like Peter's personality in the black suit he seem no longer to be a patsy. He's more suave and at the same time an asshole,and this time we didn't see him get over-powered by adversities while wearing the black suit. As the movie continued it was becoming more predictable and I began to enjoy it even less. The first two movies were more in depth of character content and this movie fails to do so. Scenes were jumping back and forth till you got dizzy to the point of losing interest in the whole movie. The lab partner(Gwen Stacy) of Peter Parker could of been left out the movie she didn't serve a purpose except wanting to be a Spider-man groupie. My recommendation the movie didn't live up to its hype and if you could wait till it comes on video that's not a bad idea neither."
"mcsheehey","5","1","2","10 May 2007"," A Disappointment
","My first reaction to this film when I saw it last Friday was, What the heck?? I feel like I can't even have an opinion about the movie because it's so all-over-the-place. We get dramatic special effects scenes, stylized but cool villain battles, a strange black-suit core plot, a romance side story, and the typical villain back-stories. There have always been these kinds of elements in the Spiderman movies, but in this one, they're over-packed. There's just too much, and for the most part, none of it is great. I'll break it down into different sections so my vote will make sense.<br/><br/>Effects Extravaganzas 8/10 The effects in the movie are breath-taking. The problem with the purely effects-based scenes is that the coolness factor wears off quickly. When Spiderman dives through wreckage in slow motion to save a damsel-in-distress (we later find that her name is Gwen Stacy), the excitement only lasts about a second. Then, I just wanted it to speed up.<br/><br/>Romance Sub-plot 2/10 By far the worst part of the movie is this sub-plot. We meet a new possible love interest for Pete (the above-mentioned Gwen Stacy), but she proves to be a very thin and boring character in the film, kind of like Mary Jane. MJ does what she did in the first two films for the most part. She whines, cries, gets captured, has useless fights with Peter, and performs terribly on the stage. However, now these things are repetitive, and this installment amps them up to the max. MJ seems to whine constantly, her kidnapping is more predictable than in the first two, she performs badly on Broadway instead of a local theater, and all of her fun and deep enigma is gone. In addition, she and Pete take turns acting like jerks to each other.<br/><br/>Villain Back-stories 3/10 I'll start by saying that Sandman is not exactly a menacing villain. His back-story is completely repetitive and ridiculous, verging on corny. Eddie Brock, on the other hand, could have been done well. However, Topher Grace turns in the worst performance of the film as Eddie, and does not become threatening or cool at all until he turns to Venom.<br/><br/>Black Suit Core Plot 7/10 The parts of the film focusing on the black suit are not menacing, like I expected, but rather funny and quirky. Unfortunately, this campy plot does not fit with the rest of the film, which tries to be dark. Spidey and Peter Parker both get emo make-overs, and Peter becomes a loser who thinks that he's insanely cool, strutting down the street and dancing 1970s style.<br/><br/>Villain Battles 10/10 The battles that Pete has with the New Goblin, Venom, and Sandman are the best parts of the film, and make it worth seeing. This is where the big budget comes into play. Seeing Spidey kick butt has never been so real as it is now. Though I give it a rather low rating, I urge you to see it just for the experience of seeing Spiderman as you've never seen him before in battle. Still, this movie has fallen under my expectations. Better luck next time, Mr. Raimi (if there is one)."
"SevenStitches","6","1","2","10 May 2007"," Doesn't touch its immediate predecessor, but nice try anyway.
","""Spider-Man 2"" eclipsed my expectations of what to expect from the mega-popular superhero franchise. Not only did it ramp up the quality of the action set pieces and visual effects considerably from its predecessor (the entirety of what most action blockbuster sequels encompass) but it also tracked and maintained the natural progression of all the characters involved, based on what was left after the first film. It wasn't afraid to further explore the emotional weight that comes with been a teenage superhero, nor to flesh out a villain that was sympathetic and not entirely malevolent. This, along with the perfect interplay of comedy and dazzling action made SM2 in my opinion the perfect comic-book movie. No surprise then that I had high hopes for this second sequel (as if no one else did!). From what had already passed and with a considerably bigger budget ($250 million +, the trailers prove that alone), Sam Raimi and co. were looking to once again up the stakes in all areas. But surely no one can beat the ""perfect"" comic-book movie?<br/><br/>All is rosy and right with our friendly neighbourhood Spiderman at the outset of his latest adventure. In stark contrast to what began the first sequel, the man sized creepy crawly is the toast of the city, now balanced perfectly with alter ego Peter Parker's straight A student life and blooming Broadway beau Mary Jane Watson, who is now aware of Peter's secret. However, not all is serene under the screen. Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn, is still seeking revenge for his father's death and now that he knows who's behind the mask of his adversary, he can finally squish the bug from the source by continuing is father's legacy as the New Goblin.<br/><br/>Enough for the latest episode you say? Well barely half an hour in, at least three more plots surface; during a night under the stars for Peter and MJ, a meteor strikes covertly close by, subsequently releasing a writhing, crawling black ooze that manages to hitch hike home with Peter that same night; a rival photographer in the form of Eddy Brock (Topher Grace) is slithering his way into the Daily Bugle as Spiderman's new photographer, much to Pete's disdain; Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church) is a runaway criminal and allegedly the real killer of Peter's Uncle Ben (a major plot motivation) who ends up accidentally trapped in an elaborate experimentation chamber that turns him into a disintegrating sand monster, aka the Sandman.<br/><br/>So after two paragraphs I've basically described almost the entire setup act. This is nothing we haven't seen in the trailers and even more is yet to come. There's the case of Spidey's black suit, Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) as the rival love interest, Venom and not to mention how all this affects Peter and MJ's relationship. People who are familiar with the comics or have seen the trailers will be aware of most of these plot points so I'm not going to elaborate, and for those who aren't aware, well, I don't have the space.<br/><br/>Yes, Spider-Man 3 is stuffed when it comes to content. The filmmakers have clearly seen this as possibly the capper on the trilogy so they decided to add in as many popular characters, villains and stories as possible while settling a number of plot lines started in the first two films. What results is at times an immensely entertaining film with action set pieces and special effects that out do its predecessors, trademark moments of zany and self aware comedy (Spidey empties his boots of sand after a long bout with the Sandman, asking himself ""Where do these guys come from?"") and our favourite characters portrayed perfectly by skilled actors. But by the end there's a distinct sense that everything else that the other films nailed could have gone smoother had they reduced the content.<br/><br/>This movie has enough to span at least two and to be honest that's probably what should have happened. While the black suited Spiderman is partly the result of the Sandman's existence, due to Peter's thirst for revenge for his uncle's true killer (feeding the black clinging symbiote), it could have been left for another film, leaving Peter to deal with the Sandman, Harry and MJ here. That's more than enough to engage for 2 hours. As much as I loved Peter's new attitude with the black suit and all the comedy that ensued, the development needed more time to illicit the sense of struggle in the character (Black Spidey is hardly seen in action nor are the symbiote's origins thoroughly explained).<br/><br/>Venom is another example. Probably the most infamous villain in the comic books, he's given nothing more than 20 minutes of screen time here, making him seem like a complete after thought, just shoehorned in for popularity's sake. He looks cool and his eventual appearance sticks to the source, but it's too little of too much too late. Along with the black suit, Venom should have been reserved for another film. New villains, especially of this ilk, need that time to develop. Venom and Sandman each deserved a full length feature at least.<br/><br/>Despite these annoying flaws, there's no denying Spider-Man 3 is still a very entertaining comic-book film due its incredible action (New Goblin vs Peter can take the prize for that), gorgeous special effects (Sandman's first appearance is a short film in and of itself due to its beauty alone) and show stopping comedy (Bruce Campbell once again has a hilarious cameo). It's never boring despite the length and the pacing is fairly consistent. It's also the most fun you'll have at the movies thus far this year, so I recommend it for that alone. But as an entry in the superior Spider-Man saga, it falls behind number 2's stunning all round quality and even number 1's tight plotting. In the end, they really couldn't improve on the perfect comic-book movie. Go figure!"
"michaelphoward","7","1","2","10 May 2007"," Why the vitriol?
","Briefly, I can't understand why so much fury is being vented at this film (though given the reasonable IMDb rating it can't be shared by more than a minority).<br/><br/>The 'Mask' dance scene IS completely laughable, even if it was meant to be funny, while I'm sure a far far better way of making Harry find out that Peter hadn't been responsible for his father's death could have been found. However much of the script, or 'moralising', isn't a lot worse than in the first 2 films - people making such negative comments seem to have either got bored of the tone of the films, or for some reason have come to expect the script to be some great work of literature rather than the comic book adaptation which it essentially is.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good, though some of the 'chase' action sequences are slightly hard to follow. There are too many plot lines but it is not a complete mess. Again this is a comic book adaptation and I don't think it would be in the film's best interests to attempt to fully and 'logically' explain everything that happens.<br/><br/>That said I did find the film a little disappointing after the first two and think the series has run its course. Unless a new director can do something truly unexpected I think this should be the final film."
"schlamniel","3","1","2","10 May 2007"," An incredibly average film
","This film was all hype, the last 2 film surpassed this one and the largest failure of this film is that it made so much money that there will be another sequel. None of the acting was much good (even for an action film). Too much was happening in the film for there to be much depth in most of the characters. The interaction between venom and spider man feels forced, the gwen stacy character was a nothing bit part. The movie as a whole felt disjointed. THe action/fight scenes were great but then with all the blue screen you'd expect nothing less.<br/><br/>There are 3 thing in this movie i liked: the cameo of Stan Lee, Bruce Campbell for he is god and how the ""evil"" Peter just looks emo. Everything else was filler ... 2 and a half hours of filler."
"drazenorama","1","1","2","10 May 2007"," Love story or...?
","I heard that mighty men from Hollywood already plan the 4th sequel. I can imagine the plot: ""Swinging from one building to another Spiderman suddenly notices gorgeous young man standing naked in his bedroom. He draws closer to the window and suddenly... his heart beats faster!! He runs, scared... for he noticed that he's turning GAY!!! His inner struggle between his (BTW most boring superhero's girlfriend)Mary Jane Watson and lust for young men so overwhelms him that he falls down from the building. Will he come out? Or will he conceal his man loving as he conceals his true identity?"" After 2 good Spiderman movies here comes one that made me leave earlier. So dull and disrespectful to the audience. Sam Raimi should definitely stuck to what he does best: Action. Not semi-love stories. So boring. Even the children in the theatre were bored. So, very, very, very bad movie."
"Oblio_11","2","1","2","9 May 2007"," Bruce Campbell was the high point of the movie.
","I had SO been looking forward to this movie, and was sorely disappointed. Topher makes a crappy Venom (and only appears as Venom for like ten minutes at the end), Sandman shouldn't have been in the movie at all, and the first hour was so slow I almost forgot I was watching an ""action"" movie. And what's with Spiderman taking his mask off every five seconds? Doesn't he understand the definition of ""secret identity""? Speaking of the mask, why is it that the mask always rips in the same places? With the inflated budget that this movie boasts, you'd think they could afford to make a new mask, rather than recycle the one Macguire wore in part one. LAME! This was like a parody of a Spiderman movie. The best part of the flick was the scene in the French restaurant with Bruce Campbell as the maitre D (spelling?) sporting a phony French accent and trying to help Peter pull off an extremely cliché'd engagement proposal. Seriously, skip this movie entirely or at least wait for video or the dollar theaters. ""Not worth it"" is an understatement. Oh, and the CG was unimpressive. Where did all the money actually go?"
"HaffiRam","6","1","2","9 May 2007"," Meh
","Let me begin by stating three words, ""NOT ENOUGH VENOM!"" I grew up reading the Spider-Man comic book series and I was personally disappointed with the lack of Venom in this movie. He is without a doubt my favourite villain. I read some other comments before I went to see this, and I can safely say most of them are correct. Overall I was disappointed with the film. Spider-Man 2 was awesome, but this just doesn't live up to the plot of the previous film. It did feel like Raimi tried to fit in too much, and what was up with the ending with Sandman, huh? I guess it did show that villains still have a human quality to them. The American symbolism was incredibly cheesy! However, go see the film in the theatre at least, who knows, you may like it."
"wokis420","7","1","2","9 May 2007"," Good movie but VERY Disappointing
","Everyone that is going to see this movie I am going to ramble on about it. This movie was A GOD DAMN SOAP OPERA. When does a story about spider man and action packed comic book hero/cartoon turn into a love story. We all know the story of peter and MJ. I enjoy that story but as a director of spider man you must realize.This is a story of spider man action comic hero. Not Spider man romance comic hero thats just the first of my problems with this movie even though i enjoyed it i was disappointed beyond my imagination. Sandman and The Hobgoblin(Harry) were done very well. The action scenes are awesome but there wasn't enough there was more love story than spider man in this movie.If I were on the team with Sam. This movie wouldn't of been a disappointment.It had so much potential and it ruined itself by rushing such a fan favorite villain in Venom on Eddie Brock in this movie it should have bin done a little bit differently too much stuff happening at once.Instead of peter dancing around in a bar they could have cut that out and just left it at hes eating dinner with Gwen in front of MJ acting like a complete ass and when MJ gets upset from it have it where they did when the Bouncer grabs Peter and so on. After you watch the movie you all will know what I mean.Then maybe after have peter at his apt listening into his radio that sandman is robbing another bank or something along those lines. Enraged peter going out to get him and Harry going after peter after the fight that they left off. wouldn't that of bin nice a free for all battle with Venom suit spider man Sandman and The hobgoblin. Each person has the others number Sandman can beat spider man. Hobgoblin has sandman's number and spider man has Hobgoblin's number. If you disagree prove me wrong. And maybe they could have done it sandman knocks spider man out and as hes going in for the kill harry knocks sandman out just like he did in the movie and in the fighting spider man gets sandman's locket. Then when Harry goes to finish off Peter the suit starts to take over Peter as he gets up and fights harry. Being more powerful spider man wins the fight. Sandman notices how he can get away with the money and flees but without the locket.A knocked out harry is picked up by the Black Spider man and the suit takes over once again urging peter to use the finishing blow and kill harry. Peter starts to notice in his head what Dr.Conners was trying to tell him. And fights it meanwhile Harry gets back up tries to kill Peter But the suit takes over while peter is fighting it and lets just say he pushes him off a top of the building and he dies. Peter can't believe what he has just done so he goes to the church and prays for the suit to come off. You all know where i'm going here. Venom suit is on Eddie. Sandman returns to his daughter with the money but realizes he doesn't have her locket. Peter tries again to get MJ back. Sandman recognizes Harry from the fight and knows peter parker is still going to be after him but he goes to the funeral waits until peter is on his way home alone MJ wont speak with him and he tells the real story about the death of his uncle. Peter Forgives him and gives him back the locket Closing scene of Eddie walking down the street wearing a black blazer that looks a little familiar (Hint Hint). I don't know thats just how i would have done the movie from the point where peter starts walking down the street pointing at people just some of the unnecessary scenes they had. But if you disagree with me lemme know how u feel about the movie thats what i would have done. thanks for reading i really needed to get that off my chest."

Spiderman should be an action movie and we need something more, which is ""Action"".<br/><br/>Seeing the stars began to weep now that must be deleted. I believe the producers rush to make this movie and it turns out the plot is bad and we don't see anything good on it.

"EdnaWelthorpe","4","1","2","9 May 2007"," Like a sandwich with good bread and sand in the middle
","Being a Spiderman fan (the 90's cartoon series, too cheap for the comics), I enjoyed the second film and looked forward to the third.<br/><br/>The beginning wasn't bad but once it got to the middle, everything that made the movie series so great went down the terlet.<br/><br/>Now I have a theory - Joel Schumacher kidnapped Sam Raimi and took over after the beginning. It's the only logical reasoning I can think of for the bloated mess in the middle.<br/><br/>First of all, when did Mary-Jane become a singer? And when did she get decidedly dumber and sorry to add on here, but at some point, you gotta stop with all the kidnappings. I mean if I was kidnapped as much as MJ was in the film, I would probably take a nap in that cab. Makes you wish for a Guild of Calamitous Intent to provide spacing.<br/><br/>Sorry.<br/><br/>Anywho, Gwen Stacy - completely unnecessary, one-dimensional, should have been in the first film if they really wanted her in this.<br/><br/>The montage sequence was WAY too long, WAY overdone, it was unintentional comedy at its most bloated. With all the eye shadow and black clothing, I thought Parker would have locked himself in his room and listened to the Cure for 15 hours. Would have fit in better than the most ridiculous dance since the Batousi.<br/><br/>Another problem - too many supervillians. If they wanted more than one, they should have kept Doc Oc alive in the second film and start up the Sinister Syndicate or whatever it was called. Venom is good enough by himself with out any need for the Goblin or Sandman.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Goblin, did the audience really want another Goblin appearance? Couldn't Harry have played no role and then make a grand appearance in the fourth one? Stop the losing the damn mask! I swear, what is the point of the costume if the guy keeps losing his mask? Do you see Batman having this problem? How about comic book Wolverine? My main gripe though is the middle which as stated before, contained not only the overdone montage but an instance of assault which helped lead to one of the more ridiculous endings I have seen. They hug and that's that...what now everything is just hunky-dory? In condensed form: the beginning was good, the middle sucked and dragged the ending with it.<br/><br/>For the next three films, they need to streamline the story, rediscover Spiderman's witty banter and have him keep his mask on."
"Carvbap","3","1","2","9 May 2007"," So bad I'm no longer looking forward to part 4
","I just saw the concluding chapter of this trilogy less that an hour ago, and I feel confident calling it an insult to modern cinema.<br/><br/>First off I'd like to credit Sam Raimi for the excellent pieces of storytelling that were Parts 1 and 2. Although I personally didn't enjoy the second chapter quite as much as everyone else seemed to, I found that the characters were developed well, the story progressed; a top notch movie in my book- and therefore I eagerly awaited this next episode. But the truth is, I don't know how they got it so wrong.<br/><br/>In order to properly tell you what's wrong with Spidey 3 though, I think I need to summarise.<br/><br/>Venom; perhaps the biggest fault with this movie. Out of all the 140 minutes of it, Grace's role in this film was god-awful. Every scene with Eddie Brock is pathetic, and looking back I'm thinking that if they took all of his scenes out, changed the ending to focus more on the Harry Osbourne angle we might be able to salvage something. He wasn't necessary, his character was completely mis-portrayed, and please...he wants to kill Spidey because he was 'humiliated'.<br/><br/>Then there's Gwen Stacey. Why does she exist again? Oh right...to push Mary-Jane's insecurities to the limit and create another story arc. I appreciate she's going through a hard time, but there's no need for a secondary character creation to accommodate that. In fact, apart from the 15 seconds Raimi uses to show that she was briefly involved with Brock...and therefore another catalyst in his mix, she doesn't serve any purpose.<br/><br/>The problems elsewhere thought I think are side-effects of the venom character. Sandman wasn't really out of place until the final act, until that point he's really just a vehicle for Peter to use in order to overcome his own darkness and need for vengeance. But when Venom enters the mix it suddenly becomes a free-for all with every plot point until this stage suddenly convoluting. <br/><br/>So Pete's after his uncles killer, got a bad ass suit, rival photographer, relationship problems and his best friend wants to kill him....but the films trying to convey too much moral messages now that we don't really hear any of it.<br/><br/>I could go on forever, but just two questions; why does the Sandman suddenly get bent on killing Spidey at the end (only to change his mind yet again) and why oh why is the Osbourne Butler a factor in the story at all? Kids will love it, but for all those who know what constitutes a good movie- AVOID."
"thechuck45","6","1","2","9 May 2007"," Worth seeing but not as good as it should have been
","First off, I'm a fan of comic books and I love spider-man. I loved the animated series when I was younger and I loved both of the previous movies. Spider-Man 2 is still the best comic movie ever made. So naturally, when I came to watch the midnight showing of Spider-Man 3 I was expecting to see the best super hero movie of all time. Three villains, the black suit, and more action. How could they screw this up? Well, somehow they managed and I left the theater that night very disappointed. Here is a layout of the things I think they did right and the things I think they did wrong.<br/><br/>First the right....<br/><br/>1. The action sequences were f*cking awesome. The best part of the movie was naturally the action sequences. CGI continues to amaze me.<br/><br/>2. Harry didn't wear the Green Goblin mask from the first movie. This was my only gripe about either of the first two films. It looks like a retarded Power Ranger mask.<br/><br/>3. They added more humor. The scene with Bruce Campbell was hilarious. The humor kept the movie from being really boring. I'm not including the piano playing or shooting from the hip scene because they were retarded.<br/><br/>4. Venom was in the movie and he looked sweet as hell.<br/><br/>5. Harry became a good guy at the end. I liked this part. At least Peter didn't have to kill his best friend.<br/><br/>The Bad....<br/><br/>1. Did Marry Jane really have to sing twice and when did she become so damn whiny? nuff said<br/><br/>2.When did spider-man become a long boring chick flick? Seriously, this movie seemed to drag on forever. They would follow up each interesting scene with a bunch of long drug out crap. Like MJ singing or Peter walking around town winking or an arguing scene. They spent more time developing how jealous MJ was of Peter and the love triangle between Peter, MJ, and Gwen then they did developing the characters of the villains. The Gwen character really served no purpose in the film. She wasn't really Eddie's girlfriend, he just thought she was. MJ being jealous was also pointless. He's Spider-Man. Get over yourself. With 3 villains it shouldn't have been that difficult to come up with a story line that kept us on the edge of our seats but instead we got a love story.<br/><br/>3. They explained NOTHING. What was the black goo? If you weren't a fan of the comic books you have no idea. Doc Connors gave a 25 second explanation and that was it. Other than that, it was just some goo that crashed from the sky. Why could Peter take the black suit on and off but then all of a sudden not be able to get it off and have to use the bell tower? Why did Eddie get spider powers? Fans know why, but no one else does. Why did sandman become sandman? They gave no explanation. Amazing, a two and a half hour movie that I was bored through a lot of that still can't manage to explain the story line.<br/><br/>4. Venom was in the movie for a whole 20 minutes and he didn't speak in the first person plural case. When he said ""I want Spider-Man dead"" instead of ""we want spider-man dead"" I was a bit upset. As I mentioned before, he looked really cool and the fight scene was awesome.<br/><br/>5. Spider-Man let Sandman just walk away because he was sorry. WHAT?! I know Spider-Man doesn't kill people but he could have at least kicked his ass. Did they run out of money or what?<br/><br/>Overall the movie is worth seeing but it's nowhere near the level of the other two films. The movie drags and fails to explain some very key elements but the action scenes, the humor, and the fact that Venom is in the movie are enough to give the movie 6/10"
"Leafsman_69","7","1","2","9 May 2007"," Unintentional Grindhouse of the Marvel world
","I wanted to start off by saying this movie was entertaining and worth the price of admission simply for the action. However after i let the whole film sink in and i have become annoyed. This film is like three Spiderman films rolled into one. Despite the film's 2.5 hour runtime, there is no room allotted for character development. Venom receives less time then most other characters and he was supposedly the headline-enemy of the film. What happened? were they pushing the limits of the 250, 000, 000 budget? probably. There were also the scenes involving Parker and MJ that were painful to watch. Watching Toby try to squeeze out those tears look like squeezing a sponge full of water was the nail in the dramatic coffin.The finale whereby the reporter narrates the events is also painstaking. So cliché, so overdone, such unnecessary babbling filler just drives me up the wall. I don't mean to lash out at a sizablen portion of the North American movie going public, but when a high-budget production flashes shiny graphics, extended fight scenes and cheesy acting only rivaled by the Young and the Restless, its enough to be considered a successful movie. Too many people just eat this stuff up. I am no exception at times however i can take the blinders off after the movie and see past the glitz that only shallow viewers will be amazed by. If you want to see multiple movies in one showing, pick-up Grindhouse when it comes to DVD. That's real entertainment that ISN'T ashamed to expose its multiple flaws."
"jdfiles-1","2","1","2","9 May 2007"," Spidey - Where's the Action?
","I loved Spiderman 1 - i really liked Spiderman 2 - I wasted my money on Spiderman 3. Even my 11 year old son thought it was poor...the few action scenes interspersed with love story sections and attempts at comedy was disjointed, and just not fun....There is a real feeling of going through the motions in this third episode of the franchise...The fight scenes were not easy to follow and i couldn't feel any sympathy with any of the characters...The relationship stories are all carried over from the first movie, and who really cares about how uncle Ben and Aunt May got engaged?...Venom and sandman are the big bad enemies and venom only really appears towards the end of this very long dull movie. I came for the action and went home and watched the runaway train section from Spiderman2 and there was more action in that segment than the whole of Spiderman 3....and this from the director who brought us Army of Darkness...on reflection even 2 out of 10 is a tad high...."

","Spoiler Warnings so don't read if you ain't seen it or have little knowledge of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Hey first review on here, firstly I would like to say I didn't hate this film, I'll even more than likely buy it on DVD when it is out.<br/><br/>However I did feel that it went wrong somewhere, I went to the Cinema with high hopes for this film knowing that I had loved the first two and it started out pretty good, the whole loving Spiderman thing was a great thing to show how its building his ego up a tad too much etc. I liked harry as the goblin (don't know if he was supposed to be green or the hob goblin but still good) I even liked the sandman, Thomas Haden Church seemed almost ideal for the part and I don't often think the actors they get to play the characters match up, but he was good.<br/><br/>But I didn't like what they did with the Character of the Sandman, they changed it to fit the ""moral of the story"" I don't believe they should have had him robbing banks to help save his sick/dying daughter, it took the villainous edge away from him making him too soft and boring as the villain.<br/><br/>The Gwen Stacy character was a bit boring too I believe, when I found out she was going to be included I thought great because she was a great character and in the comics she helps peter with some life decisions before and after her untimely demise but in the movie she was more like a prop for the writers to make MJ jealous and that was it, they could have used anyone for this but they used a great character and whittled it down to a bit part. Not good in my opinion should have used her more or not at all.<br/><br/>Now for the Infamous Black suit, I know many (comic and cartoon fans mainly - as i am) weren't impressed with the suit and unfortunately I wasn't either it just didn't have the feel the symbiote suit should have I think the main thing was that fact he could take it off, since it was a symbiote it was creating a symbiotic relationship with Peter, but in the movie it came across as if it just attached itself to the suit. Not how it works it should have fed off peter and then changed into the black suit from Peters thoughts changing it black due to its dark nature. It was a Parasite since when do parasites let you take it off and on at will.<br/><br/>Now I understand why the film makers did it this way, because they need to get to the venom part of the story before the end of the film, this is where I believe the mistake was made. They shouldn't have brought venom in, they could have had the black suit, Peter becoming more in touch with the darkness of himself and have him battle, the more evil Sandman maybe kill him, maybe just nearly kill him then realise the evil this suit was and then after the battles and everything then go racing to the church to get it off. I think the shot of Eddie Brock Jr. Getting the black liquid on him and the changing into Venom snarling and jumping into the screen mouth open would have been the better ending leaving it open to a dark evil Fourth instalment with just Venom as the evil bad guy.<br/><br/>Other little things annoyed me Eddie Brock having the venom teeth when the mask came off, Tobey Maguire not being able to do evil, even bad, it just made him look stupid I mean the audience were laughing at his bad boy routine it wasn't good.<br/><br/>So in conclusion I believe they should have done it a little different, just the two bad guys, no venom (only a closing shot) and the black suit getting more detail and showing its power more. But overall I liked the film I would watch it again but I liked the other two better. I think Sam Raimi shouldn't have listened to Avi Arad about the venom thing really.<br/><br/>Please note that these are just my opinions You should go see it your to make your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading"

","What a horrible movie! I went to the theater with all the enthusiasm on opening day. Waited in line for two hours to ensure a good seat and all I got was a cluster of sub stories crammed into one. Two and a half hours of sheer boredom. The only characters worth anything in this movie was the French restaurant host and Mr. Jameson. There were moments...but they were short lived and not very many. My 5 year old son fell asleep...that's how boring this movie is...I was falling asleep...the fight scenes are nauseating...too fast to even see who's hitting who and just lame. The news girl towards the end is corny...just like the whole coverage of the final battle from the news channel perspective...in short it was just a very disappointing movie. Hopefully the lead actors will follow their heart and decide not to do Part 4...There was no more creativity in this one...it lacked the energy from the first two...Put this franchise to bed already! 6.9 rating is way to high!"
"snottyscotty150","4","1","2","9 May 2007"," We've all done terrible things to each other, but we have to forgive each other.
","This movie had the potential to be the best spider-man movie ever, but instead it turned out bad. However I don't think its down to just the story, on paper it looks good at least a 2 hour 20 minute movie about spider-man with 3 villains (Sandman, New Goblin and Venom) with Peter and MJ together and getting married...on paper at least it looks good.<br/><br/>So why did it go wrong? The film starts off really well and picks up from where number 2 left off really nicely, personally I was never a fan of Spiderman 2 because to me it wasn't as good as the original, but this one had more to give, still back to the beginning...it starts off and reminds us of the old characters who we loved, Peter is still the web-slinger and hes top of his class and still takes pictures, MJ's acting career is on a high as shes got a main part. This is all good and for the first 10 minutes it makes you remember this is a spider-man film.<br/><br/>Then we see sandman's character (I was so uninterested I didn't catch his real name - though I believe it should be William Baker) still we get to see this new villain...then after we get a really cool action scene, at this point you start to think this is now a spider-man movie, as all the special effects come out and your sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen and wanting to know what happens next, but not much really does, during this scene we see some new character called Gwen Stacy who is a model, and we also see Eddie Brock...it then goes to a scene of J. Jonah Jameson in his office (at this point there are a few laughs but the joke wears thin after a while).<br/><br/>During this time we see Peter and Brock have some tension and they start to hate each other. Sadly however this is the point when the film starts to get down hill, as Sandman then becomes Sandman, and Peter and MJ break up....Peter is so full of himself about being spider-man that hes kind of lost how to talk to MJ but he wants to marry her so it's all good, however they have a fight in the restaurant where Peter plans to ask MJ the question. Suddernly the film turns from being a fairly solid film to a chick flick which is all about Peter and MJ trying to get back together.<br/><br/>I wont bore you with the rest of the film because to be honest the rest of it is fairly rubbish, Harry has a memory lose due to a fight with spider-man, Peter gets ""darker"" due to the black suit and becomes a massive flirt...and shows off in front of MJ and suddenly turns Emo. MJ does the typical girl thing and falls in love with Harry again and still loves Peter...in other words she turns out to be the village bike.<br/><br/>Also like has already been stated Venom is hardly in it, and the ending is predictable, I'm not too bothered about the Venom stuff because it was obvious that was a bad move.<br/><br/>But like I said to start with the story didn't kill it, I mean certain parts did but not all. In some ways I think the directing killed this movie.<br/><br/>The length when I read it on IMDb before seeing it did surprise me 2 hours 20 minutes isn't a long time, but Casino Royale was that long and so was Blood Diamond both are excellent films they have a good solid story and they have a lot of action, while keeping you entertained. Upon watching those movies though I think Sam didn't move with the times both of them movies the directing during the action scenes kept you in the movie where as spider-man 3 was more like watching the matrix reloaded the special effects for me where too over used and the camera seemed to be in the same position it was almost like it was shoot using a high digital camera on a mobile phone.<br/><br/>This film (the last film I saw at the cinema before this was Casino Royale which I thought was excellent) was meant to be every single spider-man fans dream and every non spider-man fans film of the year, but instead it just didn't feel modern, you left the cinema thinking ""what was that?"" in shock that it wasn't what you had hoped, it was meant to be Batman Begins in terms of how dark it was but it wasn't dark at all.<br/><br/>I would say that this film is a typical case of gone too far, the humour and the effects where just too much for it and the story was trying to be too much to so many people. But it done what it set out to do, look around you there's spider-man everywhere at the moment its advertised so much, the media got us to go and see it, where as we all fail to see that the movie is not what we hoped."
"timcampbell88","5","1","2","8 May 2007"," How can you live up to such expectancy?
","Waiting for this movie since Spider-man 2 was released may be my fault. This obviously stretched out movie could have done without some of the quirkiness that Tobey Maquire brings. He already has a nerd quality being himself. It was so over the top and took away from the story line. If the director/producer's intent was to merely entertain and not to tell a great story then they accomplished their goal. The Spider-man trilogy ends on a very un-climatic bang or should I say whimper. I hope they don't end this franchise this way. I don't want to have to wait 10 years for a resurrection like the Batman franchise. The writer's should have explored Spider-man's dark side as the new Batman franchise did. It's all in the actor's face sometimes. Tobey Maquire doesn't have the same flare as Christian Bale. To compensate, Spider-man needs more action and high flying swinging. And lastly, leave music to musicals."
"Sparrowmaniac","4","1","2","8 May 2007"," Well, frankly speaking.... it sucked
","I wasted 50 bucks and I want it back Sam Raimi. Spidey 3 is one of those sort of movie which directors make, when they don't have anything to do, and they are sure irrespective of how much crap they put in the movie, its gonna work in the box office. Same with Spidey 3.<br/><br/>Each of its prequels had something to remember by. Spidey 1 had that famous quote, ""With great powers come great responsibilities"" Spidey 2 had that unbelievable train action sequence. Spidey 3 has nothing. Absolutely nothing. I though with 3 villains maybe this franchise is maturing to the level of the batman franchises. Instead it has pummeled down the drain. The only logical thing to remember this sequence by would probably be, th comic relief of Bruce Campbell, and a bad Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst was awful, no scratch that she was woeful. Topher Grace, I really had high expectations for Venom, but he was shunted to the sidelines which made his character so trivial. Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko was decent. His animations as the Sandman were the only thing about special effects that were up to the mark. James Franco was probably the only person who was really good in the movie. His expressions even during the fight sequences were good. They should have re christened the movie as Harry 3. LOL !!!<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard !!! She looked stunning. I agree with one of the reviewers, she really should stop making those Shaymalan movies,and take up some romantic roles. She is a visual stunner.<br/><br/>Everything else was crap. Many are complaining that the movie was too long. Well considering the junk it was, it literally was too too long. But had Raimi elongated the movie to another 20-25 minutes and stretched the individual plots, I feel that would have been a better package.<br/><br/>No point harping on the plot, since by this time all of you should have come to know of it. Taking in about the rest of the stuff behind the scenes, well, visual effects were moderately good enough but not quite the standard you expect in a spidey movie. The score was dreadful compared to the previous 2. Screen play pathetic.<br/><br/>Simple enough, 4/10 is an overrated vote for me !!!"
"Cjrod3","Null","1","2","8 May 2007"," Broke records. So What?
","""Spidey Trounces Sith"" That's the headline on IMDb's Studio Briefings page today. Why should we care how much this laughably bad movie made in less than a week? The media seems to be under the misconception that a movie should be judged by how much dough it rakes in. OK, it's a lot easier to use numbers to gauge value (as opposed to aesthetic worth, which is close to nil here), but unless you're a Sony exec or shareholder, why are we supposed to be fascinated by box office numbers? Capitalist culture gone mad? This thing is a pure stinker. So I guess the studio publicity machine can only focus on the mind boggling profits surrounding Spiderman 3's release, which is, as the old saying goes, like putting perfume on a hog."
"mking147","6","1","2","8 May 2007"," Should of been the best trilogy ever, but didn't quite make it!!
","I first saw a trailer for this film when Superman returns came out at the cinema last year, and I said that if Superman:the man of steel (to be released in 2009) was going to compete with Spiderman 3 it would have to put in a lot of time and effort. Having now seen Spiderman 3, it is an outstanding example of how deceiving trailers can be.. I really believed that it wouldn't follow in the footsteps of the Matrix or X-MEN trilogies, but it has, and for the following reasons - there is far too much coincidence: meteor with 'black goo' lands right next to Pete and MJ, Flint Marko is Ben Parkers real killer and just happens to become a villain, the woman saved in the crane disaster just happens to be Petes lab partner and Eddie Brock's girlfriend, and Eddie Brock just happens to be at the church asking for vengeance when spider man is trying to rip the black suit off!! see what i mean? this could all be forgiven because it is a fairy tale superhero film, but what they did with the romance cannot. the end of spider man 2 (by far the best in the trilogy for originality in villain, story, comedy scenes and action sequence)showed that after two films of struggling to get together, MJ was all Pete's after running from the altar. so why why why did we have to see her Broadway career end, her dancing whilst making omelette's with harry before they kiss, spider man use their kiss from the first film when he is given the key to the city by the same Blondie he saved, SPOILER ALERT and why did she have to tell Pete it was over on the bridge just because harry told her to, surely she could have whispered or made some distraction??? SPOILER ALERT Pete's cockiness and arrogance in all of this (especially the proposal scene with the violin and Bruce Campbell very funny) could of been understood and easily forgiven by MJ, along with the kiss mentioned above that he uses on Blondie, if Pete had already been infected with the black goo from the start, but i understand this doesn't happen till it gets into his bed (??)if infected from the start he could of got rid of it sooner and given venom more screen time... there was no need to go over old ground with the love triangle when it was all sorted!! Get rid of that rubbish, and spend more focusing on MJ trying to help Pete, an then Pete have an even bigger battle with Venom somewhere else (on a spaceship or aeroplane would of been interesting!!) slimming the film down to 2 hrs flat SPOILER ALERT and then it all finishing with the wedding... most of Aunt Mays lines were about the ring, and then they don't even get married in the end!! come on!! I so wanted to love this film, and it would of competed with the best trilogies like Indiana Jones and star wars were once, but i only loved the fast paced battles with goblin and sandman, the crane scene and some of the comedy scenes, SPOILER ALERT and i think the way spider man forgave sandman worked really well, so i am tempted to go see it again, but i think i will leave half and hour before the end!! also - when he dances in the jazz bar don't worry the film does eventually get back to some sort of normality!!"

"raiderforce39-1","9","1","2","6 May 2007"," Spider-Man Triumphant (Sympathy Factor)
","I walked in to my local AMC theater with mixed feelings. Having just come out of a Hot Topic across the street and seeing a Venom t-shirt, I was somewhat pumped. However, critics had panned the film... but then again, most of the films they pan I end up liking.<br/><br/>The introduction of Flint Marko, played brilliantly by Thomas Haden Church of SIDEWAYS and GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, and his metamorphosis into the Sandman, helped make the film. For once there is a villain who is just trying to save his daughter and truthfully wants no harm done. It made me sympathize for him and wanting the rage-driven Spidey to forgive him for, yes that's right, killing Uncle Ben. <br/><br/>Topher Grace, a cool cat in my book, was for the first time down right nasty. I did, however, feel sympathy here too. Before Spidey reveals the photoshopping of a picture Eddie Brock, Jr. (Grace) used to outsource Pete Parker, he begs him not to, seeing as that the Bugle is the only place that will hire him. After this and Parker's stealing of Brock's girlfriend Gwen Stacy (hottt Bryce Dallas Howard), Brock was destined to become Venom, filled with enough rage to destroy the world. Venom made the movie, and fellow comic fans will enjoy the symbiote menace as well.<br/><br/>Now we come to Harry Osborn. You gotta love James Franco here. After a fight with Parker under the guise of Goblin 2, he tries to kill Spidey using his newly acquired ultrahuman strength and is knocked out by Parker, only to lose his short term memory (the film takes place immediately after the end of SM2) and believe Pete is still his bff. When reawakened to his anger, he ruins Parker's relationship w/Mary Jane and throws Spidey off he deep end, feeding the symbiote's hunger for rage and turning him into the Dark Spider-Man. But then Spidey does the unthinkable: after burning the left side of Harry's face so that he looks like Erik, le Phantom of the Opera, he goes to Osborn for help. And later, during a duel with Venom and the Golem-size Sandman, he ACTUALLY helps Spidey, even sacrificing his life for Pete's, which becomes the catalyst for Eddie Brock's vaporization (highlight of the movie even with my sympathy).<br/><br/>Mary Jane's life goes south, getting fired from a play b/c she can't sing (BS!!!!), losing Pete to Gwen, and being forced by Harry to betray Pete. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie, though, is Bruce Campbell. I hope to God he's Quentin Beck in SM4 and becomes Mysterio. Then we can have Mysterio, Lizard, and the other possibities and do what the original Batmans didn't. Have multiple villains and not make it campy."

","As a huge spiderman fan i was really looking forward to this movie and had my tickets booked and ready to watch as soon as it came out. I now wish i hadnt of bothered. Of course the film was enjoyable in parts but it definitely dragged on a bit with unnecessary parts.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the Xmen movies as well this was kinda similar in a way, 2 excellent first movies with the third and perhaps final chapter being no where near as good.<br/><br/>In the actual movie itself the part where peter is strutting about, as funny as it is, is just really not needed. This part of the movie was supposed to show how peter had become vengeful and unremorseful but instead its just a cocky idiot dancing about.<br/><br/>Another point which was done badly was venom. firstly when he spoke venom always spoke as he was 2 different people, the symbiote and eddie, but this was not the case in the movie. also i don't think he was given enough screen time in the movie, as a favoured character in the comics and wasn't in this movie that much. i hope he comes back but i just cant c it happening the way raimi left it.<br/><br/>I really do hope they make a fourth movie but it would have to be a vast improvement on this one to win me back. id like to c the lizard as spideys enemy this time"

"samseescinema","7","1","2","6 May 2007"," Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric
","Spiderman 3 reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>My endless fascination with midnight screenings brought me to the theatre at Union Square here in Manhattan last night, standing in line with every other fanboy garbed in a Spidey costume bought from the Kmart down the street and crushing into a third row/far left seating arrangement that cricked my neck up to the gargantuan screen above. The film rolled up to speed and the requisite clapping and whoops ensued. 140 minutes and a polite applause later we filed out. All of us shook our heads, some shaking in confusion while others shook in unguarded disappointment. This, after all, was not the Spiderman 3 we had anticipated. It was something broader, something simpler, something light. But to call this third entry into the mega-franchise a complete blunder is a gross overreaction. It's more that the big gust of air Spiderman 2 inhaled in preparation for the big trilogy finish is not the same air exhaled in Spiderman 3. The film is still the same gosh-wow cinematic event it was three years agoonly this time around, things have gone a bit goofy. <br/><br/>Things are as they were when we left Spiderman swinging through the steel and concrete canyons of the Manhattan skyline in 2004. He's still with the budding Broadway starlet Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and still at odds with his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who now seeks revenge for his father's death. Peter's lost in romance and fame, anticipating a city festival in Spiderman's honor and spinning webs for him and MJ to lie upon beneath the shooting stars. He's pitching the idea of a marriage proposal to his widowed Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and excelling in school with his lab partner/supermodel Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Yep, things are good in Spidey-land; and especially good when Harry awakes from a harsh concussive coma to have forgotten Peter's involvement in his father's death. But leave a particle physics experiment and an alien meteorite alone long enough and you're bound to face a stray supervillain. So inevitably, it isn't long until Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church) and Venom are on the loose, robbing banks and infecting enterprising photographers (Topher Grace) like supervillains tend to do. <br/><br/>What's changed most here is the text behind the production. The original Spiderman was penned by David Koepp, screen writing veteran of Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible and War of the Worlds. Spiderman 2 brought on board Alvin Sargent, a quieter writer known for Robert Redford's Ordinary People and the adultery riff, Unfaithful. This time around, Sam Raimi and his older brother Ivan penned the script with the help of Mr. Sargent. Sam Raimi's writing credentials include The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness. Though all three films are giddily remembered in all the majestic cheeseball glory, none of them would be considered the right material for the third entry into this multi-billion dollar franchise. And who trusted Sam's older brother Ivan to help put this story into theatres? Ivan's a doctor, not a writer. Anyway, this family pairing gave Spiderman 3 the wily gift of Camp humor. And Camp is something like the ugly lovechild of Satire and Parody: mischievous and unwieldy. When it works, it works (e.g. Evil Dead). When it doesn't work, the backlash from the audience can be fierce. And in Spiderman 3, the backlash will be vociferous. <br/><br/>The sequence most in question finds Peter Parker under the control of Venom, the alien parasite that, when infected, transforms its host into the manifestation of its worst character traits. We expect the grimmer, haunting side of Spiderman to rear its head here. Instead, Raimi gives Peter the emo hair-flip and pencils in black eye-liner. He dances in the street and gives the eye to girls walking past. He goes to a jazz club and showcases his surprise piano talents, dancing on top of the piano and picking a fight with the bartender while jutting his crotch out towards the ladies. And if that weren't an awkward enough addition to the Spiderman legend, Raimi poses all of this as a quasi musical dance number. So if nothing else, it is a fascinating and hideous thing watching the colossal Spiderman franchise nearly cannibalize itself in a matter of two short scenes.<br/><br/>Luckily, the action sequences are nothing if not spectacles, as usual. The feats of CGI workmanship are as we've come to expect from the Spiderman franchise, the perspective whirling about as if through the eyes of a highly enraged bumble-bee. If you aren't nauseated, you'll be amazed. The villains are the best they've yet been, with Sandman showcasing the state of artistic digital animation and the creepy, parasitic Venom living up to its insatiable hype by the film's end. It's all structured so as to make the action into fresh and sugary prizes for enduring the lesser story bits forced in between. <br/><br/>Spiderman has always pretended to be story-driven. And in the first two films the script was convincing enough so that we shrugged our shoulders and played along. But the Raimi brothers have indulged maybe too sloppily into comic book traditions this time and have let their story stray into something of an unintended joke. But for a franchise that relies on the tent-poles of event summer cinema, Spiderman 3 is still a blissful two and a half hour block of escapist fun. Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"

","Spider-man 2 is still the best, namely with the train fight and Doc Ock, one of the greatest villains ever. But Spidey 3 is almost as good, and has some truly great parts in it. Spider-man movies always had plot-holes and cheese, especially the first one; it was the lovable Peter Parker and relatable circumstances such as trying to hold down a job, or dealing with first love, that really made you love the movies and feel strongly for the main character. In a way, with the disappointing Superman Returns, the very dark Batman Begins, and the over-populated X-men trilogy, the Spider-man films are (at this point) the most superhero-ish of all the superhero films we've had yet: it's the only one with a lone, brightly-coloured hero with a mild-mannered alter ego and drop-dead girlfriend/damsel in distress and all the other tropes we expect from a superhero film. The Spider-man trilogy has always played up the cheese and the humour, and this last film is no different. There are disappointments, such as the villains not being villainy enough, especially with the Sandman (""he's a villain! But he's a good man at heart. But he's still a robber and thief and murderer. Although he didn't mean it""--make up your minds already!) and Venom not being around enough. But in places this movie was terrific, especially the Harry Osbourne story which fulfilled all the promises of the end of Spidey 2.<br/><br/>All in all, then, a very worthy end for the Spidey trilogy; pure enjoyment right through, although there were some blips in plotting etc."

","Spider-Man 3 is far from perfect, and neither are most comic book films, with the exception of Batman Begins in my opinion. There will always be things in comic book sources that don't really function or translate well onto screen, and vice-versa. Without a doubt, the Spider-Man film franchise, as well as the new Batman franchise and X-Men trilogy, are the greatest comic book films ever. V for Vendetta, 300, and Sin City don't count as they were based on graphic novels, not comic books. Yes there is a difference. But let's talk Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Spider-Man 3 is not perfect. There are parts that don't feel like they really advance the story or simply don't flow very well. The major flaw of Spider-Man 3 is it's attempt to do too many things at once. There are three villains, Harry Osborn, Sandman, and Venom. Additionally, there is of course the love story, which now is back to a love triangle involving Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry. ALSO, Spider-Man must deal with the power-responsibility catch after acquiring his new black suit, compliments of a symbiote from space, AND, Peter has a new potential love interest, Gwen Stacy. Phew...talk about a lot of ground to cover.<br/><br/>Whereas in most comic book films, the story will cover the hero, or heroes' struggles with identity and purpose, they only focus on one to two villains at a time. But Spider-Man 3 gives us three, and in some ways four, noting on how Spidey becomes somewhat of an arse after getting the black suit. This causes the story to become so divided as the creative teams attempts to give each story an equal amount of screen time, that they become very shallow and not deep enough to touch on the human side that the other two films, specifically the flawless second installment, really connected on.<br/><br/>But even with it's big flaw of being bloated, Spider-Man 3 does have many great things going for it that show why the web-slinger's outings have always been simply great. First and foremost, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, though there are a lot of tears shed. It remains one of the most fun experiences you will have watching a movie. I would highly advise seeing it on the big screen, because like the first two installments, as well as other epics, it just doesn't translate into a TV as well. The visual effects in this latest film do the impossible and top the second one. The action is simply fantastic and will not leave viewers disappointed. Also, fans will love the designs on Venom and the more hardcore fans will be drooling over the simply amazing visuals on both Venom, Sandman, and pretty much the whole movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Spider-Man 3 is one hell of a way to start the summer movie season of 2007, one that promise to bring in a whole plethora f fantastic movies to come. Also, it's a great way to conclude the current trilogy.<br/><br/>8.9/10"

","I only saw this today with my family and was looking forward to seeing the second sequel as we all enjoyed the first two ""Spiderman"" films. The story is all based from comics so as you would expect, it's pretty much paint-by-numbers but sadly the undoing of the second sequel was that it was far too long. I was a little disappointed! It starts off strongly but eventually it drags on and on and on until you desperately want it to finish! The plot is very complex: Peter is getting engaged to Mary-Jane, a escaped convict gets turns into a monster, Harry still wants revenge for his father's death and a little black, alien goo turns Peter bad! I'm not saying this is a bad movie, I just lasted 30 minutes too long. I also thought Peter was being too mean to Mary-Jane after she was trying to help him but he was under a curse. I thought the second sequel wasn't going the same way as the first two. I was pleased that Stan Lee, the original creator of Spiderman made a cameo appearance as a bystander talking to Peter, it will be a sad day on earth when this guy dies, I tell you! This movie isn't bad but I prefer the first two. Good but no cigar I'm afraid this time, Spidey! <br/><br/>7/10"

","The third in the popular Spider-Man trilogy suffers from the law of diminishing returns. The universe introduced and expanded upon in the first two movies is not as fully fleshed out, nor are the characters (old and new) that we meet throughout the story.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is about to propose to his life-long love Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but, as his alter-ego Spider-Man, has to first contend with three villains: his best mate Harry Osborn (James Franco) has assumed the identity of the New Goblin in an attempt to avenge his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man; his uncle's killer Flint Markoff (Thomas Haden Church) is on the loose, and after a bizarre genetic accident is transformed into the terrifying Sandman; plus a strange otherworldly toxic substance that takes over Peter's Spider-suit and brings out his darker side. As Peter Parker, he must compete with a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) as well as Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a supermodel who fights it out with Mary-Jane for his affections...<br/><br/>The over-loading of characters into the plot means none of them are explored in any great depth. This is a bizarre anomaly given the length of the picture, which clocks in at well over two hours. This means the movie is far, far too long and the audience I saw it with with almost certainly getting bored with many actually leaving the cinema before the picture had finished.<br/><br/>That said the action sequences are exciting enough and the humour, for the most part, is well judged (I would, however, have edited out that irritating British female reporter at the climax). The best action scenes see a fight between Spider-Man and Sandman in the sewers of New York City, Spider-Man's rescue of Gwen from falling off a building, and the climax set in a high-rise construction site.<br/><br/>Maguire fares well enough as Spider-Man but there is little more he or Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane can do with their roles. Franco seems to enjoy himself as his character comes full circle and the ever-delightful J.K Simmons provides much of the laughs as J.Jonah Jameson. Willem Dafoe makes a brief but terrifying return as Norman Osborn, but none of the other actors are given a proper chance to develop their roles and their presence, as a result, is somewhat flat.<br/><br/>After watching this well-intentioned but inevitable tired effort, I couldn't believe that Sony are already commissioning three more Spider-Man movies. There is certainly a market for them, judging from the box office, but I wouldn't bank on any of them being an improvement on what's gone before."

","This probably the worst of the three Spiderman movies made thus far. It seems that the writers and the producers were rushed to finalize this film.<br/><br/>The plot line was disjointed at times and led up to a climax that exploded into an over-dramatic cliché. The screenplay offered awkward and cheesy conversations along with disappointing humor. The plot pushed too many conflicts into one story.<br/><br/>Now, don't take this bleak view of the movie too seriously. It was entertaining to watch and a great movie for children. The special effects were amazing. I just admire good plots with interesting story lines which was absent from this film."

","I am a little surprised with people who take the view that Rami has destroyed the franchise or that he does not take into consideration what the fans want. I say thank God Rami directed this series in the first place. Imagine if Joel ""Batman & Robin Schumacher was at the helm. Rami's camera style is made for Spiderman. And without him, we would not have gotten 3 great cameos by Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>Still, the movie suffers from a plot line that shoots up and down faster than one of those bobbing bird things. I think if it had continuously escalated until the final confrontation, it would have been much better. For example, how many times did Harry die in the film? First in the alleyalright he made itthen when the grenade went off by his headalright he made itthen finally in the end. Chances are in part 4 he will rise from the grave once more. The same went for the Sandman. He was a threatthen he was gonethen he was backthen he decided to move to a beach some where and be nice.<br/><br/>If this film was a little tighter, it would have been just as good as the first two.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though, it was still way better than most of the crap released these days. I hope Rami signs on for part 4. Rumor has it that The Lizard and Carnage will make their appearance. I am all about that!"

","This Spiderman was just not in the same league as the others, halfway through the film I had to just laugh at how poor I found some of it. The script was the worst yet with some outrageously cheesy and unnecessary lines. For about 20 minutes in the film Peter Parker went on some sort of libido crazy trip where he acted like an awful John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, I could do nothing but shake my head at this disastrous tangent the movie went on. The bit that just took the biscuit for me though was where Peter turned evil and symbolised that by straightening his hair and becoming an emo boy?! With Excess CGI, far too many villains and a really awful script, this record making movie does not deserve to follow its much more credible predecessors."
"steaderjshuntz","5","1","2","7 May 2007"," Pretty good, but too long and a little sloppy
","I was a little nervous to see spider-man 3 when it first came out because I heard it was around 2 hours and 20 minutes. I am one fan who believes that Hollywood is getting lazy by not limiting themselves to to movies that are 1-2 hours long (perferably somewhere in the middle). In result these movies have scenes that are too long and less polished. My fears were correct for Spider-man 3. There were scenes that lingered on for a while. I don't understand why the camera needs to rotate around Peter Parker's face when he is questioning his life. This takes too long. There were a lot of scenes that were necessary in building the story and mood, but there was too much story. Too many villains. Too much stuff going on. A good deal of the audience left the theater before the movie was over.<br/><br/>There was also one scene where the police were looking for the sandman, but the camera was so jerky that it was hard for me to focus on what was going on.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs to stop making movies over two hours long. At least this should be rare. This should not be the new standard. I understand that some movies have are tightly made that last this long.<br/><br/>The final fight scene was good, the peter parker Mary Jane stuff was good."

It isn't pretty.<br/><br/>It is a tedious re-hash of the previous Spiderman movies, which were both fun, energetic outings. Yet where the first two had a great sense of joy, ""3"" is labored. Where the others had one evil-doer, we've got three (for most of the film). In '3', we have more fight scenes. More Mary Jane in peril. More Aunt May moping about Unclue Ben! (He's been dead for years now...get over it already!!) More! More! More! Unfortunately, it has more tedium. I can't imagine ever wanting to see this film again. Once is more than enough for ""3""!"

MJ and Peter with Gwen Stacy didn't work well at all together. this film had high expectations, but ultimately was a massive let down. if there is a spidey 4, please, please please don't let Sam raimi direct and spoil an amazing franchise further!"
"vincent_lau2003","7","1","2","7 May 2007"," The Greatest Battle Lies..within?
","Well the tagline says the greatest battle lies within. Whose inner battle? Spiderman? He had 10 minutes of struggle with the dark powers of the black suit. How dark had he become? An emo guy dancing like a clown in the streets. Maybe it is referring to the inner battle of Harry? Harry never trusted his friends yet trusted his butler. The butler didn't explained his father's death earlier. Why? Also, if the wounds were caused by his own blades, it doesn't mean he killed himself. Harry died from his own blades but he wasn't killing himself! Furthermore, I cannot understand why he trusted his butler's few words more than the repeated explanations of his friends. I don't see how his internal self struggles, as Raimi didn't put enough movie time on this. Sandman's inner struggle is also poorly portrayed due to the same reason.<br/><br/>There are many scenes that are so cheesy I laughed. Anyway I got a point I don't understand. Why can't anyone see the real face of Spiderman? He often had his mask off (first fight with goblin, also last fight where his mask is ripped off). Even MJ was captured on screen when she was trapped up there in the taxi, why can't the face of Spiderman be caught on film? The good things about this movie is the CGI. The CGI for those sand scenes are perfectly done. This movie is good for kids who loved superheroes saving the day and kicking the a**es of villains.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is just plain average. Given its hype and budget, I would say it is a disaster. Spiderman fans should find some time to see it though, it wraps up some of the loose ends of Spiderman 1 and 2.<br/><br/>65/10"
"Undertow69","7","1","2","7 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 Review
","The third and what appears to be the last installment of the series is somewhat disappointing. It is no secret that the vision of Sam Raimi for the Spider-Man franchise is that of a love story, but to continue milking the whole ""star cross lovers"" angle up to a third movie, got old really fast. The way that this film was conceived was to sum up the previous two so there is bound to be unresolved issues. But to continue picking at that particular scar in the life of Peter Parker shows lackluster by the creating team. Spider-Man notoriety as a bad luck magnet is well established in the comics and there is a ton of problems that have a negative effect in the life of Peter to choose from, aside from women problems. Without giving too much away here is a little dissection of the film.<br/><br/>Performances Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker I was hopping to see a more evolved version of Spidey comic-wise. More wisecracks and less mopping around. And we do get to see a little bit of that but nothing alike the comics.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson We see her character devolve more into a redhead version of Kristen Dunst and we definitely see less of Mary Jane Watson in her performance.<br/><br/>James Franco as New Goblin/Harry Osborn This guy stole the show. Swinging back and forth between Peter's best friend and a homicidal maniac out for Pete's throat, he easily gave the best performance of the movie. I would have loved to see the costume department come up with a better version of the Goblin costume though.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko Not so different from the comic book version. Thomas Haden Church delivered a solid performance.<br/><br/>Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock A very good portrayal of Edward Brock Jr. and a lame version of Venom. 'Nuff said! The rest of the performances were OK. Bryce Dallas as Gwen Stacy sold her character fairly well. As always Rosemary Harris (May Parker) did an excellent job and so did J.K. Simmons as crazy J. Jonah Jameson. There was nothing special about James Cromwell performance as Captain Stacy and Dylan Baker didn't brought nothing new to the table while continuing his role as Dr. Curt Connors. As expected Bill Nunn (Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson) Bruce Campbell (as the Maître d') and Elizabeth Banks (Miss Brant) deliver the goods in their respective roles. The extras in the movie could have done a better job selling their reaction to the surroundings. The kids in the movie did a better job than the adults."

","Wow what a pile of rubbish. The first 2 spiderman films were excellent, decent story, character development and big underlying messages throughout. Spiderman 3 is a mess. simple. from start to finish it eeks of an exceptionally bad chick-flick. Cheesy as anything, from dodgy jazz club dancing to exceptionally bad news reporter coverage. The battle scenes are really really poor also, completely unable to see anything thats happening apart from the fight between goblin and spiderman as them both in human form which is actually a good fight sequence.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to the sandman and on the whole he is the best character in the film exceptionally well acted and he was the only one that had some remote storyline tagged in there. One thing i didn't like was his big form. Obviously Spiderman is a comic but the whole point of the films is that its remotely believable - something that kinda gets lost when you have a 20 story monster in it!<br/><br/>Venom = waste of time. <br/><br/>To sum it up the film had far to many story lines and none of the worked. Its only saving graces were the parker vs green goblin apartment scene, the fit model and some decent scripting for the sandman. the rest quite frankly was exceptionally poor."
"JPaulokla2","6","1","2","7 May 2007"," Go ahead and see it
","I must say I was disappointed in the path the director chose for Spiderman 3. If, like me and my group of friends, you are a fan of the comic series, you will be too. <br/><br/>1) Sandman is supposed to be sick and twisted, not a misunderstood man, down on his luck, trying to do something good, but going about it the wrong way. 2) Venom is the greatest threat to Spiderman, more than any other villain, because he can do everything Spiderman can do, but Spidey's spider sense doesn't work with Venom (and it is pure evil and cannot be killed with anything smaller than a fuel-air bomb). I'm not even going to say what he did with Harry, it is simply outrageous.<br/><br/>I think the director spent too much time playing therapist, trying to give Spiderman some closure, resolving his issues. Spiderman is a superhero. As such, he is a tragic figure, like all super heroes. They don't get closure, but they fight on despite their deep inner turmoil, that is what makes a super hero heroic. So go ahead and see Spiderman in theaters, the DVD won't be worth the money."
"killpuppy","7","1","2","7 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 seems to hit a new area of the franchise, maybe one thats ends nicely and shouldn't be over done.
","Starting shortly after where Spiderman II left off, Spiderman 3 opens very quickly with little origin space for any of the main characters. We see where Mary Jane goes with acting career, and how Harry Osborne feels about Peter Parker, but we see very little of Peter Parker's status or personality.<br/><br/>Very quickly into the movie we are able to see the origin of the Sandman, and we see a very quick origin of Venom later on. But I feel both are very shallowly explained and just ""seem to happen"" without notice or enough pre-tense. For example the origin of the Sandman is displayed but not specifically told. The origin of Venom seems very like so even though it is easier to understand.<br/><br/>How Peter Parker becomes the ""black suited"" Spiderman is very shallow as well, another instance of a ""just happened"" kind of origin. The black suit origin is the hardest to understand of all characters in the movie even though it is supposed to possibly be the main aspect of the movie and the it's characters.<br/><br/>After Peter Parker / Spiderman comes into bonding with the black suit, his ""real life"" personality goes to hell. He becomes selfish, greedy, hateful, and seeks revenge all as side effects of the black suit which wrecks havoc upon all that is good about him and all good in his life, including Mary Jane. With enough conflict he decides that he does have to shed himself of this personality and does so with success.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a rival seems to pick up this personality and wears it worse than Peter Parker himself. Of course this brings major conflict to the movie as we are finally introduced to Venom so that we can enjoy him for possibly 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The ending is extremely sad as the unexpected does occur. Maybe I even shed a tear.<br/><br/>The acting of this episode is very mediocre compared to the greatness of the first two film in the installment. The directing and story telling is at a even worse level. The fx are spectacular of course.<br/><br/>Feel free to comment @ http://caseyandrews.wordpress.com/2007/05/07/spiderman-3-my-view/"
"mattfried","7","1","2","6 May 2007"," Well, there's one in every franchise....
","SPIDER-MAN 3 spars no major expense in flexing muscle: bigger villains, more action, longer storyline. Let it be said that it rarely fails in the areas where'd you want the best - this film features the best fight scenes out of the three film in the Spidey franchise. What we're left with in between is a somewhat smooth, somewhat disjointed mismash.<br/><br/>We finally reach the heart of darkness in the Peter Parker saga: as New York embraces the web-slinger to the same degree of the Yankees and ridiculous living expenses, Parker buys the hype and allows a vulnerable Mary Jane Watson to slip through his fingers and into the arms of the misguided Harry Osborn, reborn at New Goblin and bent on revenge towards Spider-Man/Peter. As the hubris begins to pile-up, Peter is greeted by an alien symbiont that gives him a new black suit, better strength, and a big anger management issue. Add to the mix Eddie Brock, an opportunistic leech photojournalist turned Venom; The Sandman re- imagined as Uncle Ben's killer; and Gwen Stacy, Stan Lee's personification of tragic love, also re-imagined as one part smoking model and another part romantic foil, and you have a veritable comic geek smörgåsbord... and a filmmaker's headache.<br/><br/>Does 3 deliver when it needs to? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Is too self-serious? Unfortunately, yes. Sam Raimi has made it no secret that he prefers Golden Age Spider-Man to the darker elements that developed as the comic's material matured in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. There are parts in this film where he tries too hard to grapple material that he's obviously uncomfortable with, and other parts where he seemed to give up. To his credit, when the film soars, it is still endeared with the warmth and everyman appeal that made SPIDER-MAN and SPIDER-MAN 2 big hits. But you can also tell he feels a bit in over his head. Instead of letting us get lost in the film's dark theatrics, he seems reserved and would rather only let us dip our toes in - trying to assure us that everything will be okay in the end. The story's third act especially has a few awkward transitions (Aunt May's deus ex machina appearance at Peter's apartment, anyone?) and there're parts of the screenplay where I found myself saying ""THAT'S the best they can do?"" By the end, there's a feeling of being bludgeoned with sentimentality where the two previous films would've just trusted to subtlety.<br/><br/>But it would be unfair to say that this is all Raimi's fault - the film is still enjoyable. Bruce Campbell, Raimi's patron saint of all things tongue-in-cheek, is hilarious in his cameo, the developing tension between Peter and Eddie is seething, and the eventual explosion of Peter and Harry's friendship is tragic, pounding, and really what the story's all about: giving into a dark side for personal gain. What is off-putting is watching Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst hit the wall. Maguire has made a career out of low-key character portrayals that carry a lot of emotional baggage... so why, at the first sign of big trouble, does he reduce Peter to a blubbering wimp on a foot bridge in Central Park? There are many moments, like this one, where you know Maguire can do better. Plus, watching him dance in the film (yes, DANCE) must've gotten Bob Fosse's corpse spinning a couple of revolutions six feet under. Dunst, who's already made MJ into a strong-willed survivalist, seems content to confine her character to a two-dimensional archetype instead of letting us see what's really bothering her: a world without Peter Parker means a world without anyone to save her from herself. <br/><br/>The ante up of three villains versus one is clear: they present character parallels for Peter, but the script seems so one-sided towards a character study rather than a superhero movie, that we're left feeling a little robbed and unconcerned for Venom and Sandman- which is a shame because Topher Grace is a casting director's dream as Brock/Venom. Thomas Haden Church's Sandman seems to only show-up when he needs to. His own story takes minor note and as we get to the end, you hope he can at least go out on a high note - a consolation prize for being a decent plot device. The addition of Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard doing her best to find footing somewhere) is also troublesome: she's a straight-A physics major with the hots for Peter, who also freelance models while her dad is Chief of the NYPD... wasn't MJ the glam girlfriend and Gwen was the down-to-earth girl next door? Where the script wants her to compete for Peter's affections, she's left to be swept off her feet and then quickly removed to refocus on the Peter-MJ issue.<br/><br/>All in all, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't terrible. By the film's end, you are left to wonder where Peter, MJ, and Harry will go to now that all hell has broken loose. The issue really remains with a production team that has maybe run it's course. Though you'd like a little more out of 3, I think it's safe to say Spidey isn't done for yet."

","I have to admit, I like the spider-man movies. The first one was the best, as most first installments are. The second was just a big disappointment in my mind. Then, we're faced with an over publicized, over hyped third movie. I was expecting it to be amazing, since they made it sound like THE movie of the year. And, humble movie goers, what is my final verdict? I'd rank it somewhere between a good and a so-so. The Peter/Harry fight was intense, enough to give me a migraine in fact. But, with a good cast, this movie offers some more than mediocre acting scenes. Peter's evil side is what bothered me most. He seems mostly vengeful, and then you've got him prancing down the street in a silk suit? And what, may I ask, was that jazz club scene all about? It's just about enough to make a spidey loving fan pack up and go home! But then, all redeems itself with a kick butt final battle scene! Where Spidey goes seemingly alone into a web of venom's crazy goo, and starts kicking some Eddie Brock tail! The sandman jumps in, and all hope seems lost, when (gasp!) Harry Osborn forgives and forgets and sacrifices his life for Spidey and MJ. Ooooh, what a good ending...not. What seems like the end of a very respectable movie evolves into a funeral scene, with a short and very predictable monologue from Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and then the movie seems like it's done, but then cuts to yet another scene. Where MJ is singing at the jazz club (goodbye to love? Yeah right!) and Peter comes in and takes her hand. Then it's over. I think that movie had the most tiring ending ever."

","The Spider-Man films have been amongst the better of the flood of super-hero movies to come out of the US after 9/11. Peter Parker was always a refreshing, nerdy take on the super-hero, and decent characters combined with lovely effects, art-direction, lovable cast, and dialog made the first movie great, the second a bit less so.<br/><br/>Sadly, the third installment of Spider-Man fails to impress as much as it's predecessors. Here, we meet a new and interesting Parker and company, but it somehow feels constructed. The characters reasoning becomes clichés, uninspiring and hard to relate to. There are also allot of new faces in this movie. Whether it's setting the stage for a follow-up, or just a means to trying to top the previous movies, they simply become to many in too little time, making the movie in some ways resembling Parker's own way of swinging through the city from action to action.<br/><br/>Probably, there will be a director's cut of this movies at some point, and if it adds another 30-40 minutes of film allowing us to get to know the characters better, Spider-Man 3 might as well score as high as eight. But for now however, with all it's swinging about, it's a six."

","After the greatness that was Spiderman 2, I was really looking forward to S3 but was sadly disappointed. I know, I know; it's a comic book movie not some deep For Your Oscar Consideration fare. But actually, that's the one of the main problems. I mean, I'm all for character development but let's face it; you don't go into a Spiderman movie to focus on the emotional struggle of the protagonist's inner demons. At 139 minutes, this was definitely WAY longer than it needed to be. Sam Raimi tried to cover too much material and ended up making the movie bloated where it didn't need to be at the sacrifice of the real attractions (i.e. the action scenes). Peter Parker has a repressed dark side, yeah we get it. Can we get a move on? Venom was one of the key attractions of this movie and he ended up being on screen for all of 10 minutes. And what's the deal with Sandman? One moment he wants to kill Spiderman and then minutes later he's standing there apologizing and acting all ""oh, I'm not a bad guy, I just do bad things because I have to."" If he wanted to make Sandman a complex character, Raimi should have focused more on him instead of wasting all that time on Peter Parker going Dark. And it's not just Sandman; lots of other issues magically resolved themselves without any good reason. Harry suddenly forgives Peter (just based on the speech by the butler?) and MJ sudden forgets all her problems at the end and goes back with Peter. Why spend all that time throughout the movie setting up these issues between Peter and MJ only to dismiss them at the end? Again, instead of wasting the time on the drama, I'd rather have seen more action.<br/><br/>Plus, what was the deal with that Jazz Club scene? Raimi must be a big Jim Carrey fan because that entire thing was just a cheap imitation of ""The Mask."" And the silly hand waving gag in the French restaurant? Really out of sync with the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and one minor niggle. At the beginning of the movie, we learn that NY loves Spiderman and Peter Parker is doing well all around (happy with MJ, doing great at school). So what changed between S2 and S3? In S2, being Spiderman prevented Peter from doing his normal life routine so much that he had to quit the superhero business. But somehow between S2 and S3 he finds some magical solution that lets him go to school, date MJ and still fight crime? Some explanation would have been nice.<br/><br/>Look, as entertainment I guess it's an acceptable entry but trust me, if you're a fan of the series and you want to keep a good memory, just leave it with Spiderman 2 and pretend this one never happened.<br/><br/>7/10 (actually more like 6/10 but I gave the extra point out of respect for the entire Trilogy)"
"judywalker2","3","1","2","6 May 2007"," Poor Jesus and James
","Both Jesus and James Brown are turning over, where ever they are. Both are missed used in this poor excuse for an enjoyable movie. I guess I should admit upfront that I didn't really care for any of the previous Spidey movies. I just can't get into Tobey as Spidey and the really nerdy behavior the writer made up for him. I prefer the comic book Spidey, no super smooth hero, but no nerd either. The Mary Jane character just continues to get on my nerves. These are the two most dysfunctional people on the planet. Raimi is good at comic relief, he should have inserted alittle more and I would have liked the film better (I missed his wife, Lucy Lawless. He should have given her a cameo, too). The special effects were okay but if you've seen one computer generated scene you've seen them all. The villains, of course are exceedingly more interesting than our hero or his whiny girl friend. And on another more serious note, there were a lot of little kids in our theater and they were in a word bored. The violence was way too much for them, the parents should have screened it first. The fight scenes were in fact on necessarily violent. I wondered after this movie was over whether or not Raimi realized how ridiculous his premise was, so its okay for Spidey by his actions allowing people to die but its not okay for villains to kill people. I know that there are a lot of people in prison today who wish they could just say they were sorry and get out, maybe we should start a movement in this country. If you're poor and steal or kill, which is about 80-90% of AA men in prison, if you say you're sorry we'll let you out to be with your daughter too. I like that Raimi but you should have used a black guy."
"green_is_the_new_green","7","1","2","6 May 2007"," Classic Raimi
","What people don't seem to realize about this movie, is that its a B-movie masquerading as a giant Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>I, for one, freakin loved it. I hated the first two. They were cliché, over-acted, and tried to make me care, but I couldn't. It seems Sam Raimi had a wake-up call while writing this script... ""Wait a second... I did Evil Dead.... and that's what I'm good at.... F*** America."" And so began the epic saga/ movie soup/ laugh-fest that is Spidey 3. Bruce Campbell is a genius, and no one in this film can act. It's kind of great how retarded all of the actors and actresses come off as, except for Campbell, the newspaper editor, and Sandman.<br/><br/>Conversely, I thought the Venom element was well done in how the physical paralleled the psychological. Only Raimi could have done this so well. I was actually surprised at how deep and dark this was, and how it worked on so many levels.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing else worked, and it was stellar."
"chickey89","2","1","2","6 May 2007"," One of the worst movies I've seen in last years
","Well, where should I begin? This movie is just too awful to fit it all in one comment. First of all it isn't an action movie, it's a soap opera with heroes! And so cheesy that it hurts. Where are the action scenes? Where is the adrenalin in my veins while staring at the screen? Where is the ""Woah...Oh my god!""? Nothing there, just 5 minutes of fights (with really excellent special effects) and 135 minutes of boredom. But besides the boredom, it was a very funny movie, although unintentionally. I don't know what came to their minds, when the styled the ""new"" Peter. When he first appeared in his ""evil"" look the whole cinema was shooting ""EMO!"" and laughed out loudly. Even tough he looked like an emp, I liked him much better in that state than when he was the little photographer-sissy again. It was the first time he reacted like a normal person to all the humiliation he had to endure. And then there was this disco-part: MJ and Harry dance in the kitchen, Peter walks down the street dancing, then buys a new suit - still dancing. What was that all about? It was just awful. It's like the director started drinking while shooting this movie and then betted his crew whether he would dare to make a romantic dance-movie out of Spiderman or not. But what really made me throw up where those two ""Oh, we need to change the plot quickly, because we have no idea how the movie should go on.""-moments. Firstly they convulsively try to create a relation between sandman and Peter (""Oh, it was the wrong guyblablabla"" Any 7 year old could have written that script.) and then this nonsense with the butler at the end. Why didn't he tell Harry the truth? Just five simple word  ""He did not do it""  and Harry would not have been trying to kill his best friend for years. <br/><br/>This movie was illogical rubbish and I want my money back!"

","Look all I need to say is Spider Man 3 is a comic book movie So I really don't know where all this hate is coming from I'm a huge fan of the comics and I found this to be an entertaining film with some flawed dramatic moments. I remember when Pirates of the Caribbean 2 Dead Mans Chest came out and there was so much hate directed toward that movie because people felt that it wasn't faithful to the first one. Listen I read the comment box and it gets me angry when people just give the movie a 1 out of 10 out of anger of it not coming out the way they wanted too. 1 out of 10 is Bloodrayne status man , 1 out of 10 is Alone in the Dark or Son of the Mask, 1 out of 10 could even be Steel, but it's not Spider Man 3 and I refuse to put this film in that type of company. The action sequences were spectacular, The Drama was...Days of our Lives and I do agree to a certain extent with some of you who hated the dramatic elements and found it cheesy but that doesn't warrant 9 points being subtracted because of that. Does not deserve the 1 out of 10s its getting."

","Seriously hasn't anyone noticed that Marvel suffers from the Trilogy Curse yet? X-men 1 - good, X2- Great, X3 - AWFUL Blade 1 - good, Blade 2- Great, Blade Trinity - TERRIBLE! Im hoping that Fantastic four is going backwards and they got the worst out of the way cause if they mess up the Silver Surfer Im gonna be so disappointed. But seriously Venom being killed by a Pumpkin Bomb? Spider-man 3 was atrocious, MJs part did nothing but insult the audience with her false attempts at emotion that just came off as annoying throughout. Emo hair isn't dark either, its LAMMMMME. And as for the Dance scene the whole time I couldn't stop thinking of The Mask or that episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with the dancing Demon which are fine in their own type of show but just throwing it into Spider-man made no sense. Venom who was supposed to be Spider-mans most unrelenting and dangerous villain had about a grand total of 10min screen time and no build up. This movie was thoroughly disappointing and and why did they even introduce Gwen Stacey just to NOT have her killed by the green goblin. It would have had much more impact if they focused on Harry Osbourne as the new Green Goblin and Venom right from the get go. You know....instead of just throwing some generic battle scenes in and 0 story. (also they could have at least checked out the comics a BIT before trying to throw a venom storyline together)"

","First of all i would just like to say that i am not the biggest spider-man fan in the world. the only thing that attracted me to the movie was spider-man 2, and i must say that i loved that movie. However, spider-man 3 was disappointing. never mind what the critics say, i felt that this movie was probably more of a comedy rather than actions. the only thing that was original in this movie was the characters, and their names.

","I expected so much out of this movie with them having one of the baddest villains in Marvel Comics. Venom was the size of Carnage except in a black costume. Eddie Brock is not suppose to have fangs either. Sand is suppose to flow not float. Good job on Sandman though. The continuity with this movie (actually all three) with the comic book is way off. Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's girlfriend and killed by the Goblin over a bridge when his glider struck her knocking her off the bridge with Spider-Man saving her before she crashed. The first movie was close but with those differences and nobody getting killed. This movie was more about Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. An action movie turned into a chick flick. The end scene really shocked me!! No Spider-Man swinging through the city like at the end of the two previous movies!!! There should not be a 4th movie just like there should not be a 4th X-Men movie!!!"

And this one wants to display the strength of the movie. Every human being be it normal human or superhero has to face certain things in his life. And this movies showcases some of them if not all. :) I like the part where Peter speaks about the Choices one can have in life. Fight scenes are brilliantly depicted and shot. The love tension between the lead pair is perfectly handled. The scene of bridge was little exaggerated. I like the movie and it is worth a watch with all those CGIs and emotions packed in it.

"ShiningWonder","6","1","2","6 May 2007"," Was this really 'Spider-Man 3'
","Really, this movie was horrible and not to think I waited three years for it. Although, the action and CGI were good, but not enough. The story is the one that counts and I must say it was meaningless.<br/><br/>There were so many flaws in this movie that it seems like a completely different franchise compared to 'Spider-Man' and 'Spider-Man 2'. It was really painful to watch all things go into the toilet and sitting there, with no escape, witnessing the horror that brought this franchise to hell.<br/><br/>This movie was really cheesy.<br/><br/>Every scene popped out of nowhere and expects us to know what is going on? Really though, so many gaps, so many flaws, and this franchise is suffering right now and I'm preying that this movie was all just a big joke to laugh at and they'll show the real 'Spider-Man 3' on July 4th competing with 'Transformers'. I really doubt that's happening, but I'm still preying because the only way this franchise is saved is:<br/><br/>1) They fix up 'Spider-Man 3' as much as they can to let people know that this is the real movie in the franchise from what 'Spider-Man' and 'Spider-Man 2' brought.<br/><br/>2) They make 'Spider-Man 4' spectacular with great drama, great action, and a really mind-blowing story that'll make us all forget the tragedy 'Spider-Man 3' gave us."
"shotdownonbroadway","5","1","2","6 May 2007"," Not living up to the hype.
","Of all the story-lines that work perfectly with that of Venom and the Symbiont, Sandman had to have been one of the worst choices. The reasoning behind choosing that villain? I'm not quite sure. He didn't really add anything new to the story, besides deciding that he was actually the real killer of Ben Parker. <br/><br/>Although very enjoyable to the eyes, this movie lacked a lot of punch. It seemed to be the same recycled scenarios all over again. Some normal person gets involved in some accident and causes them to become a super villain. Check. Peter Parker trying to exact revenge on the man who killed his uncle: Check. Peter Parker trying to convince Harry that he did not kill Norman Osbourne: Check. Some catastrophe with falling objects about to land on people: Check. Mary Jane, Peter Parker, and Harry Osbourne love triangle: Check. Mary Jane and Peter Parker's love on the rocks: Check. Mary Jane struggling to make a name for herself: Check The movie climax being spiderman trying to rescue Mary Jane from some device or contraption: Check.<br/><br/>I think that this movie could have done a lot more with it's budget. For example, one of the main reasons I decided to go to the movie was the idea behind the Space Shuttle crashing into the George Washington Bridge. Alas, this never happened and they had decided to go with a much more half-assed approach of a tiny asteroid crashing. Even Venom was a let down. The main reason why he was such an amazing bad guy was because he knew how to really get under spiderman's skin. He was so full of hate and vengeance that he did everything in his power to destroy Spiderman and Peter Parker. He got right under spiderman's skin. He called himself a poison to Spiderman, which is why Eddie Brock and the Symbiont nicknamed themselves Venom. There was however, a lot of cool effects and stunts preformed in the movie. This kept it entertaining, but like I had previously mentioned... the budget could have been used better in places. <br/><br/>For the record, lose the dance scenes, lose the emo hair, lose sandman and an unnecessary storyline. Add more venom, add more character development to venom, hit us with stuff we have never seen before (ie. the shuttle crash), and DEFINITELY keep Bruce Campbell. Besides that, the movie was entertaining but I do have to rank it the worst in the series so far. It did not live up to it's budget, nor it's hype."

","First part was actually good, it was easy to watch, it was nice movie, not just because of Kirsten Dunst / Spider-Man kiss scene.<br/><br/>Second one was long and somewhat boring. When I saw it once, I don't have desire to see it again.<br/><br/>Third part... After one hour of the movie, I was already bored with it and couldn't wait for it to finish, although movie didn't really started yet. One more hour of some action, just for the sake of the action, and many computer effects, just for computer effects' sake. Audience was laughing ironically. Bunch of forgiving and crying... The scene with Spider-Man and M.J. crying over Harry Osborne while the dawn is breaking might be sad scene with Peter's friend/enemy/friend being killed, might be sad scene, but everyone was laughing. And then when everyone thought it was over, and relieved, as they can leave cinema at last, few more scenes were there. Will this movie ever be over? And, finally when we saw closing credits, audience gave the movie big applause and some more laughing.<br/><br/>And the story... In this movie we see bad Spider-Man. A bit of Superman again, who also was little bad in the third part.<br/><br/>Maybe it's good to give Nolan a chance to fix this movie series too."

","Spidey 1 was good, Spidey 2 was better, Spidey 3 is a clear cut case of getting your money out of your pocket. I had high expectations and they proved to be too high. First the movie lacked any emotions like the first two. The special effects were sometimes good, I say sometimes good, most times they were bad and added nothing new(what have they done with the big bucks). There were better special effects in the 2 minute trailer for Pirates 3 than in this movie. And these movies normally get you excited because of the special effects. The dialogue was also cheesy and there was just to much going on and sometimes nothing was going on but fake emotions and romance........... And in the first 2 installments I could ignore Kirsten Dunst but why on earth did they choose her to be Spiderman's lover. So go an see it if you just have to see it but don't be surprised if you're not surprised at all."
"howaboutthisforatitle","3","1","2","6 May 2007"," 3 greats stories mixed together into one becomes a lesser story...
","*** Spoilers ahead *** To be quite honest I went into the movie knowing I was going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>When the movie first starts off it has a rushed feel too it. Too fast of a pace for the story the are trying to tell. The pace its put at basically tells the story as thus: Peter Parker gone Emo.<br/><br/>I loved the first two films, great writing, lots of character development, lots of plot development. Hell, even Peters secret crush that only the people who know him best, knows about is used in the plot. In the second one its a struggle to really discover who he is, and create a balance of characters between spidey and peter parker, while dealing with the holding the secret of a dying mans last wish causing a rift between himself and his best friend, trying to tell the woman he loves how he feels, and trying to come to grips with who he is.<br/><br/>Thats why everyone loved the first two movies. Not because of the action sequence, not because of the nerd getting the girl he loves, but because of the fact that spider-man symbolizes every person. He's the hero we all want to be, and the people we are in a day to day basis. He is our Ego and SuperEgo as Freud would put it.<br/><br/>This movie ignores that formula entirely. The introduction of the symbiont is a great idea to introduce Peter's Id, show his base desires which it feeds off of, and wrapping up the goblin saga is a great way to display that. To have peter go so far as to disfigure his once best friend, and then turn around and ask him, the new goblin who has inflicted so much pain in his life for help? come on. Facing the facts: Flint Marko should have been saved for a later film.<br/><br/>To be quite honest, this is what happens when you merge three stories of equal length into one.. you get a ton of decent crap. Decent none the less, but also crap. Between so many holes in the storyline, and so many flaws and so much fan disappointment, Thats what this movie is. You should seriously consider whether or not a few decent fight scenes and watching peter act like a complete ass for about 45 minutes is worth your 10 bucks when you see this movie.<br/><br/>Hopefully there will be a directors cut when the DVD is released."

I enjoyed watching this movie similar to riding a roller coaster, you are not sorry you did it, but you are not sure you would do it more then once.<br/><br/>Now, let me add that as a girl who happens to action films, the fight scenes were amazing. The only parts that got to be a bit tedious were some of the interactions between the characters. Some of these scenes were necessary, some were not.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty top notch, the special effects were fabulous.<br/><br/>For me the worse part was the senseless way to end it- If you have seen it you know what I am talking about. I saw strong potential for a storyline that could have gone somewhere...But never mind. Watch the movie, just come to the theater expecting what you'll get- a bit of sappy romance, a bit of corny lines, some great action fight scenes...and you wont be sorry"
"tomrito","9","1","2","5 May 2007"," Great movie but why the SAPPY ending?
","This was a really good film. The story line was so good that it had me completely engrossed for the whole time, up to the last 10 minutes when it turned a little too sappy for me. This was more of a thinking man's film then the other two and you really had to follow the story to feel what was going on inside all of the main characters. Also, once again JK Simmons's JJ Jameson was the truest to the comics but everyone was great. Eddie Brock was the perfect anti-Parker Venom, Thomas Haden Church was brilliant as the Sandman. These two are real good actors and they brought a life to their characters that was missing in the last two films. Kirsten Dunst and Bryce Howard played off each other very well and made it believable and Tobey Maguire had so much fun playing the dark side that I think they should bring back Black Spidey for the next movie. It had everything you could ask for, the best action by far, the most Spidey humor which is more like the comics, great acting and an over-packed story line that I loved. They could have easily made two or three movies, sort of like a ""LOR"". I have to agree with ""LennyRenquist"" another writer here and it is worth repeating when he said; ""the sequence in which Peter turns into the ""lamest bad-boy in historyand the looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless"". All of this made the movie the most entertaining of the three by far, so it is a wonder to me why Mr. Raimi felt the need to make the ending so SAPPY. This was not Gone with the Wind, the audience was looking for a great Spiderman ending so they could all jump up and cheer. What they got made them sit in silence looking at the credits. Maybe he can re-tool the ending to make this the great movie it should have been."

","Spiderman 3 returns with Toby McGuire as Peter Parker alias spider man but it has a new twist, his suit turns black because... see the movie for that and you will know! <br/><br/>It also as Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, who is Peter's girlfriend and three new villains, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, James Frasco as the new green goblin and Topher Grace as venom. It also has Peter Parker's aunt.<br/><br/>In this movie, more of romance is shown than the previous parts. It concentrates more on Peter-Mary Jane relationship. And the director, Sam Raimi has made a mistake in showing this.<br/><br/>In the first part, almost 3/4th of the movie focuses on their relationship which sags the story a bit. Instead of this, Sam could have balanced the whole story, which he didn't do.<br/><br/>Sam could have shown a scene between them and then a fight for sometime then another romantic scene after a while so that the audience didn't get bugged.<br/><br/>Instead of this, he focused mainly on their relationship. This made the film feel as if it were very long. So, I feel that next time, the film should be balanced.<br/><br/>Also, in the end of the film, Spiderman doesn't fight mostly against the villains. It is the new green goblin who does the main job of fighting the villains. Sam could have shown both of them defeating the villains in an equal way.<br/><br/>Toby acted well, but looked clumsy in the emotional scene where he had to cry. Kirsten really dulled the atmosphere as she looked a bit haggard looking. James kept smiling and that bored me. Thomas did a really nice job while Topher acted okay as his acting seemed a bit artificial.<br/><br/>Rosemary Harris, who portrayed the role of Toby's aunt in the film did an excellent job. I liked her acting as it looked natural.<br/><br/>I really loved Toby as the bad spider man. He looked good in that hair style and his mean acting was truly.... mean. He did a better job in this evil role and acted much better than the goody boy he is always shown as.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a nice film but I felt that they still could have done better. Spiderman 2 was much better than this part. Yet, it deserves a 7 out of ten."

Yes, it's impressive, but not enough to make up for this multi-million dollar ($258 million to be exact), 220-minute disaster.<br/><br/>Costumes weren't up to par at all. Spider-Man looked fine, even with his ""organic"" web-shooters, Sandman looked fine too. But what about Harry Osborn? Why was he flying a ""sky-skateboard"" and not the Goblin Glider? Why didn't he come back as the Green Goblin? Why wasn't the venom symbiote able to react to Spider-Man's thoughts, mimicking street clothes and transforming into the black suit at will? Why did Venom look more like a duplicate Spider-Man than the terrifying character he usually portrayed as? And of course, who could forget EMO-Parker with his eyeliner and black hair. Why? The music is the same as in the first two films; it worked.<br/><br/>Now, the fun begins.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, I hate you. I hated you as director for the first two Spider-Man movies. And you know what else? Evil Dead and Army of Darkness were smile-funny, certainly not ""ha-ha"" funny, and chuckle-funny would be pushing it. As director of Spider-Man 3, you had the power to turn things around, and you didn't.<br/><br/>Second, Sam Raimi, and this goes for you too Ivan, never write a screenplay, ever again. Your style is absurd; you destroyed any sense of realism remaining in the film adaptation of the Spider-Man series, an element desperately needed if the films were to succeed. I mean, a dance sequence? This isn't West Side Story. You didn't work on the screenplays of the first two films, and while they weren't good, they were OK. Speaking of which, a shout out to the return of Alvin Sargent, thanks for not letting the Raimi brothers do more damage than they did. So, Raimi and Raimi, stop writing, put down your pens, quit Microsoft Word, enough.<br/><br/>As for the actors. Tobey Maguire, get fit and stop being such a wimp. Kirsten Dunst, good job. James Franco, good job. Thomas Haden Church, good job. Bruce Campbell, you are hilarious. Topher Grace, put on a pair of bell-bottoms and go whine a little more to Donna.<br/><br/>The plot inconsistencies are enormous. Venom isn't supposed to die. Sandman never killed Uncle Ben and isn't supposed to have a heart felt moment with Spider-Man, apologizing.<br/><br/>Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, how could you allow this? I let so much fly, web-nuggets, Spider-Man killing Uncle Ben's ""supposed"" murderer (despite the third films blatant attempt to cover up that enormous error), star gazing on a giant spider-web(the worst date ever?), and more. Yet you allow Raimi 1 and Raimi 2 to have their way, and as a result we get Patriotic Spider-Parades! You'll probably see the movie regardless of my words.

"The_Wagon","5","1","2","5 May 2007"," Gasp!
","I did not care for Spider-Man 3. Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is one of my favorite super-heroes ever. He's a great hero. Along with the Silver Surfer, he's probably my favorite hero. Spider-Man was a very good movie, and it was extremely well-done, as well as Spider-Man 2, which I think surpassed the first. However, both of these films surpass the third.<br/><br/>I had very, very, VERY high expectations for this movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but honestly, this IS a very boring movie. It's about two and half hours long, but about fifty minutes are taken up with boring romantic scenes. Yes, most, if not all, super-heroes have a girl-friend, lately in super-hero films they have been adding that in just to extend the length of the movie, like in Superman Returns, which, for the record, was way better than this.<br/><br/>The comedy in it was not funny at all, but pretty much everyone in the theater was roaring with laughter. I will admit that the scene with the great Bruce Cambell were pretty much awesome, being one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>The acting? It was good for the most part, but a lot of times it was cheesy, and some of the dialog was cheesy, but that stuff wasn't a big flaw of the film.<br/><br/>The fighting? The action scenes were the best parts of the film. Many of the scenes were very good scenes, such as the final battle with Spidey, Harry, Sandman, and Venom. This was the best part of the whole movie. The fights with the Sandman were very good as well, in my opinion anyway. The scene at the bell was pretty good too.<br/><br/>But another thing I didn't like was the amount of story lines in it. A Spider-Man movie shouldn't have one million plot lines and a thousand villains. The three villain thing was okay, but I prefer the classic one villain storyline. And the fact that they made it to where Flint Marko, the Sandman, was actually the killer of Uncle Ben, was just unneeded. Now all of the people who never read the comic book will be stuck with this knowledge, when it really isn't knowledge at all. It's just bull crap.<br/><br/>What about Gwen Stacy? Didn't she play a huge part in the film? NO! She appeared in about four scenes. She didn't play a huge part at all. They messed up her character in the first movie though. In the comic book, Gwen is killed by the original(Norman Osbourne) Green Goblin. What about in this? She dangles from a building, and is saved by Spider-Man afterwards. I still liked that she actually made an appearance though.<br/><br/>After naming so much bad and so little good, I guess I should say some good so I won't anger people too badly. Sandman looked perfect in this film. No joke, he looked excellent. This is exactly how he looks in the comic. Green shirt, and a muscular body, with sand. A+! Venom? This was perfect as well. He is most peoples' favorite Spider-Man villain, and his appearances in this movie were great. In my opinion anyway.<br/><br/>Green Goblin II? I can take it or leave it, but it was a large part of the movie.<br/><br/>So overall, Spider-Man 3 did not suck. No, it did not suck at all. It has some great stuff in it. The battle scenes save it, as well as the excellent costumes for the villains, excluding Green Goblin II for obvious reasons. C'mon, a robotic suit? Oh well. That was a flaw in the first movie. Anyway, the movie is ruined by the fact that it's just too boring. A super-hero movie lots of action is more liked by me than a super-hero film that's one third action and two thirds romance and pointless scenes.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I guess, like the X-Men series, movies based on Marvel characters top off at #2 and sink with #3. I waited 3 years for this movie and, quite honestly, it wasn't very good. Unlike the first 2 movies, which had fleshed out plots and characters you could care about, this movie is the complete opposite. One minute Harry is the enemy, then Sandman, then Harry again, then Sandman, then Venom. How long was Venom even on screen in this movie, 15 minutes? I didn't feel bad for Sandman's problems as I did with Doc Ock's last movie or even Osbourne's the movie before. I don't know what else to say. Just disappointed. Since the 2nd Fantastic Four movie will be out soon, it should be good, but when they make a 3rd for that franchise, the Marvel movie curse will rule once again and make it sucky."

","Spider-Man 3 is bigger and more spectacular than its predecessors. It's also proof positive that Sam Raimi should have never let Avi Arad persuade him to add Venom to the film. There are enough good-to-great moments to recommend Spidey 3 but, in the end, the sum of its parts is a good deal less than its whole...<br/><br/>There are at least three really good movies mashed up in Spider-Man 3: an angst-filled romantic drama that features Peter, MJ and Harry; a prison escape because of extremely extenuating circumstances, featuring Spidey, Marko (now the familiar Sandman) and his dying daughter; and the competition between Brock and Peter for the new staff job at the Bugle. Each of them - indeed, any two of them - could have led to a brilliant film, but all three just wind up getting in each other's way.<br/><br/>http://www.eclipsemagazine.com/node/4404"
"reshef_i","8","1","2","5 May 2007"," great movie - but not suitable to everyone
","SO... how is Spiderman 3...? I read a few reviews before writing my own and... You can say whatever you want, one thing is for certain, whether you liked it or not - you just can't disregard it. for the better or worst - There's always something happening on the screen that gets your attention, the film doesn't have a dull moment (or very few)... However, lot of scene are down right - emotional ones... if you are a sensitive person - get ready for an emotional roller coaster. so if you're the kind of person who doesn't like to see MUSHY stuff, if you like your hero invulnerable and MACHO, and not so in touch with himself - Go and see old James bond movies.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with Messages, action, and emotional scenes. Messages like : The responsibility of being a hero, knowing what compassion is and to control your ""other self"" so you wouldn't lose what you really are - a humane person. the destructiveness of letting your dark feelings take control of you... learning to forgive yourself, forgive others, and above all - face your fears, whatever the risks, and discover courage, and who you really are. sounds a bit like spider-man 2, huh? actually, maybe because it's the one that wraps it all up- the director pulled out all the stops. there are more than a few twists in the story and people do get hurt and die.<br/><br/>the action is wonderful and feels great, the effects are nothing short of amazing and the soundtrack really serves the plot beautifully. as to the story itself... as I mentioned before- the director maybe turned to the extreme and you'll find yourself ""swallowing"" a lot of emotional semi romantic scenes which is definitely not for anyone. other ""emotional"" scenes are when close people to Peter getting hurt.<br/><br/>This is definitely not your average action movie- it's a little ""heavy"" and dares to be different from a lot of action movies you've seen. before I sum it up, I just got to hand it to Sam Raimi, Stan lee, Avi ARAD, the production crew and to Colombia/Tristar management who had the BALLS not to use the same old - hero - formula again.<br/><br/>so, why not a 10 or a 9? to tell you the truth, It was too much for me to handle. too much emotions, maybe too many messages and maybe too much of everything. still, I liked it a lot - after all, this maybe the last time you see spidey on the big screen - wouldn't you like to pay him your last visit...?"
"alfredlebum","6","1","2","5 May 2007"," A satisfying, if not spectacular conclusion.
","The original Spiderman film set the standard, with the sequel taking the superhero film to new extraordinary heights. What a shame then, that this would be the series zenith as the third film draws it to only a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>The key reason for this would have to be the muddled plot which makes the film feel crowded and confusing. The main theme this time being that through the bonding with a mysterious alien symbiote, Spiderman unleashes his evil side, which threatens to push away everyone he loves. To comic book fans this was expected to be the progression of the series, and has huge potential in a film, down to it revealing the other side of Peter, adding freshness to what was becoming a stale character. For this to work of course, the film has to have as much focus on Peter's dark side as it did on him normally in the first two. With a film trying to contain this and so much more, it ultimately leads to a shallow story which is never developed enough to really engage with the viewers.<br/><br/>Up until this point, director Sam Raimi had insisted on only featuring one villain per film, with a story arc being developed around them. This was a masterstroke idea, with villains Green Goblin and Doc Ock appearing as fully fleshed out 3 dimensional characters, who had believable ambitions which made them integral to the plot. This time around, there are not one, not two, but three villains in the piece. Acceptable perhaps if they just came and went, but with Raimi determined to give all his villains an arc, it leads to a muddled script that appears as a mess. An arc that had been developed over the previous two films had been that of Harry Osborn, son of the original Green Goblin. It makes perfect sense to have his desire for vengeance leading to him becoming a new incarnation of the Goblin. The same cannot be said for new villain, Sandman.<br/><br/>Revealed as the real killer of Peter's Uncle Ben, he is the one that sends Peter over the edge midway through the film. With a back-story given to him, he attracts genuine sympathy from the viewer, even though his irrelevance is all too apparent. Having his story connected back to first film can be seen as an unnecessary complication which did not need to be included in the film. Raimi must have realised this, but felt compelled to include his favourite villain at the expense of the story. The other villain that appears does not have the same affection from the director. Raimi had already stated he disliked Venom and did not wish to include him in the trilogy. With the symbiote theme in the film though, it made perfect sense to include Venom as the final enemy of Spiderman. Raimi selfishly decides to neglect the fan-adored villain though, as Eddie Brock is given limited screen time, leading to an unconvincing transformation that dissatisfies the viewer. The baddie Venom himself is given even less screen time, making small appearances in the climatic confrontation at the end of the film. We don't even see five minutes of Spiderman's greatest foe, his name not even being mentioned. This disgraceful cameo immediately will make any fan bitter and unforgiving over what Raimi has done to the Villain. In the end, the only reason for his inclusion seems to be because Raimi felt he had to down to the symbiote being in the story.<br/><br/>That aside, problems lie also in the nature of Pete's dark side. The film captures it completely wrong, Parker now turning into a swaggering arrogant teenager with an emo fringe, rather than a rude and ruthless anti-hero. Whilst his inner rage is compelling during the subway fight with Sandman, the rest of the time it borders on the point of ridiculous; one scene in particular almost collapsing in on itself when Peter does a Saturday Night Fever routine at a club to make MJ jealous. This ultimately can be seen as the most distressing aspect of Spiderman 3, as it is the central theme of the movie, and it is seriously flawed.<br/><br/>Now for some positives. The casting is as always spot on. Thomas Hayden Church is perfect as Sandman, carrying real weight with the role and inducing true sympathy from the viewer. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock and Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy are also good choices. The film does not let down in the action department either, with a number of big budget fights occurring throughout the movie, with a CGI Sandman being the most impressive. Again though, no fight manages to match the fantastic train fight between Spidey and Doc Ock in SM2. Unlike other superhero films like Superman Returns, Spiderman at least does not try and take itself too seriously, with light hearted comedic moments littered throughout which contrast well against the darkness of the story. A prime example would be the role of J. Jonah Jameson, who manages to thoroughly entertain the audience despite limited screen time.<br/><br/>To conclude, Spiderman 3 is a disappointing conclusion to the series, even though this was in some ways impossible not to be after its sublime predecessors. What will most annoy fans and viewers alike is the films desire to inject as much as they can in to only 140 minutes of celluloid. The action sequences as well as the villains are both examples that it is quality not quantity that matters. With the desire to finish off his trilogy convincingly, Raimi seems to have desperately tried to cram in everything he wanted from the series, at the expense of the film having any real focus. In no ways is this a terrible movie, just a poor one in comparison to the films before it."

","I saw the bad reviews for Spiderman 3 and expected to be somewhat disappointed but I never thought I would be angry at how bad it is Spiderman 1 one was really good and 2 along with Batman Begins are the two best comic book movies ever but Spidey 3 suffers from under developed characters, to much crammed into one movie, so so acting, and cheesy attempts at comedy after seeing a movie like Grindhouse a couple of weeks ago where everyone cheered at the end but its done horrible at the box office and now seeing this film that will make hundreds of millions of dollars and is not even on the same level as Tarantinos flick I'm angry with my fellow movie goers and myself for assuming Spiderman 3 would be great and its not even good the kids in the theater didn't even like it and thats bad save your money and watch Spiderman 1 or 2 to get your Spidey fix."

","This movie is the most amazing and horrible spider man movie ever. I can't give it a star rating because it is impossible to give a 10 for action and 1 for story and crappy everything else. My main problem with the movie is that Venom is BY FAR the MOST AMAZING spidey villain EVER. We ALL know that, he is amazing, the biggest, baddest, worst, best, most interesting... And he is only in the movie for 15 minutes!! Like bloody hell, the sand man is the main villain in the movie. Frig! Eddie is a skinny twig when he should be more built then anyone in the movie, Venom's costume (for the whole 15 min he's in there) is nothing like the real Venom costume. He just looks like he is wearing the black spidey costume with a water effect.<br/><br/>The movie producers tried to do to much and didn't focus enough on what they should have. They should have had no other villain except maybe Harry with Venom. He (Venom) would have easily taken up the entire movie and maybe even then they wouldn't have done justice to him. But yea, that was my main problem w/ the movie. They kill Venom.<br/><br/>Other then that, the movie is freaking AWESOME, but don't go expecting the amazing Venom that I was."
"BloodStone","7","1","2","5 May 2007"," Sam Raimi needs to do #4 just for Cinematic Redemption
","I'll keep this brief. Spiderman 3 is a bit of a letdown. Too many villains, not enough real story development & the story line many times feels rushed & clunky. The ""evil"" Peter Parker is mostly just goofy rather than menacing & dark. It is my understanding that the writer who penned the 2nd film really wasn't involved as much in the development of this third film. And it shows. Spiderman 3 has plenty of entertaining moments for sure ( Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo) but, Spiderman 3 suffers from a severe case of overkill. The Sandman is cool but slightly under-used. Venom is a mere shadow of his comic book/animated self & the battle between Harry & Peter Parker is one of the better moments/fight scenes in the film. I think Rami needs to do # 4, take his time & try to get some cinematic redemption. I predict once the word gets out on Spiderman 3 (about a week or so), the box office returns will be a big letdown when it's all said & done.<br/><br/>BloodStone's Recommendation: Spiderman 3 is worth a look if your expectations aren't sky-high.<br/><br/>Bloodstone's Rating: 7/10"

As it was, he had three villains and a whiny female to deal with and none of them were built up enough to make it interesting.<br/><br/>The scene in the Jazz club between Gwen and MJ was about the only bright spot that wasn't a fight scene.

"bickeringbird","5","1","2","5 May 2007"," The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
","While this was easily the least of the Spiderman movies, it's definitely not as bad as some (who I assume were disappointed fans with very high hopes) make it out to be. At least it's no Incredible Hulk or Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>The Bad: While Spiderman did a better job than I expected of tying together three un-connected villains and the obligatory Mary-Jane subplot, the story still felt rushed and choppy, especially toward the middle. And yet, it still managed to drag in parts. The evil/ possessive technology, while given just enough exposition in earlier movies, was introduced sloppily in this one. The dialogue was almost as bad as the tripe in Star Wars episode III at points, and the visuals were equally corny. If they ever have Spider-man pose in front of a CGI American flag or burst out at the end with some trite moral lesson again, I'm gonna puke. Finally, and this is probably just a personal issue, but Mary-Jane was at her most obnoxious and self-centered. May all Spidey-fans forgive me, but I was cheering for Gwen and Ursula for most of the movie.<br/><br/>The Good: Granted, a lot of the special effects were iffy, but they could really be spectacular sometimes. Though I'm sure some found it boring, the scene introducing the Sandman's powers was actually quite beautiful. And while the serious scenes fell flat, those which were meant to be comedic were just perfect, with the exception of...<br/><br/>The Ugly: Tobey Maguire does not pull off Angst. Nor should he ever crotch-dance. Enough said.<br/><br/>In short, as long as you let go of any expectations you had of this being a serious action movie and see it for some mindless laughs, you'll be okay."

"Yojimbo81","5","1","2","5 May 2007"," Inessential addition to the Spider-Man canon
","When the sequel question comes up in Scream 2, the film's cast of hardened nerds compile a familiar list of the follow-ups that actually improved on their originals. The Godfather Part II, Aliens, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back... If the mantra sounds familiar, it's probably because the same names came up when you had this discussion yourself. When it comes to good sequels, there simply ain't much to choose from.<br/><br/>For all its knowingness, Scream 2 wouldn't end up making it into this list (in fact, you'll probably find that most of the people who enjoyed even the first movie have since disowned it). Were the film's characters to have the same debate today, though, they might well have mentioned Spider-Man 2. As sequels go, it was very good indeed, expanding and improving on both the action sequences and the character development of its predecessor while delivering the one thing that film lacked: a truly great villain.<br/><br/>This latest installment in the adventures of everyone's favourite masked menace doesn't, sadly, manage to repeat that trick. Bogged down by a script that tries to cram far too much into far too little space, it's a busy, convoluted mess that's eerily redolent of that other recent superhero trequel, X-Men: The Last Stand.<br/><br/>This time around, closet webslinger Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is beset with problems. Riding high on the public's adoration of his masked alter ego, he doesn't notice that his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is floundering, or that one-time pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) seems to be following in his psychotic father's footsteps. To make matters worse, there's a plucky freelance photographer (Topher Grace) looking to oust Peter from his job, while the man who really killed Uncle Ben in Part 1 suddenly appears on the scene... and he's made of sand. Oh, and then there's that bit of alien gloop that landed in Central Park while Peter and MJ were making out, and now seems intent on turning Spidey blacker than black.<br/><br/>Confused? That's only the half of it. There's enough material for a couple of movies here, and by the end you may find yourself wishing that Raimi had saved some of it for later. Despite a tortuous running time, almost everything about Spider-Man 3 feels rushed, the plot developments flashing past like a caffeine-fuelled Powerpoint presentation. Parker's flirtation with the dark side is almost absurdly camp, while the last-minute introduction of a new villain in the final reel may leave even the most dedicated fanboys feeling a bit cheated. The only segments given ample breathing space throughout are the action set pieces - which, though undeniably impressive, move from dazzling to deadening with each repetition (and trust me, there's a lot of them).<br/><br/>To be fair, this is by no means the train wreck that the third X-Men flick was. Raimi is no Ratner, and he still delivers enough choice moments to keep the popcorn-munching masses happy. Yet there's no escaping the fact that Spider-Man 3 replaces the greatness of its predecessors with a cinematic experience that's merely kinda okay. It's hard not to wish that they'd called it quits after the second film - and quietly pray that the talks over a possible Part 4 come to nought."

","Got to squeeze some time yesterday to catch Spiderman 3. Well, what is my verdict? Let me put it this way. Don't expect too much. All the hype and excitement might make you expect something you might not get. Among the 3 Spiderman movies, I personally still liked Spiderman 2 the best. This third installment tries too much to squeeze so many characters and plot lines into an almost 3 hour movie. Either the Sandman story alone or the Alien Symbiote/Venom story alone should have been chosen to intermix with the love story sequences. Having all of them together felt too much, yet you also feel short-shrifted on how these stories were resolved. The action sequences are exciting, for sure. The Sandman sequences are breathtaking CG. The ""hip bad-boy"" Peter Parker sequences were funny, yet also very prolonged and repetitive. Overall, not bad, yet not very satisfying.<br/><br/>****Spoiler Alert**** I don't read the spider-man comics. So some details are unclear to me.<br/><br/>What really is the role of Gwen Stacy in the life of Peter and MJ? Her name comes up with fondness when comics fanboys write about Spidey, but her storyline was so wasted in this overloaded film.<br/><br/>Is is really possible that Harry makes a turnaround so the New Green Goblin was able to help Spiderman in that final battle? Why didn't the butler reveal to Harry what he knew earlier? It was so vital.<br/><br/>Was Flynt Marko really responsible for Uncle Ben's death??? Or was this only for the movie?"
"nobanenogain","3","1","2","5 May 2007"," Too many cooks don't quite spoil the broth
","The word that springs to mind after seeing Spider-Man 3 is 'inconsequential.' The film is packed to the rafters with cult characters beloved by fanboys, played by big names, yet despite the understandably mouth watering encounter of Spider-Man v Sandman/The New Goblin/Venom, it's a case of too many cooks, although the broth isn't entirely spoilt. For Spider-Man 3 has its moments, unfortunately the best of them, the aerial duel between Peter and Harry Osbourne in New Goblin guise, and that isn't a patch on the memorable train ride from Spider-Man 2. The hype surrounding this film of course, has been over the black symbiote that blends with Peter's Spider-Man suit, bringing out his dark side. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters have got this quite terribly wrong. There are glimpses of Peter's dark side as things do indeed go awry, but it brings out more comedy from Maguire's ludicrous, albeit well choreographed style. It may well be intended to be funny, and is indeed funny, but it's not the inner darkness one expects. The climax seems to be a case of dejá vu as once again Mary Jane is in need of her hero after being taken hostage. The perpetrator-in-chief of this, Topher Grace's Eddie Brock, is heavily disappointing. It's difficult to describe the feel of euphoria greeted by Spidey fans when it was announced that Venom, a huge favourite of the rogue's gallery, would be appearing in this film. However we don't see enough of him, only in the final third, and even then you feel cheated come the finale. Basically, it seems there are conflicting ideas that mould into one for Spider-Man 3. Sony no doubt, wanted to throw the kitchen sink at this one given the lump sums of dinero that have been garnered over the first two movies. Raimi and Maguire were the driving forces behind the inclusion of Sandman, Sony clearly forced the inclusion of Venom, with higher box office stakes plausible. The film is certainly bloated and overblown with big acting names that are needless, and what ensues is not a total mess, but, like Pirates of The Caribbean's boorish sequel Dead Man's Chest, the sequel is disappointing, seeking quantity over quality. On the bright side it is by no means a disaster, thanks to Maguire, giving his best turn as the web slinger, revelling in the semi-schizo moments and bringing great harmony to the character of Peter Parker. His and Dunst's emotionally driven performance once again give a Spider-Man film plenty of heart, but with Spider-Man 4 almost certainly likely to go ahead, let's just stick with one villain, almost certainly Dr Connors, aka The Lizard."
"kuriakamau","7","1","2","5 May 2007"," Whether or not to watch Spiderman 3
","SPIDERMAN 3<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, this year's most over hyped and anticipated movie was Spiderman 3. Over the last few years movies that have been over hyped have failed to live up to audience expectations. So does Spiderman 3 live up to the hype?<br/><br/>The purpose of trailers is to draw audiences to watch the movie by showing captivating scenes from the movie. In action movies it's the most action packed scenes that we see. However, the thing about trailers is that they can't help judge how good the storyline and plot of the movie is. Producers and marketing executive have banked on this philosophy for the past few years. We all agree that the Spiderman 3 trailers got us fired up for the movie but how good is the story? <br/><br/>Let's start with the good things<br/><br/>The action sequences were superb The action sequences were the best of all the Spiderman movies and probably the best to grace the movie screens. The fights were awesome <br/><br/>They tried to incorporate comedy in the movie that works They tried to incorporate more light comedy into the movie than all the other Spiderman movies that actually works.<br/><br/>The element of surprise Some scenes literary jolted me off my seat. I liked that.<br/><br/>Sorry, that was all that was good about the movie<br/><br/>I have to admit that when I heard that there were going to be three bad guys in the movie that got me fired up. Being the ultimate Spiderman fan, I swore that I was going to see it as soon as it hit the cinema. But it's because of these three bad guys in one movie that the storyline and plot are pathetic<br/><br/>It doesn't fully pick up where it left off In Spiderman 2, Peter was struggling to balance school, a job, being Spiderman and love. He was failing miserably and this was made him unsure of his powers and ultimately was the reason he was losing them. In Spiderman 3, he's able to quite easily without an explanation of how.<br/><br/>Plot and Storyline are messed up!!! The storyline doesn't flow. It's crowded with too many subplots. It's like a collection of short stories about Spiderman mixed together to form one. It's annoying because one story is barely over before another starts. If you were told to explain what goes on during the movie from start to finish, trust me, you wouldn't be able.<br/><br/>There is too much coincidence Movies like this about coincidence, that I know, but the way it occurs in this movie sheds light on the fact that the writers did a bad job. It's like they were patching up things using coincidence so that the story would work.<br/><br/>Some aspects of the movie aren't complete but the movie still moves on. Coming back to an earlier point, some things that happen during the movie aren't settled even to the end. I would like to give examples but I don't want to spoil for those who haven't watched.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is that they tried to do too much in one movie. I understand that this was supposed to be the last one but not in the expense of making a good movie. I would have preferred if Spiderman went out with a bang.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing about the movie is the lack of strong themes and a strong message. If they were there they weren't brought out well.<br/><br/>The music could have been better. I believe most producers and directors don't pay much attention to this but it's very important. More could have been done about this.<br/><br/>If you want to know whether to watch it on big screen, its simple; that's the only way you'll enjoy the movie. The special effect and action sequences make it worth big screen.<br/><br/>However, if you want to watch it on small screen it's not worth it unless you have a home theatre. <br/><br/>It was an attempt by producers to buy audience using the expensive special effects rather than a good story, themes and message."

","Spider Man 3 teaches a strong lesson: over expectation is not always good. Like most of the sequels Spider Man 3 could not, unfortunately, excel its antecedent Spider Man 2. Alas, Sam Raimis Spidey is caught in the web of too many foes this time- foes forcibly cut and pasted from the history of Spider Man 1( Sandman), and foes cosmetically invented. Like Dickens novels the movie has too many threads to be handled by the viewer. Obviously one or the other thread would be left untied in the end. There would be no other option amidst yawning audience in 2 hours 20 minutes duration but to feel bored at times. Character wise Mary J Watson disappoints through out the movie by means of her egocentric-ism. However it is Peter Parker/Spider Man who shines in his negative energy. Also the variety of shades in Harry Osbornes character are occupying. Although there is a feeling of fragmentation throughout the movie. Yet it could be lauded, clapped for and recommended because it seems to be propagating what is known as humanism. Remember Spider Man 3 is strictly an art NOT for arts sake. It is something beyond. The villainous projection of each bad man like Sandman and Venom is sort of justified in the light of human nature. Their demeanour though is loathsome, their psyche is never the same. We hate them not as we did Green Goblin or Dr. Octavius. And more ironically , perhaps for the first time viewers frown at hero and sympathize villains. However Spider Man 3 could be watched for its thrilling action sequences and portrayal of contradictions of human life.Sam Raimis 3rd Spidey is not as weak as the first part but nor is more stronger than the 2nd."

","I would have to say that the reviews are so mixed that I could only rely on my own judgments of the film. It was entertaining. <br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>I like how Sam Raimi attempts to develop his characters as much as possible, but lets face it, Spider-man 3 has way too many elements to work with. So many that I find it difficult to understand characters such as Aunt May or Gwen Stacy. The two furthered the plot of the movie, but I didn't care for them. I love the premise of Sandman as Uncle Ben's killer, but again I did not care much for it. And it was difficult to understand Brock's obsession of the symbiont. <br/><br/>Acting <br/><br/>I would have to say that Peter's emotional breakdown scenes were so corny that you HAVE to laugh. Again, great idea for Harry to go after Peter's loved ones, but that simply did not transfer over well. Right before Peter cried again towards the end, I was thinking to myself ""good thing we don't have to see that horrible scene again."" Then Peter breaks down. <br/><br/>Action<br/><br/>Although the story dragged on and on, the action scenes were amazing. The end fight with all the villains were awesome. I only wish that they cut out the television news scenes. <br/><br/>Overall <br/><br/>After writing this review, I realize that I have a lot of problems with the film. Plot holes, decent acting, and cheesy scenes. Still I enjoyed it. I believe Sam Raimi made a valiant effort to entertain us with a story that is true to the comics and somewhat believable. I noticed little subtle things such as Peter sleep walking with the black suit, or symbiont in the shadow over Peter as reminiscent to an origin comic cover. Spider-man 3 may have many problems, but I enjoy the film very much. The action is fun to watch and the cheesy scenes make me laugh enough to keep my attention."

It seemed to me that in the quest to tie up all loose ends in the series, a few ends were left knotted in a haphazardly and rushed fashion.<br/><br/>Some problems to highlight -I found some of the humor to be fantastic but it seemed as if no one knew where to stop, such as in the ending fight scene where Jonas buys the camera from the little girl. Was that really necessary? I felt it detracted from the intended drama of the scene.<br/><br/>-Eddie Brock received very little time on screen and Venom even less so. Sandman, in contrast, got the lion's share of the movie, I realize this had to do with his choice to kill Peter's uncle but I believe Venom is Spiderman's biggest enemy and that there was much more to Eddie Brock than having simply lost his job because of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>-The sudden revelations given to Harry Osborn by his butler seemed ridiculous to me. Not only in the fact that the butler's knowledge should have clearly come out prior to this point but also because if life truly is about choices (as Harry said) then Harry should have simply made a choice to believe his friend, he shouldn't have been told openly that he was wrong by his butler. The choice should have come from his own conscience.<br/><br/>-The acting. I realize this is an action movie but it is also a drama and Tobey's performance on that bridge while Mary Jane was telling him it was over was near unwatchable. Kisten Dunst was good though.<br/><br/>-Goth/Emo/Conor Oberst Peter Parker. A little mishandled, I think there should have been more focus on the dark side of Peter at that point, not exploitation of possible comic relief.<br/><br/>Some good things included, the effects, Bruce Campbell's cameo,and a bevy of well choreographed fight scenes.<br/><br/>In the end, I compare this trilogy to the original Star Wars in the vein of, great first movie, incredible second, and a good third with problems that leaves you wanting more but also gives you a feeling of relief that it's all over."
"robotto-1","6","1","2","4 May 2007"," A Tale of Two Spideys: Review of Spider-Man 3
","Life is perfect for Peter Parker. He has the woman of his dreams (who is making her debut on Broadway by the way); his freelance photographer job has him getting paid with some consistency, and there are even rumblings that a staff position could be open soon; and on top of all that, when he wears his pajamas in public, everyone adores him. Spider-Man 3 starts out all rainbows and lollipops for Peter and his friendly neighborhood alter-ego, but anyone who is a long time fan of Spider-Man knows the good times never last. Complicating Peter's moving-towards-perfect life are a former best friend who wants him dead, a grease ball of a photographer gunning for his job, and a little alien glob looking for a good time. Unfortunately for director Sam Raimi and co-writers Ivan Raimi and Alan Sargent, the problems with the script far out weigh any troubles Spidey is about to encounter.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problem that many comic book sequels do  trying so hard to out-do your predecessors that you feel the need to add more villains, rather than focusing on the story-telling that made the original so good. In this movie we get Sandman, Venom, New Goblin (VERY creative) as well as Dark Spidey himself. The charm of the original story was that we got to know our hero and villain as people before we saw them with powers. With this many new characters, that evolution is lost, necessitating quick set-ups that turn the aggressors into cardboard cut outs and stereotypes. On top of that, while trying to force the action and origins of the villains, we get contrived set ups that bend our imagination to the limits. I'm all for ""Suspension of Disbelief"" when seeing a movie, but don't try to get me to suspend my intelligence and just accept what you're offering no questions asked. And therein lies the biggest flaw of Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>The storytellers expect you to take enormous leaps of faith with the story, asking you to blindly accept some major coincidences and convenient timing to keep the story moving forward. In example (and don't worry  no spoilers here), we're expected to believe that the experiment that eventually turns Flint Marko into Sandman is happening at a very insecure location close to New York, that it is not being visually monitored, and even when a scientist notices an abnormality before the experiment begins his report is ignored. The movie is riddled with inconsistencies like that, which makes the experience less enjoyable.<br/><br/>What IS enjoyable about Spider-Man 3 are select performances, and the humor Sam Raimi weaves throughout the picture to break the tension. Tobey Maguire is allowed to have a lot more fun as Peter Parker, first allowing the city's love of his alter ego to go to his head. Then when that alien glob connects itself to Peter and starts playing upon some of his less admirable traits, Maguire shines. He's lovably out of place as a nerd with an attitude, then eerily overconfident when showing off to anyone who will pay attention. And it's even better when Spider-Man loses the conscience of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Topher Grace is a perfect anti-Parker as Eddie Brock. Cocky, uncaring for anyone but himself, and willing to do whatever he can to move his vision of a perfect life forward. You hate this guy almost from the get-go, and that's a good thing. Thomas Hayden Church's turn as Sandman doesn't give him much material to work, and every time they try to get a tear out of us for this unfortunate man, it leaves you rolling your eyes instead. For the lighter moments, J.K. Simmons reprising his role as Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson is a godsend. He embodies everything Spider-Man fans over the years have loved to hate about J-J-J over the years. And a nice turn by Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small role as the maitre d' at a snooty French restaurant is priceless.<br/><br/>The other thing to love about the movie is the special effects. Marko's transformation into Sandman is really eye popping. The CGI for that character is extremely consistent and very appealing throughout the film. Raimi's direction through the action sequences is good, but it would be nice to start things off a little slow and build up to the quick cutting flights through the cityscape, rather than hitting us with that right out of the box. The first views of Venom left me wanting more, but the real problem is that there was no emotion in the villain's face, so anytime they wanted the creature to have a real conversation, they were forced peel back the costume and let Topher do the talking.<br/><br/>There are a lot of holes in this film with which I had problems. Like where did the Spidey Sense disappear? If Harry's lone obsession is destroying Parker, then why is he going to a play? How does Brock know about Marko's power? And the biggest problem I have with just about every comic book movie  if these characters went 30, 40, even 50 years in print without anyone knowing their secret identities, why are there multiple people in every film that figure it out? But despite all those holes and inconsistencies, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. If you can grind your way through the long lapses in action, you will really enjoy it when you arrive. And for comic fans that have emotional attachments to these characters, some of the moments will have you cheering, and even squirming. Spider-Man 3 pales in comparison to its predecessors, but I still recommend you see it, rating it a 6.5 out of 10"
"canadasbest","7","1","2","4 May 2007"," Could've been great, but doesn't quite make it.
","Spider-Man 3 seems to follow the same basic blueprint of Spider-Man 2. Peter and MJ start to have relationship troubles, he begins to consider what Spider-Man means to him and how it's changed his life, all while a new villain is created and hatches a plot to get spidey.<br/><br/>But where it was done so wonderfully in Spider-Man 2, it suffers in this film. This is due mainly to two things. Firstly, we've already seen it before so it doesn't feel fresh as it did in #2. Secondly, Spider-Man 2 had only one villain so the story focused completely on Doc Ock and as a result he became a very multidimensional and compelling character. In this installment, the villain duties are shared between Venom and Sandman, and neither character is developed anywhere near the level Doc Ock was. Venom in particular is presented almost as an afterthought, though Topher Grace does do a good job as Eddie Brock.<br/><br/>There's a sequence in the film where Peter, possessed by the symbiote (the thing that gives him his black suit) starts doing some crazy things behaviour-wise. Although it's meant to be serious, they seem to go way over the top with it and it comes off seeming like little more than comedy relief. This particular sequence doesn't really seem to fit in the film very well.<br/><br/>The Harry Osborn story gets mixed up here too as he takes not one, not two, but THREE character turns in the course of the movie and the subplot involving him seems underdeveloped and rushed.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the special and visual effects are spectacular, save for one particularly cheesy scene where Spidey just happens to jump right in front of an American flag. The main actors do a passable job, Kirsten Dunst likely gives the strongest performance as MJ, also Rosemary Harris delivers another sweet yet strong performance as Aunt Mae.<br/><br/>The other bright spots acting wise were J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and the incomparable Bruce Campbell as an extremely funny french maitre'd in one particularly memorable scene.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film is a bit of a letdown, but the disappointment is compounded by the fact that all the pieces were here for a great story, but it just didn't pull together like it could've. Definitely worth the price of admission though, even an average Spiderman movie is a pretty darned good superhero flick."
"on_the_can","7","1","2","4 May 2007"," Entertaining
","I can't help but think that if it weren't for the legions of Venom fans devastated over his lack of screen time that this movie would have at least been well liked for it's entertainment value.<br/><br/>The tragedy of Spider-man 3 is the knowledge of what could have been. The story goes that this film's screenplay was originally intended to span two films with Ben Kingsley already lined up to play the Vulture who would have been the primary villain of the first film. One would then assume that Parker wouldn't have ditched his black suit until the finale, saving Venom to be the main contender of the follow up. This is what should have been done. Venom is a very cool character for many more reasons than his appearance, but his screen time is kept so short here that nobody outside of the comic fans know it. Comic fans are sad he's not in it more...everyone else wonders why he was in it at all. Because of the hodgepodge of activity crammed into the story he's reduced to a two dimensional character who is ultimately defeated too fast to promote any real threat.<br/><br/>But like I said, in spite of it's faults this is a very entertaining movie and given the volume of material Raimi and his team had to juggle with they did a remarkable job of presenting it. There's a ton of action, lots of humor and amazing special effects. The plot of course does not live up to the standards of the first two and that is it's main downfall...but to be fair the first two set the bar fairly high. This franchise isn't dead though and I imagine everyone's learned from their mistakes, I can't wait for number 4.<br/><br/>If you like fun action movies this is a fun ride. Watch it with an open mind...just because it fell short of it's potential doesn't mean it's a bad movie."
"rigolgm","8","1","2","4 May 2007"," People clapped. A good film
","I'm astonished by all the negative feedback in people's reviews here. I just came back from seeing Spiderman 3 in a big cinema and everyone laughed, there was some cheering, and even clapping at the end.<br/><br/>It is true that the film has a slightly messy feel about it, for example with characters like the butler or Sandman seemingly saying things 'just when needed' to move the plot along in a slightly unconvincing way. But many things that other people here cite as weakenesses of the movie seem to me to be actual strengths, for example how you lose sympathy for Peter Parker in the first half of the film because he lacks empathy for Mary Jane - something that I thought was a bold move by the writers that effectively raised the emotional stakes of the last half of the movie.<br/><br/>I really get a strong feeling that people writing bad reviews are being affected by their own expectations too much. Taken on its own merits, this was an intense, funny, happy and satisfyingly oddball movie.<br/><br/>And yes, Bruce Cambell's ""I am a French man"" (delivered in entirely unconvincing accent) and short goofy performance was a gem. Bruce once tried to get the role of The Flash (but was pipped to the post), and appeared in Darkman too, so it's high time he got his own superhero role! Hail to the Kingpin, baby!"
"Ryanb747","8","1","2","4 May 2007"," Another Good Spidey
","Well I just got back from seeing Spiderman 3 and I have too say that it was pretty good. I enjoyed most of the movie, I really liked the fight scenes in it. The end of the movie was the best, I am not going to say what happened because I do not want to give it away to people that haven't seen the movie yet. Lets just say you will be happy, surprised, and shocked! James Franco ""Goblin"" and Thomas Haden Church ""Sandman"" really gave it their all in this movie. Them two really did great and made this experience all the better, Great acting! I think that they kind of butchered evil Spider Man a bit when he didn't have his costume on,it kind of got a little weird, making the movie feel more like a comedy than and action fantasy kind of movie.<br/><br/>But overall the movie was Great! 8/10 for me"
"cyberian2005","8","1","2","4 May 2007"," Leaves you hungry for more !
","The movie is actually what I just said above, it leaves you hungry for more ""SPIDEY STUFF"". The movie starts with a real feel good factor in Spider Man. But then things starts to take shape from bad to ugly. Harry Osbourne returns to avenge his fathers death, Peter faces competition in his personnel as well as professional life. Lastly Mary Jane Watson is more unsecured about her relationship with our great hero. But the real entertainer of the movie lies with the Sandman, to see him become an evil villain from a fugitive is the real visual experience. The other worth mentioning part of the movie is the ""VENOM"" the alien ""stuff"" that makes us to see the GREY shades of our beloved super hero. It will be really funny to watch the Peter Dance and try being too stylish, those were the only 5 minutes of the movie that I looked around my seat. But even that was real stupid and funny to watch. The special visual effects and the sound effects of the movie are two thumps-up. At the end of the movie the all the people wants more from it, more action, more fight sequences and all the usual spidey stuff. The film ends up with a major character dying (seems thats the fashion these days with all the major television series too). Also there is no real story to carry forward from part-3 (Remember how part I & II ended with Harry vowing for revenge from Spider-Man)."
"DrBootleg","8","1","2","4 May 2007"," Spiderman 3: web of wonder or woe?
","Ever since the closing moments of Spiderman 2 on that hot summer night in 2004, the third instalment the highly successful arachnid adventures has been top of my ""Must See the Moment it Comes Out"" list. And for once I succeeded. The show started at 12:01 AM on the day of release, so I was pretty much seeing it as soon as humanly possible.<br/><br/>With popcorn and drinks at the ready in a theatre full of the usual trouble making delinquents (although they didn't really bother me on this occasion), I had a slight sensation of nervous anticipation, like any good fanboy would. The film starts, and my anticipation eases as the 140 minute visual feast unfolds in typically unabashed ""prepare for the ride"" style.<br/><br/>It starts off, and all is peachy for Peter Parkerhe's found stability in his life, and able to balance the pressures of being a superhero with trying to live a normal life. More importantly, however, he is in love with the girl of his dreams, the omnipresent MJ Watson, played by the delightful Kirsten Dunst. Soon we learn that Peter is so in love that he's going to proposecue emotional scene with Aunt May about how much he loves MJ and all seems to be going rather smoothly. However, we all know there is no such thing as a happy ending.<br/><br/>Over the next 2 and a bit hours, we, the audience are subjected to pretty much everything. We have action sequences galore with enough CGI to make you choke on your Haribo, three very different and menacing villains, two love interests and an internal struggle in the psyche of Peter Parker. One wonders if Sam Raimi merely forgot to add the partridge in a pear tree because he was too busy orchestrating this cinematic chaos.<br/><br/>It is a gloriously ambitious film, maybe a little too much so. With so many plot threads dangling up in the air, at times you want to give the film a good hard slap, so as to give it some semblance of order. There are instances of scenes placed next to one another that seem like they shouldn't be thereemotionally they don't carry. However, this doesn't mean that the plots in this film are bad. Aside from the well publicised ""enemy within"" that Peter Parker faces, there is also the matter of dealing with a best-friend-turned-evil-son-of-a-gun Harry/Green Goblin 2, who is hellbent on revenge, the newly revealed killer of Peter's uncle from the first film  Flint Marko/Sandman and the cocky photographer Eddie Brock who would later become Venom. There's a lot of stuff to deal with, and this is where the film falls down. The film is an engaging one, and never do you lose interest, but it is the cinematic equivalent of having a three course meal followed by a pint of Guinness and a Chocolate Forest Gateau, it just feels bloated.<br/><br/>However, there are many good points about this film. It is surprisingly very funny. At times I had to ask myself, am I watching a summer action blockbuster or a romantic comedy? I suppose with Sam Raimi's character focused ethos, it affords him the opportunity of showing all sides of their personalities, not just those relevant to the plot. With this in mind, the scene with the new ""cocky"" Peter walking/dancing down the street is a very amusing one.<br/><br/>The action is superb, but crucially, not groundbreaking. There are many fights between Spiderman and his nemeses, but none them make you sit up and think ""Wow, this is amazing!"". I was particularly disappointed with the final confrontation between Spiderman and the villains, because it just felt like we had seen it all before, and didn't come close to touching the climactic ""Train Battle"" sequence of Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>I also would have like to have seen Topher Grace given more room to spread his wings, because whenever he is on screen, as Eddie Brock at least, he is captivating. The same can be said for the 40s-esque editor of the Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson, who defines the term ""scene-stealer"". But hey, it's all well and good for me to tell Sam Raimi where he went wrong, but he and the rest of the people who put this film together must be applauded for creating a piece of such magnitude, even if it is flawed.<br/><br/>So, overall, how is it? It's good, really good, but doesn't compare to Spiderman 2, I'm sorry to say. If this is the last of the films in the franchise, then it is a fitting end as all the loose ends are tied up, and is suitably emotionally weighted. However, if this does stay as a trilogy, then it only goes to prove, like the Godfather and Star Wars (originals) before it, that the second part is always the best."
"lallamavolador","8","1","2","4 May 2007"," Some spoilers/my 2 cents
","Spiderman 3 invoked more emotions than the previous two movies. I believed that the movie offered a good balance between battle scenes and the emotional appeal.<br/><br/>Special Effects: I really did like the special effects; at times I believe the effects went by too quickly for a person to really enjoy that particular part of the film. Despite this, they were great. I loved the directing style and camera style. The way in which the movie was but we all enjoy some cheesy romance to bring us out of reality. And I believe it was a master piece of its own. I enjoyed how often times they blurred the background as you see Peter. That itself could be considered a sort of theme, because every time that Peter is somewhat confused is one this happens, like if the world is sort of a blur.<br/><br/>Plot: Overall good plot. My first response was damn there are a lot of villains in this movie. But I gave it a fair chance and considered the significance of each villain. Venom was brought back mostly because he was very popular in the comic book, and it does follow along with the motif of choice, and the difference between good and evil. Sandman brought a final sense of closure to the death of Peter's grandfather. It also brought out a potential driving for someone to do something evil. This character also brings up forgiveness, that sometimes we must forget things that have happened and not let our vengeance get to us. The new Goblin, he brought out friendship. I really can' imagine the movie without the three villains because they all add something to the movie to give the audience a sense of closure.<br/><br/>Acting/Character development: Toby's acting was generally great, he brought to us that same feeling of good in our heart that we know from the previous movies, and he also brought out how good could be bad easily. He showed this by his hairstyle and dark facial features. Although the dance was awkward, it did offer some comic release to the tenseness of the movie. Kristen Dunst was perfect, but once again she played the Damsel in Distress. I kind of would have like to see her become a little bit stronger. I would have like to get to know venom more. The sandman was very well suited for that role.<br/><br/>I would have really like Spiderman to save more people like he did in the previous movies. In this movie he basically just saves the main characters instead of common people like in other movies.<br/><br/>As I walked out of the theater I heard people say the two words I hate the most ""IT SUCKED"", I give people all the freedom that they could have their own opinion but I could not honestly say that the movie sucked. It is worth remembering and it gives us a sense of closure to most of Spiderman. The romance was a little cheesy,d rather nicely and it forms a good balance between the male and female audience.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie a 8/10. I walked out of the theater saying to myself that's it, but when I thought about everything I realized that the movie was great."

Venom looks much cooler then the actor. Spiderman himself.. Amazin.. THe did a better job with him in this movie then in the others. Black suit was perfect. Looked great. Tobey did a great job as well... even though he did look like an idiot dancing down the street with no music. um.. Lets see. Harry... Great job with the new hover board. He was good other then the fact that he suddenly got immense amount of skill. I understand the strength but cmon. Even spiderman had developed his skill. He wasn't all o f a sudden a hero. As seen with his fight with bone saw in the first movie. He didn't fight well. Any way i Must say the most impressive thing in the movie for me is when the sandman was first seen in the pile... First seen as sand. Amazing... It was distorted enough to look confusing and impressive at the same time. at times it looked like meshes of sand and at others u suddenly see a character... VERY WELL DONE... Crazyness.... Story.. good... Less drama needed... MJ... + Peter... will always b.. no matter what.. the harry and mj.. 2 sec affair not necessary...

","SM3 was almost perfect. Sam Raimi definitely made another blockbuster. Again, it was a flick in Raimi's style...watch Evil Dead 2 or Darkman and you'll see the similarities. Topher was excellent as Eddie Brock and sold it for the big V. Thomas Hayden Church was impressive as Flint Marko and the sfx bunch did wonders for Sandman. Always the All- American Sweetheart, Kirsten Dunst embodied the girl-next door MJ. Newcomer to the Spiderman franchise Bryce Dallas Howard was a very tempting Gwen Stacy. <br/><br/>The only thing preventing SM3 from getting a full 10 from me was the ""mystery"" surrounding a Raimi staple and B-Movie Icon: Bruce Campbell. It was rumored that there'd be 4 villains in SM3, and that Ash from Housewares was going to portray one. Although, in an interview, Bruce did say that 'in the first one, I named him. In the second, I defeated him, and in the third...I help him.' Well to avoid posting a spoiler, I won't go any further. Still, there were 4 villains in SM3...see if you can figure out #4.<br/><br/>SM3 rocked, and I'll see the film again<br/><br/>Marcus Schlecht - Knallübel"
"SylvesterFox007","1","2","7","4 May 2007"," Lousy Movie
","Right now, I know you're not going to want to believe me. But trust me, this movie isn't what you think it is. I loved the first Spider-Man movie. I tell people that it took me on the whole emotional journey: I laughed, I cried, and I had more fun that I did during any other super hero movie. And then I enjoyed the second Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>But there were those rumors that Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst all wanted out of the franchise. And there were those rumors that the producers wanted to do more, with or without them. About halfway through ""Spider-Man 3"", I got the distinct impression that writer/director Raimi and star Maguire were intentionally trying to sabotage the franchise, brilliantly screwing the studio heads begging for more sequels and, consequentially, the audience as well.<br/><br/>The movie starts out promisingly enough, as an excellent character drama in the spirit of the first two movies. Like the first two, the movie puts the emphasis squarely on the character of Peter Parker and his relationship with those around him, specifically beautiful redhead Mary Jane and ""New Goblin"" James Franco, as well as Eddie Brach Gwen Stacey, Aunt May, Sandman, J. Jonah Jameson, Captain Stacey, and too many others for the director to keep track of, even if he wanted to, which Raimi certainly doesn't seem to. Then there's the sloppy handling of the introduction of the symbiote that will eventually create Venom. And there's also the annoying continuity error of Eddie Brach, already mentioned as being a photographer for the Daily Bugle in a previous movie, coming to the Bugle for the first time in search of a job.<br/><br/>Despite a few excellent action sequences, the character drama soon devolves into an overly long soap opera filled with love triangle upon triangle and other contrived interactions between the characters. The movie then devolves further into a B-list monster movie. Along the way, it mixes in song-and-dance numbers, extremely awkward and sometimes laughable moments, forced humor, and cliché lines from cheesy buddy cops movies. And the whole time the dialog and situations become more and more cringe-worthy, to the point it seems certain that Raimi and Maguire were trying to make the worst movie possible in order to guarantee there wouldn't be a ""Spider-Man 4."" The movie climaxes in a series of sickly sweet, over-the-top, sappy ""moral of the story"" scenes.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst at least seems to not be trying to destroy the movie, turning in one of the film's better performances. Nor does Christopher Young, who takes over scoring duties from Danny Elfman, who also wanted desperately out of the franchise. The special effects people also seem to still be trying to turn in their best work, doing incredible jobs of bringing Sandman and Venom to life, even though the movie's major showdown involving the two villains seems like something out of a cheap Godzilla or King Kong movie. And Bruce Campbell's brief cameo appearance provided the only genuinely successful humor in the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is kinda cute as Gwen Stacey but seems somehow unnatural. Meanwhile, Topher Grace as Eddie Brach/Venom seems to be playing a more contemporary version of his character from ""That 70's Show"" while Tobey Maguire, who did an amazing job portraying Peter Parker in the first two movies, mugs so much that he, once again, seems intent on sabotaging the franchise.<br/><br/>The only other people involved with the film who did a decent job were the advertisers. By placing elements of all the best scenes into every trailer, they raised my expectations for ""Spider-Man 3."" I haven't been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>Believe me, I really wanted to like this movie, and I'm sure you really want to like it, too. But don't waste your money and time."
"andrewrod24","10","2","7","4 May 2007"," utterly disappointing...
","the best way to sum this movie up is that it was a lot of flashy effects with what at times seemed awkward dialog. with the hype being that this was the best of the three spider man movies i was excited t go see it, and the action scenes were the only part of this movie which lived up to that bill. had the action scenes been average i would have graded it much lower. the script was bad, the acting was bad, the only believable character was harry Osbourne but other than that i feel it was Toby and Kirsten's worst performance in the series.<br/><br/>i agree with previous statements that they seemed to try and fit way too much into this movie, it would have been much better served omitting the sandman completely and having the first third to half of the movie concentrating on the peter vs harry storyline with peter transitioning to ""black"" spider man, thus the relationship issues that were touched upon. there should have been more venom, he is almost without question the greatest villain in the spider man saga and i feel they sold his role way short in the movie.<br/><br/>i don't see the humor that some people are raving about, the only part i found amusing was when an awkward peter parker was trying to be suave and cool when he was the ""black"" spider man. i don't even know if that was intended to be funny or if Toby trying to act cool just came off that way... naturally awkward. i also took exception to some of the deviation of the spider man storyline. i understand you cant do things by the letter of the comic but the venom death sequence was awful and the ending with the sandman was equally bad if not worse.<br/><br/>whatever. i guess i cant really say anything else that hasn't been said... i suppose I'm just venting after rushing to go see the biggest hyped movie of the year and coming out of it feeling like i just saw a fireworks display... all flash with no real substance.<br/><br/>i will admit that the action scenes were excellent. but if you are looking for a creative story with wit, humor, and some action, i would suggest Hott Fuzz to anyone over this movie."

","I catch-ed Spider Man 3 at a press screening here in Zurich. Let me first say that I rated Spider-Man I with a 7/10 and Spider-Man 2 with a 8/10. My favorite comic book movies are Batman Begins, X-Men 2 and Spider-Man 2 (and of course the blueprint of them all Superman: The Movie) First of all the good news. The Visual Effects and the choreography of the action sequences totally rock. The FX are way better than the ones for part 1 and 2. My favorite sequences are the ""birth of the Sandman"" and the ""out of control crane"". The cast is superb and the villains are OK.<br/><br/>The bad news is that the drama is laughable and the dialogs are worse than the ones George Lucas writes. And the film is way to long. Parts of it are boring. I guess all the good dialog writers are working for series like Lost, Desperate Housewives, Greys Anatomy and Heroes....<br/><br/>All in all I was kind of disappointed. The spectacle is superb, the drama is poor.

A hero that cries twice or more for her lovely Mary Jane is not super, and this film present Parker in the mood for Love , always (or frequently, at least) ! The balance leans on loading love with Mary Jane rather than spider - man' duties, the resources of a hero! I am sure, spidey 3 tears make onion soup tasty ...<br/><br/>The visual effects are very good, and the action of battles but too short (!) in comparison with movie' runtime.<br/><br/>The spidey 3 News are: <br/><br/>1. The spider man is sometimes ""dark"" , ""bad"" and wears a black uniform ! (not as Batman's suit but similar with his original) because of an alien material that followed him from a meteorite that dropped in earth (maby in N.Y Central Park)! <br/><br/>2. The alliance with Norman Osborn ! <br/><br/>3. Two deadly enemies: Sandman (the fugitive Flint Marco who killed Spider-man's uncle in episode 2 - accidentally !) and the Venom (Eddie Brock) who lost his job and girl from Spider - man (so he wants revenge and acts like Faust) <br/><br/>4. Parker's greatest battle is within himself. Between the dark - bad, and the innocent - pure hero. The balance between his devotion to Mary Jane and his spider-super duties !"
"EddyTheMartian007","6","2","8","21 December 2018"," A very flawed film, but still has heart, and great moments.
","Spiderman 3 is such a weird movie. The first 30 minutes are an absolute mess with the lazy Introduction of Venom, Peter fighting Harry (The new Green Goblin) and Harry getting amnesia, peter preparing to propose to MJ, Sandman's very weird origin(how can you confuse a bird with a human, and why is the dialogue hilariously unnatural in the lab), but good motivations, the Spiderman festival, Gwen Stacy and more.<br/><br/>The issue with this movie really is how cluttered it is. There's 3 villains being the unnecessary Venom, the underdeveloped Sandman and the underused Harry. Harry should've been the focus of the film. He's been set up since the beginning, but then he gets amnesia and it becomes a mess.<br/><br/>Sandman could've been great. His motivations make sense, and he's not really a ""bad guy"" but we needed more time with him.<br/><br/>Venom was also kinda good, I mean peter basically ruins his career and steals his GF, but he just feels tacked on, and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) was kinda weird. I feel like he should've been a bit more serious, but I do think he was pretty good, but also underdeveloped.<br/><br/>I do think Harry was fantastic though. He starts becoming his father and it was really good how he starts attacking peter emotionally.<br/><br/>Black suit Spiderman is amazing though, I love it. Also the theme for it is great.
The music is great again and maybe even better than the other movies.<br/><br/>Honestly the movie feels so choppy with everything that happens I can't remember clearly how the movie progresses. Peter getting the symbiote on him and becoming EMO PETER was so weird, I don't understand what they were thinking. They should've made him more aggressive, and peter should've tried to control himself from becoming a bad guy or something similar, but peter just becomes weird and rude. I mean dang he ruined Eddie's Career, and steals his GF, and then tries to make MJ jealous with Gwen, and then straight up hits MJ, WOAH WHAT HAPPENED?!?
It's so hard to watch Peter such a kind guy become such a terrible person, and it could've worked, but it's just done is such a weird way, and it's just not good.<br/><br/>Peter getting rid of the symbiote and Eddie getting it was some of the most convenient BS I have ever seen, take Venom out of the film and it would've been much better. You can set up Eddie, but wait till the next movie or another one.<br/><br/>Despite saying a lot of bad things about this movie I do think it has a lot of good, I mean the villains are pretty good, and Peter's redemption is great.<br/><br/>MJ unfortunately is still a damsel in distress, and Peter and her still have no chemistry. Harry stealing MJ was genius, but honestly it made MJ even more annoying and unlikeable.<br/><br/>Another good thing is the action. It's pretty good, but not as good as Spiderman 2, and also the CGI looks even more dated in this movie for some reason.<br/><br/>I also love how Sandman is the actual killer of Uncle Ben. It brings some great conflict between Peter and him. Peter going too far and actually ""killing"" him in the sewers was great too. I think this is what the symbiote should've done, instead of making him emo.<br/><br/>After realizing what he did was wrong it really strengthens Peter as a character. Peter's Arc in the movie is great though, it could've been handled better, but it's still really good, and it works. Peter has always been great in this trilogy and he continues to become a deeper character, and he honestly does feel like a real person.<br/><br/>I do like the fact that the villains team up. I mean it makes sense, and up until this movie It was never really done.<br/><br/>The last fight with Peter and Harry was really good. To see 2 best friends fight and betray each other is really heart breaking after 3 movies and it's done very well. The third act is really good, with Harry finally coming back after realizing that Peter didn't kill Norman and both villains attacking Spiderman however MJ is a hostage for the third time... The Battle has the most stakes we've ever gotten and it really feels like Spiderman could die? To see everyone's beloved hero be actually beaten is painful to watch, but then Harry coming back and having their friendship restored at the last second was really good. They feel like they are actual friends.<br/><br/>Harry's death was really emotional sacrificing himself for peter. It's one of those deaths where it's been set up since the beginning and it was pretty unpredictable. His death is genuinely sad. Venom's death is convenient again. Sandman asking for forgiveness is another great scene. Realizing what both Peter and him have done just makes both characters better, and I would've loved to see more sandman. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was a great character but should've been had more time.<br/><br/>Overall the movie, like this review, was a mess. However it had a lot of good, but a lot of bad too. It's sad to see this trilogy end on its worst movie, oh well...<br/><br/>5.9/10"
"jbyrd-9","10","2","8","8 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 is a great movie despite heavy criticism
","In my opinion Spider-Man 3 is a fantastic movie even though it falls short of the greatness that was Spider-Man 2. If Spider-Man 3 was released ahead of its predecessors as the first Spider-Man it would not have had to deal with such heavy criticism and would have gotten better reviews from the critics. However since this movie is the third installment of the Spider-Man trilogy it had to live up to the greatness that was Spider-Man 2. Therefore the main reason I have decided to even post a comment about this movie is to 1.) Help those who haven't seen the movie get an idea of how great the movie is despite its flaws, and 2.) Rebut other people's views about what was wrong with the movie. A movie is never going to satisfy everyone, and because of that people are going to have complaints. <br/><br/>I would first like to address the complaints about this movie being too crammed with plots, characters, and so on. This is true, to a degree. One of the things that helped make the first two Spider-Man movies so great was the fact that they could end the movie with some unanswered questions, there was no need to tie up all the loose ends because the next movie would do that. However Spider-Man 3, which is suppose to be the final Spider-Man, movie had the weight of all the unanswered questions from the first two movies which needed to be answered in this final installment. Not only does Spider-Man 3 have to tie up all the loose ends from the previous movies but it also introduces 2 new villains, a new pretty girl, Peter Parker personal demons, plus competition at the Daily Bugle. With all that said it sounds like too much right??? Wrong!!! It's almost too much. Although this movie does have a lot going on, director Sam Raimi does a fantastic job of juggling all the plots, characters, and action sequences to allow for everything to tie together beautifully in the end. I personally would rather have a movie that had a lot going on in it than not enough. I have been to movies where I felt that there wasn't enough going on and wished that they had error on the side of putting too much into the movie than not enough. Regardless Spider-Man 3 sets the bar for how much you can stuff into a movie and still have it be a great movie.<br/><br/>On another note some even feel that some of the characters in the movie (like Venom) needed more time to develop. Ironically those who I have heard complain about there not being enough character development are those who are die hard Spider-Man fans and already know everything there is to know about the characters. These people are being picky and unreasonable. If you wanted more in depth character development you are looking at splitting Spider-Man 3 (which remember is ""suppose"" to be the last one) into two movies rather than just the one, and I'm willing to bet that if they did split Spider-Man 3 into two different movies someone would be complaining that they could have combined the two movies into one. For those who are unaware of the characters prior to watching the movie or those who have never read a Spider-Man comic book, there is plenty of character development for every character in the movie. Now could there have been more character development, Yes, but there doesn't need to be more character development not only because of time constraints of how long a movie is expected to be but also because it would simply be a waste of time. <br/><br/>Yes Spider-Man 3, even though a great movie just how it is, could have lived up to the high expectations from movie critics by ousting either the Sandman or Venom which would have given more time to the villain kept, however director Sam Raimi isn't as concerned about the critics as he is the fans. Director Sam Raimi was NOT even going to have Venom in this movie; however the pressure from the big wigs over him kept pushing for Venom to be in the movie because of the loyal fans out there that wanted to see Venom on the silver screen. Lets just say for the sake of arguing that one of the villains was omitted from the movie. I personally feel that the movie would have had the ""been there done that"" feeling with just the one bad guy. Spider-Man fighting just one villain again would have been too mundane for me. Not only would it have been too mundane but it only seems logical that after the first two villains failed at beating Spidey one on one, that the next super-villain would want to out number Spidey to increase their odds of winning. Plus I sometimes like it when the odds are heavily against the super hero but yet the hero finds a way to prevail. <br/><br/>Now I could go on and on about how this movie has been unfairly judged but I will save you, the reader, the time and just tell you that the plots the characters, basically everything in the movie (despite some rushed CGI animation which all together is fantastic)is still solid and Spider-Man 3 is definitely worth seeing."

"greg-1984","1","2","9","13 April 2010"," Hate with a passion
","I loved the spiderman cartoons when I was a kid and it breaks my heart to see one of it's greatest villains, Venom, trashed like this. First of all bad choice of villains. Sandman was never that popular and lets face it wasn't well written as a character, all they did was give him a sick daughter to ensure that spidey wouldn't kill him. Harry as green goblin was an OK choice but so underused, amnesia wow thats original, why not have him as a constant threat in the background? That could have lead on to spidey needing more strength to beat him and cause him to use the black suit. Also the symbiote was meant to turn spidey evil, in previous versions (cartoons/comics) he almost killed someone because of it's influence, this version made him dance down the street like a drunk. And what was the catalyst for ripping of the suit? Hitting Mary Jane by accident, don't get me wrong thats a despicable thing to do but it didn't really give the impression that the suit was taking over him and why did he go to the bell tower to get rid of it? Like I said there was no indication that the suit was literally taking control of his body so he could have easily gone home and got rid of it there. Replace that idiotic montage of him dancing down the street and replace it with scenes of him being more violent with criminals, I know it's a family movie but still at least give a hint that the symbiote's turning him bad I would like to review venom as a character but he wasn't in it long enough to review. Next why have him loved by the city? Keep the constant pressure of hate form the bugle feeds his repressed aggression. I know it's a small point but it's a personal annoyance. To summarise; I hate hate hate this movie don't watch it."

","When this movie came out, I went and saw it in theaters with a friend. I enjoyed the new villain Sandman and liked how they made Harry Osborne (James Franco) the successor and avenger to his late father's legacy. And then there was also Venom. Forced? Yes. Interesting? Maybe. Needed? Maybe not. Not only that, we got the Gwen Stacy plot line, which I could have done without to be honest. Maybe if they left out Venom and Gwen Stacy, this could have been a better movie. The ending death scene made me tear up and I cannot watch that part anymore without feeling a sense of sadness. I don't care if it was fake or forced; it got to me. My instincts and feelings paint a different picture when it comes to certain death scenes. In fact, I'm getting them now. But don't let that get to you. Try to watch this and avoid the later Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield. And if you want something better, give the MCU Spider-Man films a go. I know I will soon!"

"stormhawk2020","1","1","3","9 July 2017"," The curse of the years ending with ""7"" of the superhero films
","Watching ""Spider-man 3"" has come to mind a contest I particularly liked, the weakest rival. More than anything because with this film could be organized a similar contest, but would be called the strongest rival. It would gain who could take more time viewing this infection without leaving the room.<br/><br/>The film is clearly divided into two very differentiated parts; A first half boring, dull and with an argument more proper of a soap opera than a Marvel comic. The second half is directly an insult, an unworthy, soulless and unbearable garbage.<br/><br/>At the same height as Sidney Furie's ""Superman IV: The Quest of Peace"" (1987) and Joel Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin"" (1997), Sam Raimi is dedicated to giving us a script that kicks up to the balls the original Spider- man comic and that reduces the characters to simple puppet theaters of themselves. There are times when I have come to ask if it was not before a gross parody, because what I saw could not really be serious.<br/><br/>If the script is bad, it is also possible to speak about performance and direction. From the first it all boils down to the following: many characters, little history, little psychological depth and the end result: insensitive performances at best (James Franco), mostly inconsequential (Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, James Cromwell, Bryce Dallas Howard) and wicked in the couple protagonist. From the direction, nothing at all, camera movements at all rags, a lot of video clip, paste some American flags that are always grateful and waste millions of dollars in digital effects copied from ""The Mummy"".<br/><br/>In short, a debacle in the whole rule. Not that the previous deliveries were wonderful, but they maintained a certain dignity, characteristic that Sam Raimi has lost in filming this, and still to continue charging. If he had a modicum of decency, he should retire from the cinema, only to not continue to offend his own legacy and above all because of the offense that has caused Spider-Man fans.<br/><br/>The best: Now ""The Ghost Rider"" seems to me in comparison, a masterpiece. The worst: So much promotion for this? Shame!"
"wiholke2020","6","1","3","7 July 2017"," Spider-Man 3 is the worst Spider-Man film, but it's not terrible.
","Spider-Man 3 is the third and final film in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and stars the same cast from the first film plus new actors and actresses such as Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy and Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom. And yes this movie is very disappointing.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 followed the wonder that was Spider-Man 2. This film had to satisfy fans, bring epic closure to the film, and finish the character arches in a way that made sense. And this movie failed to do all of those things. Don't get me wrong. This isn't Batman and Robin bad it's just disappointing. For those that have not seen the trilogy, I am going to talk about this film and the rest of the trilogy in detail, so you have been warned.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the satisfaction. Yeah there is barely any. Throughout the movie, sub plots and new characters are being thrown into the mix at random points. One example is when Peter and Aunt May find out Uncle Ben's killer is actually someone else and he is still at large and he happens to be one of the villains in this movie: The Sandman. I can accept that, but they threw it in the middle of the film when it could have been one of the first things the film introduces. It's a surprise that was out of place. I also feel like it was thrown in to have people care about Sandman more even though we were given a reason to care already. Sandman just wants to take care of her sick daughter which also stupidly keeps a locket of herself. And do not get me started on how Sandman becomes Sandman. After running from the police and punching a dog, Flint Marko stumbles upon a silicon experiment. The scientists even notice a change in the silicon mass but the don't even bother to see what it is and they just assume it's a bird. It's very dumb. As long as we are talking about Sandman, let's talk about his action scenes. They are very unmemorable and the special effects look bad which makes Sandman a cheesy villain just like he was in the comics. What Spider-Man 2 did well was take a cheesy villain, Doctor Octopus, and improve upon his character. Spider-Man 3 tried, but failed. Not to say all of his scenes were bad. The train scene, which I will talk about later, actually was pretty good.<br/><br/>Also, a symbiote landed on Earth, right next to Peter and MJ making out, but they don't notice. The symbiote follows Peter and stays in his room for God knows how long, and finally attached to Spidey's suit, creating Black Suit Spider-Man. The problem is Peter doesn't question it. He just automatically loves it and accepts it. We learn that the symbiote is slowly making Pete evil. The problem with that is the way they execute it. His hair color changes from black to brown whenever he takes off the black suit. He flirts with girls all the time and dances sexually all the time down the streets. This is without a doubt the low point of all the Spider-Man films.<br/><br/>How are the character arches? Too filled with side characters ruining everything. Peter and MJ literally have two love triangles to worry about. One of which we have seen before in the first Spider-Man film. Harry Osborne is the new Goblin. And he is taken down easily and loses his memory in the first twenty minutes of the movie. What a let down. But he comes back later when MJ feels lonely and the story needs to have something else going on. Gwen Stacy is shoe horned in to have more tension between Peter and MJ when this movie was already filled with a lot of other crap. Eddie Brock cheats at his job and is disliked by Peter Parker and when Peter rips of his black suit, the symbiote lands on Eddie and he turns into a terribly executed Venom for like five minutes. This movie is packed like crap. It's annoying and very distracting. <br/><br/>Luckily the whole movie isn't like that. There are good scenes. The train scene with Sandman and Black Suit Spiderman. Great special effects for the most part and great action and lighting. Venom's reveal and Peter ripping off the symbiote was very well directed. Aunt May is always good in the movie. Kirsten Dunst had a very nice performance. Her performance was probably better than Tobey McGuire's or James Franco's. Gwen Stacy makes very smart choices and she felt like the only one to make smart choices in the scenes she was in. And Harry and Peter teaming up to fight Venom and Sandman at the end was also beryl good, even though both Sandman and Venom were terribly executed villains.<br/><br/>I don't hate this movie, but I am disappointed it was no where near the level of Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2."
"alexanderdavies-99382","4","1","3","2 July 2017"," The weakest of the trilogy.
","A few things hinder this last ""Spiderman"" film before those terrible new films. Firstly, the character of Eddie Brock/Venom is physically so wrong. In the comics, he was a very tall and strapping person of 6 feet 4 inches and weighing about 290 pounds of muscle. In ""Spiderman 3,"" he looked about 5 feet 8 and weighing about 150 pounds. How on earth someone could have got this wrong I can't imagine. The next problem is Toby Maguire. He was truly out of his depth in attempting to play Peter Parker/Spiderman as being conceited or evil after the black costume invades him. His performance is shockingly bad and he looks a right prat! As a result, Maguire's career was killed off and he was labelled box office poison. The villain of the Sandman worked a little better. If the plot had stuck with him and had avoided including the black Spiderman costume, then this film might have worked. The look that Harry Osborn had as the new Green Goblin was a lazy and unimaginative one. The running time is far too long, just under two hours would have been an improvement. The one saving grace, was the climax. It was quite well handled and there was a bit of tension. A disappointing finish after the brilliance of the first two films."

","It is too much, far too much, that is where the movie failed. It assumed that there needed to be more, more villains, more action, higher stakes, and at the end the film suffered for it.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin, Venom, the Sandman, there were three major villains and three villain stories to tell and as a result the film lost focus.<br/><br/>Not that it didn't have it's charms.<br/><br/>Topher Grace isn't exactly the buff Eddie Brock we know from the comic books, but he works splendidly in a Raimi vision of Spider Man. He is the perfect foil for Tobey Maguire's character.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church doesn't exactly fall to the bottom either. He adds a depth to a character that is allowed only so little screen time in a jumbled film.<br/><br/>The problem isn't with the cast, the cast was great. And as usual Raini does an excellent job at directing.<br/><br/>It's not as horrible as people say.<br/><br/>The problem comes in with the plot itself, the script, there was too much.<br/><br/>The tags the trailers, everything hinted towards Venom and Venom should have been the driving force behind the film. Had they stayed with a singular villain and not cut the movie into three little plot lines, it would have been a nicely streamlined success.<br/><br/>Instead, however, they tried to throw too many at the audience at once, just like they did with the Batman movies, and just like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, Spider Man 3 became a disjointed mess of a film."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","23 February 2015"," Another step down, but not a complete failure
","""Spider-Man 3"" is the final installment from Sam Raimi's trilogy on everybody's favorite spider. In contrast to films 1 and 2, it did not achieve any Academy Award nominations (let alone wins), but ended up as the most successful film from 2007 in terms of box office. 3 years earlier, only the second ""Shrek"" movie was seen more often than ""Spider-Man 2"", but in 2007 ""Spider-Man 3"" beat ""Shrek 3"". Unfortunately, this does not mean that it is as good as the second film. It's slightly worse and way worse than the first in my opinion. I would not go so far and say that this was due to Raimi being involved with writing for the first time too here, but it had more to do with the fact that 4 superheroes/villains are just too many for one movie. The previous 2 films worked so well because it was this 1 vs 1 mentality that shone both times. Part 3 is also the longest film so far and they certainly could have cut it down a bit, for example why include Harry's amnesia early on if he turns out the way he ended up in film 2 anyway. A bit of a pointless inclusion.<br/><br/>Talking about Harry, this is almost more of a Green Goblin film than a Spider-Man movie. James Franco became more and more popular than Maguire, so he got most of the interesting scenes here and easily much more character development. Also he ends up saving Spidey's life more than once and it is very telling that the franchise pretty much ended with his death. Back to the villains here, they are just both fairly forgettable. While I liked the way that Venom was animated, they simply could have done so much more with the character, but definitely came short here. Also, Topher Grace's character is the only antagonist from the trilogy, who has no real ""justifiable"" events happening that make him turn evil. James Cromwell plays a nothing character and even Rosemary Harris has no material that she can shine with just like in the last two films. It's fairly ridiculous how Parker always reveals himself as Spider-Man in situations where everybody could actually see him, like early on during that date with Mary Jane. Talking about Mary Jane, she needs to be rescued once again at the end. Getting a bit old by now. Another criticism would be that it is just too much of a coincidence that it's exactly the guy who shot Ben who turns into a sand mutant.<br/><br/>Well.. these were quite some negative points, but here and there, the film also had a couple strong moments. It's a movie about fatherhood, friendship, betrayal and forgiveness. If you liked films 1 and 2, you should still give this one a go and be it only for reasons of closure. Recommended."

But the story involving the relationships between the characters is horrible. Every relationship is a ""I'm locked up in my own opinions I'm not really going to listen to what you have to say"" or some other information withholding type. By the end of the film the whole story turns around when the butler tells some key information that he could have, and should have, told at any time since Spiderman 1. At that point I had to stop the film and go check the mirror to see if I had any hair left, or if I had pulled it all out. A few minutes later when we were supposed to feel sorry for a bad guy and forgive him for a murder (""he only did what he had to""), we were expected of course to ignore the probably hundred people or so we recklessly had killed throughout the movie. I didn't need to stop and check my hair in the mirror because I didn't have any. I admit I often shed a tear at the sad cry-scene at the end of movies.

If she's not in trouble, she's a whiny, impenetrably jealous woman with mood-swings on the dime. She becomes bent out of shape from one petty kiss Spider-Man shares with Gwen Stacy, who is in Peter Parker's chemistry class, after he is awarded the key to the city early on in the film. And if she's not whiny and jealous, she's dangling helplessly, ""x"" amount of feet from land in a vehicle secured by webs strung in all different directions. Oh, now where's that dirty, rotten, cheatin' Spider-Man when you need him? Spider-Man 3 is a rather depressing and unsatisfying conclusion to a franchise that hit the ground running with its divine human scope, wonderfully colorful and cinematic special effects, and worthy performances from its entire cast. The original Spider-Man film was impeccably rewarding and undeniably entertaining, but more importantly, should be known as more than popcorn entertainment, but intelligent entertainment, with an appreciation and fondness for the human behind the mask and bearing it. Its sequel was even more impressive, depicting the agonies and the weight of being a College kid, a freelance photographer, a moderately-devoted romantic, a best friend, and a serene crime-fighting superhero all in a day's work. The stress on Peter Parker's shoulders was unbearable and the film, brilliantly written and directed, conveyed the angst and pressure perfectly.<br/><br/>With the first film being more about familiarity with powers and the second film being more about the struggle of the job, I contemplated what the third film would focus on. I imagine the writers, Alvin Sargent and the brothers Raimi, Sam and Ivan, did as well. Apparently, none of them were easy to agree, because Spider-Man 3 feels like someone had a plethora of ideas and shot in the dark with most of them. The film tirelessly juggles five stern subplots, while seemingly trying to incorporate more, to the point of cinematic confusion.<br/><br/>We are greeted again with Peter Parker, again, played by the effortlessly charismatic Tobey Maguire, who plans to romantically propose to the long-suffering Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her musical debut on Broadway. During their date, we see a strange, extraterrestrial symbiote crash-land on Earth and attach itself to the back of Parker's moped. Meanwhile, criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who will later become ""The Sandman,"" has just escaped from prison, and is ostracized by his wife and daughter.<br/><br/>Before we go too much into that, the arrogant Harry Osborn (James Franco) returns and is infuriated at Peter Parker, who he believes is responsible for the death of his father in the first film. He carries on his dead father's orders to ""avenge"" him, and after a brazen fight in the New York City sky, Harry hits the ground hard and experiences short-term memory loss, making him forget his grudge towards Peter. He will inevitably regain his memory and transform into the ""New Goblin."" Before we go too much into that, Peter is also facing some harsh competition at ""The Daily Bugle"" newspaper (which is still run by the strict J. Jonah Jameson, continued to be played fantastically by J.K. Simmons) when Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), another freelance photographer, is hired by Jameson to try and catch Spider-Man doing something that would turn the town against him. Grace, who I continue to dub an underrated talent in film, plays Brock with admirable conniving instincts, and when he later must force himself into the role of ""Venom,"" he does a solid job for a villain so underwritten. Venom was a last minute addition to Spider-Man 3 and it greatly shows, since his story is given very minimal time to develop. The character of Brock, too, is only modestly fleshed-out, and his screen appearance is short when compared to the likes of Sandman and Osborn's ""Goblin."" Before we go too much into that, we can't forget Mary Jane is struggling to get work in the enormous state of New York. She continues to plod along in the vaguest of limelights, desperately trying to achieve her dream as a consistent Broadway performer, but reality gives her hard slaps to the face and the film is sure to try and illustrate those.<br/><br/>And let's really not forget that symbiote that attached to Peter's moped and will eventually alter his personality by clinging to his body, giving his red spidey suit an unwanted black makeover. This will too turn the geeky, socially-awkward Parker into an over-confident, boastful cad with dark eyeshadow and a Gothic-like persona.<br/><br/>There's Spider-Man 3 in the biggest nutshell I can find. I almost forgot to mention the redundancy in its sentimentality as well. This is without a doubt the sappiest Spider-Man extravaganza we've gotten and are likely to ever get from a film based on this character. Everybody offers some sort of advice to Peter, several characters shed tears, even the villains (which tremendously obscures how we're supposed to look at The Sandman in particular, with sympathy? Forgiveness? Or just nihilistic impulse because he's a villain?). Despite some extremely well-done effects work, easily making this the most visually impressive and eye-catching film in the series, the overwrought nature, the depressingly underdeveloped subplots, the shorthanded villain backstories, the repetitive sentimentality that creates an atmosphere more self-depreciating and mawkish than need be, and the needlessly emphasized issues that should've been left as subtle as possible, Spider-Man 3 is a big budget mess and a big budget disappointment.<br/><br/>Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi."

","This movie would have been pretty good if they had left out the Venom plot line. Thomas Hayden Church is a fantastic villain, and he has a great back story, but the Venom/Brock nonsense was horrible. Although it never explains how Parker knew The Sandman was Church, or at least I didn't figure notice. Also, the part when The Sandman first gets wet is /incredibly cheesy/.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Gwen Stacy character either. She was a needless love interest which complicated things too much. Might I also add that Harry Osborn's butler is a crappy 'Michael Caine from Batman' ripoff. He's nothing more than a plot device.

"christian-carrion","4","1","3","3 April 2011"," Spider-Man 3 Review
","Not my favorite Spider-Man movie. It seemed like to much comedy was trying to be put into the movie. Peters ""Bad antics"" were shown as childish, and he didn't seem as much as a bad ass as he should've been. Ex: Dancing like a douche on the street, not paying attention to Dr. Connors while eating cookies. In some actions scenes people weren't soo into it, they were to calm and not as dramatic as they used to be in Spider-man 1-2. The part of Eddie Brock should not have been given to Topher Grace. Ii anything he'd make a better Spider-Man what with the rise cracks and cool moves. But Eddie Brock is a football player, an not a teenager. He's a big character in the comics and isn't shown as much as he should've been. Venom was not what i expected, he was spider-man's size, and wasn't as strong as he is. Another big character, Gwen Stacey, is also a big character shown in few scenes. She was also peter's love interest at one point but lack of drama put into the movie didn't show that. Spider-Man 3 = Fail. Hopefully the next movie will be better."
"dzyah","4","1","3","27 December 2010"," Was too long
","If it was about 45 minutes long I would have liked it. Half of the story was unnecessary filler. The story line was similar to any episode of the TV show Smallville except that Smallville doesn't have all the boring filler.<br/><br/>The acting was poor to average. Tobey Maguire does have on screen charisma but his charter worked much better in the first Siderman. Special effects where good, so for anyone watching a movie because they enjoy special effects Spiderman 3 would be OK. Overall it was similar to watching an episode of the TV show Smallville except that Smallville doesn't need all the boring filler to stretch it into a full length movie."
"chucknorrisfacts","1","1","3","13 March 2010"," Raimi sucks, Raimi sucks, watched his film and blew ten bucks!
","Ah, the third and now that Sony has officially announced plans to reboot the Spider-Man franchise, the final installment of Sam Raimi's awful Spider-Man trilogy.<br/><br/>Oh, how I've waited to review this sacrilege to anyone who considers themselves a comic book fan! Just when I didn't think Sam Raimi could sabotage Spidey any worse than he already had, he makes ""Spider-Man 3"".<br/><br/>Where do I begin? That's such a daunting question when having to select a point at which to begin tearing this movie a new one. I guess I'll start by saying that Tobey Maguire may very well give his worst performance of Peter Parker to date in this film, and that's really saying something. The other actors aren't much better either. Kirsten Dunst is still annoying, and James Franco who is usually enjoyable to watch also becomes irritating as well.<br/><br/>Casting is terrible once again, but what else would you expect from a Raimi Spider-Man flick by now? Topher Grace as Venom? Friggin' Forman from ""That 70s Show"" as the ""lethal protector""? Give me a break! <br/><br/>Lowell from ""Wings"" as the Sandman wasn't the greatest choice either, I mean, he was so boring his monotone delivery of lines almost put me to sleep.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy wasn't so hot either. I will say she is leaps and bounds better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, but that's nothing to brag about. Her character, Gwen isn't even really necessary, and it seems was only included to provide a lame love triangle subplot for Peter and Mary Jane. Besides, they had already veered off the comic continuity so much by the time this movie was released there was no hope in being able to give Gwen the story arc she really deserved.<br/><br/>The character development is nil. There are far too many villains in this movie, and never do they really take the time to delve deeper into any of them, and only give them the most superficial of treatment in the movie. Venom could have easily been the sole villain in this installment, but Sam Raimi hated the character and only put it in because Marvel bigwig Avi Arad told him to. His resentment shows, as what was one of Spidey's greatest foes in the comics is portrayed as one of the most one-dimensional characters I think I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Which, for me, was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>The ""emo"" scene in which Peter Parker bebops his way down a New York sidewalk was one of the most cringe worthy moments in any movie I've ever seen. Just embarrassing! I could go on and on, trust me, on just how bad this movie is, but why? If you're halfway intelligent you already know this, and if you're a comic book fan you definitely know this.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is terrible and effectively killed Raimi's run with the web-slinger. So, I guess for that I should be thankful, and I am. I just hope that Sony doesn't make the same mistakes twice, and actually does Spider-Man justice in the reboot.<br/><br/>Oh, and please dear God, do not cast Robert Pattinson, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or any other dork as Peter Parker. Parker may have been a little socially awkward in the comics, but he was most certainly not a complete loser.<br/><br/>Give us someone good this time, someone who can actually play both Peter Parker and Spider-Man convincingly. Is that so much to ask?"
"TFrenchy","1","1","3","2 June 2009"," Disappointing, Predictable and Over the top.
","I'll go through the good points of the film first although these are few in number. Firstly the effects are very good and so they should be considering the substantial budget this film had, the fight scenes are exciting and packed with action and the general idea for the storyline is good (with both Venom and Sandman) however this is also one of the major shortcomings.<br/><br/>All of the characters even Peter himself are poorly defined. As a lot of other critics have noted Venom gets around 10-15 minutes of airtime with almost no character development. Peter's 'dark' side is almost laughable as half of the film is spent observing him doing incredibly outlandish and over the top things that just look ridiculous, from walking down the street acting suave and trying to chat up ladies to a 2 minute dance scene in a jazz club. This reflects poorly on Tobey Maguire's acting which is usually pretty good but throughout the film he seems slightly fake and detached.<br/><br/>Overall I was very disappointed by the film often finding myself 20 minutes ahead of the action guessing CORRECTLY exactly what was going to happen. Honestly the script is so predictable its unreal.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but for such a highly anticipated film I was expecting much, much more."
"classicsoncall","7","1","3","24 April 2009"," ""You know, I guess one person CAN make a difference...""
","Unlike the first two Spider-Man films which I saw in theaters when they first came out, I sat this one out until last night to catch it on one of the cable channels. That decision was probably justified, as this one didn't feel like it had the heart of it's predecessors. Too many characters, too many sub-plots, too much of the angst ridden Peter Parker to take the joy out of the Spidey character. Growing up I wasn't much of a Marvel Comics fan, but you could tell that the film makers doing Marvel really had it together with their characters and writing. Even this one was pretty slick with the action and the special effects, but on the flip side, those elements might have been a negative as well - just a little too much and too over the top to produce any feeling of identification with the hero or his significant other. Not to mention the trillion to one (notice how economic stimulus has affected my thinking) coincidence of some outer space meteor depositing a tar-like symbiote right in Peter Parker's back yard, and not affecting any one else. You needed it for the story, but you just can't think about it for too long.<br/><br/>My favorite part, as always, catching the creator of Spider-Man in his expected cameo appearance - the great Stan Lee - uttering my summary line above. He went on to finish the sentence with the trademark Marvel zombie catch phrase - 'nuff said'. This will be the only time you'll hear it from me."

"Monarch_311","Null","1","3","21 March 2008"," Awful
","The third installment of the Spider-Man series is a massive disappointment and disgrace to what was hitherto one of the finer franchises in mainstream cinema. While the first and second Spider-Man films had their rough spots, they were overall manna from the Hollywood blockbuster heavens. Interesting stories involving realistic, multi-layered characters were told in adaptations of the original stories written by Stan Lee in the 1960s. Like the third installment of the X-Men series, this film does away with basing itself on original comic book content entirely and instead rewrites the death of Spider-Man's Uncle Ben for the sake of creating a conflicted but underdeveloped antagonist. In fact, all characters in this film are underdeveloped, except in the case of the leading man and lady who we would frankly be better off seeing a lot less of.<br/><br/>This film centers around a very boring relationship between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst.) None of the chemistry between the interesting, intelligent, emotional characters from the comic book resonates in the on-screen scenes of ""passion"" that would be sub-par by daytime soap opera standards. In such scenes, the same tired dialog concerning undying love is regurgitated ad infinitum in scenes of wooden acting. Both characters are lackluster shells of actual human beings not fit to carry a film. This is especially true in the case of Mary Jane, as Dunst is as uncharismatic on screen as she is physically unattractive. An entire article could be written about Dunst and how poor a choice she was for playing Mary Jane, though I do appreciate the unintentional irony of a talentless actress portraying a like talentless and struggling actress on screen. Still, we could have done without a female who bears such a close resemblance to the Masters of the Universe villain Skeletor. Throughout the film the romance between Peter and Mary Jane is silly and shallow; the acting is poor to non-existent. I actually laughed out loud on more than one occasion at scenes that were intended to be serious drama, particularly one in which a jilted Maguire sobs to himself on a bridge. <br/><br/>I've yet to really get into the plot and that's because there really isn't one, truth be told. Just a series of scenes that follow one another with no real sense of gelling. Villains are brought on screen in sequences that make little to no sense and rush by too quickly to make us really care about any of the three antagonists this film saddles us with. We don't fear or hate any of the bad guys, nor is it explained in any depth why either Sandman or Venom really got to be what they are. Some black goop falls from a meteor 10 feet away from Peter Parker (who doesn't notice the crash despite having a sixth sense) and then adheres itself first to Spider-Man then disgraced photographer Eddie Brock. Why? Where did it come from? How does it give its host enhanced strength and agility? Why is a physicist with no understanding of microbiology given a sample of the creature and how does he discern its evil nature? The director never thinks to explain any of these things, and none of what we see on screen bears any resemblance to canonical comic book storyline.<br/><br/>One of the greatest problems of this film is that it is based on a comic book but tries to take itself too seriously. The only times that this film stops taking itself seriously are the scenes that try (and fail) to be humorous and playful. In an unwarranted Emo makeover, Peter Parker models his new 'bad boy' look not after icons of masculinity or rebellion but after the highly effeminate lead singer of Panic! at the disco, wearing ""guy liner"" and combing his bangs forward. Actor Tobey Maguire reaffirms the stereotype that white people cannot dance when he engages in an impromptu boogie on a New York sidewalk before an audience of some awestruck young ladies. Of all the unrealistic happenings in the film, this moment played the falsest as there is no way on earth an attractive young girl would stand and watch this knave humiliate himself unless she were being paid to do so, let alone would she feign admiration on the back of it.<br/><br/>Shortly following this we're forced to sit through a similar scene that is literally painful to watch. Under the sinister control of the black goop from outer space (how and why is never explained,) Evil Peter enters a jazz club and engages in an impromptu solo on the dance floor. The scene is supposed to be playful and hip, but comes across as mock camp desperately trying for cool. If the scene were intentionally self satirical it would still fail to entertain the audience with its clumsiness, but as it is I have more than once heard the word ""embarrassing"" used to describe the scene. This film unwittingly denies itself the charm of the campy-classic Batman series of the 1960s by taking itself dead seriously at all of the wrong times.<br/><br/>Other cringe-inducing things include but are not limited to an obscenely forced shot of Spider-Man sprinting into action before the backdrop of an American flag, constant misuses of the character J. Jonah Jameson that only serve to distract the viewer from more interesting events happening on screen, and deplorable dialog and acting from 'reporters' covering the misadventures of Spider-Man (who is inexplicably a public darling in this film, unlike the comic book or previous films).<br/><br/>The highlight of this film is a two second clip of Harry Osborne (James Franco) eating pie in a cafÃ©. In this scene Harry is celebrating his success in a cruel game played on his best friend and worst enemy, Peter Parker. For once I found myself laughing with a character on screen instead of at them."

","Let me first start criticizing the director, Sam Raimi: Spiderman 1, great movie no doubt, even if he made a tiny error such as giving peter the ability to shoot webs without cartridges, no need to stab him for that. Spiderman 2, perfect sequel, not huge fan of doc. octopus but great movie. Now... where to begin with the errors of Spiderman 3... Well first off, he made peter into an ignorant moron who decides to kiss ""someone"" on national TV, in front of a crowd of 1000's of people knowing that Mary Jane is watching... stupid... The suit... if you're like me, who watched the 90's series, Spiderman - the animated series, you know what I'm talking about. The only thing Sam Raimi got right about the suit was the shade of the suit. Ne who, the suit in the movie was just a spray-paint of his original one... In the show, it had some weird design on the chest which resembled a bigger spider and had no web-patterns on it whatsoever. Pure black. Secondly, as you saw in the previews, peter is holding his Symbiote suit as if it were a piece of clothing - WRONG! The suit is supposed to appear and disappear from his body at will. Now, if you think that I'm angry because of peter's acting and the suit design, not even; those are just stuff that adds oil to the fire. The thing that bothered me the most is venom... Omg, Sam Raimi clearly did not follow the spider-man comics at all... The name venom was born because it symbolizes both Eddie Brock's and the Symbiotes hate for Peter/Spiderman... ""Our hate is like poison to you"". In the show, shocker and rhino wanted to gang up on Spiderman but venom didn't want that and took them out easily so he could fight Spiderman 1v1. In this movie, he does quite the opposite and asks for Help, i wont say who for spoilers. I expected venom to be some huge buff guy and beat the crap out of Spiderman but no, Sam Raimi chooses Topher Grace, who is well known to be the skinniest actor alive (not to hate on Topher, awesome dude from that 70's show). There is one more thing i'd like to complain about but its a huge spoiler and it is what harry did in the end... it made me so angry that I thought this was a rip-off of sesame street. Peter and Harry joining forces?? The moment the green-gas was inhaled by Harry, he should have been the crazed maniac like his father. I hear a lot of people saying the main reason the movie was bad is because it had too many villains and not even time... No, this movie could have been good, and I guarantee if someone like Peter Nolan (director of batman begins) made Spiderman 3, it would've been great. Now that my hate is spread throughout the world, I can now rest in peace."

Kirsten Dunst from Interview with a vampire? Awesome! Bryce Dallas Howard from The village? She's the best! Well, last night everything turned 180 degrees about them for me. Now my trust is over. Sorry, but this movie was nothing for me just 2 and a half wasted hours. But I think I'll tell my opinion with my reaction to one scene.<br/><br/>When Harry Osborn/New Goblin (James Franco is still the best!!!) is dying at the end of the movie, I just couldn't stop laughing - sunrise, last touching word, crying, et cetera. What is it, damn it? I think at that point nobody cried - so, almost everybody laughed. I think this tells everything about the dramatic scenes of this movie. Even the worst comic movies had better scenes sometimes - even Daredevil or Hulk, too! This is not even the worst scene I think. When Tobey Maguire gets infected and evil, and plays the cool guy everywhere...That' not cool, not cute, not everything, just awful! Or Bryce Dallas Howard - she gave me the creeps... And the new villains...maybe there were too much of them for the director to control: Thomas Haden Church (Sandman), Topher Grace (Venom) and James Franco as New Goblin - they just became pieces of CGI near a CGI Spider - Man. The villains of the first two movies was much-much better (and there were one of them for each film...) But I think I should tell some stuff what I liked in this movie. J. K. Simmons is still awesome, Ted Raimi, with his clumsy attitude still made me laugh, James Franco was the best, and STAN LEE! When he showed up, I unconsciously shouted ""F**k it, it's Stan Lee!"" So, to sum it all up: I don't want more sequels. Let him go, Mr Raimi, and try to do something else. But please, choose wisely!"

","Since I wasn't really wowed by Spider-Man 2, I had low expectations for Spider-Man 3, so I can't say I was disappointed. But the overall consensus is correct: this movie was too ambitious for its own good. There's simply too much going on, and as a result every subplot is underdeveloped, especially Venom's story. Of course the action is excellent, I wouldn't expect less from a Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>*Major Spoilers* First, let me get this out of the way: Venom. Venom is one of the top three Spider-Man villains, and he's reduced to a ten minute role. He should have gotten his own movie. Period. I suspect Avi Arad and Sony pushed Raimi to include him, since nobody is sure if Maguire or Dunst will return.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Peter Parker actually having some good luck for a change. He's happy with his love life and his job, and he finally decides to propose to Mary Jane. Unfortunately Mary Jane gets fired, and Spider-Man really acts out of character when he kisses Gwen Stacy in public. Of course this puts a strain on their relationship, but compared to the first two movies, their problems feel forced, almost artificial. I'm getting the impression Kirsten Dunst wanted a more dramatic role this time around. (Harry later exploits the tension which leads to a very poorly acted scene on a bridge).<br/><br/>Things begin to look more bleak when the Alien symbiote crashes in an asteroid and latches itself onto Peter. Unfortunately, the movie seems to assume the audience knows what the symbiote is already. Not every audience member is going to have comic book knowledge, Mr. Raimi! The symbiote turns Peter Parker into this weird Emo kid, which just makes a mockery of the symbiote's effect IMO. In an embarrassing sequence, he starts dancing down the street like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. <br/><br/>Harry takes on the Green Goblin mantle from his father. While this story wasn't as bad as the treatment of the symbiote or Venom, it was underdeveloped and lazily told, and it is the biggest disappointment for me. Harry conveniently gets amnesia after hitting his head in a battle scene, so the movie can pretty much ignore his plot to kill Spider-Man for half of the movie. Harry just wanders around in the background again like in Spider-Man 2. Harry's story should have focused more on overcoming his father's influence and reconciling with Peter. Instead, Harry only decides to help Peter fight Sandman and Venom after his butler tells him that Norman Osborne was killed by his jet-glider. Not only does the butler have no way of knowing how he was impaled by the jet-glider, but you would think he wouldn't have waited two years to tell him! He would have saved Harry a lot of emotional trauma! Still, the conclusion of Harry's plot is a tear-jerker, and Franco gives a good performance.<br/><br/>The second villain in this movie is Flint Marko, who becomes a corny sand monster that you would expect to see in a Godzilla movie. Raimi tries to make him sympathetic by portraying him as a man who made a few mistakes, but who is now willing to do anything to save his seriously ill daughter. Church gives a touching performance with a contrived character. We find out he actually killed Uncle Ben, but I find it hard to believe the police would keep this information from the Parkers for two years. His scenes are scattered throughout the movie and he just doesn't make a strong impression. He teams up with Venom to take MJ hostage in order to draw Spider-Man out. When the battle is over, he does a complete 180 and acts all apologetic. I'm sorry, but when you agree to help murder people I can't buy your apology! <br/><br/>This movie obviously needed some reworking, but it's not all bad. Its greatest strengths are good action scenes, and some good acting from JK Simmons (always hysterical as JJ). Despite the embarrassing symbiote scenes I described earlier, the scenes where black suit Spidey became angry (especially with Sandman) were excellent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I think this is the end of the Spider-Man series. MJ and Peter's relationship has progressed as far as it can, just short of marriage. There are few villains left in the archives that can compare to the grand spectacle of Spider-Man 3's villains. Oh well, Spider-Man 3 carries the tradition of third entries in comic book franchises that can't compare to the first two."

","OK, hearing that it was the best Spider-man movie yet, I was so excited when my dad decided to take us to watch it! I was telling myself that it was going to be super! (I loved the other 2 movies). Yet, what a disappointment. Something went so terribly wrong.. I don't know about you, but I felt the movie was too detached, there were too many villains(although at first, I was excited about the 3 villains) for Spider-man to handle and well, it was too romantic! I agree that it proved to me of why I love Spider-man the most out of the other action heroes, that he is just an ordinary guy who is down-to-earth who screws up every now and then, but this was just to soapy!! No doubt the effects and actions were awesome, but let's face it..that isn't everything! In terms of storyline, it was a total mess! It was like a song, having a beautiful melody and the world's best musicians to play it, but having a lyrics that does not make sense! And another thing I've notice, people started to walk out after 2 hours and more couldn't wait to walk out before the movie really ended! So maybe I wasn't the only one who thought it kinda sucked. I still love Spider-man and I still love the sequels, just not this one."

Its just that, 'There is always a room at the top' also comes with the previous saying, and hence, even a little mistake might allow others to overtake you or point fingers at you or get some fingers pointed at you.<br/><br/>Spiderman-III, is an entertainer. It has got some good acting, music, story, action, and you would enjoy watching it with your friends, family or alone:) I won't say much more about the movie.

","They could have made another 30 very good movies for this budget. Spiderman 1 is still 100x better than number 3. They should stop with the cash-cow approach in Hollywood, and become more imaginative and creative! The movie is filled with ""cheap"" special effects, where it's very clear that Spiderman is a 3D animation, rather than a ""real"" character. Even my 12 year old son thought it was disappointing compared to number one (and two). I had hoped they would raise the bar with this one - meaning the bar that allows you to think you're in the movie, rather than being a spectator. Movies should bring emotions, and the more the better - this movie didn't bring any emotions over, I mean, none! It's time for more Stanley Kubricks, Alfred Hitchcocks and Roberto Benignis, as I think the world has seen enough Spidermans for the next 100 years. At least I have :)"

","Come on, there are a lot of really bad reviews out there for SM3, but it only really seems as bad considering the last two were so good. Comparing this to fantastic four for example, SM3 is a much better movie. Plus, there's a lot of talk about how stupid some of the plots points are such as the black suit coincidentally finding Peter of all people. Thats stupid right? HELLO! Straight out of the comics people, it is a comic book movie after all. Sure, the movie had its problems, but people are talking about it like its ""From Justin to Kelly"" for Gods sake. The action sequences were Stellar with great great acting for the most part. Raimi just simply tried to squeeze too much into 1 sitting. It was a fun movie, but people seemed to be expecting it to be the new Godfather or something. Geez, lighten up people and have fun."
"jflizard","8","1","3","12 May 2007"," Great visual movie, not so good storyline, BUT...
","It's not unusual that people comment on a movie like they're looking for mistakes in the plot, or searching very deep for the weakest points in it, just to give a so-so-rating. Spiderman is one of those kinds of movies... It has some weak points, the story sometimes seems to forget one or other character, and then in the end they all come together like it was so natural. The sandman isn't such a bad guy but seems to be a bit too violent for a person who is just trying to save it's kid... a bit greedy isn't him? And if he's not a killer, why'd he agree to kill spiderman so easily?... OK, you can add lots of other bad things in the plot, you'll find'em, but isn't it supposed to be an entertaining movie? Yes, and to put the bad guys together Eddie, wearing the black suit finds the sandman in a blink and make in an allie in less than 5 seconds!! Besides that, and concentrating on the action itself, Spiderman 3 has a very good pace, and most of the situations happen in a ""natural"" way, entertaining a lot (which is it's main purpose). The special effects are great, lots of CGI of course, but even that is getting better and better, and now Spiderman jumps and action seems more real than ever! That was one of the reasons I went to watch the movie! The black suit is really nice and it was a really good story to pick from (will it return? there is a little sample on the laboratory where Parker left it to be analyzed)...<br/><br/>I am Spiderman fan since I was a kid, although I stop reading the comics long ago, but this movie is probably the best in the series, mainly because it's superb special effects and CGI. Because of that, all the weak points aren't enough to say ""it's not a good movie""..."
"salilgoyal","4","1","3","12 May 2007"," Why the world doesn't need a Spiderman?
","All right, I spent 100 bucks to see this one because I was desperate to see despite the bad reviews this movie has got? This is what I have to say- Spiderman 3 is a disappointment and a big one indeed. I wish to suggest few names for this movie-<br/><br/>Spiderman and Mary Jane. Spiderman and Baby Goblin. Spiderman and Sandman. Spiderman and Venom. Spiderman and the new photographer. Spiderman and Miss Stacy. Spiderman and Aunty May. Confused-man.<br/><br/>And the best one suggested by good old friend 'Arjun Shankar' Peter Parker and family. And really, that's what it is. <br/><br/>These are not just names but eight stories desperately clubbed into a 2½ hours movie by the movie makers. Anyways, here's what the movie's all about-<br/><br/>-Spoiler Alert-<br/><br/>A happy Peter Parker who is excited that people are mad about Spiderman. A tensed Mary Jane (MJ) whose stage career is in jeopardy. A confused Harry Osborne who is yet to decide whether he actually needs revenge from Spiderman. But he finally decides and tries to kill Peter Parker. As an amateur goblin, he fails and loses. Peter rescues him and Osborne suffers an interim memory loss (like a normal character in an abnormal Ekta Kapoor serial). He forgets that Peter is Spiderman and they again become friends. But soon he remembers everything seeing his dad's portrait (again an Ekta Kapoor twist) and is back to his abnormal bad. <br/><br/>Then we have a Sandman aka Flint Marko who appears from nowhere as Uncle Ben's real killer. He escapes from prison and lands onto a huge pile of sand where some stupid experiment in underway which makes him Sandman. Police tells Peter than Sandman is the one who killed Uncle Ben and Sandy and Spidey start dhishum-dhishum after that.<br/><br/>Then there is a piece of trash called Venom who lands onto earth like a meteor and coincidentally finds the luna (bike) of Peter to hide (Wow) . He then silently develops and later gets into the body of Spiderman. We have a new spidey now. Black suited, strong and a selfish spidey. MJ (on pressure from baby goblin) ditches Peter and the bad Peter begins to date a model called Stacy who is the crush of Peter's rival photographer Eddie. Peter hits MJ accidentally and feels guilty. He then quits the new suit. Venom tries to find a new identity and coincidentally finds none other than Eddie who for some reasons, was there in the church where Peter was quitting Venom. Eddie now becomes new venom and is looking to take revenge from Spidey.<br/><br/>Baby Goblin realizes that Peter didn't kill his father when his servant, after so many years, tells him that his father (green goblin) killed himself. Baby Goblin and Spidey now form a tag team and take on Venom and Sandman. And the tag team Champions are Baby Goblin aka Osborne and Spiderman. But Osborne sacrifices himself and dies. Sandman compromises with Spidey and goes away and Venom is killed by Spiderman's knowledge of resonance theory. Venom is susceptible to bell-like sounds and Peter gathers few alloy rods and hits them continuously until venom vanishes. MJ and Peter again start their relationship and the story ends with Osborne's funeral.<br/><br/>However, the few pluses are there in the movie. Osborne's character was a bit confused but James Franco who played the role has acted quite brilliantly. Unfortunately, we will no longer see him in future sequels (if tried). Thomas Haden Church (Sandman) was quite good as well despite his outdated character.<br/><br/>So, the final question that arises is, have movie makers left something for spidey 4? Maybe. For example, A tiny piece of venom is still left with Peter's professor. We don't know exactly whether venom has died or not. Sandman may return as Uncle Ben's replacement. Aunt May is still alive. Peter is yet to marry MJ to produce a baby-spidey.<br/><br/>On the whole, Spiderman 3 is a disappointment which may prompt filmmakers to make a sequel to end the series on a high note. You can definitely watch the movie for action but don't expect anything else. And yes I forgot. While watching the movie, I was thinking that MJ will come out as a sultry and super-sexy spider-woman but that obviously didn't happen."

"I_Am_The_Taylrus","8","1","3","11 May 2007"," Good, But Not The Best Spidey Film (SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I was very anxious and excited about seeing Spiderman 3. I mean, it was highly anticipated and one of the most expensive films ever made. When I saw the mere rating of 6.8 I was a bit nervous, though. Spiderman 1 has 7.4 and Spiderman 2 has 7.8, and this has 6.8. Still, I had a great time watching and this is probably the worst Spiderman movie, but come on, 6.8? It at least deserves a 7.1. Sure, there were flaws, the middle was over-the-top and cheesy, and the plot was complex but this is the ultimate popcorn movie. Oh, let me tell you about the plot, I knew the plot was complex from the beginning, but I am still debating how I am going to write a synthesis for the plot. Yeah, the plot is very hard to put into words, but if you just watch and do not need to worry about commenting on it it is not the hardest thing in the world.<br/><br/>This was probably the saddest Spiderman yet. I mean, the whole thing about Sandman's dying daughter and how he did not mean to kill Uncle Ben was really sad. Also, Harry DID NOT need to be killed off. The same with Venom. They were some of the most important Spiderman characters and they were just killed off in the third movie? Come on. Oh, and by the way, Venom seemed to be just thrown in there. He, one of the most important Spiderman villains of all time, was just there for roughly twenty minutes, and then killed. <br/><br/>Useless? Yes.<br/><br/>This is also, probably, the funniest Spiderman. All the scenes with J. Jona Jameson were really funny, from the high blood pressure scene to the camera scene. He had more of a comedic edge in this. But, not all funny scenes were funny. Some scenes tried to be funny, but during those and a couple other scenes I felt embarrassed watching it. Some scenes were cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Here's the plot. Oh boy, this is going to be fun. <br/><br/>Peter Parker, or Spiderman, is becoming a New York celebrity, and it is going to his head. He also plans to marry Mary Jane. One night, while Mary Jane and Peter are looking at the sky, some black ooze emerges from a meteorite and clings on to Peter's bike. Then we can welcome the new villain, Sandman. Flint Marko is an escaped convict trying to get to his daughter that is dying. He then falls into a pit of sand and turns into the Sandman. He is also Uncle Ben's killer. <br/><br/>One night, Harry attacks Peter because he thinks he killed his father. After a battle, Harry is hurt and has Amnesia, forgetting all about it. Meanwhile, Peter learns that Sandman is Ben's killer. He swears revenge. Then the black ooze clings to his costume and he becomes darker and has more power. He also becomes evil. He humiliates Eddie Brock, Gwen Stacey's boyfriend at the Daily Bugle.<br/><br/>Then, Harry remembers everything. He tells Mary Jane to break up with Peter or else. She does. Peter becomes angry and takes Gwen away from Eddie. Harry tells Peter that Mary Jane loves Harry. Peter fights Harry, leaving him scarred. Peter then loses Gwen at a nightclub. Peter discovers that his new costume is bad and gets rid of it, turning him good again. The only problem is that the ooze gets to Eddie Brock and he becomes Venom. Venom teams up with Sandman to kill Peter. They capture Mary Jane and Peter tries to save her. Meanwhile, Harry learns that Peter did not kill his father. He helps Peter in a four-way brawl with Sandman and Venom. Venom is killed and Mary Jane is rescued. Peter finally forgives Sandman about Ben's death and he floats away. The only bad news it that Harry is killed. In the end Mary Jane and Peter attend his funeral.<br/><br/>Overall, this may have a complex and hard to understand plot of a lot of moments are cheesy but this is actually quite good. This is definitely not for everyone, though. A lot of moments are strange. I am talking Moulin Rouge strange, and Moulin Rouge is strange, very strange. Anyway, if you do not like this film at first just try to give it another shot, because when you look at it, this film is a very fun ride.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: Spiderman."
"mjk280","5","1","3","11 May 2007"," Throw A Bunch of Crap Together
","Hmm where to start? I'm well-versed with Spiderman and the other characters in the movie, so I have a basis for saying this movie was below average. Above all it was okay as a popcorn movie so I gave it a five. I don't just settle for popcorn movies unfortunately for Hollywood and that's where the movie becomes unacceptable. I enjoyed the first Spiderman even though I felt it was a pretty ""safe"" adaptation, and I honestly hated the second one but I'm in the minority on that one so I still had huge hopes for the third installment. <br/><br/>There's plenty of reviews bashing the fact that there's too much going on in the movie, so I'll just focus on what else I saw. Where has the creativity gone? There is no plot point in this whole movie that made me think the writers/producers/director did anything original. You've got whining over uncle Ben (again), two villains who team up at the end (what a concept!), a love story, and the good guy briefly turning bad only to realize he was heading down the wrong path. That's a pretty basic list, and believe me there's more cliché than I can write about here, but this stuff can be found here and there in probably 2/3 of movies that are out there today. <br/><br/>Also, there are so many plot conveniences that act as main catalysts for twists in the story. The symbiote happens to fall near Peter. Fine, that's what makes it a tale worthy of being told, but how about explaining it a little? Spiderman happens to bump into a huge bell while writhing around in the black suit, and THAT is how he figures out how to beat it? And the worst: the ever-so-convenient phasing in and out of harry's amnesia. His condition basically unclutters the movie for about an hour, then his memory is restored to hate and then eventually help Spiderman. If you've already seen the movie you know what I mean and if you haven't, well it sounds great doesn't it?<br/><br/>Sandman was a waste. Again, back to the lack of creativity. He can turn into anything he wants, but we'll just turn him into a huge sand version of king kong. I think anyone involved in Terminator 2, including the caterer, would have had some suggestions to improve on this. Also, Sandman is a bad guy but wait a second he's doing it to steal money and pay to make his sick kid better. How noble! Ever hear of getting a job?<br/><br/>The lack of focus on the symbiote and its affect on Peter was disappointing as well. Of course, it was given a bit of face time. Too bad it was treated like a comedy. I didn't know alien symbiotes turned you into an overconfident pig when dealing with women. I can't criticize Maguire's acting too much, but that doesn't mean there was any thing positive about it either. He was just kind of there. <br/><br/>Venom wasn't given enough screen time we all know that already. He also suffers from something that's not unfamiliar to a lot of superhero movies: although he is a substantial nemesis to the hero, in this case spiderman, he isn't treated as such. He's just another villain churned out to last for one movie and one movie only. <br/><br/>On a final note: What was with Harry's death scene? I was waiting for Mark Hamill to step in for Tobey Maguire at one point it reeked so much of Vader's demise from ROTJ. Just a thought, haven't seen that commented on yet."

First the credits in the beginning are like an hour. The voice over of peter is bad. Mary Jane is pointless sandman makes no sense. Basically the whole movie makes no sense. A few examples: 1. Where does the symbiote come from and why does it by a stroke of luck fall right where peter is? 2. Why does he change into sandman? I know he falls into a deatomizer and there is sand on the ground but why would he turn into sand? and once again very convenient. 3. Eddie Brock what? Where did he come from who is he? 4.Why is Mary all mad at Pete. I know she is jealous and feels like hes becoming self involved but i don think thats an excuse to make out with his friend. 5. If sandman is such a good guy why is he killing people? 6.why is Gwen Stacy here? 7. Venom what? 8.Topher grace what? 9.how does sandman know where venom will be when they team up in the alley. The scene cuts to venom and the is sandman ready to punch him. then they team up. i thought sandman was some kind of hard on is luck villain. 10. If Harry's butler knew his father killed himself why didn't he tell him years ago instead of letting all this happen. 11. Why does spider-man let sandman go? He still robbed killed and escaped from jail. overall this movie basically makes no sense.Peter turning evil was good at times and entertaining. James Franco did a real good job. And the goblin fight scenes were good. But i think its time rami and co hang the tights up t just seems they don't have a voice anymore and they just tried to combine as much as possible.When it all comes down to it the blame falls on rami.

It makes no sense, and is completely and utterly random, complete with black slime falling from outer space in the form of a meteor. The acting is gloriously over the top. I mean, really.

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","9 May 2007"," Success not wholly deserved
","""Spider-Man 3"" not only exceeded the performance of the previous two movies; it set a new world record for an opening weekend, netting an amazing $375M globally. I was one of the many who was there on the first weekend and the opening applause in my central London cinema was a clear indication of the super-hero's enduring popularity. Yet, although Columbia Pictures has spun its web and pulled in many punters, the success is not wholly deserved.<br/><br/>As always, there are some superb special effects, as there should be with a budget of $250M. I particularly enjoyed the creation if the Sandman character, although it was a pity that the subtlety of his features was lost as he became bigger and uglier. However, the black stuff that turns Spider-Man evil looks pathetic and its arrival on earth through a meteor is so lame.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi is the director for the third time which provides continuity of style and narrative but, for the first time, he is involved in the storyline and the script and here the movie is sadly lacking. There are too many villains, too much romancing, and not enough genuine drama. The final scene especially is really weak - and the whole thing is about 20 minutes too long.<br/><br/>Where the third movie does score is with some genuinely funny moments, such as J.K. Simmons performance as newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson, Bruce Campbell as a restaurant's maître d', and Tobey Maguire giving a swaggering show like a John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever"", but basically we want our super-heroes to deliver thrills more than humour and I knew this wasn't working when I found that the black-suited Spider-Man was attracting me more than the original incarnation of the arthropod."

This film takes a chance and tries something different in comparison to not only the prior two movies, but movie series in general. As you might know, there are multiple villains. Along with this, there are also various dilemmas taking place non-stop; whether they are physical problems or emotional discouragements. The movie tries to put all these events in a 2 1/2 hour movie. Although many don't like this attempt, the concluding result is that the audience member is never bored; there is always something taking place. Go see Spider-man 3 as soon as possible.

Hence, i was anticipating this movie ever since I left the theater after watching the last one. That's why it is so disappointing to have to criticize this movie. I really tried to like it. But the movie was so clichéd and jam packed that there was no space for the story to actually communicate to audiences.<br/><br/>My whole theater laughed at the serious parts, and I'm sure everyone else's experience was the same. There was a lot of good in this movie. But the bar they set in the last movie meant that everyone else expected a lot more good and a lot less bad.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this then you probably will down the line. It is worth watching and it isn't a bad movie. It is just so disappointing that they didn't take more time to iron out the flaws.<br/><br/>P.S. - i'd take Bat nipples over stupid ass butler any day. At least Batman has Alfred."

","So this comment may contain a possible spoiler, I'm not too sure what some readers consider spoilers.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 was long, drawn out, and overall really boring. 2 1/2 hours with about 5 actions scenes and all about MJ and Peters relationship problems. I'd have to say the best part of this movie was Harry Osborn hitting his head and losing his memory. At least he knows how to act unlike Tobey Maguire. His best part was when he was dancing down the street like an idiot. Even Kirsten Dunst was horrible this time around. Her best part was probably when she kissed James Franco. I did enjoy Topher Grace as venom though. He played his part quite well.<br/><br/>If there is a part 4 I will not waste the money to go see it in theatres. I'll wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it for free since I work at a movie store."

","The things I hated about this movie: --Emo Spider-man. OK. This is a BIG one. He gets injected with evil black stuff (that comes from space for no apparent reason) and suddenly, he looks into a mirror and parts his hair into the nice Good Charlotte half-bang that South Park has already made fun of years ago in their beautiful ""You Got Served"" episode. Then Spidey puts on a bit of eyeliner to look like the metrosexual version of Green Day (but only when he's in an emo mood! The stuff is magically not there when he comes to his senses!) And then there's his whole dance-strut-musicvideo number in the middle of the movie that I guess was supposed to be funny... yet it was just about as funny as the Batman credit card scene in ""Batman & Robin""... in other words, ridiculous.<br/><br/>In fact, this is a good comparison. ""Spider-man 3"" is the ""Batman & Robin"" of the Spidey film franchise. It took a great first movie and an okay second movie with all those established characters and story lines to build off, and it couldn't get the job done, not even with 2.5 hours to work with.<br/><br/>--Spider-man landing in front of a huge CGI waving American flag as if he's Captain America. What's the message here? He's defending America against... something or other... some sort of terrorism... in New York City? Hell, why not just have the baddies and Spidey duke it out in the empty hole of Ground Zero? --Sandman's origin was idiotic: Outlaw runs from the police, climbs a fence and stumbles into some sort of top-secret fusion reactor that a bunch of white-robed scientists led by a hot supermodel in a labcoat activate to do something with... sand. The fact that a person has fallen into their outdoor experiment and altered the mass of their sand is dismissed as a mere 180-pound bird that will probably fly away once they proceed with the experiment.<br/><br/>--Speaking of Sandman, apparently fairly intelligent human villains lose their ability to speak when growing to a height of several stories. They must communicate entirely in growls, moans, and groans like Godzilla until they return to their regular size and can continue to have somewhat heartfelt meaningful discussions with other people.<br/><br/>--Stan Lee should stop making awkward, pointless cameos that only serve a purpose of showing his face and getting a quick ""hee-hee"" from the crowd.<br/><br/>--Stop using CGI for every-friggin-thing. It doesn't look convincing. The fighting-while-falling gag that was done maybe 20 times looks like two rubber video game characters bouncing off one another.<br/><br/>--Seeing Eric Foreman's head on a steroid-pumped CGI body was the creepiest part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>--Kirsten Dunst's character does the same thing in every Spiderman movie she's in: Get trapped/kidnapped by the villain and scream and wait for our teary-eyed hero to save her before he goes on another weepfest about how everyone he loves falls into harm's way. By the end of the movie, I was happy just to recall that she got punched in the face by Spider-man.<br/><br/>--Peter Parker making out with another girl on national television on the same day that he plans on proposing to Mary Jane. After that point, are any of us supposed to give a crap if the whole engagement thing doesn't work out? --The kids saying ""Wicked Cool!!"" --Treating the Empire State Building the way crappy American movies treat the Eiffel Tower: by making sure it's visible from every window to remind us what city we're in.<br/><br/>--Eric Foreman going to church to pray to God that he will kill Peter Parker. I only wish God would answer back ""You idiot, my church doesn't work that way. You have to go out and kill Peter yourself... and then come back and pray to me for forgiveness."" --I could've sworn that masked superheroes tend to wear their masks now and then, especially in public. I guess I was wrong.<br/><br/>Save your money!!"
"Reel_World","3","1","3","4 May 2007"," My Spidey Sense is tingling! Webhead jumps the shark
","Just caught the film last night and I have mixed emotions.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an enjoyable romp for a summer movie, but not without its flaws. The action scenes were very good - albeit a LOT of CG that looked obviously so. The plot was all over the place, and character development was almost non-existent. In a lot of ways, the film reminded me of ""X-Men 3"" - very rushed, with a storyline that jumped between the multiple plot points way too much.<br/><br/>The CG effects of Sandman were hit and miss IMO. In some cases - it looked really good - and others not so much. Venom was majorly underused and when he was he looked a lot like that dog Milo from ""The Mask"" when he sticks the mask on - overexaggerated fangs, and lacking the protruding jaw from the comics - just something didn't look right with him. Add to that the fact that even when in full on fangs and white eyes mode - Venom still speaks with Topher's voice - no effect has been added to it at all - which quite honestly looked really off! In some cases it looked like pre-viz work almost. I knew it would be hard to pull of Venom - but with today's state of the art - I was expecting something different.<br/><br/>Acting-wise - well - this is a comic book film, so I'm not looking for next year's potential Best Actor or Actress nominees here...When Peter goes evil mode with the black suit, the scenes are almost too much. I'm not sure what effect Raimi was looking to convey here, but I found much of the time he was just acting plain stupid. Spidey's fights while clad in black are much more brutal - with him not afraid to go beyond what is necessary in the battle - even to the extent of playing dirty. I've long stood by the theory that Dunst can't act and she once again proves it with a 2-dimensional run at MJ. Church, as Sandman, was a throwaway character. They gave him nothing to do except be a stand in for the CG department. Topher as Brock/Venom really didn't have ample time to create anything of a character - another drawback from the loopy storyline. James Franco sways between acting like Willem Dafoe - right down to the squinting left eye thing - to Degrassi mode when he has amnesia. Like I said - I'm not expecting awards here unless they're Razzies.<br/><br/>The big huge battle royale has its moments of pure wow factor, offset by Venom's comical appearance. For most of the fight, Topher has the face pulled away, but you do get 4 or 5 really good looks at him in full on symbiote mode. Without ruining anything, the ending was a bit of a let-down.<br/><br/>The Stan Lee cameo was a nice touch, and Campbell as the French waiter was funny, but the spidey sense line was right up there with the ""Holy rusted metal"" schtick. Again, stuff like that really detracted from the film IMO.<br/><br/>All in all, I suppose it's a film worth seeing - but if you go in there thinking this is the superhero film to top the likes of ""Batman Begins"" or the second Spider-Man, you might be disappointed. Worth the price of admission at a matinée, and I look forward to the DVD in November in hopes of some deleted material to fill in some of the gaps and make some sense of the multitude of story arcs."
"macnimation","Null","1","3","8 May 2007"," Not sure this if this movie is for true Spiderman Fans
","I was expecting a bit more since the second movie and was hoping the makers learned from it. I was disappointed. I don't think it was necessary to spend so much time on the Peter/MJ relationship and we were already given this treatment in the previous two films, this time however it was laid on a bit thick. The singing and dancing was a bit vaudeville, and you could see on the screen Toby Maguire was not comfortable doing it and I couldn't figure out the point to it. I got the impression the makers ran out of ideas and threw it in for filler. The Action sequences and villains were excellent although sparse, this was born out by my seven year old constantly fidgeting and only concentrating when Spiderman turned up. Outside he said it was just ""ok"" and asked why Spiderman wasn't in it so much..... Venom, like in the comic had much more potential and did not come across as ruthless as he should have, and the relationship with Spiderman would have been more positive instead of the Peter/MJ ""Dynasty"" saga. I hope, if they follow the comic lines, that when Venom returns he gets more airplay. Again the Sandman wasn't fully appreciated, and was used as filler it seems. The Audience doesn't get a chance to sympathise with the character as much as they could have. This movie was aimed at the female audience I think , and in my opinion does not impress or satisfy Spiderman Fans of the comic."
"bnally62191","3","1","3","7 May 2007"," This is what we get?
","It all started with Spider-Man number 1, awesome. The number 2, one of the best superhero films of ALL TIME. Then this one, a horribly written film that jumps all over the place more than any film has ever. What was Sam Raimi thinking? People we're dying to see Venom, they couldn't wait to see him, I personally was waiting before the first film was made. This is the villain people want to see more than any other. And this is what we get? Venom is on screen for twenty minutes, and it's played by... whatever his name is which doesn't cross my mind because of his poor performance as the villain. This was supposed to be the best of them all, the grandest, and needless to say, it is the worst. Seriously, a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FILM. There are too many irrelevant scenes to even count, decent action, good acting only by Toby Maguire and Thomas Haden Church. And by the way, what the hell was that thing that he fell in before he turned into Sandman? We're they experimenting with sand castles? There is no explanation to anything at all in the film to what the hell that was, what and where the meteor came from, there are just too many villains. All I can say now is that they messed up. They messed up big time. This was supposed to be the film that everyone wanted to see because of Venom, HE'S ONLY ON SCREEN FOR TWENTY MINUTES!!!!!!!! THE REASON FOR THAT IS Because Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry, Aunt May, and Gwen Stacy all take turns crying in the film, this is the biggest crying fest I have ever seen on film. Every second, someone crys. This is about the relationship more than dealing with the Villain. Peter would rather cry than save people. I honestly thought this film was horrific to watch, and some scenes in the film I couldn't believe we're filmed. Save your money, this film wasn't worth me going to see it Thursday night, at midnight mind you, watching people cry for 2 hours and Venom for fifteen, getting out of the movie theater, and getting home at 3:30 am. Sam Raimi has destroyed this film, blame him."
"anderu22487","7","1","3","7 May 2007"," Emotional and Awesome action
","This one really gets at Peter character. of course the other two did a good job this one really shows his struggle with choosing his destiny. The action was superb they plot was huge and Raimi did a pretty good job of creating the villains. The ending is great. I only have two criticisms: 1) The film drags in a few places. Sometimes it feels like the movie needs to move on but they are restricted because they needed to go give insight into another character. 2)The conflicts with Peter were extremely deep and a lot bigger than the film was able to give to them. He has series issues that seem to fizzle out or just look over. (Except with MJ) It was still the most psychological superhero film I have seen. If you have seen the other two Spideys you can't miss this one but it helps to have a refresher on the story before you go to this one."

","After seeing the movie I am absolutely let down. The first and second films were very good. 8+/10 in my opinion but this one really left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Lots of pointless plot lines and events that happened just to happen. Lots of those same plot lines left totally open at the end. The entire scene on the bridge made no sense for any of the characters involved.<br/><br/>Why was Gwen even in the movie? Apparently it is OK to kill several people (The construction yard HAD to have fatalities at the end) as long as you have a sick child and Spidy says so.<br/><br/>I wanted to get up and walk out on the movie when Parker hit Mary Jane. By the end I wish I would have."

","Don't want to go into excruciating detail, however this film is much more a ""COKE COMMERCIAL"" then Spiderman on film. I thought we were going to such interesting places with graphic novel characters, and here we are left to sit though something reminiscent of the debauchery of Batman and Robin. There is no reason why u can't make a lot of money on a film and still grove a little outside of the box. In a Market that is Fueled much more by avid mature fans who spend the money as apose to kids( when i was younger my collection was no were near what it is now) This being said there needs to be more then just fat on the bone. Im looking for meat on my adventure bone, delivered by Batman Begins, Sin City and Superman Returns. I suppose All I can do is hope that graphic novel material is taken with more weight and pushed to take u into the world of those characters. The whole lure of comic hero's is escapism and i was just never really invested into the film, never was regretting leaving this crazy visual world.

"Dhopz3","6","1","3","7 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 was GOOD,but not GREAT.
","WOW,this movie was not what I expected when my friends & I went to the midnight release at 12:05am at my local theater. Iam a BIG comic book fan, I have ALOTS of comics which includes SPIDEY,XMEN,HULK,SUPERMAN and few more SOooOO I know few things about the DC/MARVEL UNIVERSE. I'vie seen all the comic book movies so far and now saw SPIDER-MAN 3.<br/><br/>This movie is GOOD but like my TITLE said's its not GREAT. HERES WHY: The starts off slow but with 20 minutes it picks up with NEW GOBLIN chasing PETER on his bike which ends up being a pretty GREAT FIGHT SCENE between the two while PETER was on his way to pop the question to MJ. Iam really happy that FINALLY HARRY OSBORN has turn to the dark-side this time around. I'vie been waiting for HARRY go evil every since this SPM 1 ended which we ALL knew that it was gonna happen sooner or later.<br/><br/>JAMES FRANCO did an AMAZING job as HARRY, in my opinion EVERY scene with HARRY & PETER fighting or getting into a argument's was the best parts of the movie. But then HARRY hits his head on a pipe while chasing PETER and gets short-term AMNESIA and forgets PETER is SPIDEY plus he no longer blames PETER for his father's death. But later on he remembers EVERYTHING and once again going after PETER and his love ones.<br/><br/>I agree with everyone else that by having 4 villains(venom,sandman,new goblin,himself) is way to much. I guess SAM RAIMA never saw BATMAN & ROBIN. I like SANDMAN in the comics but he does not belong in this movie,RAIMI said in a interview that he wanted to keep VENOM out and place him in SPM4 but the fans demanded him to be in SP3. It should'vie been the other way around,put SANDMAN story in 4 and keep VENOM with GOBLIN story in 3. SANDMAN just wants $ to save his daughter and he killed UNCLE BEN which is the DUMBEST thing I have ever heard,saw,and read. WHY would you change SPIDEY'S ORGIN like that while it work so well in the comics and IN SPM1. Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Venom in the movie was OK. TOPHER GRACE did a GOOD job as EDDIE BROCK/VENOM. But VENOM should have had MORE FACE TIME,MORE STORY,MORE FIGHT SCENES,MORE EVERYTHING. My BIGGEST PROMBLE with VENOM in 3 is that WHILE EDDIE is VENOM his voice does not change! VENOM sounds just like EDDIE. WTF??? VENOM SHOULD SOUND LIKE A MONSTER,not a normal man. HECK,even in the cartoon VENOM voice changes and sounds more like a beast then the film venison. ANOTHER THING, even in the comics for VENOM the writer changes the letters in the WORDBALLOONS to a more darker/crooked color to express the voice change. The do it for cartoons and comic books but don't from the film? WHAT?<br/><br/>THEN there's the EVIL PETER with BANGS! GOOD PETER=NO BANGS. Every time I saw EVIL BANGS PETER I LAUGH! The whole theater laugh,even little baby's giggle! I know they wanted to change PETERS look while as EVIL PETER,but when you look at him your not scared,your just laughing. On the bright side at least they didn't make PETER wear EYESHADOW as EVIL PETER.<br/><br/>SPIDERMAN takes his mask off A lot in this movie,as he does in 1 & 2. LOOK SAN RAMIM,we all know TOBEY MAGUIRE is SPIDEY but we didn't need to see PETER PAKER FOR 80% of the movie. We wanted to see SPIDERMAN with his mask ON! GRANTED SPIDERMAN takes his mask off a lot in the comics BUT like this movie. IT LIKE EVERY 10 SECONDS.<br/><br/>I don't even want to get started on the dancing parts. ALL I got to say about that is WTF!!!<br/><br/>IN THE END SPIDERMAN 3 is all that bad BUT not all that GOOD either. I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out but I have a QUESTION FOR SAM RAIMI if he ever reads this:YOU EVER HEAR THAT OLD SAYING,""SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST?"" What? NO....Oh thats what I thought. <:"

Director has entirely failed in this- I will give 2/10 for this effort.<br/><br/>Acting was OK.. So 6/10 CGI effects were good but I expected lot more than that..

"exchronos","7","1","3","6 May 2007"," Great But Flawed
","If you're a fan of the comics, and know the back story behind the events of the film, then it is a rather great and enjoyable film. Be warned though that this is not a good film to hold the attention span of most very young Spider-Man loving viewers unlike the first two films of the series. Most of the film is character development bookended with action, and its in that middle part where the young children of the audience I was in started to get bored, and I must admit even I was getting a little anxious for some action. Also, it seemed that most of the audience got a little lost during the part where the black suit begins to alter Peter's personality, and the transition back to his true self wasn't as handled in great detail as the transition to ""Bad Peter"". After viewing the movie there seems to be a few plot holes in character development, as we are shown unimportant tidbits and the tidbits we need for the plot are left out. If anything I'd say the way the film was edited left more to be desired and some things could have been left out. Another item that hampers the feel of the movie is the fact that it also mirrors the Spider-Mania that has occurred due to the film, and made Spider-Man from the semi-loved Maryl hated by the masses superhero into a full blown celebrity, something that was Maryl avoided in the comics for a very long time. To the extent of what was in Spider-Man 2 was great, like the scene on the train, but in this film it takes public love for Spider-Man overboard, and even dwindles the amount of time we see Peter at the Bugle or see the negative views about Spider-Man, which has been an integral part of the character's mystique in most representations. Although they do use Spider-Man's celebrity status in contrast to Mary Jane's pitfalls, there really was little character development on Mary Jane's part for most of the film. <br/><br/>The special effects were spectacular, and the fights were very well executed. More Spidey VS Sand Man throughout the film could have helped keep the pace going, but unfortunately the middle of the film seemed to be quite villain-less other than a dark Peter Parker. <br/><br/>So, if you're a fan of the comics, know the back story, and understand what's going on with the black suit, it can be a very enjoyable movie to watch, but in the end it could withstand a better editing job. When they come out with a Director's Cut DVD (hopefully) it may be done a little more justice in cutting down the slower paced parts and adding whatever deleted high paced scenes that may have been cut. I wouldn't recommend taking the small kids out to see it, because they will lose interest after the first hour, and won't regain that interest until the last half hour of the film. <br/><br/>I give it a 7 because of the reasons above, and it really was a better than average movie, but it wasn't the blowout 10 I semi-expected. After X-Men 3 came out I had lowered my expectations a bit, and where if X3 had more it could've been better if Spider-Man 3 would've had less...or had the right stuff in the time it had its flaws, it could have definitely been better. The pacing and humor were off, and the feel of the film didn't match the feel of the previous films in tone or spirit.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Exchronos"
"angadh-n","3","1","3","6 May 2007"," No Spidey No(more)!!!
","Being a complete comic junkie and a movie junkie(especially of comic adaptations) i walked into the cinema hall,wit much anticipation.The promos looked so amazing that i just couldn't wait for the real thing.But after i saw the movie i think we all could have waited another year or so just to have a better end product.<br/><br/>Basically the movie is too flawed.Whatever was present in the last 2 spider-man movies has been completely washed away by Sam Raimi.OK,its not like u expect a great story when u come into watch a comic adaptation,but seeing the last 2 parts had some substance i just couldn't't't stop myself from thinking this would be the cherry on top of a perfect set of movies(until now!!) The action sequences leave much to be desired as there's not a single one that stays in your mind five minutes after its over.The fight sequence with doc ock on the train and on the buildings(the one with aunt may)were really stunning and you'd think that this one with its host of ""bad guys"" would just be jam packed with the best stuff yet.But all you get is a whole lotta third rate stuff of which you can hardly make anything out because most of the action sequences are at night.(probably to bring out the so-called ""Dark"" nature of the movie)<br/><br/>Which brings me to the characters and performances.the only one u can actually say who did a half decent job in this movie is James Franco(not saying he was good but was better than the rest).The character of sandman is absolutely unnecessary and i think it's been added to the lot just to make the fan think a lot before the movie.For me the Sandman was probably as essential or important as Bruce Campbell thinks he is in any of the spider-man movies.Thomas Haden hardly has much to do so he cant really be judged.Kirsten Dunst is just another prop(and should have been in the play in which she features in the movie).Tobey Maguire fails to make the audience feel the varying emotions for Peter Parker that he has made them feel in the last 2 parts.<br/><br/>Which ultimately brings me to Venom.Now I'm a big Venom-fan from the comics and i thought that this might just turn out to be the necessary ingredient to save the movie cos venom's appearance is saved until the end.But unfortunately Venom isn't half as scary as he's supposed to be and Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is another unnecessary distraction.So all of you who are looking forward to getting a peek at venom...don waste your time watching this movie.Just pick up[ a good old' comic book and enjoy!<br/><br/>On the whole this movie is filled with unnecessary scenes,has no plots or sub-plots in-spite of having so many characters,filed with unnecessary characters.Its very obvious that the filmmakers haven't paid attention to having a a good script.The focus seems to have been on how to make the characters look like they are from the comic book and how to make the costumes look great.Its hard to believe that these guys actually churned out movies like spidey1 and 2.And this movie's faintly reminiscent of superman returns which was also a massive disappointment.Basically this movie should never have been made.It turns out to be flatter than the soda you take into the hall.Please don't waste your money on this."
"snapshotbch","5","1","3","6 May 2007"," All this proves is...

I mean tell me that when venom showed up you were not excited that you were not sad when harry died that you can not feel for peter and all he is going though now i know all the emo stuff was a little much so Tobey can not cry well so what! so the movie had some cheesy moments who cares now everyone should stop expecting Shakespeare from comic book movies and give Tobey and the rest of the cast a break. in closing i had fun watching this movie i laughed a lot and it may not be as good as the 2nd one but no superhero movie will ever be but everyone needs to remember that we are going to the movies to have fun and enjoy going into another world and that is what this movie does."
"Dream_seeker","8","1","3","6 May 2007"," Simply still the best superhero movie despite mixed reviews...
","I'm sure you seen the mixed reviews and heard it thru the grapevine by friends and friends of friends; but there's still no denying yes...Mary j sings and yes Toby's character does have a weird dance moment along with a strange 70's beat to it which is very funny but no matter what you hear good or bad Spider-man 3 starts the summer movie season with a bang and still keep it coming with the goods. Spider-man 3 continues directly where Spiderman 2 (or Spiderman 2.1 depends on what you watched or liked more) left off having Mary J. Watson (Kristin dunst) finding out that Peter parker (Toby McGuire) is spider man all this time. <br/><br/>Thus, begins a good and bad whirlwind of events that sets the tone for even shocking revelations and life-changing choices that makes even peter questions his ""Great power"" and the responsibilities to go with it. While Mary and peter enjoy a good night together a strange star fell from the sky and landed directly around there area....coincidence I think not! but this is no star nor rock but something far more dangerous and will test peter's heart as well as choices in his somewhat good part of his life; Meanwhile elsewhere a convict is on the run once again but it seems luck gives him a bad hand again when he becomes a unwilling test subject that will give him the power over sands and lets not forget the vengeful son........<br/><br/>okay let's start with the story...as you can tell its very convoluted and that's one of two gripes I have with this movie; they mixed in too much of the elements of the different villains stories so much that you can tell that the story was a rushed job to some degree making the movie somewhat either rushed or confusing in some parts; we never really understood how the symbiont code name ""Venom"" even found its way to earth all we just know is that it got here...nothing more! And the sandman's character as much as I liked his character you really wished there was more depth to him because he seem like a good man who pretty much had bad luck and still continuing to have it. and of course Hobgoblin (aka green goblin 2) we already know his story so we are not going to go into that neck of the woods; put all of this together you got yourself a lot of great and awesome fight scenes that you also wished they were emphasized on the work done and choreographed to make the special effects and fights were pretty damn good and it just make you want to leap out of your seat at the awesomeness that it brings.<br/><br/>Unlike some other movie (ahem X-men: last stand) this movie puts more personal touches which is REALLY good; giving Peter and the other characters realism and life making choices along with tough choices that can make any one of us question, ""now that we found the truth what would we do?"" and, ""how would we react to something like that!?"" Peter's journey to the dark side can sometimes remind us that we have a same side when it comes to private justice if something happens to any one of our family members which again is good but then going back to the story being rushed you lose that moment and feeling along the way but it does show back up again which brings a more darker tone to this movie and even though they were trying to add funny elements to it still felt really good to see a dark side to peter's confidence that he now has. all of the actors did good regardless of the mixed reviews and the quality still makes this the best superhero movie bar none; and even though they tried really hard to put all of the stories together the aspect and adventure to this film you'll come out feeling like it doesn't really matter cause you had a fun time. And that's what this movie does it makes you sit and eat your popcorn have fun and sometimes get a little sappy while you're at it.<br/><br/>My second gripe is not actually a problem persey but I've just wished the fights were more extended and that the emotional tone wasn't pushed a notch but then again if they didn't do that you wouldn't have much realism to the characters thus the end result would be making this movie pure action, with lots of pointless casualties that comes out of left field, and a lacking plot unlike some movies (x-men: last stand) but they didn't go down that path and that's GREAT! All in all, at the start of the summer movies is this movie worth going to see? yes, I think it is but my only suggestion is take the movie for what it is...a fun, emotional, thrill ride nothing more and nothing less don't expect too much from it or you will be disappointed and don't expect too less of it or you will misjudge the movie just take it for what it is cause spider man is still a great example of a good superhero movie.<br/><br/>Now let's hope that ""iron man"" falls under the line...<br/><br/>8/10"

Unfortunately, the movie runs long as it is, so improving the story would mean removing some items from the plot. For example, there was nowhere near enough time to develop the character of the Sandman. I felt that he could have been a deep character that the viewers could have genuinely empathized with, but he was simply not given enough time to develop. Also, the last minute addition of a ""butler"" character was totally unnecessary. The plot could have carried itself just fine without the use of a ""deus ex machina"" for Harry. <br/><br/>Although the special effects were beautiful, and the fight scenes were thrilling, this movie badly wraps up what could have been an incredible trilogy."

","Spider-man 3 was an excellent movie. With only a short amount of time, Spider-man 3 revolved around realistic struggles(ex. love,commitment,friendships, enemies) and had time to introduce new enemies(Sandman, Venom, New Goblin) that had their fare share of viewing time. Granted me a huge Venom fan, would loved to have seen much more of him,however the time used was much appreciated,except the way he supposedly died.Venom ""supposedly"" died in one of the most retarded ways that a more powerful villain could have. If you noticed me saying, ""supposedly"" it is because I don't believe he died and think he should be back for more action. One more quick note on Venom, the actor playing him is a joke and the only reason i got over it is because Venom displayed in black substance covers up the actor himself and shows the true character of Venom. A much stronger,more violent actor should have played the role of Eddie Brock,and Venom.Nevertheless, Spider-man 3 did a great job at showing the average person that horrible things can happen to anyone(Break-up,dying, spousal abuse). I hold, heartily believe this has been one of the best movies in the marvel industry. it had substantial action, drama, and nail biting energy, along with a some comical humor and would give this movie a 9 out of 10."
"w00f","5","1","3","5 May 2007"," Spidey Goes Splat
","After thoroughly enjoying the first two Spider-man movies, I was very much looking forward to this third one. I'm sorry to say that it didn't deliver on most levels.<br/><br/>The story drags this time around and the warmth of the first two films is sorely lacking, leaving nothing to propel it through the long, long build-up toward the climactic battle scene. The chemistry between the main characters seems to have evaporated in between the second and third installments. There's a coldness and distance to this movie that wasn't there before, and in a movie about superheroes there needs to be a strongly human element. We just don't get that here.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disappointing effort in this movie is the re-writing of the death of Uncle Ben from the first film. To introduce this new element seems dishonest, a contrived plot device that really doesn't work. It also makes the ending of the film make no sense, as Spider-man lets one of the villains  the very one who killed his uncle  escape. Why? The bad guy gets away to rob and kill another day. It's a very poor note upon which to end the three-film saga.<br/><br/>There are also some very silly moments, even for a movie based on comic books. What happened to the writing this time around? You don't have a physicist point out, for example, that ""I'm not a biologist"" and in almost the very next line have him declare that an organism never before seen on earth ""has the traits of a symbiont."" That's just bad writing, nothing else. Later on, this ""just a physicist"" also suddenly has detailed knowledge of meteorites that fell 30 years prior. Huh? Also disappointing was the character of Venom. He turned out to be a one-dimensional caricature who occupies far too little of the film after all the build-up to his appearance. That being said, Topher Grace does an excellent job in his portrayal of Eddie Brock/Venom, and it's nice to see him taking on a new sort of role.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire seems to have phoned in much of his performance on this film. He's stated publicly that he doesn't intend to do anymore Spider-man movies, and perhaps he'd already gotten tired of playing the character. His performance lacks anything distinguishing this time around. In the first two flicks, there was a certain charm about Peter Parker. In this one, the portrayal bounces back and forth between extremes of self-centered cockiness and whiny geekery. It's definitely time for Maguire to move on! Lastly, the ending of this film attempts to be a multiple tearjerker in such a clichéd and self-conscious way that it doesn't work at all. We get such a schmaltzy ending this time around that there wasn't a wet eye in the house. It couldn't have been done in a more heavy-handed manner if Mary Jane had walked back and forth across the screen in a sandwich board painted with the words ""Cry now!"" Nobody at the showing I saw did so; in fact, audible groaning was the most notable sound in the theater.<br/><br/>It's sad to see what was arguably the best series of comic-inspired movies yet brought to the screen end on such a mediocre note. Perhaps Sam Raimi gave all he had already, or perhaps the cast has just gotten bored. I wish I could end this comment by saying that I hoped for a fourth installment, but nothing in the third makes me feel that way.<br/><br/>Rest in peace, Spidey. You had a good run."
"tideking78","4","1","3","5 May 2007"," The problem is......
","The problem with this movie is simple. It is lazy and sloppy. It's as if Raimi, Maguire, and Dunst just figured ""oh well we don't have to do too much work, people will show up"". And they have in droves this weekend. I went to see the movie at one of the greatest theaters in the country at midnight first show. The crowd was pumped. They cheered during the Transformers trailer, buzzed about the 28 Weeks Later trailer, cheered again when the Columbia logo emerged. Then the movie started. And nothing... For over 2 hours.. Finally Venom appeared and the crowd went crazy... Then nothing..... For the rest of the film... It's the first time I have been to a midnight show where no one clapped at the end. I've been to cheering crowds for Star Wars 3 and Batman Begins and Snakes on a Plane. Even Superman Returns and King Kong had clapping at the end. This movie costs nearly $300 million to make and it looks and feels like it.. There is absolutely no heart in this movie. As far as past Marvel films have gone... Hulk had a good story it was just directed by someone who had no idea about CGI. Fantastic 4 was alright but at least it tried. I compare Spider-Man 3 to X-Men 3. Movies made solely for the benefit of making money. And it will make money this weekend. Mark my words though. Like Matrix Reloaded, once people figure out this movie is not good, it will get crushed by Shrek the Third and Pirates 3!"

","Too much hype, did not live up to either of the first two movies, a complete and utter disappointment. Only 3 action scenes and they were not even that long, too much of Toby acting and he was not even that great. The part were he gets carried away by the black substance is the worst hour or so of the movie, very much unlike the first two. It also seemed like they struggled to figure out what they wanted to do with the movie villain wise. It just seemed they ran out of ideas in the end and it showed in their workmanship on this movie. Best part was when the writer of the Spiderman comics made a cameo appearance. See it for yourself but don't get your hopes up."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," Disappointing
","The third installment in the spectacular Spider Man franchise has Peter Parker coming to grips with his own ego and his dark side. All the while New York faces two new villains - the Sandman and Venom. And Harry Osbourne has yet to settle his score with Spider Man.<br/><br/>The first two films were terrific hero stories with a feel good comic book twist. In addition to their spectacular action sequences. The trailer for this film looks like a continuation of just that, but sadly the film proves to be something different.<br/><br/>There are many story lines and none of them receives the attention they merit. Prime example being the Sandman character who was a simple crook stealing money for his family before being mutated. There is a scene where he visits his family, but that is all we see of them and from then on he is merely an on-screen menace. The other villain, Venom, appears so late in the movie that he is barely developed as a villain and ends up being another merely another menace for Spider Man. If that isn't enough, then the remaining storyline - between Harry, Peter, and Mary Jane - receives such ridiculous melodramatic treatment that is is practically and insult to the last two films. It is not wholly bad and plays as a cheesy comic book story, but given the fact it follows the previous two films' much stronger and effective stories it is just above sheer disappointment.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the action sequences and effects are some of the best around with Spider Man performing some spectacular heroic rescues. The Sandman is also an impressive creation and has a stunning creation scene. And Bruce Campbell gives what may be one of the best cameo appearances ever. However, a few good action/special effects scenes have never earned a movie big points. --- 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence"

","Cheese is good in moderate amounts. But have you ever had a hamburger for example that had extra mozzarella? It is overload and it ruins the meal.<br/><br/>Such is the case for this movie. The acting is laughable at times and the script is ridiculous. I kept thinking to myself ""No they are not trying to pull off the love triangle bull manure like Pearl Harbor."" Well, they did. It doesn't work here either.<br/><br/>That said, I did rate this movie 6/10. The special effects are great and the action scenes/circumstances are some of the best if not the best to date. That doesn't save the overall movie though.<br/><br/>Like a bad cheeseburger, this movie will satisfy your hunger for big budget comic book flicks, but you might have to take some Tums afterwords."
"djvale","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," So-so prequel - don't expect a masterpiece!
","Upon seeing the film being released world-wide last night, I was quite excited to believe that this was going to be the best Spider-Man film yet. The hype, trailers and build-up had this destined to be the #1 film of the summer (and it probably will be to be honest). A sign of Toby Maguire putting on a few pounds probably means he's had enough of the Spider-Man series, and there probably won't be anymore.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>The film starts with Peter Parker loving his ""claim-to-fame"" as Spidey - he swallows his pride and forgets that Mary Jane is also part of his life. A fantastic battle scene within the opening shows the quality of the special effects put into this 3rd film. They really have outdone themselves in this Spidey, but the lack of story and depth to characters showed.<br/><br/>It seemed as though they decided to fill in comic moments to tie up loose ends in the film, which weren't really that funny anyway. I guess this was to make-up for the ridiculous sub-plots and storyline. There are three baddies in this one, and in my opinion, it just slaughtered the films structure, and weighing in at 2 and a half hours, it seemed to drag on abit. I do have a soft spot for Jameson though, his attitude and timing are perfect. Really great moments with him! Venom should of been the baddest, coolest, evilest S.O.B. that Spidey had to face, but the feeble attempt from Topher Grace as Venom (and I mean feeble in the highest degree), just made me cringe. His acting was absolutely shocking, and he just did not suit the Venom role what-so-ever. This brings me on to the ""cheese"" factor of the film. You could actually of had crackers with this film. The cheesy dialogue, acting and stupid Jazz Bar scene was ludicrously stupid and had no meaning what so ever. (Watch it and see what I mean).<br/><br/>Sandman (played by Thomas Haden Church), did a poor job of portraying a man-on-the-run - his dull tone put me off and made me want to fall asleep. Only when he became the actual Sandman (which the effects were amazing I have to say - they really did capture the villain as Sandman perfectly!) he felt comfortable and gave a good performance.<br/><br/>The effects really did save this film, and for the money they spent on it, really does show. The story isn't anything to be desired, and the crap acting from most of the cast sparked off some of the cheesiest moments in cinema history.<br/><br/>I walked away from this movie thinking how much I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. It was a big let down. Spider-Man 2 completely washed this film away. Save it for a DVD watching, or if you have to see it, go watch this with an open-mind. Its not as good as the second Spidey, but the action sequences are stunning. Period. Don't get your hopes up."

Those parts weren't even supposed to be funny! I felt like I was watching an un-funny version of Jim Carrey's ""The Mask."" It was THAT Bad.<br/><br/>I wish I could like this movie. I really do, but there are too many villains, too many plot lines, and too many cheesy one-liners. If Sandman wasn't in the movie, and the whole thing had focused on Peter Parker/Spiderman and Eddie Brock/Venom, the movie would have made MUCH more sense, and it would have fit much better with the other two movies in the trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie was just a mistake. I feel bad for everyone involved, and I'm sad to see a great series just die like that. It's over."
"TimLax51","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," Disappointed. Too many chefs spoil the soup.
","First the disclaimer. I have been a loyal Spiderman fan through the 80s and 90s when I was growing up, and have been fervently awaiting the third installment for over two years. Some of my favorite movies are the Evil Dead trilogy and Darkman, so I also have nothing but respect for Raimi. So what I say in this review comes with a heavy heart.<br/><br/>There are two types of people who will see this movie, people who know the story (me), and people who don't (my wife). Both will be disappointed. Now, the movie is not really that bad, but in comparison to Raimi's the first two outings with the Spiderman franchise, this movie reeks of other franchises past failures at a third installment (for those that don't know, see Superman 3 and TMNT 3 for perfect examples.) <br/><br/>At first glance, it's tough to see why this movie doesn't work. The special effects were incredible, the direction was top-notch, even the acting was pretty darn good, for a comic book film. But the story suffered from too many characters. The main focus in on Peter's internal struggle with a creature from space which essentially turns him evil. Great idea for a story, it's easily the biggest of Spiderman's comic book arc, besides the Green Goblin/Gwen Stacy story, and it's chock full of emotion. But the characters who play into it have no characterization, the audience gets no feeling from them. <br/><br/>First, the goo. I know all the stories of it, both comics and cartoons, however, there is nothing in the movie to explain it, so non-comic book fans have no idea what or where this stuff comes from, or what it does to Peter. James Franco's character, Harry, does enough 180s to make even a figure skater nauseous (or maybe that was his acting), while Thomas Hayden Church, who plays Sandman, arguably the best actor in the film, has almost zero characterization and plot, despite having the most special effects. Due to this, all the extremely pivotal plot line events and scenes in the film feel weak, unemotional for the audience, and down-right cheesy (even if you leave out the 15 minute long homage to Saturday Night Fever). The other character, Eddie Brock/Venom, played by Topher Grace, feels like such a farce. His motivation for hating Peter Parker is a stretch of the imagination so big that it's glaringly obvious, even in a movie with unexplained black alien goo. <br/><br/>This movie left so much of the story unexplained it is highly confusing, unless you know the story going into it. So, sadly to say, this movie was created with solely fans in mind, and even they, due to how poorly characters are handled, walk away feeling disillusioned and disappointed. This movie has everything, except feelings."
"gt-24","2","1","3","5 May 2007"," Emo Peter?
","Dreadful... Atrocious... It's finally clear to me that James Franco is indeed a terrible actor, Thomas Haden Church needs to stick to comedies and Icehouse VOs, and Tobey Maguire is revealing the weenie that he really is. At one point, they have him doing a song-and-dance number. Wow. And the clue that he's ""bad Peter"" as opposed to ""good Peter"" is his hair brushed down in his face, emo-style. <br/><br/>It's visually stunning, as you'd expect, but the plot, acting and dialog are horrendous. Sam Raimi needs to let David Koepp write, and he can stick to the visuals. Camp works in Evil Dead, but for the Spider Man franchise? In the words of Bill Walton, ""Verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry disappointing!"""

"diac228","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," What happens when you try too hard
","One of the toughest things to do in the world of today is to entertain and satisfy multiple types of crowds. Among the hardest to please includes the comic book studs. The comic book fans have different expectations from that of the rest of the mainstream. It is a difficult job to do, but the Spider-Man series at this point had done a fantastic job gratifying everybody. Combining excellent special effects, great acting, a wonderful script, and good direction; the Spider-Man films rank as among the best films based off comic books. Spider-Man 2 stands as the best of them all, even above Batman Begins and Superman. But, with the third installment looming and multiple plots being revealed, it was looking like a movie with a lot of content for something that's just 140 minutes.<br/><br/>This is pretty much what makes and breaks Spider-Man 3; the sheer amount of things going on. Packing in way too much when it easily could convert into two films, Spider-Man 3 disappoints mildly because of lack of consistent pacing, lack of development, and lack of direction. The special effects and the musical score also takes a step backwards. Spider-Man 3 is a lot of fun and at times hilarious and jaw-dropping, but at other moments just misses the mark. The potential was there, it had the opportunity to be the best superhero film in existence, but with everyone having to share screen time, nobody besides Spider-Man actually got much time to present their capabilities (in terms of character and the acting). The list of underused characters is astounding; from Harry to Sandman, to J. Jameson, to most unfortunately, Venom.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 takes place right after part 2, in which Peter Parker and Spider-Man are enjoying a new life of acceptance, success, and happiness. In the meantime, the new girlfriend MJ isn't getting the breaks in terms of her career. Things take a turn for the worse when ex-friend Harry tries to kill Peter in honor of his father, when an escaped convict accidentally gets superpowers, when a meteorite lands on Earth with a mysterious substance, and there is a new photography rival in Parker's newspaper. Despite the plot taking a few twists and turns, this movie is mostly drama. We still don't have the smart-aleck one-liners and laid-back attitude of Peter from the comic books, even though it seems like all the humor in the franchise has and will only come from Bruce Campbell (in another great cameo) and J. Simmons (underused, but scene-stealing). The writing is decent, but still has its moments of bad dialogue and somewhat unnecessary moments.<br/><br/>The acting isn't that bad, especially when compared to other superhero flicks, it gets the job done. Topher Grace is the big surprise as he pulls off a surprisingly decent performance as Venom, while the rising star Thomas Haden Church does a superb job as a broken escape convict-turned supervillian Sandman. James Franco is the best among the main characters however playing the confused, angry, and sometimes charming (when happy) Harry. The special effects, as stated before, wasn't as good the third time around because it was rather overused in multiple instances. It does not help that the Oscar-winning special effects team behind the second installment did not make a return. The pacing however is really what hurts the movie the most. With so much to tell in so little time, the pacing goes rather fast for a Spider-Man movie, and then it leads to nobody but Spider-Man going through changes in front of the audience. The villains, while potentially horrifically menacing, pale in comparison to the enemies in the first two simply because they weren't in the movie much at all. Venom, the most-hyped portion of Spider-Man 3, gets very little screen time when he could easily have been a deadly force to reckon with.<br/><br/>By the time the final act rolls around, the setbacks of the movie become very clear. Spider-Man 3 tried to add so much, tried to pack such a heavy punch, that we get a rather anti-climactic final battle, and an anti-climatic ending. The final sequence, despite being rather truthful to the comic books, still somewhat feels rushed and does not deliver as much as the previous battles throughout the movie. Instead of being a wild ride final chapter, we get a heavy dosage of melodrama. Yes, the Spider-Man films are about character and the emotions they go through more so than the action, but this time it was taken a bit too far. The chemistry between Parker and MJ wasn't as strong this time, as it was spent mostly bickering. So what happened? They tried pleasing everybody, from the comic book buffs to the action buffs to the fans of the previous installments. The end result is a rather mixed bag with its fun scenes and battles, but boy could it have been something else.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The third installment is not as good as the previous two, but still has plenty of good moments and some incredible action. However, trying to build so much, trying to tell so many stories and introduce so many characters, the plot feels rather tangled. They failed to build upon the villains, and we don't get to see them develop into the monsters they become like before. Worst of all, Venom, a character that could have really stolen the show and added horror and suspense to the picture, becomes nothing more than almost a mere cameo. The Spider-Man franchise isn't ready to give up, but perhaps its time to pass the directing and writing baton to others who might be able to give the trilogy a little face lift. They seem to have lost the way with this franchise, and perhaps with a new cast they can steer it in the right direction. Don't come into this movie expecting brilliance, but rather a decent popcorn flick with its flawsin other words, the typical popcorn flick."
"samuel-113","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 Opinions
","Just saw Spidey 3 last night and there are a couple things I'd like to touch on. Firstly, the character development from the first two films was much, much more in depth. Then this one comes along and it's just jam-packed with short character development, various story lines and sub-plots. I'm all for action, especially superhero action but the first two movies were much easier for me to latch on to. Being a Spidey Comic fan from childhood, I'd never really been into the Goblin or even Doc Oc but the way the first two movies developed their characters made me appreciate them actually start to like them as ""complicated evil villains"". But my favorite character has always been and always will be Venom. He was well done graphically in 3 but how much screen time did he get as opposed to the Sandman? Ten minutes maybe after actually becoming Venom and then the character development for Eddie Brock prior to his mutation was no way in depth. He was spouting cheezy one-liners and his disdain for Peter Parker/Spiderman almost seemed to happen instantaneously after one or two encounters which involved what seemed to be no more than playground competition. <br/><br/>Secondly, my issue was with the length of the film. I'm all for long-flicks (LOTR, Saving Private Ryan) in the theater, if they entertain me. But for some reason i was finding myself uncomfortable after about the first hour and a half trying to shift myself around in my chair. The movie actually lost my attention long enough for me to focus on how comfortable I was. That's never happened to me during movies I'm enjoying thoroughly but for some reason it did this time. i can't quite put my finger on it but it just seemed that a few things were somewhat irrelevant and kind of put in as ""filler"", such as the dance scene. All in all, I'd say it was impressive visually but should have been more in depth with character development rather than Peter Parker development. This movie seemed to combine two flicks in one and really should have been spanned out between it and a fourth."
"Baldrick44","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," Hmmm....
","I went to see this after seeing the good Spider-Man and its great sequel. Unfortunately this one, while still being OK, didn't quite measure up to the lofty heights of the first two, for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) at a high point in his life- his relationship with Mary Jane ( Kirsten Dunst ) has never been better, he's getting top graders in his classes, and Spider-Man is now regarded as the hero that he truly is. However this is soon shattered as Harry Osborn ( James Franco ) begins to plot his revenge on Parker. Furthermore, Uncle Ben's killer, Flint Marko ( Thomas Haden Church ) has been transformed into something else- the Sandman. Add to that the new black costume, which is much more than it seems.<br/><br/>The fact is, that despite it being a two and a half hour movie, nothing gets truly covered well enough and there is the same fight sequence at the end of the movie. The best scene in the whole movie, in fact, involves Bruce Campbell as a hilarious waiter that seems to be channeling Inspector Clouseau. Many of the movies better moments, besides the action sense, involved humour in some way.<br/><br/>And then there's Venom, who they don't really know how to design as his head isn't quite big enough to look right. Instead it almost looks like his mouth has been drawn on separately with a life of its own.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 crams too much into one movie and as such has to use dumb plot devices to keep the story moving ( there is one near the end that will have people screaming 'why?!' ). It moves too fast for the plot to work, but it's the plot's too cumbersome and unwieldy anyway."
"whoatemytuna","2","1","3","5 May 2007"," Bruce Campbell is awesome, this movie is awful.
","This movie was awful, i can't really say too much about the problems i have with it because i would give too much away but the movie was unfocused and Raimi's dislike of venom as a character was very apparent. This film should have cut out about a half hour and at least one villain i think that there should have been more of the harry storyline and less of the random love story line that took up too much of the movie and didn't really contribute to the story. It seems that when they were writing the script that they got stuck and they went to the old fall back for all bad theater, the Deus Ex Machina, what with the miraculous coroner/geriatric butler, and the convenient meteor landings, strange same church same time thing all in all everything in this movie was too coincidental and too convenient and it was just downright cheesy. i give it a c- (it gets some credit for the incredible Bruce Campbell cameo)"
"mbremote","6","1","3","5 May 2007"," Hmmm....
","Opening night last night and I was there. Good lord, this film is long - too long. There's enough content in it to fill three pictures, and with each the mood and genre appears to change radically. I never thought I could say I'd seen too much of Spidey, but sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is pretty much as you'd expect the story to continue from the second movie. However, there are way too many characters and sub-plots going on which seem to scream an urgency to move onto the next scene as soon as possible. Even then, like I say, the film is still a long stretch.<br/><br/>Some of the diversions from the comic's established story arc are good (it keeps everybody guessing), and this is especially so with Harry. However, Gwen Stacy appears out of place in this film (and James Cromwell as her father has far too little airtime to warrant an inclusion too).<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the latter half of the film just drags - full of CGI and action sequences - but it could have been edited together far better. When the closure of the film does finally come, it limps past the post so that you almost feel cheated out of what was established in the previous films. It's a bit like the old Superman films not finishing with Christopher Reeve circling the globe and smiling to camera. You expect Spidey to put his costume on one last time and go swinging through New York's skyline into the sunset. He doesn't. No rousing orchestra, just a fade to black.<br/><br/>Maybe that's Sam's subtle way of getting the audience to want another sequel, but I felt a little short-changed for all of the pizazz and pomp quite obviously invested in the special effects.<br/><br/>I've a feeling that there'll be one more film - Dr Connors' Lizard will emerge, along with the Scorpion probably (because J.Jonah Jameson's instrumental in his history, it'll make up for J.K.Symond's lack of airtime this time around). Personally, I think that this film starts the downward trend of popularity with the franchise, but as Tobey McGuire said, if all the same cast and crew can be convinced, maybe one more outing wouldn't be a bad thing."

I don't know what was worse...the acting or the script, really they were both terrible.<br/><br/>There are A Grand total of Three cool parts in this movie and in the following order of coolness. <br/><br/>A. Bruce Campbell as a French restaurant guy. Probably the funniest scene in the movie.<br/><br/>B. Evil Peter Parker Dance at the Jazz Club. It was very evil and very cool looking at the same time.<br/><br/>C. The 15 minutes of Venom. I don't like the script they gave Venom, but when he was shrieking and not speaking it certainly made Venom much better then SandMan.<br/><br/>Yes. Thats Right. A Total of 10-15 minutes with the Insanely cool Venom.<br/><br/>But wait, you ask, Sandman wasn't cool? Thats right. Sandman was nicely CGIed, and his first fight with Spidy was decent, but honestly, the threw him in there for no other reason then to make Peter Parker unhappy and want revenge against someone again. By the end he completely lost his purpose, and the screen writers tried their best but it nowhere near enough to make him a full character.<br/><br/>But wait again, you say, Green Goblin returns yes? Indeed he does. Willem Dafoe even gets 15 seconds or so of Screen time. But even Stan Lee got more then that in this movie. Anyway, yes, there is Green Goblin, who gets royally beaten and happens to lose a good portion of his memory for about half of the movie. He returns and plays some severe vengeance (a good scene featuring him and Parker)...but then goes and ruins it completely like every evil maniac seems to do (making it Very very uncool).<br/><br/>Hey what about Gwen Stacy, she's there? Is she hot? Plot device. No character development, and really, I didn't think she was all that pretty.<br/><br/>How this movie could have been better? <br/><br/>A. Peter wakes up from a dream after the first 4 minutes of the horribly disgusting and poorly written (and just as poorly acted) opening and finds out his life sucks. Basically, cancel that ""happy"" ending they tagged on to the second movie. Make it so the papers still proclaim Spiderman as a criminal as opposed to a hero. That would Immediately make DarkSpiderman much more meaningful. Peter Parker should start in depression darn it. <br/><br/>B. Starting Peter in Depression means you no longer need Sandman as a major character, so you can drop him all together or leave him as a minor villain. If you really really want him there, give him a better story, the whole, ""he killed your uncle"" line was very poorly done. <br/><br/>C. Green Goblin and Venom vs SpiderMan would be a much more plausible fight. D. Dark Spiderman for first half of movie (start it MUCH sooner then it did), then Venom for the Second Half.<br/><br/>In fact, just redo the second movie, and make the ending much more Empire Strikes Back. Basically, what I'm referring to is the fact that the end of Spiderman 2 was really just to ""happy"". I know people liked it, but personally I just found it a bit distasteful. Mary Jane SHOULD have married the astronaut guy. The Last Scene should have been Peter eating a piece of Chocolate cake on his bed with the semi-cute neighbor girl next to him. It sets up SUCH a better opening then this laughable thing. Then for this movie Astronaut brings back Venom specimen. Specimen escapes, (insert plot device) and finds Parker to make Dark Spiderman...and I could go on and probably make a very cool plot line for the movie.<br/><br/>The worst thing, is that no matter how badly I personally rate this film, it will probably gross enough on opening weekend to pay the bills it cost. Frankly I hope it doesn't, a SpiderMan 4 would just be really really bad."

","...with a little Xanadu sprinkled in for good measure. The producers of these must have had something to do with the production of Spidey 3 (I'll explain these comparisons in my review). I dislike spoilers and think the best way to properly review this movie without giving it away is to compare it to other films and TV shows.<br/><br/>I stopped guessing who was going to be caught kissing whom by the end and I just didn't care anymore. I went into Spidey 3 not expecting it to be as good as 1 & 2 (I had read other reviews), but good lord! It was like someone p*ssed on the iconic scenes from the first two movies. Shame on whoever came up with this mess.<br/><br/>I don't mind complex characters. In fact I enjoy them, but it was like Dr. Phil was involved and wanted to show the tortured, tender sides of the villains, while Spidey is shown as no saint. Spidey 3 had the same problem I had with Elektra, I didn't know who to cheer for, and to top it off, Elektra had a better script. I'm serious. I'm not exaggerating. It was like the producers of Spidey 3 came up with all these great fight scenes and musical numbers first, and then realized they should have some kind of story to tie it all to together. The logic and motivations of the supposed ""good guys"" are completely off (even if they are being influenced by evil). The only truly good person is Aunt Mae, who randomly bursts onto the screen to offer pearls of wisdom akin to Yoda guiding a young Luke Skywalker.<br/><br/>To top it off, the heroes are just plain stupid in the heart-to-heart dramatic scenes (don't worry, I won't spoil the heartbreaking moments). Just watch an episode of Dawson's Creek and that will give you a good example. The audience was actually booing and someone sitting behind me called MJ a b***h.<br/><br/>The dialog was on the level of the junior high school kids in an after school special. It was obviously written by someone who'd never actually stepped into a college classroom. Peter Parker even gets picked on for being a nerd in a college-level physics class by a jock throwing spit balls at his head and another shining a mirror in his eyes while he's trying to read the chalkboard.<br/><br/>I won't go into the massacre of the Gwen Stacey character (Peter's lab partner).<br/><br/>There are some continuity problems which can jerk a watcher out of the moment which are quite annoying (my brain would go ""wait a minute"" when the poor editing would change what a character was doing in mid-sentence).<br/><br/>The only reason I suggest seeing this on the big screen is for the special effects. They're pretty amazing. The Sandman is quite breathtaking.<br/><br/>See Spidey 3 if you must, but expect a huge spectacle like Xanadu with flashy numbers and thin dialog in the middle. You've been warned."

","You know when you've done something wrong or really bad as in the case of Sam Raimi and Spiderman 3 and someone says there not angry with you, but just disappointed? This is what the whole cinema felt like last night. It was an exhausting experience which felt like it was never going to end. The film spends so much time on character development but fails because of the vast amount of characters, thus half of the film is wasted. Apparently the cast were recalled earlier this year to add more action scenes, yet there were still few and far between. It's big year of blockbusters this year which relies heavily on third installments, so far Terminator 3 and The Matrix Revolutions spring to mind rather than Return of The King or Revenge of The Sith. Bad start Spidey."
"fstysiak","4","1","3","5 May 2007"," Failure
","After watching S1 and S2 and being sure that this is the only worthwhile comic book adaptation, I had great expectations about Spiderman 3. I had also MANY worries 'bout it. Symbiote? Black Suit? New Goblin? Sandman?! And VENOM!?!? In one movie? that's a script for at least 2 good blockbusters. Nevertheless, I've gone to the cinema with a lot of hope.<br/><br/>I don't regret that. S3 is a good movie after all, but fails as an action movie (it's better than Ghost Rider (what is not?) and X3, but these were complete failures...). Too many characters guarantee poor development, and : I won't forgive the come-in of the symbiote. It just fell of the sky. Great. The writer must have reached nirvana to make this up. And then stuck to Parker's bike, hid under his bed. Another great idea. What you can expect under collegian's bed? A beer bottle? Pizza? Pack of condoms? No, it's an aggression-booster that fell of the sky. Bravissimo.<br/><br/>Venom. A villain essential to Spider-man franchise as The Joker is for Batman's, and so on. Spider-man's biggest nightmare is shown for, i don't know, 20 minutes? With no tongue, no muscles, no VOICE? Venom should be too powerful to even consider an alliance with Sandman... Venom is too ""big"" to be so ""small"" like in the movie.<br/><br/>New goblin. One fight, lots of crying, I don't want to talk bout it...<br/><br/>Sandman was OK, properly developed, looked like a King-Kong/Godzilla/Monster from Ghostbusters during the final scene, but OK.<br/><br/>There's only one way to continue the 9-movies saga (?) - forget the part 3 (it'll earn the money after all), make part 4 with, for example, Shocker and Rhino, and start the symbiote story once again, and make it a good one...<br/><br/>Sorry for any language mistakes"
"spiderdkb","9","1","3","5 May 2007"," Best of the trilogy
","I am a huge Spider-Man fan and I gotta say that this movie was amazing. It pains me that some people have said it was terrible. I'm sorry, but what movie did you see? Obiviously not Spider-Man 3. The singing in it was not a problem at all. Mary Jane is supposed to be a performer. That's what she does. The storyline was great. and if any of you have read the interviews and articles on this movie you would know that there is a good chance for a 4th film. Tobey Maguire said he would consider doing a 4th one if Sam Raimi and Kirsten Dunst were in it. And I'm sorry, but the actors in this movie were great. Like I said I don't know what movie you were watching, but it definitely wasn't Spider-Man 3 if you are saying that it was terrible. And for those of who don't read the comics, Venom will come back. Yes I will admit he was in the movie for a short time, but the look of him was awesome. That was the important thing. Needless to say if Sam Raimi knows that Spidey fans want a 4th movie there will be a 4th movie. So don't count him out on that one. I thought the movie was great and filled with lots of action. Sam Raimi didn't lose his touch."
"jsaade","4","1","3","5 May 2007"," A movie where the bad guy is free because he made the hero cry
","I do not know how the votes have reached 7.9 The amazing effects and stunning animations deserve 4/5 and the storyline 0/5 which makes 4/10 in my opinion. It is not a good movie when the crown bursts into laughter every time the camera zooms in on the hero's face because we all knew he was going to cry. It is not a good movie when for no reason and in the middle of a battle the camera shows a completely unrelated character (like a policeman for instance) applauding spiderman and nodding in approval. It is not a good movie when the hero is shown as 2 completely different characters and there is a big difference between the 2 characters. The writers did not take the time to try and minimize the difference and show us the evolution of the characters and how one becomes the other. It is not a good movie when the villain becomes a hero becomes someone told him a stupid thing. something he already knows and the switch to the hero phase is made in a very naive way (when the new Goblin is informed by his butler that his father might have killed himself, well the butler could of told him that from the start of the movie so it does not make any sense). It is not a good movie, when the movie is suddenly a comedy, then a sci-fi then a romance then a drama, just pick a genre please. It is not a good movie when the hero starts dancing a non-musical movie.<br/><br/>In all, just watch this one if you like cool effects. Skip it if you are searching for a good storyline, because this one contains too many story lines and none of them is any good."
"magma-12","7","1","3","4 May 2007"," Spider Man 3: A major disappointment
","Bad news 1st: No suspense at all, every plot, moves easily predictable, poor storyline- too much content just pushed in, Sandman's role unwarranted. Too many flaws, for example, how could one know for sure that Spidy didn't kill Osborn though Harry is told that only his father's blade could kill him! How can the butler be so sure? Harry is crushed by the blades at both sides, yet he survives; Mary Jane is so humiliated, yet in the end she doesn't seem to mind it just because Spidey saves her (he saves anyone for that matter) Mary Janes humiliation at the Jazz Room is so easily resolved? The Black Suit Spidey should have been kinda given more role cause it was given much attention by the fans. The Second part of the movie was the major disappointment! It cannot even be compared to Spiderman 1 and 2! Sandman reminded King Kong for some and Hulk for others! Sandman's background track was really poor. Spidey's aunt May, The Daily Bugle, Spider love life were never resolves in the end. Poor Screenplay! What happened? The ending was so abrupt and tasteless... leaves you with a feeling that you just wasted your time and money! I know I may sound like a stereotype, but that's what everyone, including the kids expect that being - Heroes don't cry! The crying part of Peter Parker in Spidey suit was so artificial that almost the whole audience actually started laughing! We were expecting so much.... I will stop here.. The good news: Acting wasn't that bad! Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) deserves much credit, not only for her role, but her acting as well (her role in emotional scenes)... I loved the Jazz music (cause I love Jazz)! So I enjoyed all the Jazz songs! It was terrific! There was good humor (especially in the French Restaurant, Jameson's blood pressure control to name a few). Though I think religion wasn't necessary to enforce the moral lines, it is really the only worth of this movie: Forgiveness, Humility, Marriage, Friendship, Unity and how Revenge can destroy you! I loved this very much! I liked Black Spiderman and enjoyed it more!<br/><br/>Conclusion: Only the moral worth can be acclaimed, though not unique to this movie! The story was the real cause for disappointment after the first part! Leaves you unfilled and wish for Spiderman 4 or to watch Spiderman 1 or 2 again just to console yourself! Major disappointed!

"ibentmywookie244","5","1","3","4 May 2007"," Worst of the 3, but not horrible
","A lot of people are saying how terrible Spider-man 3 is. It is not terrible, but it also isn't great. Because many people expected it to blow their minds (which it definitely fell short of doing), this movie was still entertaining as hell, funny, and Venom was amazing. Here are some problems I do have with it:<br/><br/>1. Venom doesn't come into the movie until there are 20-ish minutes left; most of the movie focuses on a giant mound of sand for a villain. 2. There was WAY too much going on; they should have focused on a few story lines, leaving out the jealousy and romance of Peter and Mary-Jane (kinda became a chick-flick). Again, this should have been Venom's movie. 3.Lame, lame, lame ending. (I mean, come on...) 4. at least an hour that could have been spent doing something better but chronicled Peter being a jerk, etc.<br/><br/>They got lazy and could have made this much better than it actually was. To end the way they did was shocking because they worked so hard in making this movie and appeared to have given up at making a good ending (seriously--its corny and dumb).<br/><br/>Still, this movie was VERY entertaining, good story, awesome special effects, loved Venom, SAndman was OK (but he's still just a giant mound of sand...). Still, a movie with such good predecessors should be equally great and this movie wasn't, which is why everyone felt let down by it. If this movie came out independently of the other two, people would have to at least given it a 5/10 because that is what it's worthy of. Still...I hope that Spider-Man 4 returns to the things that made the 1st and 2nd truly great."
"manu_lopez08","7","1","3","4 May 2007"," It's an excellent film... but Why am I so disappointed?
","I'm a die-hard Spidey fan, and have been anticipating Venom's arrival since the wall crawler first put on his red and blue suit. Over a year ago venom's part in Spiderman 3 was confirmed and I have been extremely excited. Thinking, dreaming and talking about spider-man, counting down the days since. (I saw Spiderman 1 and Spiderman 2 in my home, religiously, every night of Spiderman week) -But, I've been uneasy with all the negative reviews it's been receiving, and I've cursed on all the critics who ruined my excitement. I saw the movie on May 4th, excited, never the less, but even though I try to deny it, I WAS SO Disappointed. <br/><br/>I'm gonna give you a list, THE TOP TEN REASONS SPIDERMAN 3 JUST ISN'T SPIDERMAN 3: <br/><br/>10. IT'S SPIDERMAN 3 AND 4, IN ONE MOVIE - If you look at it, this movie should have been 2 movies, it's all too crammed up! When the simbiote attaches to Eddie, that's where the credits should have comed up. <br/><br/>9. TOO LITTLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - Look, If you saw Spidey 1 you love the Green Goblin for it's symbolism and iconic stature, and the costume. If you saw Spidey 2, Dock Ock was too great, one of the best and most developed villains in fictional cinema history. But still, Sandman and Venom have much more stored up than ether of these two first villains. It just isn't shown. Sandman's story is great, and if emphasized more, could have been better than Dock Ock. His CG and action scenes where much better (The scene where Sandman first gets up is just GENIUS, my jaw was dropped through the whole scene). ANd never the less, the best, biggest, and grandest villain in Spiderman comic book history is VENOM!!! And we only get to see him like 25 minutes. I was expecting so much more. <br/><br/>8. GWEN STACY barely appears in the movie- Gwen is such a big character in the Spiderman comics, she should have had a bigger role. <br/><br/>7. THE CAMERA VIEW - Spiderman 3's camera view is put on focus for almost the whole film. In Spidey 1 and 2 you see great panoramas and great visuals of New York City, In Spidey 3, you don't.<br/><br/>6. NO FLYING THROUGH NYC - Spiderman 1 & 2 show us one of the most thrilling and compelling scenes of Spiderman swinging through the buildings of New York City, Spiderman 3 doesn't, so you really don't feel that ""wind in your face"", if you know what I mean. <br/><br/>5. IT FEELS LIKE X-MEN 3, MATRIX 3, AND REVENGE OF THE SITH - Like these other big franchises, Spiderman 3 feels like the ending movie, filled with sorrow, only anticipating the final scenes. It feels unbalanced, very mournful as if everything is lost. <br/><br/>4. TOO RUSHED. - The movie feels completely different from Spidey 1 & 2. It's pace is too fast, too many cuts between story lines, no emphasis on just one story.<br/><br/>3. POORLY EXECUTED - Look closely. Spiderman 3's story and overall theme is much, much better than the previous 2 films, yeah, it really is. It's just poorly executed. Peter and Harry's story is perfectly done, very, very strong and it is the main story in the 2nd sequel. Peter and MJ's story is also very good. But they just executed a poor script, after the jazz club scene, and before sandman asks for forgiveness. They just didn't make a good climax.<br/><br/>2. SPIDERMAN BARELY USES THE BLACK SUIT - Come on, the black suited Spiderman is such an important part in the Spiderman comics and cartoons, and he does a lot of bad things using it. To show his suit in so little scenes, is very, very disappointing. <br/><br/>1. VENOM - Looks great, but isn't. SPIDEY FANS, you know this: VENOM IS SPIDERMAN'S TOUGHEST, BIGGEST, BADDEST, MOST ICONIC, AND COOLEST VILLAIN, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT. So, why did Sam Raimi leave him for just 25 minutes (or so) of the movie??? We needed more development from Eddie Brock. Come on, we needed to see more 1 to 1 fighting with Spidey, we needed Venom to relate to himself as we (eddie and the simbiote), we needed his tongue, my god! where is Venom's tongue???? It's his signature!!!! In conclusion: Venom needs more screen time, and should be VENOM!!!!<br/><br/>I give it a 9 to keep Spidey on top, but... NOW I KNOW, NOW I CAN SAY: WE DESPERATELY NEED A SPIDERMAN 4!!!!.... WITH VENOM AND HIS TONGUE!!!!!!!"

","Why is it that all Hollywood super-hero adaptations, if they start well, eventually go overboard? Spider-Man the comic book has been on going for, what, 40 years? Yet Hollywood insists on trying to cram 5 years of story into 2+ hours. With that off my chest let me say that it's obvious that Sam Raimi loves Spider Many and tries to make a good script, but there is just too much involved to do it justice. What there is has problems, mostly plot holes. One of the biggest is one of my favorite Spidey power, spider sense! It is on the fritz for most of this film. The REASON it is on the fritz is so that the over-the-top battle scenes can take place. Now I know spidey regenerates quickly, but he's not superman! he does cut and bleed and his bones will break...not in this cartoon version. But having Spidey dodge his opponents would not satisfy some know-nothing Hollywood big wig by having enough 'action'. Now for the good. Good dialog, except for the lack of snappy patter during combat that is part of the Spiderman mystique. The love story and relationships, well done. Super effects, solid acting & direction. It gets a 7 from me, simply for being entertaining, and I was entertained, when I wasn't noticing problems."

"palewook","5","1","3","4 May 2007"," Weak Script & Great special effects equals a forgettable ride.
","The Good: Tobey as Parker. Sam Raimi's direction and camera style. The Special effects. Topher Grace as Brock. J.K. Simmons as Jameson. Bruce Campbell's cameo is a script highpoint. Did I mention the special effects? <br/><br/>The Mediocre: Venom, interesting design and special effects, but not a developed story arc. What could have been impressive, comes off flat because of the depth. Thomas Haden Church also had little to work with, was as good as the script allowed him to be. James Franco did what he could with the script as well, but his part became so cliché because of the script, it was almost laughable by film's end. James Cromwell is under used.<br/><br/>The Bad: The script. Treads into numerous clichéd areas. The villains are underdeveloped, special effects can't carry a C script into an A grade. Too much occurs with too little depth, characters occur shallow or callow at times. Gwen Stacy's parts are so poorly written and conceived, that Bryce Dallas Howard is unable to salvage anything from her screen time. Which is a shame.<br/><br/>The Unforgivable: If there is a Spiderman 4, please for the love of all that is unholy, don't bring Kirsten Dunst back.

"brooklyn-schuster","6","1","3","4 May 2007"," A bit disappointed but still entertained
","At first, I didn't really like the beginning of the movie it was a bit too minimalistic in my opinion. But later it got more interesting. Spiderman's fights were very wicked placed perfectly. I'm a big fan of Marvel comics, so I can't figure out why the producers decided to put Gwen Stacy into the plot. She didn't really fit in. Some scenes of Spiderman 3 were a pleasant fun. I mean fun in a way like in Raimi's earlier Evil Dead trilogy. In some way there were also unintentionally funny scenes, like Peter telling Mary Jane that the acoustic at the her musical was bad and shortly after the little comet including the symbiotic entity making almost no sound.The movie focused a bit too much on it's visual appeal rather than its character plot development. I have mixed feelings about the ending, on the one hand it was very epic and satisfying on the other hand it was too sentimental and cheesy. Some fans might say it was a bad idea that Harry dies at the end, but I don't think so, to be honest it is if the character would have been brought back and back again after surviving almost every attack. I have noticed some big flaws, but there are still more positive aspects. Some of them:<br/><br/>Awesome visual effects, there are dimensions between the this one and the first Spiderman flick.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is still damn sexy<br/><br/>Funny dialogs"
"torque_mod-1","7","1","3","4 May 2007"," Good movie, just not what I was expecting...
","Let me start by saying that Spiderman 3 was a good movie; though I was expecting it to be a lot more than just good. Spiderman 1 was, to coin a phrase, amazing! Spiderman 2 was Spectacular! (better than amazing) Spiderman 3 however just didn't live up to the quality of the first two movies. I did like the film, but it just didn't go in the right direction for me. The first two followed the comic/animated series pretty loyally, but in the 3rd one, I think Rami and his brother decided to thrown in their own Hollywood plot twists that might end up leaving a lot of the more knowledgeable fans feeling a bit confused and alienated. Its hard to get into details without spoiling the plot, but lets just say that the story works, provided they follow it up with another 3 movies like the rumours have stated, and that they really go back to their comic book roots with the next films. If this is the finale to a trilogy however, I think there are going to be a lot of unhappy fan-boys (and girls) stomping on their Spiderman DVDs.<br/><br/>I agree with what someone else said about the directors trying to cram too many characters into the story, but they could have made it work had they changed gears slightly. Again I will say that a lot of comic fans are going to be more than a bit upset when they find out how many times the characters in the movie completely ignore their own persona that they have in the comics... I guess the biggest let down is simply that the first two movies were spot on from a geek's perspective while still allowing new fans to understand everything that was going on whereas this movie didn't do the series justice in that respect.<br/><br/>There are some absolutely incredible effects however, and Spiderman/Parker and Mary Jane hold pretty true to their characters... in fact it was mostly Hary and Venom that let me down."
"Steven_Inter","6","1","3","3 May 2007"," Followed the down hill path of Batman
","This is a strange extension of the Spider-Man series. There were a few arcs created in the previous two Spider-Man movies that were left open. This movie attempts to close them. But for most of the movie I couldn't help but think I was watching the Joel Schumacher vision of a comic book movie. More bad guys doesn't mean more excitement. Crying doesn't mean drama. Reporters telling us how this is the end for Spider-Man doesn't mean the audience feels a sense of dread. Basically what I am saying is that the movie didn't have enough time to connect the audience to the characters. Which may seem like a throw away comment, as by now, after 2 movies, you'd think we'd know them already. However in this installment, the characters of Peter Parker, Harry Osborne and Mary Jane Watson seem to have changed in to different people. Each becoming the extreme of their previous versions. MJ just cries and whines in nearly every scene she is in, which makes you feel pity for her. She was always the damsel in distress, but to watch her go from ""Miss Popular in High School"" to this version of her, is a major fall from grace. Hard to get to like her. Harry is so confused he doesn't know what face to pull on, so he ends up resembling Two-Face from Batman! Peter Parker does his best Superman 3 impersonation, as well as turning a little Gothic. But again, you never really feel anything towards him. In the previous 2 Spider-Man movies, we felt what he felt. In this movie, we didn't have enough time to get to know Peter Parker. We didn't really get to know any of the characters. We simply got to meet them. Say a quick hello to them, and then see them every now and then crossing the road to wave them an acknowledgment. I counted 4 bad guys in this film, if you count Spider-Man as one, when he turns to the dark side. But why were they all dark. Well, we sort of understand why. But do we care? In the last 2 installments, we certainly do. We know what the Green Goblin was all about. We felt his rage. We also understood the backdrop to Doc Ock. This time around, we start to get there with Sandman, but not quite, because he was fighting for more screen time with Venom, Green Goblin 2 and Black Spider-Man to contend with.<br/><br/>Great action sequences, but the lack of plot development. The confusion of characters, the not so subtle changes of pace in the film, all help to make this Spider-Man, bigger, more explosive, more action packed, but no real point.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this is the last installment of Spider-Man, and they do what Batman did. Wait a while till people forget this one, and start again with a different person at the helm, with a different view of the Spider-man. Because I'd hate to see what Raimi does with Spider-Man 4!!! We'd need Schwarzenegger to come back as Mr Freeze! People seem to get carried away with these comic book movies. They always seem to think its all about violence. They forget that you need a good reason for the violence to happen (it's called a plot) for the audience to get hooked. We need to understand the point of view of the bad guy, but also understand that he is in the wrong, so that we side with the good guy when we watch.<br/><br/>Spider-Man Begins..."
"alfred-guernica","8","1","3","3 May 2007"," Great summer blockbuster, funny and entertaining but nothing more
","First of all: This is the perfect movie to kick this year's summer, it's a great summer blockbuster, but nothing more. Let's start with the bad things: the acting hasn't improved at all, Tobey is trying hard, he's not bad, but ain't a Christian Bale. Thomas Haden Curch performs well as Sandman, Kirstem Dunst gives the same solid performance like in SM1 and SM2. James Franco is good and the others hasn't got big role. The script is very crap some place, we got dialogs in Lucas-level, but hey, is SW so popular for it's screenplay? Don't think so. Spidey 3 has so many plots and characters, 3 villains, so we doesn't have deep feelings for the characters, they are not so complete, like Doc-Ock was in Spidey 2. There are some clichés, Ant May is very boring, Venom has just a small part. But the movie works. Hell yes, it rocks. Yeah, there are too much love story, but the whole movie is a great ride. You can find so many mistakes if you want to criticize the movie, but let's not forget one thing: It's ENTERTAINING, if you expected more, watch Batman Begins again, if you want to see a great action-packed summer movie, lean back and ENJOY the movie. Spidey 3 is very funny, I know that that part when Peter Parker goes crazy, changes his hair, does extreme things, will split the audience, but we all know that we do not see the real peter, the black suits causes this, but folks, that scenes are very funny. the music is great, maybe the best score of the 3 movies. The first battle between Spidey and Green Goblin is spectacular, but too fast, you hardly see anything, but if you get used to 24, you won't recognize anything. :) The born of Sandman and Venom is amazing, actually all the Sandman fights are eye-popping action scenes. The last battle, containing Spidey, Goblin, Sandman and Venom at the same times is also very good, there's just one things: Venom kidnaps MJ, the scenes are great, just we have seen this before. But there are some very powerful scenes. If you find excuses like why Spidey takes off his mask or how becomes Sandman Flint Marko again, then you decided to blame Spidey before seeing the movie. It's not the movie of the year, but worth the money. If I had to choose between Spidey 2 or 3, I would say that at home I prefer Spidey 2, and I think that's the better movie, but in the cinema, I'd rather watch Spidey 3 three times more. It was made for the big screen. Do not miss it!"
"poolandrews","3","2","10","1 April 2010"," I really didn't like this one at all.
","Spider-Man 3 starts as Spider-Man's alter-ego Peter parker (Tobey Maguire) is set to propose to his long time childhood girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), however Pater's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) still blames him for the death of his father & is intent on killing Spider-Man. Meanwhile an escaped convicted murdered named Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church) wander into a restricted proton testing range & is zapped with the result of his body being molecularly combined with sand, as the almost invincible shape-shifting Sandman he sets out to steal enough money to pay for an operation to save his daughters life as Spider-Mantries to stop him. At the same time humiliated newspaper photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is consumed by some parasitic black alien slime that makes Eddie evil & intent on killing Peter Parker & Spider-Man, both the Sandman & Brock team up together to kill Spider-Man their common enemy...<br/><br/>Cowritten & directed by Sam Raimi this was the third of the hugely successful live action Spider-Man films that have broken box-office records all over the world, personally I am not a huge comic book fan & I have no real liking for Spider-Man himself but I did enjoy the first two Spider-Man films although I thought Spider-Man 3 was absolutely terrible & a massive bore from start to finish. To be honest my main complaint about Spider-Man 3 is that it just felt like a rehash of the the previous two films ideas & themes without ever being as good as either of them, the strained relationship between Parker & Mary Jane, the tensions between Parker & his best friend Harry, some super villain or other terrorising New York, his landlord asking for the rent, dealing with the death of his Uncle & the problems of being a teenager are all recycled here to dull effect. At almost two & a half hours long Spider-Man 3 felt like it went on forever to me, I was really bored by the time this thing had finished. The film has themes like people's dark sides (here the script deals with hero's that have a dark side & villains that have a sympathetic side) & such but the idea that Paker just needed to pull his hair down a bit & do funny walks down New York would get all the girls to throw themselves at him come across as ridiculous. Cranky newspaper editor Johna Jameson livens things up with some very funny scenes but other than that Spider-Man 3 just felt lifeless & bland. Even the villains aren't that great, Venom only appears during the last twenty minutes while the Sandman is given a back-story about his daughter & the fact he killed Peter's Uncle which were not in the comic books & just feels a bit pointless other than to carry on the themes from the first two films.<br/><br/>I brought this really cheap on a second hand Blu-Ray & I have to say I want my money back, an unimpressive film & a flat looking Blue-Ray means the hi-def CGI computer effects look pretty average at times. The action set-pieces this time around feel laboured & daft, the fight between Peter & Harry on a glider feels like a video game while I personally thought the crane smashing into the skyscraper was the best moment although the giant Sandman at the end is quite cool but doesn't really do much. Personally I don't think any sequence here comes anywhere near as close to the two sequences in Spider-Man 2 where Spider-Man & Doctor Ock battle it out climbing up skyscrapers or the cool out of control train fight scene. The CGI varies, some of it is excellent while at other times it's rather fake looking. The IMDb's Trivia section lists all sorts of facts & figures that I assume are meant to impress but only disappoint more as the amount of time, money & effort spent on Spider-Man 3 was enormous & the end product just so bad. It's no surprise to learn that there were re-shoots that went on for eight months apparently.<br/><br/>With a reported budget of around $250,000,000 plus addition re-shoots, evolving CGI computer effect technology insiders say this might have cost as much as $350,000,000 in the end. The acting is OK but I just didn't warm to anyone particularly & Maguire's bad boy sequence is just laughable.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is a film that I really disliked, I was literally sat there wanting it to finish so I could watch something else I was that bored by it. The first two Spider-Man films are much better than this huge disappointment & waste of huge potential."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","10","16 January 2010"," Enjoyable, but the weakest of the series
","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.<br/><br/>And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.<br/><br/>However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.<br/><br/>All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"tavm","9","2","10","8 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 is the first very good movie of the summer season
","I just saw Spider-Man 3 with my friend and while I can see why some critics have complained about some of the length and subplots, for the most part I enjoyed it. Certainly it was nice to see Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco together again as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborne. I also liked Thomas Haden Church as The Sandman and Topher Grace as, first, Peter's Bugle photo rival Eddie Brock and then the black Spidey costume-dominated Venom. Hilarious scenes of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as a French waiter who greets Peter. Nice turns from Rosemary Harris as Peter's Aunt May and Mageina Tovah as Ursala, the landlord's daughter (I first noticed her as Luke Giradi's first girlfriend, Glynis Figliola, on Joan of Arcadia). Also nice additions of James Cromwell as Captain Stacy and Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard as his daughter Gwen. And Spidey creator Stan Lee says something to Maguire that seems very poignant here. All this and some of the most thrilling scenes provided by Sam Raimi make this one of the most exciting movies of this young summer season. In other words, don't hesitate, just watch it!"

"ncruz-77996","5","2","12","30 June 2019"," Deserving of a Little More Praise
","Introduction:<br/><br/>Many people are not very fond of this film. But I am. And I don't care what other people think. I can love the movie if I want to.<br/><br/>What I Like:<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is probably the weakest the trilogy, I agree with that. The writing's not as good, the film is a little clunky, and it suffers from more issues than that. I will go more in depth into that later. But I'm here to talk about what I like.<br/><br/>I love the character's in this film. There is a logical progression with them. Peter, after years of saving the city, he finally gets the recognition he deserves, and the people love him. And because of that the praise gets to his head, and he develops an ego. Mary Jane gets big an theater, but when she suffers rejection, it conflicts with Peter's success. Harry is finally ready to fight Spider-Man, after two films developing his thirst for revenge him.<br/><br/>And while the film is very cluttered with villains, I think all of them are interesting in their own way.<br/><br/>Harry, was easily the best out of all of them, as he had truly transformed into his father, a man he wasn't. Consumed with vengeance, he is however, eventually able to redeem himself. Sandman was also a descent villain, the scene of his birth was beautiful. With effects that somewhat hold up. And told entirely through visuals, it could work as it's own short film. And while cliche, his motivation does work. And he does have a tie to the narrative and the main character.<br/><br/>And Venom, who's easily the most out of place character in this film. As he doesn't fit the theme of forgiveness. In the film, Peter had to forgive Sandman for killing his Uncle Ben. Harry has to forgive Peter for apparently killing his father. Mary Jane has to forgive Peter for not being the best boyfriend. However, Eddie Brock doesn't have to forgive anybody.<br/><br/>However, Venom is still an interesting character. As Eddie Brock is a corrupt reporter, who after being fired for forgery, grows a hatred for Spider-Man. Even though people say Topher Grace was a miscasting, he did still put up a good performance. Well adapting the comic book character.<br/><br/>The action scenes are arguably better the first movie. My favorite one being the fight between Peter and Harry early in the film. It's fun to watch, and while the effects don't hold up, the scene is still a rush.<br/><br/>The visual style also has that Raimi charm to it. Looking like a comic book world.<br/><br/>And here's an unpopular opinion, I like emo Peter. I think the comedy on this part was entirely intentional, and while I preferred a more serious take on the symbiote aspect of the story, I think the scenes of emo Peter are hilarious. I honestly think the campiness was intentional in these movies. And I think rather than laugh at the movie, and to steal a quote ""You are laughing with the movie.""<br/><br/>What I Don't Like:<br/><br/>Well, I did say I would talk about what I don't like: so I will do that. Where do I start? Well, Venom feels very out of place, he doesn't fit with the theme. The amnesia plot with Harry is really stupid. And is probably the worse part of it's clunky writing. When Harry should've been the main villain. And the movie doesn't feel like it has a main villain. And the issues of course don't end there, but I'm just beating a dead horse.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Now, many might ask, do I like the Amazing Spider-Man 2? And to answer, I don't. Why? Because Spider-Man 3 knows it's stupid. This movie thinks it's super serious. And a great superhero drama. When that's not the case, and you are laughing at it's unintentional hilarity. So I can hate that movie and love this one. And no one will convince me otherwise."

"Meven_Stoffat","5","1","4","21 December 2009"," Seriously?????
","This movie was so bad and convoluted, it was ridiculous, Let me start off by saying that I have seen both Spider Man 1 and 2 in on their opening weeks, and they freaking' rocked. Actually, Spider Man 2 is one of the best movies I have seen in a theatre. Then I saw Spider Man 3 on opening weekend... and Sam Raimi has officially destroyed my love of the franchise. Sadly. I felt as if Sam played a practical joke on us instead of giving us the real Spider-Man 3. There seems to be a limit though on the amount of words so I'll get straight down to it: -The opening fight between Harry and Peter. Wolverine would roll his eyes, it was so dumb. And then of course, the scene ends with Harry getting Amnesia from hitting his head so hard on a rock! WOW!!!! Jessica Simpson did a great job at writing this!!!! Seriously though. That scene was so stupid that everyone was laughing in the theatre.<br/><br/>-I'm not kidding, the whole Amnesia subplot was hilariously bad. All of a sudden, Harry is happier and smiler, and rockin' and rollin'. Franco... please do us a favour and don't give into scripts where your character's amnesia causes your character to be all smiley and happy, because you look and act like an idiot. No joke.<br/><br/>-Sandman. Actually, the whole movie should be cited as a giant epic Sandman failure. He has no development and is just tacked in there to be all cool and badass. And his introduction was hilarious. What is this Military thing in the desert with lots of sand??? And why does he fall into it? And more importantly, why does nobody there notice some random guy in the pit, and the machine turning on? -And also, can someone tell me the point of the whole American Flag gag? Is it because Mr. Raimi had to thrust red, white and blue in your face? Excuse me, I may be a little while on this one, like I have been for the past 3 years.<br/><br/>-Too many villains, too many subplots, too many coincidences. This seriously drove me crazy. I couldn't follow what went on, because of this.<br/><br/>-Gwen Stacy. WOW. WASTED POTENTIAL. The idiotic comments defending her are ridiculous, just like her. No point, except to be hot and sexy, which she is, but that doesn't mean she was a consistent character.<br/><br/>-The Symbiote was seriously stupid. I loved the slick black design, but all of a sudden, Peter goes emo and starts doing sexualized dance movements to girls in the street.<br/><br/>-Speaking of which, whose idea was it to turn the movie into a musical romantic comedy? We have Peter walking around dancing inappropriately, and then then that scene in the club which lasts 10 minutes (it honestly felt like 10 hours). My brain was so tired by that point that when the next scene came, I could only think of that. Oh, and then because he accidentally smacked MJ (that was actually a moment that I applauded at because she was unbearable throughout the whole movie- who would date her at all??????? I certainly would not), he goes all depressed and wants to give it up.<br/><br/>-And yes, this movie is as depressing as I am making it sound like! MJ being a total dog? Check. Aunt May's boring advice? Check. Spidey emo? Check. Emo hair? Check. Boring breakup subplot? Check. This is SPIDER MAN, DAMMIT! WE WANT THE ACTION!!!! NOT HOUR OF SOAP OPERA MATERIAL!!!!! -Venom is seriously, the biggest disappointment of any movie. First off, he's only in the movie for 5 MINUTES, and has literally 4 lines. And he's not the Venom I am used to- Instead he is a totally sleazy douche bag becoming a totally sleazy douche bag, as usual.<br/><br/>-Oh, Sandman killed my dad. Even though he is a murderer and a monster and is using his ""family"" BS as an excuse, I'm just going to forgive him anyway! Seriously, that bit was so stupid, I literally laughed out loud in the theatre.<br/><br/>-And that ending. YAWWWWN.... what happened to the ""Get ready for the next movie"" ending? Instead we just have boring stuff about Peter and MJ dancing...<br/><br/>-Too long for its own good, yet at the same time, too short for all the material crammed in. When you have a movie with a ridiculous amount of villains and subplots, it becomes too long, but then at the same time, it's not long enough, why? Because so much is crammed in that there's not enough time to explore them all.<br/><br/>I could type more, but I'm getting angry just thinking about it."
"RomeoKnight","1","1","4","18 October 2009"," Love this, love that, but where is spider-man?
","What a hell was this? After first two good spidey movies we get this? Oh boy, where should I start.<br/><br/>Firstly, the biggest gripe. The whole love triangle subplot took about 2/3 of the film. I'm not kidding. It seemed the whole movie revolved around some adolescent boy-girl love drama. spider-man is a god damn cartoon character with lots of fights against cool villains and heroic moments and not some Casablanca! How many 9-12 aged boys want to see their idol kissing and whining for some red haired girl all the time? I'm an adult and even I don't want to see that crap.<br/><br/>Secondly, what a mess the script was. There is sandman who is poorly acted by some no-name no-personality actor. There is some black goo that turn people into evil spideys. There is green goblin junior with a grudge (I liked the actor though). There is red haired diva girl with mannerism that already start to annoy. Total mess. The black spidey was a cool concept and I liked it but I didn't like Peter Parker acting like some ""cool"" bad-ass guy. It was mostly embarrassing to watch and totally pointless to show to audiences (did they actually screen this movie to test audiences?). OK, OK we get it! He turns into a bad guy by the goo. I wanted to see black spider-man doing bad things wearing the suit, not Peter Parker with Hitler hairdo trying to score chicks! Also related to this: keep the damn spider-man mask on! People want spider-man, not Peter Parker with a suit.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the acting and dialog was sub par. Good ol' granma blasts clichés and ""pearls of wisdom"" like ""man's gotta put girls needs before him"". Right. Platitudes include things like ""You're okay?"", ""Yeah"", ""Good"" (aaand, cut!).<br/><br/>I wanted to see great thrilling action and witty dialog and inventive plot that would nail my eyes on the movie. I wanted to see spider-man, not Peter Parker and his personal love affairs. There was a lot of cheesy parts some of I just had to rewind. This movie is disgrace to spider-man canon and that's why I don't give any slack with my one star rating. I could give this easily 4 or even 5 stars but I just don't want to. I'm so disappointed. I want to end this with a positive note and say that at least the sandman was technically well made. Props for CGI team."
"flapdoodle64","1","1","4","28 May 2008"," Three's a Crowd
","I love comic books and there are many comic book movies I have liked, including the first 2 Spidey films. But 'Spider-Man 3' is pretty terrible. I think the major problems with this film come from 3 big mistakes: 1) Trying to outdo the first 2 Spidey films. I.e., Spidey #1 had 1 super-villain, #2 had 2 super-villains, therefore #3 should have 3 villains. This doesn't work because these villains are clearly too much for Spidey, thus necessitating some extremely unbelievable and stupid plot twists. And it doesn't work because there isn't enough time to develop any emotional interest in the hero-villain conflict.<br/><br/>2) It's obvious that this movie was created to produce maximum video/computer game spinoffs. The menu screen of the DVD features video game versions of Spidey and other characters moving about in video game style and a couple of the 'special features' are video game promos. The creative decision to go this way has led to fight scenes that are way too long, break too many laws of physics too often, shatter all sense of believability, and feel downfight oppressive and exhausting. My guess is that for those of us over 35, at least those of us who don't play computer games daily, our eyes are simply not geared fast enough to really follow this kind of action.<br/><br/>3) Over-reliance on Computer Generated Images (CGI). The fight scenes all look like either cartoons or video games, and so you just don't have the kind of dramatic involvement required to suspend disbelief. In the old days, directors had to rely on tricks of editing, camera position, stuntmen, harnesses, etc. to create exciting and believable fight scenes. Now that those gimmicks aren't necessary, directors seem to think we'll just buy into anything. Not so: the old school fight scenes, where you had stunt men doing what was vaguely possible intercut with close ups of the actors' faces, looking angry, exasperated, sweaty, etc., had much more dramatic impact. Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Johnny Weismuller, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood never needed CGI. Hollywood seems to think that CGI solves all problems of special effects and fight scenes. Not so: CGI looks fake, just in a new way.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man 3 is bad because it follows the conventions and formulae of most modern action films: more, harder, bigger, badder, etc. and full-speed ahead with the games and merchandising. This movie is all about the paycheck, there is neither heart nor soul."

Even with three villains they couldn't keep me paying attention.<br/><br/>The dialog is so terribly melodramatic and unreal people in the audience were actually laughing when characters on screen were crying and revealing their innermost feelings.<br/><br/>Characters swung from one side to the other, from good to evil, just by hearing a couple of honest words or seeing the light that seemed to come from absolutely nowhere? Okay, the special effects were really good. They keep getting better and better. The Sandman's scenes were especially well done.<br/><br/>But what I loved about the last two movies was their integrity in regards to character motivations and emotions.

","I was very disappointed. The action scenes were messy an unorganized. They did not flow well and it made it somewhat difficult to follow at times. The scenes where Peter takes on the black suit persona were laughable - in a bad way. He dances in the street like John Travolta in Satuday Night Fever and dances again in a bar with his new arrogant confidence that too closely resembeled Jim Carrey in The Mask. I was surprised that this was the same director as the first two that I enjoyed watching. He made the mistake of writing his own script and screenplay.

"CrazyMovieEyes","10","1","4","10 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 swings into becoming the best film of 2007
","As a long-time Spiderman fan, I expected a lot from this film. The 'spidey' universe is full of interesting and exciting characters and super villains, and Sam Raimi managed to incorporate three of the best into this summer blockbuster. Toby Maguire shone as Peter Parker once again as he struggled to life a normal life with Mary Jane but with the added trouble that comes with owning an alien being. On the topic of Mary Jane, I feel that her role in this film was small compared to others, possibly due to the lack of time in the film, or prehaps movie fans and comic fans saw that there was no-where else for her character to do within the plots confines. Instead, Kirsten Dunst portrayed a Mary Jane without a direction or focus, the first theatre scene her best contribution by far. Now, Bryce Dallas Howard as the lovable Gwen Stacey was the highlight of the film for me. Gwen Stacey has always been a favourite character of mine for many years and Dallas managed to bring her magical persona to the screen perfectly with just a dash of 'girl-next-door' looks (very simular to Mary Jane in Spider-Man 1). If asked, I really hope she is brought back for Spider-Man 4. Howard should be proud. J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is, and always will be, the best comic book film character ever. The humor of his character and scenes is just side-splitting funny to watch and it hasn't lost its impact. More of this would have been apreciated however. Sandman, Green Goblin and Venom. Three of the favourite Spider-Man villains. All used to perfection, all had reasonable backgrounds and worked within the confines of the story. But my main problem with having three villains is what killed over the Batman film series with Batman Forever. Having two villains team up is always an mistake. The ending for me was good, but prehaps a little too predictable. Finally, the whole 'black-suit' Spider-Man was a real letdown for me as it didn't feel like it did in the comics. The suit was always meant to be a part of Peter Parker and allow him to change at will. It was never a separate costume. Overall, this film is 10/10 on everything."

"gatsby2244","10","1","4","9 May 2007"," Despite its flaws,better than the first two
","We waited three years for this, the third Spider-Man adventure- and what a long wait that was ! Now I've finally seen it and can only say breathlessly-AWESOME !! It starts with the storyline itself- whereas we only had to concentrate on Doc Ock and one long(though, unforgettable !) duel between him and Spidey in the second instalment, here we are left speechless at the variety of themes that are treated,and deftly brought together by Sam Raimi's masterly direction .The sheer idea of bringing together so much in one film shows just how dedicated Raimi is to his character,and he ends up delivering a near-flawless product, which by the way, has once again broken box-office records all over the world.We are treated to three villains at one go-Sandman,portrayed brilliantly by Thomas Haden Church,Goblin alias Harry Osbourne,and the delightful Topher Grace as Venom.To make things even worse, Peter Parker has to fight his own inner demons too- what could be more entertaining ? Raimi never lets the script get too dark at anytime, and throws in some classic comedy moments into the mix , courtesy J.K. Simmons and the evergreen Bruce Campbell.Both shine in their brief, but memorable on-screen moments.Tobey Maguire has improved greatly as an actor, and it shows right from the start. He still is the centerpiece in this movie, though he is somewhat upstaged( however briefly) by Church and Grace,both of whom are experienced actors. Then there is Kirsten Dunst, who is perfect in her role as MJ, and even impresses with her vocal talents this time ! Of course it's not the first time-she did a pretty good job in "" Get Over It"" too. Special mention must be made of Bryce Dallas Howard, who is rather good as Grace's girlfriend, and seems to have a good future ahead of her. She is very easy on the eyes , too. And now to the special effects, which are the first and last reason for anyone to go to see this flick - they are simply UNBELIEVABLE. CGI was never this perfect, never this heart-stopping. Every action sequence is executed with incredible precision , making the train sequence in the second movie look like an antique ! The CGI guys have clearly outdone themselves, and anyone who criticizes them must be out of their minds. Well, there can't be any movie without flaws- and yes, this film has them too. The greatest flaw of Spider-Man 3 is that it actually has no real villains ! Sandman is terrifying, and yet, the way he is dealt with is actually pathetic to see. Goblin and Venom , despite being formidable baddies, end up looking like dilettantes.The film actually ends up looking like a family drama with action thrown in for good measure.And it hurts me to say it.There were teens in the movie-theater next to me who were complaining about too much emotion and character development being thrown in. Maybe they were right.If a fourth movie is to be made(and I am sure it will ), Raimi should spend less screen time on Aunt Mae or MJ crying/brooding/fuming, and give the audience a villain who'll make their blood curdle, yet one who Spidey can take on his own, and NOT with the help of some friend ! Still, all things considered, Spider-Man 3 is a great movie, certainly not to be missed.It clearly outshines both its predecessors,drama or no drama. Great work, Raimi !"

"MaxBorg89","7","1","4","8 May 2007"," Third time's a charm... or maybe not
","In 2002, Spider-Man was a huge hit, impressing comic-book fans and critics alike. Two years later, the sequel gained even more praise, justly regarded as one of the few follow-ups that actually improve on the original. Needless to say, expectations were justifiably high for the third installment. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 is the least strong (""worst"" is too harsh with a Raimi flick) entry in the franchise (officiallly a trilogy, but there's a strong chance a fourth movie will get made).<br/><br/>Whereas in the first two movies he enjoyed getting his hero in trouble, this time Raimi (who also wrote the script with his brother Ivan) opens the film with an illusion of happiness: Peter Parker is an excellent student, is about to ask Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him and, best of all, has been able to convince the people of New York his web-slinging alter ego isn't the criminal J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons, still a riot) makes him appear to be. Naturally, this being a Spider-Man movie, things start going downhill pretty fast: first of all, MJ is fired from a Broadway show because of bad reviews; then there's Harry Osborn (James Franco), Peter's best friend, still eager to avenge the ""murder"" of his father (Willem Dafoe, who makes a brief but memorable appearance about twenty minutes into the film); moreover, an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), aka Sandman, is revealed to be the real killer of the beloved Uncle Ben. And let's not forget Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a cocky photographer who's trying to steal Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. Quite a lot to handle at once, don't you think?<br/><br/>In fact, the presence of three distinct villains - generally not a good thing, as Batman & Robin ""memorably"" proved - is the main flaw of the movie, despite Raimi's attempts to construct a coherent plot with the bad guys having a section each until the overblown climactic showdown where they all come together. Not that the actors are bad or anything: James Franco's logical evolution from best friend to new archnemesis works perfectly, and Haden Church brings an unexpected maturity to a potentially campy role (besides, his arc allows Cliff Robertson, aka Uncle Ben, to make a welcome return in a couple of flashbacks). As for Grace, his problem is strictly time-related: the whole movie builds up to his character's transformation in Venom, one of the most loved villains of the comics. Raimi, however, has openly stated he doesn't like him, and so Venom gets a total of six minutes to impress us, which is too little even for Grace's considerable charm and talent (Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays MJ's potential rival Gwen Stacy, is similarly underused). <br/><br/>Still, the ""evil trio"" allows Spidey to exclaim ""Where do all these guys come from?"", a deliberate in-joke that sets the tone for the entire film: the trailer promised a darker installment, akin to Christopher Nolan's version of Batman, and there are a few pretty grim moments, but most of the time those scenes are replaced by moments of absurd humor. This isn't a new technique coming from Raimi (he mastered the same balance between laughs and shocks in the Evil Dead trilogy), and the comic-book is well known for pulling off the exact same stunt, but this time the director hits overload, causing a tonal confusion: the usual cameos by Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell (the latter gets listed in the opening credits despite being in only one scene) are hilarious, while Peter's ""evil"" dance routine (see it to believe it) borders on ridiculous. <br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man 3 isn't really a bad film: the story works to a reasonable extent, Maguire and Dunst still share a perfect chemistry, and the visual effects are as stunning as ever. Nevertheless, there's a distinct feeling that something's missing. Maybe next time Raimi will remember this: in some cases, less truly is more."
"vickypollardsbestmat-1","9","1","4","8 May 2007"," Spidey's back swinging
","This film has everything a Hollywood production should have but often lacks: stunning action sequences, ambiguous characters, emotive performances, and most surprisingly this time round, a very witty script. I'm a big fan of Spider-Man in general, he's my favourite of the Marvel comics for so many reasons, and Sam Raimi is doing a fantastic job at bringing those aspects to life, namely Peter's inner as well as outer struggles and his general duality in life. He is complex yet delicate at the same time.<br/><br/>I have to say the criticisms I have read, professional or otherwise, anger me as I feel people aren't even watching the film properly, facts are often wrong, so the best advice is to watch it for yourselves. The friend I went with isn't in to Spider-Man at all and loved this sequel, because this time there is constant comic relief from J. Jonah Jameson, Peter's boss, and the excellent cameos from creator Stan Lee and the ever entertaining sci-fi/horror legend that is Bruce Campbell (donning an hilarious French accent), as well as from Peter himself after the symbiote brings out his darker side, and quite frankly, his sense of humour.<br/><br/>The film's length was also not a problem for us, we didn't see the time go in, and yes I am a geek, I could have watched it all night. I was excited anyway as Venom is one of my favourite baddies, his whole being is so intricate and integral to the plot line rather than just being a mono-event freak accident like most others. I suppose I would have liked to have seen Eddie Brock's Venom for longer, but the whole point of his genesis is Spider-Man's black suit, which I think Raimi did an excellent job with. There is so much to say about this film so I urge you all to see it. It is deeper than simply being a 'super hero' flick."
"frankwhat","9","1","4","8 May 2007"," ""Spider-Man 3""  Summer '07 Officially Swings In
","Ultimately I was highly impressed by the last installment of a trilogy that due to its immediate success has spawned a supposedly unplanned follow-up trilogy. ""Spider-Man 3"" starts off on a happy note and all is well for Peter Parker, however things quickly go awry as his web gets even more tangled than ever before. A big warning to all potential viewers should be that if they're not familiar with the comic books with at least a general knowledge of the new villains, then there's a favorable chance that they will become completely lost along the way. This is mainly due to the fact that so many characters and subplots were crammed into too short of a time and the story moves along at a lighting fast pace. If you aren't paying attention I can see how it'd be very easy to get confused about who's who.<br/><br/>Even though there was a mostly younger cast they all did supremely well. Tobey Maguire was probably the only exception but even he was okay. J.K. Simmons was absolutely hilarious and even though he was cramped for screen time, whenever he was present the audience was laughing. The same went for Bruce Campbell who despite only having one scene, made sure all eyes were on him for that whole time. The biggest surprise for me was Bryce Dallas Howard who I normally haven't been thrilled by, nevertheless was very pleasant hereboth on the eyes and acting-wise.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness of this film besides squeezing too much into it, was the cheese factor. The worst of the worst was when Spider-Man runs past an American flag. This was tied with the jazz club dance routine. The audience was literally groaning out loud at this and ruined the momentum that was built up until these points. Plain and simple they just didn't belong. I'm not even going to comment on when Peter Parker develops a darker side since that sequence was too corny to capture the essence of in mere words.<br/><br/>On the brighter side there were many pluses, the first being the CGI as it was incredible. So much work must've been put into making the Sandman character as they fine-tuned him down to each grain. I also was impressed at how so many separate stories were tied together so well. The musical score was invigorating and set an appropriate pace. Even though the running length clocked in at around two-and-a-half hours, I couldn't tell since there weren't many slow moments and it seemed to fly by. The producers could've easily added on another half-hour and I wouldn't have noticed. That might've even been a better way to go.<br/><br/>Any true fans of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise should see this. The tone and style are a lot different than the first two, but in some ways this is better since it adds a darker feel to the experience. There are some great quotes as always, which is a bare essential of any worthwhile comic book adaptation. To all those cynics that are complaining about the lack of clearly defined villains, well welcome to reality. Even the most ruthless bad guys either have some good to them in real life, or there were mitigating reasons for what made them into what they are. I thought that touch made it easier to identify with the antagonists since they had actual human aspects to them.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi stuck to his artistic vision as best that he could and the successful completion of a blockbuster such as this deserves the high box office results it'll certainly produce. I'm very glad that they will continue the series even if it means bringing in a new cast and crew. Spider-Man was one of my favorite superheroes growing up as a kid due to his sheer ordinary daytime persona and the horrible things he'd have to endure. Yet he'd keep on going, not by relying on his superhuman powers but by getting by with sheer determination along with the love from his family and friends. Thankfully ""Spider-Man 3"" didn't stray too far away from the comic books that it was based on, and was one of those movies that really make you stop to think about the fairness in life. It strives to be more than it is and in most cases, that's exactly what it does. As Stan Lee would say himself, ""'Nuff said!"""
"niceguy_gav","9","1","4","8 May 2007"," Too many people hate this movie for no reason !!!!
","Lets get one thing straight first of all - Spiderman 3 isn't perfect. Nor is it Batman Begins, or in fact Spiderman 2. But on the plus side (and a BIG plus in my opinion) it isn't Fantastic Four, Daredevil or the ""Joel Schumacher"" Batman Movies !!!! What it is though, is a great comic book movie, albeit let down by the final third. I guarantee the same people slagging it off now, will watch it in a years time and say ""I was wrong !!!"" The acting by the returning characters is spot on, action sequences fantastic and the overlying story of redemption, love is played out brilliantly. I'll admit, you get the feeling Sam Raimi really doesn't like Venom due to the lack of input for the character, he is there more out of necessity if anything. Also, (*spoiler ahead*) whenever Sandman turns into the giant ""mummy rip-off"" I lost interest. But those are really the only gripes. Really and truly, there could be a whole movie about Venom (which I would love by the way), But the ""black suit"" is the main focus point of this story, not Venom. The finale for me is the real let down. The rushed and cheesy feel is definitely where this movie fails. Its unfortunate because the first three quarters of this movie will satisfy every Spidey fan out there. Really and truly a great comic book movie still. What does annoy me is people slating Sam Raimi. Were it not for his vision and skill as a director, and for the actors involved, we would have been subjected to a much poorer version of the franchise !!"
"Wildman_3j","8","1","4","8 May 2007"," Take Spiderman 3 with a grain of salt. . .or two!
","There is a lot going on in Spiderman 3. So many characters, and so many stories going on at once. It's a surprise that they were able to cram everything into the 2 hour and 20 minute running time. This may sound like a long film, which it technically is, but with so much going on it still felt that they should have given the more time to explain itself. For the first time in a Spiderman film we are introduced to multiple villains. First we have Flint Marko aka. The Sandman, who in my opinion is easily the best character in the film, played very well by Thomas Hayden Church. A character that you just might find yourself caring for. He is a flawed villain, not at all evil at heart but is forced to commit these crimes to get money to help his sick daughter. Eventually joining him is Eddie Brock aka Venom, a fan favorite character who is also exposed to the dark Symbiote after Peter, and inherits similar powers to Spiderman(this is due to the Symbiote remembering). Venom is played by That 70's Show star Tropher Grace. He played it well, but it is hard to watch him and not see Eric Forman, considering how similar he played Eddie to his famous television character. However, once he has that Symbiote suet and becomes the Venom, you cannot help but get your geek on and enjoy it! Finally he have the ""New Goblin"" which is just vengeful Harry Osborn using his fathers technology to recreate the foe we all remember from the original film. New Goblin is basically an angry snowboarder, an angry showboarder with bombs. We do not actually see a lot of this character in the film, and to be honest it is hard to think of him as a villain being Harry. Because really he is just angry and confused kid who thinks his best friend killed his father.<br/><br/>You really do have to take Spiderman 3 with a grain of salt, or two. Again, it has a lot of story, but it also has a lot of humor, which may seem out of place. Its not only Spiderman who becomes this darker self but Peter Parker also becomes another person. Which can only be described as one thing, EMO(Emo is a ambiguous term used to describe a subculture of fashion and music which is sort of a combination between Punk and Goth. An ""EMO Kid"" is usually angry quite and dark. EMO coming from the word EMOtional.) Its not clear weather this is supposed to be humorous or not, but it really is. When you see Peter with his bangs combed down and his eyes darkened by make-up, you cannot help but laugh. Also being that this is the vision of Sam Raimi, you know it must have been meant for laughs. There is one scene in particular which sees Peter strutting down the sidewalk to some cornball music striking cornball poses to all the ladies, and even stopping at a fashion store and getting some ""hip new threads"". Its moments like this that can kill a film, and for a lot of people it did. Its out of place campy humor and dancing really kinda picks the film up and carries it to a different place for a few scenes. The concept is good, Peter is a dork, and if the Symbiote is supposed to bring out your dark inner self, then Peter, though now dark, should still be a dork. Which he is. Though perhaps having Peter dancing on a bar was a bit too much. There is some great comedic moments in the film, most of which involves J. Jonah Jameson and his newspaper staff, and another wonderful show stealing cameo from the legendary actor, and Raimi regular Bruce Campbell. Who plays a french Maitre d.<br/><br/>Where Spiderman really thrives, and uses most of its $250million budget is the action, and the way over the top(in a good way I suppose)CGI! The action is top notch, you may have to grit your teeth and suffer through some dramatic scenes, but its all worth which when you get to see one amazing climax! And in between we also have some pretty great moments, including a very memorable sewer battle between the symbiote Spiderman and Sandman! The CGI is almost flawless which is an enormous leap forward from the somewhat animated looking graphics from the original film. Regardless of what you think of the story, or the jokes, or the drama. One thing is for sure, you have to be dead to not at least enjoy the action!<br/><br/>Overall Spiderman 3 is a worth while finale(?), to what has become the most successful comic book franchises ever created. It may not be the strongest in the series, but then again when is a third film ever the strongest? It is very much worth watching, and it's a must watch on the big screen. Love it or hate it Spiderman 3 is destined to be one of the most successful films of the year in this ""summer of sequels"". You may even have to watch it more then once to fully digest what is given to you. One thing is for sure, its needs some tweaking from what is being shown in its initial theatrical release, and if we all know the film business there will most likely be another version of the film. Perhaps as an initial DVD release, or maybe a second release later on. But as Kevin Smith once said ""Theatrical releases are just previews for the DVD release""<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 The Directors Cut will arrive one day. . ."
"SolaceBlood","9","1","4","7 May 2007"," Great movie; possibly better than the other two combined!
","I saw the movie Saturday after it came out. So,before then, I had heard mixed feelings about the movie. Most people I talked to thought it was the better of the three movies. One person said it was better than the other two movies combined. After I had seen it, I thought it was a great movie, but I don't know about it being better than the other two. The effects were good and the story line was awesome, the way they incorporate three different villains into one movie was amazing. Butthere were a couple of cheesy lines and dull scenes (not very manythought). I would definitely go see it again, if I had the chance tovisit an IMAX theater. If you are a fan of intense action, and amazingspecial effects (or not), I recommend this movie!"

","In 2002 Sam Raimi, with the help of modern day technology, showed an exceptional and successful comic book adaptation in ""Spider-Man."" Then in 2004 Sam Raimi outdid himself by directing a sequel that took everything that made the original great and improved upon it. Fast-forward to May 4, 2007 and Sam Raimi is at it again with ""Spider-Man 3."" With arguably two great, this review believes that they belong in the league of the best of their genre, comic book adaptations under his belt; can Sam Raimi bring a successful third film to the saga? <br/><br/>Peter Parker's life is finally starting to look up. His relationship with Mary Jane Watson is picking up, he is still taking responsibility as Spider-man, and he is a celebrity in NY. Now he faces new challenges. Parker's old friend, Harry Osborn, is out for revenge against Peter; Parker also discovers that his Uncle's real killer, Flint Marko, who is mistakenly transformed into the Sandman, is still out there. Hope seems lost until Peter discovers a black alien organism, aka a symbiote, which turns his suit black but improves his powers significantly. Unfortunately, the side effects of the symbiote show a darker side to Parker's personality. When Peter discovers his wrongdoings, he attempts to get rid of the symbiote suit. Parker successfully gets rid of the symbiote, but it found a new host, Eddie Brock, causing the birth of Venom, Spider-Man's most dangerous foe. Will this be the end of Spider-Man?<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of the movie, which you should realize after reading the synopsis, is that there is too much going on. There are too many plots, too many characters, and too little development. The audience has to watch Spider-man face off with three villains and his inner-demon. In addition Gwen Stacy is added as part of a love triangle. Applause should go to Sam Raimi for attempting to bring it all together but the entire plot and subplots would be better suited for an extra movie. This was a big worry upon this reviewer but Sam does it better then originally thought. It was a lot better then the poor excuse for a director, Brett Ratner, of ""X-Men: The Last Stand.""<br/><br/>Despite there being too much in the movie, the movie was very entertaining. As far as film-making goes it is not the quality of one or two, but as far as the fun superhero, comic book type of movie, it was everything that it should have been. The visual effects were amazing. The action scenes were the best of the series. The humor was upped a lot as well, though some may complaint about there being too much. The acting was as good as it should be. As far as a ""Spider-Man"" movie goes this is what you should expect.<br/><br/>Visually this movie was outstanding. The special effects were out of this world but since it is the most expensive movie ever made that is expected. It would be shocking if this movie is not nomiated for special effects. The visual effects that really stood out were the creation of the Sandman and the symbiote. The action scenes were great as usual. This reviewer thought that they were more thrilling then that train scene from ""Spider-Man 2.""<br/><br/>Besides the visuals, the humor was great. It was just as campy and silly as the first two series but turned up a notch. Bruce Campbell made another cameo, as he has in the last two, as the hilarious Maître d'. There is even homage to both ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""The Mask."" Some may complain that some of these more campy scenes ruin the movie, but this reviewer thinks otherwise. The reviewer loved those scenes; he believes they improved the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was as good as you should hope for in a movie like this. The returning cast was just as good as the other two. The newcomers are also a great addition to the ""Spider-Man"" cast. Thomas Hayden Church was good as the Sandman/ Flint Marko. Topher Grace, Eric from ""That 70's Show,"" was a huge surprise as Eddie Brock/ Venom. It will be exciting to see what Topher's career choices will be after ""That 70's Show."" Bryce Dallas Howard was also great as Gwen Stacy. It was very obvious why Peter Parker would like her and why Mary Jane could possibly be jealous of her.<br/><br/>Overall if you liked or loved the first two ""Spider-Man"" you may like it. The reviewers are very mixed but that is probably because the viewers each had expectations that were too high. The only real defect to the movie was that there was too much happening. Luckily everything else that this reviewer loved made it forgivable. Any other complaints are just very minor nitpicks. Congratulations to ""Spider-Man 3"" for collecting $151.1 million at the domestic box office it's opening week. ""Spider-Man 3"" is recommended!"

","This didn't really measure up to the first two movies, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are incredible. They whirl across the building tops of the city, and the blows are believable and painful to watch. (For example, when Peter trips Harry with a web, and he falls down, I winced.) It's definitely worth watching for the action scenes alone. They are well choreographed, the CGI is breathtaking, and it's just great to see the characters butt heads in a fight. The Sandman vs. Spidey scene was great, as was both of the Harry vs. Peter scenes (these were actually my favorite, because we've had three movies to get emotionally invested in both characters.) While I liked the individual stories, I think the movie overall was too cluttered. Separately, I think each story would have worked better.<br/><br/>The Sandman story is brilliantly written, touching, and sad. Great acting, great character. I hope he turns up again.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Harry Osborn's character arc in this film. It's been building up all throughout the franchise, and it has finally come full circle. I've always had a soft spot for dark little vengeful Harry, and it was fun to see him go all the way, allowing revenge to completely consume him, to rising to the ranks of a hero. Amnesia!Harry was both touching and amusing. The scene where he and Peter dribble a basketball through the Osborn penthouse is one of my favorites. All bitterness has been forgotten. They're just two high school outcast best friends again. It was sweet. And I'd be surprised at anyone who didn't grin when he showed up at the end in Goblin garb and fought alongside Peter. I'm really sad he won't be around anymore, as he and Spidey made a pretty awesome team. Loved the character, loved James Franco, who managed to make a half-deformed face really hot. Seriously, the Phantom of the Opera's got nothing on him.<br/><br/>Ahem.<br/><br/>There was a lot of silly slapstick in the background of this movie. You'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>Beware of the cheese. Normally, I don't mind cheese too much, but it goes a bit overkill in this movie. I mean, the other two movies could be cheesy, but sometimes, cheese it good. Like cheddar. Mmmmm, cheddar...<br/><br/>It's a fun movie, probably good to see with friends. If you want to laugh at the cheese, don't be afraid. Don't hold it against the other two movies, just enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>Oh, and Bruce Cambell is awesome. Worship the Bruce."
"mellowmice","8","1","4","6 May 2007"," Over All: Good-- But Does Depend on Definition and Expcectation
","I stood in line for over five hours to watch Spider Man, and anticipated it for two weeks in advance. Finally watching it, I was not disappointed. And I don' think anyone else will be very disappointed if they go in with low expectations. Check it out: First off they had far to many villains(three-four villains for one movie was way to many...a big mistake). Not to mention that they (the bad dudes) kept going back and fourth from villainy to heroism. Not only that, spider man lost his mask to many times, and was a cocky jerk even before the venom took over. But I think the real clincher was his dance of evil, in which he decides to go dancing along the sidewalk to show his conversion to villainy, and his haircut from hell, where he decides to comb his hair across his forehead, once again to reveal his villain hood: in other words, jerk hood. Spider man himself was a little disappointing, his ""struggle within himself"" was a let down. Wasn't nearly intense enough. He also appeared a little wimpy because in all reality he only kills one villain. However despite these things, it was still good. Very fun to watch, and worth seeing again. It had good morals, and an important message for those able to see it. Also was it was intriguing to see which villain would pop next-or return-and see what would happen next. The cheesiness was to be expected, and was good for a lot of laughs. Indeed, if one goes in with low expectations, predicting cheesiness (and doesn't care about the fact that it is cheesy), I think they will like it very much."
"royale_w_cheez44","7","1","4","5 May 2007"," The weakest of the trilogy, but still good fun
","Critics have been relentlessly bitchy about Spiderman 3. Even though I see where they are coming from when they say that it wasn't as good as the previous film (it isn't), there are too many villains (there are), too many subplots (there are), and some contrived story elements (there are), the film is just what you would expect in a summer movie: action, adventure, and an enormously entertaining film.<br/><br/>Following up the superb Spiderman 2 was something that might have set this film up to ""disappoint"" from the beginning. With Spidey 2, you had a magnificent villain, a sincere, human storyline to accompany the action, and a plot that worked seamlessly. The fact of the matter is that Spiderman 3 cannot match its predecessor in those respects. It simply doesn't work all the time, but when it does, it shines and creates some of the most audacious moments in the entire series.<br/><br/>The attempt to up the ante falls flat in some respects. The film is just jam packed with so many subplots and characters that it struggles to keep everything in place. You have Peter and MJ's romance, Peter's revenge story against Flint Marko, Peter Parker ""gone bad"", Peter meets Gwen, you get the idea. If nothing else, the story line is quite convoluted and it doesn't always work. Eddie Brock, played spot on by Topher Grace, is also seems rushed. His character was one that needed further development, not to mention more ""villain"" screen time. And don't even get me STARTED on the helpful Osborne butler. Those who have seen the film will know what I'm talking about. All in all, I believe that the film would have worked out better if maybe Venom were eliminated from the script.<br/><br/>That's not saying that Spiderman 3 lacks the sincerity of the second movie, because it certainly has its moments. We see the humanity in Flint Marko (an excellent Thomas Haden Church), or glimpses of a Harry Osborne not bent on revenge, played terrifically by James Franco. The bits that hit spot on in the first films (Aunt May giving Peter money, MJ's abusive parents) aren't quite matched, but Spiderman 3 still has plenty of genuine heart to go around. It also keeps a lot of the humor from the previous films, with an especially brilliant Bruce Campbell cameo. However, these moments are often times overshadowed by a problematic script and story.<br/><br/>But above all, this film is great fun and a visual masterwork. The action is superb and edge-of-your-seat, and absolutely breathtaking in its best moments. Embarrassingly enough, I think I actually gasped out loud in one of those ""close call"" moments. There is one especially ""holy crap"" sequence of Sandman coming together that is so brilliant and haunting that I would almost see the film again for that one scene.<br/><br/>Don't let the negative aspects or critic nitpicking turn you away from seeing this film. The fact of the matter is that despite a story that doesn't gel as well as those of the first two and multiple plots that could have been split up into separate movies, the audacious action, superb visuals, and terrific cast that almost makes up for the jam packed storyline make this a great summer movie, if not a completely disposable one. While it may be a step down from Spiderman 2, I can guarantee that it achieves what VERY FEW comic book films have in the past.<br/><br/>And of course, that's not without saying that it absolutely murders, buries, and spits on films like X-Men: The Last Stand. People should stop using the term ""disappointment"" so loosely when you have films like that."
"cheefyro","5","1","4","5 May 2007"," I regret seeing it
","I am not a fan of the movie Spiderman, I didn't like Spiderman 1 or 2 but I was hoping that since we are in 2007 some film should improve. I am kind of surprised to see so many votes and a high note here. I am pretty disappointed about many of the critics. I went to the movie and I was wondering if it can get more worse as the movie was playing. First of all I think the actress not only that is playing bad but she is also unattractive. She has tons of make-up and she is totally not fitting for the role. The only roles that fit in the movie are Topher Grace and J.K. Simmons who looks pretty funny, but the rest.... Story, it generally goes in a Spiderman way but it has so many problems and so many downwards that I could not imagine. Funny how Sandman/Flint Marko ended being a sandman, rather hilarious. The part where Tobey Maguire playing the Macho? that was fun, was fun to see how it ruins more and more the movie, I think of that part as being one of the most homosexual thing I seen so far. Too many errors in the movie, and investing 250m$ in it, I practically don't believe it. The only part I liked is the final battle when they do good work on the effects. And the end, wow, don't tell me that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst we're trying to get an Oscar out of that.<br/><br/>I gave it a 5 just for the time wasted on the movie."
"rosco55","5","1","4","5 May 2007"," That's Entertainment?
","It's too much and it's not enough. Too much fried food? Too much manipulated vision without a reasonable tale to tell. I had the comics as a kid and understand that corny as they were the collective stories added to something, but for a large expensive and expansive movie there really should be more (or is it less) thought put into these undertakings. Corny can get by if there is a good balance of real drama and humor, but this is another bloated entertainment where the characters have slipped through the cracks between the technology. The public may think they've been entertained, and some of them will be, but for most; at least they can say they've seen it. I'd skip straight to No.5 and let Elmore Leonard write it and give the budget for No.4 to charity."

","I bought the tickets for this film in Mexico one day before the release. I invited my best friends to it and we were on a sort of hype in order to watch it. To be honest, I didn't like the first Spider-Man; the second, I believe was awful. Now, the third... Well, I give it a sentimental value only because of watching it with my friends. Technically speaking, it may have some effects that remind me of The Mummy; some scenes are almost as watching a regular diary of a blown off teenager. And then, A MUSICAL SCENE (!)<br/><br/>I believe that Columbia should have been more thorough in hiring a director that only bluffed about having a Spider-Man poster on his door as a young filmmaker, talking about how he loved the character and all that junk. I even liked the focus on Fantastic Four better than this one (considering that I also hated it). Hero flicks are drowning in a high budget investment and lots of marketing strategies to compensate it. The storyline is every time lighter, less brainy and completely boring. Heck, there was even a point when we counted 8 consecutive yawns during the feature, and a friend of mine asked: ""what's the name of this movie, again, Spider who?""<br/><br/>Bring more talent, people; bring more brains rather than brawl and teen inner conflicts. Less propaganda, please, and more essence of the story. God Almighty, please deliver us from Sam Raimi and Brett Ratner, as well as from uninteresting sagas. Please bring back the time of the superb X-Men, the smart V for Vendetta, the arabesque Hellboy and the beautifully narrated Blade.<br/><br/>And by the way, Spidey, pack Mr. Raimi's bags and go back to sniff on Stan Lee's rear. Get out of the film (sadly) industry."

The story was a good idea, but there was no follow through in the plot. The action scenes were good, but limited. The movie did not feel like a Spider-Man movie, it felt like the Peter Parker chronicles! I was a huge fan of the series up to this point and was very much so anticipating the movie, and it stunk! No matter what this review says if you want to see this movie, you probably will so don't let this review deter you from seeing it.

Isn't that something you find out during the audition process?<br/><br/>2) Did the story really need to have Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brock connected? <br/><br/>3) Is the half-torn Spidey mask now an official look for him?<br/><br/>4) What was they symbiote doing in Peter's apartment in the time between it arriving and it leaping on him? Watching soap operas? 5) Why did Eddie Brock get sharp teeth when the symbiote joined with him? <br/><br/>6) Does Spider-Man have some kind of one person per rescue quota? After he saved Gwen I couldn't help but wonder about the poor crane operator. Was the crane still out of control? Were they able to cut the power?<br/><br/>7) Why would a villain with a ""heart of gold"" like Sandman join up with a clearly evil creature like Venom? <br/><br/>8) Was the New York subway system designed by the same people who created the mine tunnels in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom? <br/><br/>9) Why would Mary Jane go along with the whole ""Dump Peter or I'll kill him"" plan that evil Harry proposes? Did she forget that Peter is Spider-Man and that he can pretty much take care of himself in a fight? Or did she just use that as an easy out for what she really wanted? <br/><br/>10) And where was the scene where Evil Peter would fight Good Peter in a junkyard?"

","I was so disappointed at this film, it started of with promise. Good action scenes, some good villains and the ground work for a good story line from the last two films.<br/><br/>But there are three big reasons that this film is bad. <br/><br/>1- Acting was terrible especially at the end when we are supposed to cry, I just laughed, however this wasn't just because of the bad acting it was also because of the <br/><br/>2- cheesy and clichéd plot which is especially evident when Sandman (after robbing banks and nearly killing spider-man)suddenly says sorry and walks into the sunset as if he has done nothing wrong. And of course where would a clichéd plot be without an old friend (who suddenly is good) turns up just in the nick of time to save spider-man, and then of course has an'emotional' death.<br/><br/>3- The worst crime this film committed is that it got rid of probably one of the best comic book villains (venom) in under 30 minutes of his appearance, not only this but he was defeated ultimately by high pitched sounds.<br/><br/>If u really like spider-man i suggest you give this one a miss and stick with the first two."

","Spiderman 3 succeeds above all in closing down the best comic-book film trilogy. It, unlike X-Men last year, comes full circle-, with the plot successfully relating back to the first and second movies. The plot- 3 villains and enraged Spiderman for the second act, can it work? Supisingly yes, and thanks to some superhero teaming up, the line is drawn and somehow, the editors to their behalf have found a way to cram such a varied storyline into the limited time-frame. The action is superb, and this is the best web-slinging action yet, not to mention the SFX wonder of Sandman. That begin said, Bryce Dallas Howard's acting isn't suited to the character, who struggles to find her feat in the film. The presence of the media turn an emotion packed finale into a cheesy moment. Choopy editing in the first act seems to jumpy, and while Venom, looks great- the voice doesn't sound so. Emo-Peter Pakrer, also doesn't suite choreographed dance sequences, an out-of place moment in the film. However- Spiderman 3 finds its feating in the superb action, visuals, SFX, plot, and the acting of the leading 3 (and Thomas HAden Church). In all- it does what it was meant to do. Full circle the trilogy with substance and style."
"jeffdepressio","3","1","4","5 May 2007"," Bizarre and Unsettling
","A very strange, awkward installment in a franchise that seemed to be gaining momentum in its past two entries. Ridiculous dialogue and shameful interactions between characters culminate in a jumbled, ultimately incoherent plot line. As demonstrated with Schumacher's Batman films, more villains does not make a movie better. Unlike the previous titles in the franchise, the focus here is on three different foes, who are ultimately left undeveloped because of a sheer lack of screen time. Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina were given opportunity to explore their characters, but the same courtesy is not extended to Spider-Man 3's villains.<br/><br/>Those who are seeing this movie for the appearance of fan-favourite Venom will likely leave the theatre unsatisfied. His appearance is rushed considerably, and he hardly seems as deadly as a foe as Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus. The symbiote plot line and Venom's origin are depicted much more effectively in the mid-90s Spider-Man series, which is a shame considering how much more they could accomplish through a film. It would have almost been a more cohesive movie without him, though it certainly would have been great to have him as the film's one central villain.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, it is almost as if the franchise becomes overwhelmed by itself, and in so doing creates a lackluster entry into the Spider-Man series."

","I really liked the first two Spider-Man movies. This one, however, feels like they didn't really even try. Here's why.<br/><br/>The action sequences were good. They weren't great like the first two, but I think we all learned from the Matrix that the same effects get old by the third movie. The problem was that there were so few action sequences.<br/><br/>The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long. This is about an hour longer than it should have been. There were scenes that didn't even have any purpose, that somehow didn't end up on the cutting room floor. This is inclusive of all the singing and dancing. We could have gone our whole lives without all of that.<br/><br/>The characters didn't seem to be themselves. When spidey gets the black suit, Peter turns into some angry emo kid. I won't give anything away at the end, but suffice it to say that the ending is uncharacteristic of the people who are involved.<br/><br/>All in all there were parts of the movie that were supposed to be super dramatic and pivotal to the plot, but left the audience laughing at the cheesiness and awkwardness of them. Everyone let out a sigh of relief when it ended. Not because it resolved anything, but because we didn't have to be subjected to it anymore.<br/><br/>If you are a HUGE Spider-Man fan, go see it anyway.

"Cold-Cock","9","1","4","4 May 2007"," Aaaagh! Too--many--villains. Please. 2 and 1/2 is enough.
","SM3 was a long movie, and with good reason. It translates to the big screen epic plots that had a large amount of buildup to work with to establish their depth. Translating these plots to the big screen usually means condensing a lot of it into a short space. Sadly, SM3 tries to do that, and craft five different story lines around 5 different characters.<br/><br/>There's Mary Jane, there's Peter Parker/Spider Man, there's Harry Osborn, there's Sandman and there's Eddie Brock. All five of the main cast are dynamic characters. Dynamic characters are characters that go through changes of circumstance and/or character in a movie; as opposed to static characters who go through the movie relatively unchanged. SM3 suffers from trying to give all 5 of these characters spotlight and ultimately, you don't know who the movie is really about or who is supposed to be the most important. <br/><br/>The real reason the movie suffers is because all 3 villains try to fill the niche of being Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, and when all three try to take center stage, there ends up being no lead villain. This mirrors Spider-Man's situation from the comics where he's got Doctor Octopus, Venom and Green Goblin each vying for the top spot of Spider-Man's all-time nemesis. But at least in the comic books, you can devote arcs to each individual villain. When you stuff 3 cats into the same bag and give them one mouse to fight over, you end up with what SM3 comes out with: a hero flying blindly into piles of sand and web.<br/><br/>The only redeeming aspects of the movie come at the final half where the plot threads finally start to come together and it feels like we're reading a single comic book again rather than putting down one in the middle of reading it only to pick up a different issue.<br/><br/>Any longer and this movie would have thrown The Lizard/Curt Conners into the mix."

"drawlife","5","1","5","28 September 2014"," A disappointing third entry.
","Massively disappointing. <br/><br/>It's so disappointing that it hurts. Spider-Man 3 to me, I like to compare it to an ex-girlfriend of sorts, there are some things that I liked about it, but a lot more things hate about it. <br/><br/>This film tries too hard and tries too much. As some of you may know Raimi envisioned a different film for Spider-Man 3. I can't help but ponder how that would have turned out. <br/><br/>The plot here isn't the real the problem, I was able to follow the story without any confusion. I understood where the story was going, so the basic plot points is not the film's biggest problem. It's the characters and their actions. The first two films have logic and plausibility to every character's actions, in this one there isn't. There's a lot of miscommunications in this film. For instance why doesn't Mary Jane tell Peter she got fried from the play? Why doesn't she just talk to him about it? Why doesn't Harry's butler tell Harry from the first place that his father died by his own hands? Why does Flint Marko(Sandman) willingly join Eddie Brock(Venom) to kill Spider-Man, after he claimed he's not a bad person? <br/><br/>All this was just very hard to follow, and you question why they would make these choices? It was very frustrating to watch. If it weren't for some of the story elements and the cool action sequences, there wouldn't be anything pleasing to watch at all. <br/><br/>Firstly I did somewhat enjoy Maguire's performance this time around. The very first time he puts on the black suit, he was pretty intimidating, taking out Sandman with no mercy, whom he thought he killed. I liked the contrast of personalities within him here and there, beating up Harry and having no problem throwing the pumpkin bomb right at his face, or the scene where he humiliates Eddie Brock for exposing his flaws in front of the whole Daily Bugle staff. But it all went down hill when he had his, not one, but two moments where he can show off his extremely lame dancing moves. <br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is so hate-able in this film, you'll wonder why anyone bothers to save her, let alone imagine what Peter sees in her in the first place. I guess in a way I have to give credit to Dunst performance because she did a great job at portraying a bitchy and whiny Mary Jane. Rosemary Harris is alright this time around, and J.K. Simmons is always great as J. Jonah Jameson. As for Gwen Stacy, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, well she was just a throw away character, didn't care for her at all and that's not Howard's fault. <br/><br/>Now lets talk about the villains, I for one enjoyed James Franco as Harry. I liked the completed Osborn arc we got in this film. I liked the fact he got amnesia and we got to see the Harry prior to his father's death. Granted it's not exactly the way it was in the comics, but I thought it brought something new to the table and was an acceptable change. I firmly enjoyed Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, but I feel as though Raimi tried to rehash what he did with Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus. It has a been there and done that feel. As for Topher Grace who plays Eddie Brock/Venom, well it's a massive disservice to one of Spider-Man's most popular foe. I didn't mind Grace in the role of Brock, I like the contrast between him and Peter, but it was the way they handled Venom. Just not enough screen time to really do him justice, shouldn't have been in the film at all. Although I must complement his overall physical appearance, he looked great. <br/><br/>Spider-Man 2 was too good, and Spider-Man 3 tries too hard to be as good as Spider-Man 2. All Spider-Man 3 had to be was just good, a decent follow-up to the second film. And from the early stages it looked that way. I also stated that the the first film in the series has a bit of a cheesy factor, well in this one it's over the top. There are too many civilians applauding, cheering, and mourning for Spider-Man, out of place cut-scenes of the kids commenting on the final battle at the end, and too many musical numbers. I have the concept art book for this film, and there were so many scenes left on the cutting room floor. Very similar to the Spider-Man 3 video game, it involves Sandman's daughter Penny, Venom kidnapped her, blackmailing Sandman to help him defeat Spider-Man. <br/><br/>I personally thought this was a better way to execute the film cause again, Sandman in the beginning claimed he's not a bad person, and in the theatrical cut of this film he just agrees to help Venom. There were also extended scenes of Eddie Brock heading over to the church and a scene where he sees Gwen after he gets fired, but finds out that she's going out with Peter. A tender scene with Sandman and his daughter where he transforms as a sandcastle with his wife present. <br/><br/>I feel as though Raimi made a mistake cutting these scenes and changing up the climax. What he could have done was cut out all those dancing sequences and put those scenes in. <br/><br/>I don't personally blame all of it on Raimi, but also the studio and the producers who forced Venom and Gwen Stacy down his throat. He does the best he can do and tries to please everyone, but in the end it's a disjointed entry compared to the two superior installments. <br/><br/>5.7/10"

","Spider-Man was a surprisingly entertaining action flick with touches of humor and suspense. Spider-Man 2 was one of the best films of the past decade, with its alarmingly believable emotion and fantastic characters. But then came this disaster. This movie brings back plot details from the 1st film, making it feel as if the crew ran out of ideas for the story. This then results in Spidey hunting down Flint Marko, played by Thomas Haden Church in a talent-wasting performance. The love triangle between Dunst, Maguire, and Franco has zero sizzle. The action sequences are merely attention-grabbing instead of tense. Spider-Man's dark side is not terrifying, mainly consisting of stealing other people's girlfriends and wearing thick black eyeliner. Instead of being emotionally complex, the subplots this time feel sappy, forced, and manipulative. Church and Topher Grace (as Venom/Eddie Brock) are talented, but not as effective as Willem Dafoe (as the original Green Goblin) and Alfred Molina (as Doc Ock). The endless story lines and melodramatic speeches make this film bland, excessive, and boring. Even the behavior of the characters (leaving boyfriends, assaulting friends, not calling the police) is implausible. If quality ran the box office, this film would not even cross $100 million."

","First of all, I'd like to say that I am a comic geek. I love comics. Marvel, DC, Image...anything...I love em. What I think sucks is that a majority of us cannot be pleased by these movies! Spider-Man 3 is the best example of that. WAH! WAH! WAH! All you people do is bitch. Guess what? NOTHING WILL EVER PLEASE YOU!!! They could have made this movie word for word, scene for scene of the comic and you STILL would have picked it apart! The main complaint I hear is that there was too many villains/plots. God forbid a super hero got a break and only fought one person at a time eh? Here is how I see it: Plot 1)Black suit, Venom/Eddie Brock, and Peter's attitude change (its all the same to me; they all interlink) Plot 2: Sandman, Uncle Ben's Killer (interlink)Plot 3: Peter's failing relationship with his friends and family. So you're saying 3 sub plots is too much? If so, never ever watch Crash! You will die!!! People Spider-Man 3 is a movie. More so, it's a comic movie. NOTHING is supposed to be correct or real about it!!! Enjoy the goddamn thing instead of LOOKING for stuff to complain about!!!!!"

","I was looking forward to this sequel that made a record breaking gross on its opening day, beating Pirates of the Caribbean 2's record, and it was quite satisfactory. Basically, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are together, since she now knows he is web swinging super hero Spider-Man, and he is happy both to be with her and have public cheering and supporting him. But one day, his job as Spidey's photographer is being threatened by rival Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), hoping to be his replacement. Meanwhile, escaped criminal Flint Marko (George of the Jungle's Thomas Haden Church) gets caught in a experiment that places his molecules in sand, and he is now Sandman and can transform into anything he wants. But what Peter also finds out about him, is that he was responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) (accidently, he later finds out). Also, one night a tiny meteor hits the ground, and from it comes out a mysterious black alien substance that will eventually transform Spidey's suit, and Peter's personality (if he has it on underneath his clothes), this becomes a concern for Mary Jane. Also, Harry Osborn (James Franco) recently attempted to become the new Green Goblin, after his father Norman (a brief Willem Dafoe), and he has light amnesia, but he'll get it back and rethink his Dad's past. Finally, when Peter sees the evil of the black suit, he rips it and the substance off his body, and passes it to rival Eddie, who turns into (popular Spidey villain) Venom (but no-one actually calls him that in the film). Also starring Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, Rosemary Harris as May Parker, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, James Cromwell as Captain Stacy, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Dr. Curt Connors, Bill Nunn as Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson, Bruce Campbell as Maître d', Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Hoffman and a more noticeable cameo by Marvel Comics man Stan Lee. Eventually, Venom is defeated, Sandman blows away (he should have stayed washed away), and Harry/New Goblin dies, but will Peter and Mary Jane get engaged? The film may be longer than the other two, and the story may be overloaded and plodding, but the humour and even better special effects (particularly for Sandman) can't be faulted. Good!"
"smithboy777","8","1","5","7 May 2007"," Grownups will be grownups....Critics that never had a childhood.
","First of all...the movie has been getting pounded with tons of negative reactions. They seem to all focus around the same thing, too many villains, what the heck is Peter doing Emo, and bad acting. Its like some playground bully talked about this movie because he expected this and that and wanted to look all big and bad. So then all the kids were like, OK better say the same thing over and over again in different reviews so that we can make Spiderman 3 seem bad compared to all the hype it generated. I'm an 18 year old teenage boy who never ever writes these things and never ever really cares about reviews and such because what i like is what i like. But you see all the reviews everywhere and its the same stuff, i am here to say that this movie is absolutely great. The aciton in it is OUTSTANDING and the people who think its ""Way too cheesy"" must be those kids that had a bad childhood, you know dad was always gone for work and they ended up growing up way too fast. It's like every critic expected it to be something Spiderman isn't. Spiderman is designed to focus on a superhero with problems that also happens to find time to save the day. Its intended to show comic book style action and bring out the kid in everybody. Im glad it doesn't live up to the reviewers expectations because they expect Spiderman 3 to be some melt your heart movie soap opera thing that actually tells some crappy love story the way Notebook did while putting one good action scene. Man, its SPIDERMAN!!!! THATS WHY HE IS WHAT HE IS!!! ACTION, EXCITEMENT, AND HUMOR!!! THe movie does great by first of all delivering non-stop action, WAY MORE than the first Two combined. And even though, yes, the actors are a little young, it in no way takes away from the movie experience. The scenes in the movie had the whole audience laughing and at the same time gasping when the times came. It is told like a comic book. It is fun. Critics, lay off. Every REAL person i've asked thinks it rocks. So go enjoy the movie for yourself, and just enjoy it."
"vip_ebriega","7","1","5","6 May 2007"," Great sequel, but one can't help but think...
","My Take: A rushed and bloated mess. But an extremely enjoyable and exciting one. <br/><br/>...isn't this all too much? This was indeed a great sequel, not just for more CGI. But it is clear that everything goes way too fast in the frantic first half. It is fun and is as deserving as the second (the first was good, but not as great). One of the film's problem lies on its abundance on special-effects. Particularly, in a ""battle that lies within"", do we really need the new villain, Sandman. Thomas Haden Church tries hard to be significant, but other than the fact that he might possibly have something to do with killing Peter Parker's uncle, he has very little to do with the film. With or without Sandman, Sam Raimi would have wrapped up a great film. And, unlike Green Goblin and Doc Ock, his origin of becoming The Sandman is, to but it bluntly, rushed. Obviously, the screenwriters just rushed it so they could get on with the circus of special effects.<br/><br/>But lets skip the negatives. what really gave me the urge to give it a positive review is the superb performance by Tobey Maguire as, not Spider-man, but as Peter Parker. This time around, he isn't just play a nerd, but a different side of Parker, after the ""battle within"" rages inside him. For my opinion, this is his best performance among the three films. The only villain that seems to matter is Venom, a symbolism of inner evil. It was good for the writers to think of that, besides just turning him into another villain. <br/><br/>My overall review, ""Spider-man 3"" is not that bad. For me, it was the most symbolical of the series, which was a good thing for the genre. But too bad, everything is turned bad when it comes to direction. Sam Raimi had so much in his mind at the time that it seems that putting them all together in one sitting is showing too much of a good idea. Let us be thankful, at least, that ""Spider-man 3"" is not another ""Batman and Robin"".<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"kevnar","9","1","5","6 May 2007"," Take it for what it is
","Spiderman comic fans are trashing this movie. Film buffs and movie critics are trashing this movie. The only people who aren't are people who just like to go see an action blockbuster and be entertained. So there's a few details and characters they skimmed over. Big deal. They got the main message across. They entertained people.<br/><br/>The only criticisms I have of it is that the character of Mary-Jane was kind of annoying. Here Spider-man's saving the whole city and she's mad at him because he's not paying enough attention to her. Then in the end, all she does is get rescued. She never really contributes anything except problems. It would have been nice to see her actually do something in the story line. They probably could have completely left the Sandman out of the movie too, and it wouldn't have suffered one bit, but he did add a whole lot of excitement and drama in the end.<br/><br/>Other than that, it was an entertaining action blockbuster. If you were looking for Schindler's List or Shawshank Redemption and were disappointed by Spider-man 3, that just makes you an idiot. Rate this Movie for what it is, not what you thought it should be."
"bnblack","10","1","5","6 May 2007"," Amazing.
","Awesome Best Spiderman Yet. And one of the best Superhero movies ever, much better than the disappointing x3 or superman returns. Also much better than the likes of Daredevil, Electra, Hulk, and Punisher, I DON'T like Spiderman as a general concept, he is way to much of a whiny kid to me both in the comic and in the first two movies. I really disliked the first film and felt there was not enough action in the second, way to much whining about MJ and ""I don't want to be Spiderman.""Now to finally see him not only except his role as Spiderman and then be a bad ass, granted a little EMO was cool. It reminded me of the now modern Superhero classic of Batman Begins. Although Maguire did ham it up a little, it is a kids movie after all, and that is to be expected. But as with the first two the saving graces are the villains really good choices, the villains this go around are all really cool and well fleshed out, and just kick ass to watch. And the balancing of the 3 villains was amazing and very well done storytelling. Not to mention killer effects,Venom was very well done and the Sandman was incredible especially at the end.<br/><br/>B"

"donatolla","4","1","5","5 May 2007"," Worst of the Series...
","Perhaps part of the reason why I give this a low mark is that I had high expectations going in. Maybe that's not fair. In my book, you spend more money on a movie than any other, I think that high expectations are justified.<br/><br/>This was supposed to have action, suspense, and humour. Was it really supposed to be an overlong melodramatic soap opera? My only impression when I left was that Sam Raimi turned spiderman into a ""chick movie"".<br/><br/>I can say without question that the action sequences were quite good. The producers got what they paid for. However, there were sequences (primarily involving Harry) that seemed very cartoony.<br/><br/>From there, I'm not sure what to say. It is a comic book movie, and shouldn't be taken too seriously. The movie seemed very long. There were massive segments dripping with melodramatic cheese. During one particularly long segment, my wife leaned in and said: ""This is boring."" And she was right. I checked my watch several times - never a good sign for a movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I wasn't in the right demographic? Not so...looking around, there were many kids looking for more spidey action. Instead, they were left to jump around on chairs and run for refills of popcorn as the dramatic pieces bored them to pieces.<br/><br/>When all was said and done, Spiderman 3 was too long, too boring, and had too few over the top action sequences to make up for the badness.<br/><br/>Oh...and Emo Peter Parker was so bad I found it hard to watch. At least fans of the Cure finally have a comic movie with scenes they will identify with."
"Adenjo","3","1","5","5 May 2007"," Spiderman3 : The letdown
","I'd been planning on taking the kids to see Spiderman 3 for a while now, as usual I had to give the kids the ""cinema rules"" y'know the drill... No talking, please sit still.. And as an added extra.. ""even if Spiderman 3 is amazing, you still have to walk out saying Superman returns was far better"".. Take note, the last rule was a joke and the kids were under no obligation to follow it to the letter...<br/><br/>So we all sit in our seats... Me, Jo, Kai (9), Nick (7) and their friend Callum (8) The trailers played Harry Potter, Shrek 3, Transformers, Pirates 3 and the Simpsons.. And then Spiderman 3. I'll cut straight to the chase and maybe dissect the film later. Spiderman 3 is an awful film. Easily the least entertaining of the three spider movies.. yes even worse than the bore fest that was Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 (IMO) lacks action, sadly the action that is seen on screen is handled very badly.. We have CGI that rivals the most awful Superman returns CGI in the crap stakes, we have action scenes riddled with plot holes (yes, Spidey saves Gwen Stacy when she falls from the building.. But Spidey old mate.. you seem to have forgotten all about the out of control crane)<br/><br/>We have Harry (hey i'm evil.. hey i've lost my memory, hey my memory's back and i'm evil again.. Hey, Peter just blew me up with a bomb and all I got was this lousy facial scar..Hey I've had a chat with the butler and now i'm gonna be Peter Parkers best mate again) Osbourne.. OK there was a point to Harry, He's always wanted MJ and yes he blames Spidey for the death of his father.. But surely if Harry were to become the goblin he'd have at least created a costume/glider that resembles that of the Goblin? or did Harry also agree that perhaps the Spidey 3 toyline may need a little action figure related boost?<br/><br/>Eddie (bugger me, Peter Parker found out I photo shopped a spidey picture and he got me fired now he must DIE!!!!!) Brock... I think he has anger management issues.<br/><br/>Sandman.. I liked Sandman, I though most of his CGI was handled pretty well.. Well, it was a bit CGI from the Mummy, but it kinda worked. <br/><br/>Spiderman 3 had 3 villains.. Sadly there was no room for 3 villains in this film. Dropping Sandman in 3 and maybe using him in 4 would have been a better option..<br/><br/>Things that really got my goat about Spiderman 3<br/><br/>Spiderman and his joy of removing his mask in public places... Spidey, the mask is there for a reason surely?<br/><br/>Peter Parker and his Saturday night fever strut down the street. Cringe worthy to say the least.<br/><br/>Peter Parkers dance routine in the jazz bar. Cringe again.<br/><br/>Once again (I presume) A huge comic book character gets killed off in a Spiderman film. So far Raimi has managed to kill off Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom and Harry Osbourne... I really hate when film makers kill of characters like this, remember batman (89) when they killed off Joker? Bloody hell.<br/><br/>I also hated the shameless way Spiderman just had to go past the stars and stripes flag on his way to battle Venom and Sandman... Hated it.. Not sure why, I just did.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy Spiderman 3. ( ""NO! Really?"" I hear you cry) And sadly neither Jo or the kids enjoyed it either, they all found it boring, something a Superhero film simply should not be.<br/><br/>One thing I did like tho was this... The scene during the Spidey/Goblin VS Sandman/Venom.. J.J.J. is trying to buy a camera off a small girl.. Take a good look at the blonde extra standing next to J.J.J.. Her overacting is hilarious.. In fact.. Blonde extra chick.. You were the star off the show.. Hurrah! You saved this film from being a total waste of my time and money.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3... 3 out of 10<br/><br/>It would have been 2 out of ten but blonde extra chick made me add that extra point.<br/><br/>PS In all honesty the kids actually did agree that Superman returns was much better.<br/><br/>PPS So did I."

","This 3rd (and probably not-yet-final) installment of the Comic-Book-Hero movie series has all of the familiar trappings to live up to that all successful franchises have to cope with: 'Must be the biggest, the longest, most-complex, action-packed, story-arc-crazy, satisfy-the-extreme-fans, pull-in-the-new-audience film of the year/decade/quarter century/history of film since pre-talkies!!!!! All that being said, I was simply looking for another fun film with Sam Raimi directing a continuing story about a superhero trying to exist in the 'real' world, all the while defending the 'good' against the 'bad.' No real reason to quote plot or cast here - that would be insulting to all of us who can read or use the internet to research things we have an interest in. Furthermore, those of you who've seen the 1st two films already know roughly 75% of the story as well as all the principal characters. For this movie, you also get two more villains who, just like the 1st two villains from the previous films, are really tragic heroes trying to do 'good' or do 'right.' There really is something for everyone to enjoy here. Peter Parker is never more 'human' then he is in this film. MJ is the same, as well as Peter's friend Harry. The story arcs are aplenty, some involving all three films. The action sequences and special effects all do reflect the money that was spent making them.<br/><br/>So what is so different this time, you ask? Well, watch your opening credits real closely, and you'll see your answers (note: I'm referring here to the actual names and their roles in creating the film, instead of the exposition montage of the 1st two films). Two or three key changes which probably explain most of the bickering:<br/><br/>1) Your writers this time are no other than Sam and Ivan Raimi, the director and one of his brothers. Anyone who is familiar with (Sam) Raimi's earlier works involving two other 'heroes' (Ash from the Evil Dead Trilogy, and Peyton Westlake aka 'Darkman' (1990 - see it tonight!)) will certainly understand, respect, and ultimately enjoy all of the nuances, subtractions, and additions that have been made to this 3rd installment. Raimi has always injected his films with wild stunts, incredible camera work (remember, this guy was a man amongst boys LONG before computer graphics or digital anything), humor (everything from jet-black dark humor (""A Farewell To Arms"") to slapstick to corny one-liners), and pathos.<br/><br/>2) ""Music composed by Christopher Young."" Yes, you hear the familiar Spidey music, including the opening credits stuff, the Mary Jane theme, and the thrill-button fanfare cue every time Spidey saves the day or swings by an American flag or swings by policemen and/or firemen. The one character in this movie that really doesn't get their part right is the musical score. Early on in the planning stages of Spidey 3, composer Danny Elfman and Raimi had a falling out, meaning no Elfman soundtrack. The 1st music credit actually reads ""Spider Man themes by Danny Elfman"" - one can assume that Elfman got a nice check in the mail for permission to continue to use his themes. On the other hand, Christopher Young has been composing for film longer than Elfman. His music for this film is good, but it's simply not Elfman's musical touch. Furthermore, the way it is used brings back memories of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where every time Indiana Jones cracks his whip, we get his theme. Same thing here.<br/><br/>Will you like this movie? There's only one true way to find out: buy your ticket & go see it. People who try to tell you that 'the movie was bad' almost always really mean 'the movie was bad because it's not what I thought it should be!' or 'The movie sucked because it didn't have enough (fill in blank)' or It had too much (fill in blank). Well here's a news flash - Sam Raimi and Columbia Pictures made this movie for us to enjoy. It's a comic book for the big screen, made by a guy who grew up loving comic books & probably still does today. You want pristine, crackling dialogue? Tarantino movies await you. You want more Venom? Watch 'Spawn' and pretend it's Venom (or better yet, read Venom graphic novels & comic books). You don't want emotions in a movie? Then don't go see superhero movies - stick with videogames instead.<br/><br/>Lastly, this is not a movie for little kids. Don't bring them along and torture them with nightmares for weeks just because ya gotta get your Spidey fix & can't find a babysitter.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 -- One star penalty for the soundtrack and sound editing of it."

","If one were to go by the rumors that ""Spider-Man 3"" would be the last installment involving director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire, then it's possible that Raimi wanted to cram as much elements into this film as possible before exiting the franchise (although judging from the local crowd turnout that fell in line as early as 8 am for the opening, I doubt Columbia will be putting the web-slinging hero to rest any time soon).<br/><br/>The jam-packed third part of the series picks up after the events of ""Spider-Man 2"" and Peter Parker (Maguire) has grown confident in juggling his life between being New York's beloved superhero and a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle. Oh, and he's about to propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), too.<br/><br/>But complications arise in various forms: Peter's best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still seething with anger over the death of his father (Willem Dafoe), which he attributes to Spider-Man; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a small-time crook who has been accidentally transformed into Sandman, has been found to be the real culprit for the death of Peter's Uncle Ben; and a mysterious black goo from space has landed into earth, eventually finding its way to Eddie Brock, who has his own reasons for wanting to kill Peter, and morphs him into Venom. As if Peter doesn't have his hands full of villains that would fill up three separate graphic novels, screenwriter Alvin Sargent gives Spider-Man yet another demon to conquer: his inability to empathize with MJ that results to a falling out in their relationship.<br/><br/>Granted, the story lines are ultimately wrapped out nicely and the issue between Parker and Osborn is finally given a much-deserved closure; but not before a shaky set-up with far too many subplots that has no villain fully realized, resulting to a lack of an emotional core that has been the main attribute of ""Spider-Man 2"". Grace's Venom, the supposed iconic villain of Spider-Man, and Church's Sandman, ultimately come as less memorable than Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus whose personality - motivation-wise - comes as more natural and believable.<br/><br/>But despite the narrative faults, Raimi finally builds enough momentum going into the climax that features a New York showdown among Spider-Man, Venom, Sandman, and the New Goblin. He also manages to keep a consistent impertinent tone throughout, adding a nice blend of humor and special effects into the action that escalates in terms of scope.<br/><br/>While the massive anticipation that comes prior to it - partly due to the intense marketing campaign Columbia does, but mostly due to the high standards set by its predecessor - is perhaps its chief undoing, ""Spider-Man 3"" is still a worthy entry into the franchise. It's certainly better than some comic-book movies that had come out previously.

","I do not despise this movie like a lot of people might but I personally like this movie more than The Amazing Spider-Man movies because this movie has certain scenes that work quite well, but overall I do think this movie is a mess but like I said I do find it more entertaining than the Mark Webb films, also I would rate the editors cut a high 8/10 because we get to see a little more Sandman and more scenes that makes this movie more sense although I do know that they didn't release the unaltered footage and I think if they did show it in the editors cut I feel like it would be close to a 9/10 but I do think that certain people will enjoy the editors cut more"
"connorwburnett","7","1","6","18 July 2019"," Just as Entertaining as the Others
","With the recent release of Spider-Man Far From Home I feel like it is only fair to not forget what brought us here. Spider-Man 3 is known, worldwide, as a disappointing sequel which is too be expected, It would be an incredibly hard job to top Spider-Man 2 in terms of quality film making. However it is by far my favourite of the Sam Raimi trilogy.<br/><br/>I'm sure you are aware of the general population's view of this movie, it was one of the most discussed film topics of 2007. Critics slated Spider-Man 3 for its sloppy storyline, lack of character development (especially for the villains) and weak plot. But even through many viewings of this film I have never been able to grasp why this film is so hated. Sure, it doesn't treat are main characters perfectly, Harry gets amnesia within the first 20 minutes losing all of his development from the prior film and Mary Jane is frankly an awful person, which is completely out of character for her. Otherwise Spider-Man 3 feels just like the others, I believe it is much better than Spider-Man 1. Sam Raimi's direction is just as effective as it usually is and the comedy is perfectly on point here, which is an area the other films in the trilogy fail in. I still laugh to this day.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack is just as good as usual, it flares especially high when Peter first tries on the black suit, one of my favourite parts of the film. It goes without saying that the action set pieces are truly great, particularly the first fight scene between Peter and Harry, we know that neither of these main characters will die here because we have barely reached the ten minute mark but the added pressure with peter having to worry about losing the engagement ring keeps us hooked. One issue I have with the film is the introduction of another love interest for Peter, Gwen Stacy. She serves a purpose of cause, but there is not enough space for her here. We already have 3 villains and all of our main characters are changing dramatically. A common complaint is that there are too many antagonists, however they are not the problem. If they would just take out the character of Gwen Stacy entirely I think a lot of this film's problems would just fix themselves.<br/><br/>In Conclusion this film deserves more love, its a nice ending to the trilogy, it could have been a lot better but it could have also been a lot worse. We should be thankful of what we have here. Give it another chance before you bandwagon with every else."

","Looking at the reviews, I'm starting to wonder if I even watched the same movie as most of these people. This movie is, without a doubt, the greatest Spiderman film, nay, greatest superhero film, nay, greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time. The scenes of Peter dancing, and being ""emo"" are hilarious, and serve to heighten his character to the greatest lengths yet. As for the villains, my only complaint is that there are far too few. I was sorely disappointed that Mysterio hadn't made a surprise appearance by the end. Topher Grace as Venom is the only REAL Venom I acknowledge. Anyone who criticizes this film is a drone and a mindless hater. This is, without exaggeration, the Citizen Kane of superhero films. A MUST WATCH for TRUE Spider-Man fans"

","This film is just bad. Real bad I am huge spider-man fan and this film just seriously took a huge dump on everything i loved about spider-man. Sam raimi got a huge budget and couldn't manage to put together a half way decent story. First it bit off more than it could ever possibly chew. This causes a laundry list of problems,three bad guys, two girl friends, and trying to implicate uncle Ben's death from the first film into this film. Its all way to over whelming but the thing that really gets me the most, is the fact that for a good thirty Min's of the movie Peter Parker turns the movie into a jazz concert. That's right a jazz concert. In which comic book did spider man play the piano, when did he dance,when did he front an emo hair cut? This movie was just an abortion if there was anything to like from the first two films this film totally crapped on it. The only high point is someone finally made raimi end his madness behind the camera. No wonder a reboot is in order and not soon enough avoid this film at all cost don't even let your children watch it unless you hate them."

But back to the film and a strange black substance gets onto Peter which turns him into an evil version of Spiderman that made him look like Jim Carrey in The Mask which was hilarious but this was so crap.<br/><br/>The acting was rubbish(Kirsten Dunst was a bitch in this movie,Tobey Maguire is too childish to be Spiderman as he always cries like a 2 year old), the CGI was too fake, the music was depressing,the villains were too much one should have been enough instead of 3.<br/><br/>And the ending was so boring.<br/><br/>(WARNING DON'T READ: Spiderman forgives Flint who is Sandman on the death of his uncle and he turns to dust and goes off and MJ & Peter get back together.<br/><br/>AVOID at all costs as it is a heap of crap.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Yes, I saw Spiderman 3 on opening night at the Odeon Leciester Square in London. After about half an hour I was bored, and so were these 4 teenage girls sitting in the row behind. They decided to talk loud, kiss their teeth at anyone telling them to be quiet, answer their mobiles, even though those wonderful guys from Orange have spent millions advertising their product, oh and asking if we'd turn our phones off during the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, the screen in front was showing some chick flick with inconsistent special effects, rubbish story line etc, still no action yet. The action behind me was unfolding nicely, a guy next to me threatened to call security on the motor-mouthed teen girls. They called his bluff, he got up an marched off in a huff., the girls said ""your mum!"". A minute later he returned with a bean-pole, drink of water of an usher who couldn't scare a pigeon, he asked them to be quiet, they did, for about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, I think something happened in the movie, but can't remember what, Kirsten Dunst was on screen so that made me turn my head round at the naughty girls again. By now they were throwing sweet wrappers at each other, great fun! I think Sandman had arrived in the movie, but the girls were more entertaining.<br/><br/>The guy next to me's blood was boiling, he waded through our row, and got security on the lovely teenage girls! This time, a security guard came, he looked really tough, taking on four 14 year olds, rather than throw them out, he sat next to them, they kept commenting under their breath that this was ""wrong"" it was ""nuff bad"", I thought ""rather like the movie!"" Anyway the film dragged on then ended. Its not very good at all, if you're under five or like Hollyoaks then you may like it."

"TheBabblingFool","10","1","6","5 May 2007"," Makes up for the crap that was Spider-Man 2
","Spider-man was one of the best movie experiences I had in my life. Then Spider-man 2 hit. I hate that movie. Why? Well I just found it to be overall ripping off the plot of Superman II...just without Zod, and the awesome presence of Christopher Reeves. Spider-man 2 felt like a wannabe Superman movie with the wrong guy in red and blue tights. That's the short end of why I hated Spider-man 2, there are other reasons.<br/><br/>So I wasn't all that psyched when Spider-man 3 started rolling around. I felt like I had to see this movie...because it was required, like jury duty.<br/><br/>I went to the midnight showing at my local theater with my Spider-man and general Marvel comics nut of a roommate, and zero expectations. I expected to maybe have a good time.<br/><br/>I was generally blown away.<br/><br/>Everything I felt was lacking is back in the 3rd movie. I actually care about the characters again. Peter isn't frustratingly stupid and Mary Jane and Harry are not obnoxious like they were in Spider-man 2. The humor works, even if it is over the top sometimes. Watching the three of them interact was entertaining for me.<br/><br/>The fights finally felt like something out of a Spider-man comic. Spidey and his villains whizzing, swinging, punching, flailing around. Pure glee for me.<br/><br/>Some people claim that the movie was overstuffed with plot. I think that's a pretty subjective argument, and will depend on the viewer, I was never confused, bored, or felt like the plot was being rushed.<br/><br/>I also found it refreshing that more time was spent with the hero than establishing the villains. You know enough about them, that's it. They're the villains, they are not any different from any other villains, even if one is a space alien and the other is made from sand, they are still just nuisances.<br/><br/>It's like this trend since Tim Burton's Batman to spend half the film with the camera squarely on the villain, taking away focus from the main protagonist. Batman Begins broke this trend and thankfully Spider-man 3 does the same.<br/><br/>To sum it up. Spider-man 3 is going to be argued about, some will hate it, some will love it. I loved it and I am surprised I did."
"SonicBoom77","6","1","6","4 May 2007"," Looking back on it......
","Looking back on Spider-Man 3 after all the hype...<br/><br/>When you re watch Spider-Man 3 today you see the biggest flaw fairly early. Way to many story lines in one.If you were to re watch Spider-Man 2 and 3 in the same day you would notice the flow and amount of development Spider-Man 2 had. It built to everything so masterfully and had great delivery. I know I am not the first to say this nor will I ever be the last, but it has to be said once again.<br/><br/>The movie suffers with the lack of character development in the Eddie Brock character not to mention and I will say it now a major mis cast in Topher Grace.Venom.My all time favorite super villain was thrown is awfully. But the biggest slap in the face and perhaps the biggest thing to anger the fan boys like myself was the very cheap plot device of the symbiote. The symbiote story needed to have a whole movie to it's self.We needed to see the symbiote come from space.We needed to see the JJ's in the shuttle and that's how you bring in the symbiote. not to mention this could have helped the Peter MJ storyline with JJ's son.<br/><br/>Speaking of which brings me to my next biggest grip. Kirstin Dunst as Mary Jane. Annoying. Very annoying. She is written so poorly and whinny. Even if she is mad about the negative reviews never would I treat the person who saved me from being thrown off a bridge, kidnapped by Doc Ock,etc. She is nothing but useless and annoying in this movie. She either needs to bite the dust or be used much better in the fourth instalment. <br/><br/>Sandman is a terrific villain to watch on screen. His background is always great for a villain. Misjudged, but once again not developed enough. Another case of to many story lines this could also have he's own movie. The whole scene of Sandman being born picking up his daughters key chain is amazing CGI and always great to watch.<br/><br/>Harry I thought was done and played off well for the most part....the thing that was just idiotic and stupid was having him have that head injury he became a little....ya know? It was pointless and strange to even go that route again I have no idea why they did it, I am at a loss for words. The way he goes out however was done well. I remember reading the way he dies "" your my friend.Best friend"" to Peter many many many months before the film was released online. That's interesting. <br/><br/>Now I love Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. But he really needs to keep his mask on more. Anyway we all know him dancing,emo cut,etc was awful now moving on. Spider-Man needs to crack more jokes, but I won't complain about that as much as some people.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard/Gwen Stacy is the most undeveloped character and was a huge waste. I also felt the way her character was portrayed wasn't to my liking very much. By now I don't even want to see her in the sequel and scrap her. Now onto Felica Hardy/Black Cat.<br/><br/>The special effects/CGI in this movie was strange to say the very least. At times it looked amazing and at other times it looked awful. Example when Harry and Peter are fighting in the alley during the opening fight scene. The CGI on the walls and pipes looked horrid. Like they came ripped from a N64 game. But all the effects before the alley part were terrific and well done. Now I understand we had a new team doing the effects/CGI in this film. Please for the fourth Sony try your best to bring the old team back.<br/><br/>Something that felt very off in the movie was the music. Now all respect to Christopher Young but the soul of the movie felt missing without Elfman. He really defined everything about the first couple movies and I hope Raimi and him make up and Elfman gets back on the fourth. no disrespect to Young I still though he did a fairly good job.<br/><br/>now after all of this you would think I hated this movie. But i didn't for the most part I was letting out my frustrations. Sure it is the worst Spider-Man movie yet and I don't blame Sam Raimi as he is one of my favorite directors and with his newly released horror film ""Drag me to Hell"" Raimiproves he is one of the best directors in horror. But that's another story for another time. Now that Raimi has creative control over the fourth I hope things get back to the roots that made the first two Spider-Man films great. I still do enjoy watching Spidey 3 now and than despite the flaws. I will like to note Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time and nobody was more excited for this movie to come out than myself."
"pratyush","6","1","6","3 May 2007"," The promise of a great dark classic was there
","I had gone for a premiere show yesterday. The story is very dark which is a great thing. I loved the graphics, the villains and the character depth people had in the movie. What I didn't like was the the trying to please every one, be it the kids or the romance lovers or the audience which likes movies a bit lighter.audience aspect which can come in with so many bigger budget films. <br/><br/>So you had kids scenes which weren't needed and looked very cheesy given the dark plot of the movie. Then, while the romance angle was a key aspect in the plot and adds depth to the movie, it was handled horribly. There were trillions of cheesy scenes related to the romance angle, so much so that some people walked out of the theatre even before the ending credits started rolling in. <br/><br/>The Venom moniker is used differently in the movie compared to the comins as while in the comics, Venom has a life of it's own, in the movie, it brings out dark inner desires out in the open and makes characters more aggressive. This subtle change provided great scope for exploring a darker angle in the movie. Inner tirbulations of Spiderman could have been emphasised upon. Instead, we see Peter Parker in a couple of egoistical comic scenes which, while funny, are a light diversion rather than a big addition. <br/><br/>The darker scenes were shot superbly and the plot provided immense potential for this to become a great movie. This is distinct from Spiderman I and II where the plots weren't as dark and so the light nature was fair enough. A bit more focus towards the darker side would have added a lot to the movie."

","Spider-Man 3 (2007) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The final film in the trilogy has Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) trying to get on with their lives but new villains (Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace) cause problems as does a strange black entity, which causes personalities to change. While all of this is going on you still have Harry (James Franco) wanting revenge. SPIDER-MAN 3 hit with a pretty loud thud from both fans and critics and I've read several opinions on why the film didn't work. To me, the biggest thing to blame for its failure is SPIDER-MAN 2. That film mixed the character development with the action so well and since fans and critics ate it up so much I think writer-director Sam Raimi was just under pressure to try and recapture that magic. This third film gives us much more character development, much more story, a bigger running time to deal with it and non-stop crying scenes and in the end the film just comes across as a complete mess. Trying to make an entire film about the relationship between Parker and Mary Jane was just a mistake because there's really no chemistry here and you really can't see what one would see in the other. The entire stuff dealing with Mary Jane's professional career was just boring and never worked either. The stuff dealing with Parker's personal problems really wasn't interesting either. The only good stuff, in regards to the character development, comes from the Sandman character as Thomas Haden Church easily steals the film delivering a nice performance and making his subplot work. Maguire, Dunst and Franco are all good in their parts and Grace gives a nice performance but there's just not much they can do. The film does contain some excellent special effects and especially all of the stuff dealing with the Sandman. Still, in the end, you have a weak screenplay and the movie simply isn't going to work and I think this is a case where the writer just tried to do too much and in the end it didn't work."

This time around, the acting is a little edgy but I guess it's because of the script and its endless revision.

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","1","4 April 2020"," The film has a different tone from the others and also features no scenes flagship anthology and that are stored in memory of audience. Good fun, though inferior to the others
","Spider-Man 3 premiere again with Sam Raimi and toward Jirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire in the lead roles. and is definitely a controversial film and controversial, especially for fans of the superhero. It is undeniable quality in some aspects of long, but the expectations generated were so great in so many ways that failures were even more evident and exposed to criticism, making this third installment of the franchise you love weakest of all. With an investment in the tune of $ 280 million outside ad spending, the intention of Raimi as managed to do in the first two thanks to full creative freedom was granted, was present only a villain, at most two, to get back the characters develop well psychologically and not run with the story, keeping the balance between effects and script again. According to the news circulated on the internet, the principle would be the second villain the Vulture, but the producer Avi Arad eventually convinced the director to include another villain to the plot: Venom.<br/><br/>For this sequence we also highlight the loss of Danny Elfman, who immortalized the theme songs for the first two long and that helped create the identity and appropriate tone of the film. Elfman did not return due to creative differences with Raimi. In its place was hired Christopher Young, composer versatile but mainly responsible for the soundtrack of thrillers and horror in general as The Grudge, The Glass House, The Uninvited and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Luckily we knew we would not need to worry about it, because even with the loss of Elfman for this movie, Young has proven a great composer and his work here differs somewhat from themes by Danny Elfman, although he frequently uses the theme main, as it should be in specific scenes. Since Young made many thrillers and horror, and this film has a more heavy and dark, the combination of the track with what was shown married perfectly, being one of the strengths of the work without objection.<br/><br/>Finally the script disguises the lack of creativity with the use of the trick of presenting new facts concerning the important facts of the past of the protagonist, and in this case were unreasonable and for the sole purpose of increasing ties between villain and a hero of incredible coincidences aforesaid. Another important point is the inclusion of excess humor, which had variations with great sequences as the frustrated attempt to propose marriage at a restaurant just finishing touches with more melancholic, and horrific sequences as Peter dances in the streets of New York. Among the many high points of the film are criticized: In the comics, the end of the saga known as Secret Wars, Spider-Man has brought the planet where the event occurred, a uniform that was able to read the thoughts of the hero turn into any kind clothes, generate their own webs, among other things. It was the controversial black uniform. In the movie, the symbiotic just reaches Earth without explanation, within a meteorite, and that among every place on the planet Earth, and conveniently falls exactly where are Peter and Mary Jane, and to top it sticks to the bike and Peter accompanies.<br/><br/>If Peter was angry, wearing the black uniform, if not, he took the uniform black. Moreover, the powers of the symbiote that appear in comics are not obvious, except that his powers are more leveraged causing a feeling good and invigorating to Peter, which is also more aggressive in some more isolated parts of the film. And worst of all, instead all this aggression, the more Machiavellian see one side and aggressive, we see Peter actually an ""emo"" with the fringe move forward, having a behavior more confident, dancing and playing piano. Then we still have the displeasure of seeing him at the nightclub where Mary Jane serves the tables and sing to customers. After Mary Jane have broken their relationship following the plan Harry, the boy tries to cause jealousy in the girl being accompanied by her new suitor, Gwen Stacy, the boy starts dancing. And to close with a flourish, he still provokes a fight and ends up attacking free his beloved Mary Jane who no longer recognizes him more for his actions. All this to show that his personality was altered by clothing, making him acting like a callous.<br/><br/>Venom is another victim of coincidences ""brilliant"" script. Its origin is different journals. Originally being official Globe Gazette, a newspaper rival the Daily Bugle and not the same as shown in the film, that's not the main point about it. In the comics, Eddie Brock Jr (yes, in the movie he has a ""Jr"" in the name for no reason), is fired from the Daily Globe in a story because Emil Gregg accused of being the Sin Eater, a serial killer who had murdered Captain Jean DeWolff, a friend of the Spider. The report would have been a success if a few days after the spider had not caught the real killer. When the self-pity and hatred for Spider exceeded his limits, he decided he should end his life. In the film, the reason comics could be perfectly used in full and would be more believable.<br/><br/>The Sandman has always been from the beginning the character's favorite Sam Raimi, and receives special care director, which actually makes it more interesting villain of all present. However, in most of the coincidences script, the solution to make it more humane and tried to justify the character's final scenes in the film, eventually making it the killer of Uncle Ben. It is used as a turnaround used by Tim Burton in his Batman (1989) in which the Joker killed Bruce Wayne's parents. This dramatic shift in the history of Spider opens a lot of possibilities. For example, if Peter would prevent the escape of Dennis Carradine (occurred in the first film), the boy still could not prevent the death of his Uncle Ben Parker, as his killer was Flint Marko, entailing changes in the character of friend neighborhood.<br/><br/>Another fact is when Flint Marko is being chased by the police and invades a testing area for particle physics and falls exactly where the experiment will be conducted. The most curious thing is that the transformation could show without much explanation, but trying to give an explanation to the public for a ""foreign body"" was noticed at the test site, an area totally controlled and seemingly impenetrable, the writers show scientists performing experience and notice a change in mass of the test site and think it is a bird. The weight difference between a bird and a person is huge and the weight of Marko would not be so little to be ignored by scientists, who seemed a bunch of inexperienced trainees to reach such a conclusion.<br/><br/>The New Green Goblin, now taken over by Harry, as in the comics, had a share expected by now so that the previous movie was over. Raimi had to turn Harry into a new Sprite, and actually quit their participation. In his best performance in the series, James Franco seems more interesting psychologically, going deeper into their motivations still fueled by revenge for Spider-Man. We note that the experimental serum left Harry with the same powers of his father, but without the insanity of Norman. The downside is the clothing of the new Green Goblin, which leaves much to be desired compared to the comics and shows that Harry just gave a perfected in instruments that his father had left him.<br/><br/>Peter and Mary Jane have relationship problems and another side of their relationship, as had hitherto romantic and idealized, becomes more real and conflicted when Mary Jane faces problems with his career while Peter is increasingly beloved city. He ends up going blind and not notice that his girlfriend is experiencing problems. And Gwen Stacy just jealous also helps that arise in Mary Jane, even after the kiss that Peter gave to Gwen during the delivery of the keys of the city to him and they reproduce the kiss that immortalized the boy's relationship with Mary Jane. And not least being that MJ jealous of colleague Peter in college, because Gwen is a real temptation disguised as women. Bryce Dallas Howard does very well and Kirsten Dunst dazzles at various times, such naturalness of Bryce on the scene and its stunning beauty. She is the face of the drawings of comic book character and charm is also vented. Unfortunately it is also not as exploited, and only have the function of being in danger in a sequence spetacular crane that struck the building in which she modeled, and adventure jealousy MJ Peter, either in the restaurant, is the club where Peter ""Dark"" dancing on the tables, or the ceremony of the keys to the city.<br/><br/>Scenes such as the transformation of Sandman which uses a technology that could control every grain of sand separately and allowed fantastic scenes as the first fight with Spider-Man in the Sand truck and the final scenes of the confrontation. By far, the visual effects are the best of the trilogy, with movements Arachnid much more smooth and uniform, like Venom, beyond its visual. All aerial scenes are indeed exciting. The darker scenes used by cinematographer Bill Pope and art directors J. Michael Riva and Neil Spisak clearly show this darker side caused by the arrival of the Venom symbiote and consequently.<br/><br/>Unlike the other films, brighter and more colorful, with scenes taking place day and night, the look more night here and heavier tone and portray the conflicts that part of the trilogy. Raimi could make a big blockbuster in great action sequences at the level of the great Marvel hero, but lost in the story, which despite not being even a little complicated, has many elements and incredible 2h20min seemed little to so many elements and parallel events. The film has a different tone from the others and does not seem to be part of the same universe of the above. also features no scenes flagship anthology and that are stored in memory for a long time. Good fun, though inferior to the others."

","Spiderman 3 had two very interesting villains - one who could 'demolecularize"" into sand, and the other a snubbed photographer who links up with an alien critter after Spiderman manages to rid himself of it.<br/><br/>Sadly, the writing for this film is stilted, to force artificially and rapidly plot points that would otherwise take too long to reach because there are oh-so-many such plot points. The worst case-in-point is the deteriorating relationship between Spidey and MJ. It relies on a hilariously artificial set of misunderstandings, as well as completely un-Peter-Parker-characteristic public displays (e.g. a kiss on the lips of someone other than MJ during a celebration, with the mask purposely pulled up to make it 'wet'). Likewise, the contortions of Harry Osborn as frenemy are beyond plausible, and scientists operating a demolecularization device getting a weird reading are not going to say ""Bah, just a bird, it'll fly away when we turn it on."" As a scientist who operates expensive equipment at taxpayer's cost, I have to say this is plain ridiculous. Of course they would have a closed-circuit camera imaging the area of the experiment!<br/><br/>The writers could have streamlined this script while developing the stories of the villains better. All in all, it's either totally implausible (sandman's genesis) or totally annoying (MJ and Peter's deteriorating relationship) as executed. 5/10 because I did not leave as a happy camper, despite to villains with a lot of potential."
"filipemanuelneto","5","0","1","11 October 2019"," The weakest of Spiderman trilogy movies.
","This movie is the end of the Spiderman trilogy, and the follow-up to the previous two films. Of all three, it is undoubtedly the weakest and the most fragile.<br/><br/>The script brings together, in a movie, four action figures from the Spider-Man universe: himself, the Green Goblin, the Sandman, and the Venom. The movie shows the birth and clash of the four, and perhaps that's why it all seems a bit forced and clichÃ©, especially in the end. The development of the characters did not have the care and attention to detail we have seen in the previous two films, and the script looks more like an outline than a finished product. I didn't like to see Spider-Man go through a phase of malice, but I understand the reasons and realized by doing some research that comics really give us this story associated with the birth of Venom. So what we saw in this movie has a strong foundation in the original comic books, something I don't despise.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst kept up the good work on their respective characters. Dunst, I dare say, even improved her performance from film to film. Topher Grace was an exclusive addition to this movie but seems like a serious and capable actor, but has received little and bad material. Thomas Haden Church did an excellent job as a Sandman. JK Simmons and James Franco kept up well. Bryce Dallas Howard was more unlucky ... her character is basically just a pretty face for Spider-Man to save.<br/><br/>Technically, it is the most visual film of the three in this trilogy. Bet everything on impactful CGI. Powerful to the point of clearly being false. Does the movie lose any credibility with this? Well, just because we know well that all we are seeing is done through a computer, green screen and other features. It has great special effects and sound, a range of good camera angles and action scenes to suit every taste.<br/><br/>The movie is not brilliant. In fact, as a movie, it is the worst of the trilogy and it is a pity that the director did not give the script the same relevance as he did to the special effects. But Spiderman will definitely be back in the movies soon ..."

","4 May 2007. Once in a while, a movie comes out that taps directly into the mainstream audience with such power that it resonates its own level of quality. Such is this third installment of Spiderman. Two such contemporary movies have come before - Jaws (1975) and Titanic (1997). Spiderman 3 sets a new standard of excellence for the mass audience movie taking humor, relatively complex plot outline, and incorporating breathtaking action sequences, and a heavy dose of spirituality, betrayal, revenge motif, forgiveness, love and relationships into an amazing package for this era of time. Besides a surprisingly somewhat weak special effects and one weak scene with the Franco and his servant, the overall movie is superb. The depth of emotions and the ethical message is so riveting is so ripe for today's complicated and crumbling societal direction. Nine out of Ten Stars."
"TheNamelessNobody","7","0","1","8 November 2018"," Not Good, Not Bad, But Decent.
","Ever since its opening weekend, Spider-Man 3 has been the biggest moneymaker for Sony yet, crushing the box office with 890.9 million USD. But over the years, fans have criticized it over and over, calling it ""The ""Batman & Robin"" Of Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy"" but is it really bad? my answer is no. And i'm here to explain why.
For starters, let's talk about the plot. Peter Parker/Spider-Man finally wins the love of Mary Jane Watson. But after saving Gwen Stacy from a crane accident, his relationship with MJ starts to fall apart. And when a strange alien symbiote crash lands on earth, it hitches a ride with Peter - changing his Spider-Man appearance completely. With a stronger look and blackish color, Peter starts to love his new suit - until it changes his attitude. Now he must get rid of it - facing new foes such as Harry Osborn, who has turned into ""The New Goblin"", Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and the man that was dating Gwen Stacy - Edward Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) Who, with the symbiote, turns into Venom.
Now, the main problem with Spider-Man 3 was it had a strange case of TVO: Total Villain Overload. Let's talk about the 3 villains of this movie.
The New Goblin, for starters, is just Harry Osborn trying to avenge his father's death, believing that Peter/Spider-Man killed him. When it was The Goblin's glider that killed The Green Goblin. But he learns the truth about what really happened, and then teams up with Spidey in the final battle between Sandman & Venom. And it was really cool to see how he sacrificed himself, mirroring his father's death.
Thomas Haden Church doesn't do a bad job of portraying Sandman/Flint Marko in this movie, he's a troubled father who needs money and promises her daughter to make her healthy again. But ends up in a testing site - where all the molecules in his body are scrambled, thus creating the Sandman. It's kind of weird how in one scene, the police informed Peter and Aunt May that Marko/Sandman was the one that killed Uncle Ben, not Dennis Carradine.
But Sandman confesses of what really happened, that his partner (Carradine) was running towards him with the money, and the gun was in Marko's hand - Killing Uncle Ben. But wait, if Carradine was running up to Flint, maybe Carradine must have accidentally pulled the trigger instead of Marko - That's a theory.
Now, to talk about the main problem of Spider-Man 3 - Venom.
Yup, Venom. The possible main reason why the fans hate this movie, they say that it was Raimi's fault venom was in the movie, and that Topher Grace did a horrible job on acting. But I can see why venom is like that - maybe when Sam Raimi was a kid, he must have watched Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994) during Spidey's first Venom encounter - Venom was a little taller and stronger, and can shoot webs like Spidey, and uses the term ""We"" when mentioning the symbote and Eddie Brock. Sam Raimi must have looked back to the series and must have put Venom's somewhat-animated series design in there - to let us know about Venom's first animation design. But Venom always says ""I"" instead of ""We"" for some reason.
The special effects are somewhat king of all the movies - the reflection of the mirror, the symbiote, Sandman's final form - it would have been impossible to get that without creating a giant robot. And with green/blue screening, they managed to crop the filming camera out of Spidey saving Gwen Stacy down the building.
There may be some other problems with this film, but all I can say is that Spider-Man 3 isn't a bad movie. Nor is it good, we can all say that this movie is decent according to my studies.

","""Spider-Man 3"" has really great special effects but, if it wasn't so awesome visually, I probably wouldn't watch it till the end. Peter Parker is portrayed as self-pitying selfish cry-baby, Mary Jane is a personification of negative prejudices about women, and in the role of Venom we have Eric Forman from ""That '70s Show"". And by it I do not mean only that it is the same actor, but virtually the same character in the new environment. The film has no focus at all and is fading into a multitude of insufficiently elaborated stories and characters, with too many bad guys, none of which is the main one. Two and a half hours of meaningless action, based almost exclusively on excellent effects and some pathetic scenes. The scene in the jazz bar is the only really good thing in the movie that even director himself, Sam Raimi, was not satisfied with.<br/><br/>5,5/10"

"Floated2","5","0","2","17 July 2017"," Disappointing end of the trilogy as it shows
","Having watched Spider-Man 3 for the first time since years after its release, one forgot a lot about this film. Many consider this film to be the worst of the Raimi Spider-Man franchise and the failure of Spider-Man 3 to be why they rebooted the series 5 years later.<br/><br/>The film did have its typical action and the special effects were great but after a heavy rewatch, it is clear this film did have many flaws. As many critics and fans have mentioned, the main problem is that the film tries cramming in a little too much into the film, which makes the main focal point hard and difficult. Also there are a few cheesy moments which were used for comic relief but it didn't work in my opinion. Specially when Peter Parker gets infected with the black Spider-Man suit and becomes ""evil/bad"", we see a moment of him dancing to jazz music walking down the street, then the scene involving him showcasing his talents in the Jazz club in front of M.J and Gwen Stacy. The entire time involving his slight personality change of being ""evil"" within the black suit that also altered his hair slightly was just cringe acting from Tobey MaGuire. Did not like it as it felt forced for comic purposes. <br/><br/>First you have the main storyline of Peter/M.J relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story from the start and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Then little subplots with Gwen Stacy and the competition of Peter and Brock working at the Daily Bugle. It's a little too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie. Two villains (Sandman and Venom) may not seem much as people have mentioned but it slightly was. Some may add that Green Goblin was another villain but that was merely for a few scenes in the beginning and Harry was never truly a villain. We see him more as a friend to Peter, even though he did want to kill Peter for killing his father. The way the villains became villains (Sandman and Venom) are all too coincidental. Sandman escaping Prison than falling into a large hole/ditch of sand, while Brock just so happens to be in the same place (a church) where Peter is having problems with the black suit then it falling onto Brock.<br/><br/>What we did enjoy is the effects of the black suit Spider-Man and the look of venom. The look of Peter in the black suit was really well as were his scenes, it was just when he changed as Peter becoming evil wearing the black suit underneath that was the problem. The graphics made this film much more satisfying but overall with the flaws, one can see why this film is considered the worst of the franchise and the reason for the reboot. <br/><br/>Briefly comparing Tobey MaGuire's Spider-Man to Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man, you can see the clear differences in personalities and attitudes. In this film, especially the first half, Peter is much more upright, happy, is always smiling, and his overall character is more of a pushover and nerd than the Peter Parker/Spider-Man of Garfield's. Another negative about Spider-Man 3 is the amount of sad and depressing crying or lonesome scenes we see. At times, it felt like a sappy romance film as it didn't work. Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Mary Jane came off much more unlikable here than the previous two films as she was more whiny and seemed less appreciative throughout. The obvious jealously with Gwen Stacy was clear as it showed, Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job and was a highlight. Also the ending battle was okay but it gets the questions as to why exactly did Sandman want to kill Spider-Man in the first place. The entire character was off switching as they try making the character appear to be a good person in the end. His entire motive leading up was to kill Spider-Man but it was never really mentioned why. This reminded very much of the Amazing Spider- Man 2 villain of Electro, another weak villain but didn't have much motive in wanting to kill Spider-Man, only because he was the ""bad guy"". Both weak and not interesting villains.<br/><br/>Although Spider-Man 3 has these flaws, it is still quite entertaining from an aspect as we do enjoy the character and some things in the film. Being difficult in rating this film but from a standpoint from the other two films, it is the worst in the series and a rewatch really confirms it. Though, Spider-Man 3 is still a better film and overall more satisfying than the Amazing Spider-Man 2."

","Ah, the Spider-Man film that nearly ruined the franchise, Spider-Man 3. Like the previous two films, there's a tremendous amount of nostalgia attached to this film for me. This was the first trilogy of superhero films that I connected with, and at 13 years-old I was willing to forgive many of the mistakes this film made, most of which I cannot forgive a decade later.<br/><br/>Only a few films have tried balancing more than one villain, Spider- Man 3 being the classic example of how not to do it. Apparently, the studio forced Venom on Sam Raimi and hence making Harry & Sandman's arc far less effective when the final act is bogged down by a silly attempt at bringing Venom to the big screen. None of the three villains are all that great, but there's at least some emotional undercurrent with both Sandman and Harry. Venom is, more or less, just a third act reveal that is meant to please fans. Only, it did the exact opposite.<br/><br/>Another thing that definitely didn't win over fans was the fact that this film made Peter Parker an absolute jerk. It's one thing to have the symbiote change Peter, but it's another thing to have him physically abuse Mary Jane, and nearly kill his best friend Harry multiple times. This was far from the Peter Parker we came to love in the first two films.<br/><br/>Another headache was the direction they took Harry Osborn. Having him get ""hit in the head"" and lose his memory for half the film was one of the stupidest and laziest decisions I can remember from a comic-book film. I don't mind having Harry go the villainous route, but the memory loss was all a bit of a headache.<br/><br/>There is good, however. Raimi, as he proved in the first two, is great at shooting high-scale action. The CGI is definitely dated when looking back on it after 10 years, but the action is as visceral as anything in any Spider-Man film to date. Yes, that includes 'Homecoming'. If only the dialogue surrounding the action could match the brutality. I also think Thomas Haden-Church's performance as Sandman is nothing to scoff at, reminding me of the character depth that made Doc Ock so memorable. At the end of the day, Raimi was trying to give us a Spider-Man film that dealt with bigger and more important personal issues, whether that worked for you or not is entirely up to the viewer.<br/><br/>I think if Raimi had the tools that filmmakers have now (improved CGI) and perhaps a little less studio interference, then Spider-Man 3 could be a much better end to the trilogy than it ended up being. There's plenty I can't forgive about this film, especially the infamous 'dancing in the street' sequence, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be.<br/><br/>+Action<br/><br/>+Deals with real issues<br/><br/>-But is sometimes careless in its execution<br/><br/>-3 villains proved to be way too much<br/><br/>-Memory loss for Harry<br/><br/>5.8/10"
"mjplysaght","5","0","2","10 July 2017"," It has it's flaws, but it's not the worst
","So with the release of Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, people were looking forward to this film. We were going to be introduced to the Sandman and Venom, so what wasn't to like about that? Well, some people ended up hating this film because of its overcluttered plot and pacing issues, and while I have to agree with those problems, I wouldn't say I hate this film.<br/><br/>So, the story. Peter Parker is finally going out with Mary Jane, who now knows his identity as Spider-Man. As well as that, Harry Osborn now knows about Peter being Spider-Man and is hell bent on revenge, still thinking that Peter murdered his father. Harry takes possession of his late father's Green Goblin weaponry and arms himself to eliminate Parker once and for all. However, he ends up getting concussed and this triggers amnesia, wiping his memories of Peter being Spider-Man and his father's death. Pretty convenient, huh? Anyway, along with that, Flint Marko comes into the picture; an escaped convict revealed to be the real killer of Uncle Ben, who gets caught in a particle radiation experiment, restructuring his anatomy, changing him into the Sandman. Also, a meteor falls to Earth, containing the symbiote that changes its host to Venom. It latches onto Parker, who discovers about Marko and awakens his darker side.<br/><br/>ALSO, Eddie Brock is introduced as a rival to Parker, determined to beat Parker at getting a staff job at the Daily Bugle. He's kind of a snarky ass and from the get-go, is kinda unlikable. He eventually becomes Venom.<br/><br/>Right, so even by the description, there is a lot of stuff going on. Peter feels the pressure of all the obstacles going on. His turbulent relationship with Mary Jane, his on-off friendship with Harry, avenging his uncle by confronting Sandman, and dealing with Brock. The overcrowded plot and supporting characters obscure the story quite a bit to the point where it gets messy.<br/><br/>Peter struggles to balance his emotions, amplified by the Venom symbiote and as a result, we witness a number of cheesy scenes. When you picture Parker trying to overcome the influence of Venom, the last thing that comes to mind is a montage of him walking down the street and pathetically flirting with female pedestrians.<br/><br/>The story beats are all there, but as I said, the pacing is all over the place, as well as the tone. The action scenes are decent enough though, so I have to give it that.<br/><br/>A major step back from Raimi's first two Spider-Man films but it's not the worst Spider-Man film. I'll just leave it at that."

"Leofwine_draca","5","0","4","29 December 2016"," Lacklustre addition to the series is one sequel too many
","Sam Raimi's third entry in his now-flagging series is a big bloated mess of a film that still looks and feels good but tries too hard for its own good. I mean, did we really need no less than three bad guys in this flick, as well as an out-of-control crane? The resulting concoction focuses too hard on the story, and with unbelievable character arcs and an overwhelming amount of unnecessary supporting characters (I mean, did we really need the pointless Gwen played by Bryce Dallas Howard in this film?) the film feels really s-l-o-w. It's a shame, because the special effects are absolutely brilliant and there are some genuinely good moments, including the climax that packs an emotional punch. But essential this is an uneven roller-coaster ride of a movie, sometimes great, sometimes rubbish, worth watching once.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is surprisingly one of the worst things about this film, along with the always unwatchable Kirsten Dunst. Maguire's character is by now an irritating big head and, although he still makes us laugh, there's no sympathy for Spidey whatsoever. Far better are the film's villains, excluding Topher Grace who seems to think he's in a teen comedy. Thomas Haden Church brings menace and surprisingly charisma to the series as Sandman, and, in revealing his human side, he's by far the most interesting villain of the three films. James Franco is frankly scene-stealing in this film; his acting surpasses Maguire's every time and he's also much more of a real hero than the (by now) bland and unremarkable Spiderman.<br/><br/>As for everyone else – I'm talking a shoehorned James Cromwell, an unfortunately ubiquitous Rosemary Harris, a Dylan Baker who really doesn't need to be here – well, they ain't much cop. I did enjoy the comic shtick from Raimi's crew of old-timers; brother Ted gets a nice scene to himself, J. K. Simmons is funnier than ever, and Bruce Campbell has another hilarious cameo but the comedy is hit-and-miss elsewhere, such as Maguire's transformation into an 'evil' guy; the whole song and dance routine is good but seems too much in retrospect.<br/><br/>As for the action, sadly it's nothing we haven't seen before, all high-rise antics in webs, the falling person routine played out half a dozen times even though it was tired in the first flick. The Green Goblin's return is too cartoonish to be very good although I did like all the knocks and stunts, even if they were done with CGI. Best effects go to Venom in its sticky, slimy, Blob-like form, very creepy, and also the Sandman, who's a bit like the T-1000 from TERMINATOR 2 mixed with the Marshmallow Man from GHOSTBUSTERS come the film's climax. While I did gain some enjoyment from this movie, I sincerely hope another sequel doesn't follow and that the talented crew find new, fresher projects."

","Spiderman 3's webbing caught me. Fortunately, I got out of it. This third installment by Sam Raimi and Tobey MacGuire shows a lot of misfiring of the web as well as the execution of a disjointed screenplay. Spiderman/Peter Parker is riding high on his success. He is planning on proposing to Mary Jane Watson. However, following a disappointing opening night and being replaced, she is down in the dumps and Peter has no clue how to help her. At the same time, an alien symbiote has fallen to earth in a small meteorite. Also, Flint Marko escapes from prison. A person who was complicit with the death of Ben Parker, he falls into the midst of a scientific experiment that turns him into the Sandman. Harry Osborne, the Green Goblin II, is still planning his revenge against Peter Parker/Spiderman. They fight, and Harry gets amnesia, forgetting his feud with Peter/Spidey. He starts dating Mary Jane. Also, a new photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), gets on at the Daily Bugle and starts annoying Peter Parker. Furthermore, Gwen Stacy is a new friend of Peter, and Brock likes her. Eventually, the symbiote gets on Peter, taps his dark side, but then ditches the new suit that merges with Brock and becomes Venom. If you can't follow that story, then you get the problem. The movie tries to do way too much with a huge, disjointed story, and too many characters. Ironically, all the performers give great, credible performances with the loose screenplay. Raimi even does a good job at directing the actors and characters, but has trouble with the labyrinth screenplay. He does well with the juxtaposition of Venom and Sandman as one is redeemed, but the other isn't. He handles ideas of forgiveness as well. Where Raimi and MacGuire fail is when Peter Parker gives into the dark side with the symbiote suit. It becomes ridiculously silly. Then, as the Symbiote attaches itself to Eddie Brock to become Venom, it is clear that Topher Grace was terribly miscast as an evildoer.

","My wife and I watched the end of this movie, which was on FX, the other day, and we were particularly outraged by the scene with the butler talking to James Franco about cleaning his father's wound. The butler said that the wound came from his own blade. Therefore, he must have killed himself. That was the dumbest part of this movie. My wife thought that the butler's character was poorly acted. I also thought he could use some work on his acting. My wife was exasperated by the fact that a big-budget movie with so many stars (i.e. James Franco) would then pay such a low-rent actor to play the part of the butler who then had to tell a story about cleaning James Franco's father's wound. And somehow the butler, who wasn't there when James Franco's father died, used his butler skills to deduce that James Franco's father committed suicide. I mean, c'mon! Just because you know how to clean a wound doesn't make you a detective or a therapist. That butler ruined a perfectly good afternoon of watching FX for me.

","Box-office success that it was, this Spider Man sequel shows the same traits of slackness and tiredness that the Superman and Batman films of the Christopher Reeve and Tim Burton eras did. The film's become much longer, indeed bloated, the action sequences become fewer and attempts at often campy but unfunny humour intrude. <br/><br/>That's not all that's wrong with this movie. The SFX are not of the best quality, an important piece of Spidey history gets re-written, as Uncle Ben gets murdered again, but this time by a different guy who of course, morphs into our hero's latest home-town super- villain plus there are just too many villains competing to down the web-slinger. Between Venom, The Hobgoblin (or the New Goblin as he's termed here) and Sandman, too many crooks definitely spoil the broth.<br/><br/>Peter Parker's on-off romance with Kirsten Dunst's rather dismal Mary Jane Parker trundles on too and of course he has his usual existential crisis triggered this time by being taken over by an alien micro-organism which twists his mind but for some reason has a weakness for loud clanging noises. The plot too seems borrowed from ""Superman 2"" meets Star Wars as Spider Man gets in touch with his bad self, losing his popularity and his girl as he does so. Throw in a lame attempt at humour which sees Pete come over all John Travolta and yet another unnecessary Stan Lee cameo and you can see why this seems to me by far the weakest entry in the franchise so far.<br/><br/>I don't know the exact reasons why Marvel chose to reboot Spider Man after this admittedly very successful entry, at least judging by its box-office returns, but the signs of wear are there. I just found the endless shots of the expressionless faces of Maguire and Dunst only added to the tedium, the former only occasionally gets into costume and finally who was it who put the title end sequence at the start of the movie, holding up proceedings interminably it seemed.<br/><br/>I've still to watch the most recent remake of the title character but hope it manages to spin back to the promise of the first film of this particular three."

When Peter abandons the symbiote, it finds refuge in Eddie Brock, a rival photographer, Eddie Brick, causing Peter to face his greatest challenge.<br/><br/>This movie had me feeling some cool amazing emotions. The main criticism to me is Venom, because he was the biggest character promoted in the trailers and posters to the film and he only got ten minutes of screen time, now, if they would have made this three hours long, this film would have been fine.<br/><br/>The music by Christopher Young is amazing and Danny Elfman's themes from the first two SPIDER-MAN films and it is amazing. The story of Sandman is just emotionally powerful and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman is emotionally powerful in his performance. The story of the symbiote was confusing as heck, but when Eddie turned into Venom, that confusion all went away.<br/><br/>The visual effects and action sequences are just amazing in this film, but I hate the fight between Harry and Peter because they are supposed to be friends, but they are not, until at the end of the damn movie. What the freak happened man?<br/><br/>The acting survives. Tobey Maguire and the returning cast all do really great jobs this time around. Topher Grace as Venom / Eddie Brock, I don't hate him, I just wish his character was developed a little bit more. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, she is okay, but Emma Stone's version of the character is just amazing and it is really cool.<br/><br/>Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 does a few things right, but with some major issues and like I said, if the film was three to four hours long, it would have been fine.

There are so many pointless, meaningless scenes, not enough spider-man scenes and too many characters. I did not like the fact that poor Pete could not even propose to his love life Mary-Jane Watson because of a series of unfortunate setbacks; Peter finding out who really killed his uncle Ben, Spider-man kissing Gwen Stacy and a bunch of others. What could have made Spider-man 3 better if it was split into two parts; Spider-man 3.1 & Spider-man 3.2. Spider-man 3.1 focusing on Spider-man/Peter Parker flying around New York City, hanging out with MJ etc etc but Flint Marko's transformation into the Sandman and the Spider-man vs Gwen Stacy kiss at the festival etc toward the end of the film, by this point Spider-man gets the black suit but fling in some extra scenes/bits to make Spider-man 3.1 a feature length film and then in Spider-man 3.2 have more of the dark- natured Black Suit Spider-man scenes attacking Flint Marko, the break-up with MJ in the park scene, the fights with Harry Osborn, the emo dance and the final battle towards the end. But instead of the dance scene at the nightclub MJ works in, Peter fires firework rockets in the nightclub causing multiple casualties in the bar to get back at MJ for breaking up with him under the influence of the black suit at the cost of MJs life just like in Casualty Series 28 Episode 19 ""For Auld Lang Syne"" that aired on Saturday 4th January 2014. After the final battle with Sandman and Venom, Peter develops a new relationship with Gwen Stacy as opposed to re-starting his old relationship with MJ at the end that might have lead to a 'Spider-man 4' but no!

Even with the extended running time the focus is diffused, and as a result none of it makes an impact.

"holly-fritz13","4","0","4","25 September 2014"," Not the worst movie I've ever seen
","Spider-Man 3 is the third and final installment of the Sam Raimi directed Spider-Man films. Like the first two films, it features poor acting, utterly laughable and unrealistic dialogue, stunts, and writing. Unlike the first two films, there's not enough plot and action to rely on to get past those things. <br/><br/>First off, there's three villains. Admittedly, all three of them can be argued as victims of circumstance and not actual villains, but they all prevent Spider-Man from keeping the city safe and that's enough justification for me. Three is just too much for one movie, especially when two of them don't seem to have much reason to be there. The Sandman is just trying to save his little girl. As for Eddie Brock, he was just the stereotypical antagonist in Peter Parker's life - so why not be one for Spider-Man, too?<br/><br/>Harry Osborn's story line is at least fleshed out in this movie, though it's done poorly - using partial amnesia and blackmail that's supposed to make you hate him, but isn't quite convincing enough and James Franco delivers the best acting in the entire movie. After head trauma, Harry forgets all about his desire to kill Spider-Man, a seemingly shoddy attempt at tying up that particular plot that's been running since the end of the first movie. Not to worry though, Harry regains his memory and tries to kill Peter several times before they become BFFs again. Then they kill Harry off, because Peter needs another dead loved one to add to his tragic back story.<br/><br/>The love story in the third Spider-Man leaves a lot to be desired as well, both in the script and the acting. Mary Jane is left behind when Peter bonds with the symbiote and she turns to Harry. A cringe worthy performance featuring Tobey Maguire dancing later, and Peter hits Mary Jane. Frankly, the redemption arc isn't good enough. Just because Peter tries to atone for what he by becoming a true hero doesn't mean he should be excused from those actions. <br/><br/>And Peter's excuse? The symbiote attached to his suit. It's supposed to make him faster, stronger, better but all it really does is turn him into something that looks to be poking more fun at 2007 emo icon Pete Wentz than actually turning Peter into anything other than a misogynistic jerk. <br/><br/>The movie relies predictably on Uncle Ben's death, the driving force behind the plot in all three Spider-Man movies. Tobey Maguire's acting is about as convincing as Kirsten Dunst's red hair. There's no comic relief in this movie- unless you count the fact that the whole thing is so poorly executed it's actually funny. The movie would be redeemable with the action scenes - Spider-Man's web shooting skills and swinging from tall buildings while saving the citizens in the nick of time are always good, but the movie is simply too long and poorly acted to rely entirely on them. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a disappointment. There's no point spending money on it, unless you happen to watch movies because they're bad, like I do, or because you got all three films for your birthday, which I did. On the positive side, emo Peter Parker will be a legendary example of second hand embarrassment in a movie for decades to come."
"GeorgeRoots","5","0","3","29 July 2014"," Unnecessary Additions To The Franchise Is What Killed It.
","""Spider-Man 3"" at the time remained one of the most anticipated movies in all my life, mostly because I saw the trailer about a year before it actually came out. Looking back at my 14 year old self, the only highlight to be said about ""Spider-Man 3"" is that it was the first movie I ""hyped"" for considerably.<br/><br/>Well at the time the film had the biggest opening weekend, and I contributed by seeing it 3 times in the span of a week. Had I been paying enough attention, I should have seen that the franchise took a somewhat bizarre turn for the worse and effectively ended the series before more damage could be made. Looking back after those repeated viewings I can just about get away this one, but the drop in quality is considerable. Sam Raimi never wanted to approach the symbiote costume, but was forced to due to fan demand. Peter does become fairly interesting when the alien takes over, but ultimately reduces him to a whiny, dancing, hard to relate to ""emo"" character with his hair down (I can't believe I just wrote that in a Spider-Man review).<br/><br/>After all that, the film becomes very depressing in a sense. Redeeming qualities is that Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) becomes a lot more of a fleshed out character, and Thomas Haden Church was phenomenal as Sandman. For everything bad that people say about this movie, did they forget the scene when they introduced the character after the transformation?<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie continues to gradually go down hill. The original comic book storyline the movie is based on has some of the most visually striking moments in the characters history (Including a nightmare sequence, where the two costumes fight over a powerless Peter Parker), why none of it was incorporated is beyond me. Three's a crowd with the villain aspect, leaving no development for rising antagonists from previous instalments. The addition of Gwen Stacy was pointless this late in the game, and I enjoy Topher Grace but I feel that was really bad casting on someones part.<br/><br/>Overall, what can be said is that I enjoyed some of the visuals that were displayed, and the action scenes still work but lack the scenarios that made the previous battles so enthralling. I'm glad that ""Spider-Man 4"" didn't happen, even though what I heard would have been very interesting to see.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Flawed. Sam Raimi gave us two of the best superhero movies the genre has to offer, so I think we can forgive him for this. 5/10."
"alindsay-al","2","0","1","26 June 2014"," The death of the original Spider Man films
","I love the original Spider Man and Spider Man 2 but this film is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The film starts with Peter Parker balancing his life as Peter and Spider Man relatively well until he comes under the attack by his old friend Harry Osborne as the New Goblin, a new villain called The Sandman and an Alien Symbiote which eventually creates the villain Venom. Tobey Maguire as the lead is a mixed bag for me he is a good spider man and peter parker in all three of the films however, I believe he is a negative in this film with his performance turning to be gut-wrenching and hard to watch because of how bad it is. Kirsten Dunst is once again total rubbish as Mary Jane which is expected in my opinion. James Franco is pretty good as Harry and is more relatable then Peter even though his climax is fairly predictable. JK Simmons is great as J Jonah Jameson but it is a small role so not really a big enough positive. Sandman and Venom are both mixed bags as I think Sandman is a decent character in this film but he is hurt by the overall film. Topher Grace is pretty good as Eddie Brock but as Venom not truly as he is not Venom enough to give the character justice. Now the story is horrific, the film is all over the place with too many story's such as Peter and MJ's relationship, the love triangle between Harry, Peter and MJ and the Ben Parker death story and this is without the villains getting enough screen time. The script is pretty shocking throughout and is a pretty big negative. The main positive is the style as everything looks cool and every character has there visually cool moment. However, I believe it is substance over style and this film fails magnificently at nearly everything."

Peter's old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge against Peter; taking up the mantle of his late father's persona as The New Goblin, and Peter must also capture Uncle Ben's real killer, Flint Marko, who has been transformed into his toughest foe yet, the Sandman.

"The_Film_Cricket","3","0","1","15 April 2014"," Sand in your shorts . . .
","Being Spider-man is nothing if not a learning experience. The common thread through the Spider-man movies is that Peter Parker has to take a certain amount of responsibility for the powers given to him. This is a thread that began with Uncle Ben's famous proclamation in the first installment ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and continues on into this third movie.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is minor a step down from the previous episode - but to be fair, Spider-man 2 was a tough act to follow. The second film nicely explored conflicts in his dual personality - it is fun to watch Spider-Man but it isn't as much fun to be Spider-Man. You're on call 24/7 and attempting to having a social life or a career can be difficult to fit it into your schedule. Here we get into the darker aspects of Peter's dual nature.<br/><br/>If his problems in the earlier film stemmed from juggling his normal life with his abnormal life, here the problems come in sheer numbers. 1.) He's got to deal with Harry (James Franco), who still blames him for his father's death and his turned himself into The Hobgoblin.<br/><br/>2.) He's got to deal with an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who outruns the cops an falls into a scientific something-or-other and gets a body made of sand.<br/><br/>3.) He's got to deal with an upstart (Topher Grace) who wants Peter's prospective job with the Daily Bugle and will do anything to get it. He later turns himself into Venom, an impressive mutant type creature who is sort of the anti-Spidey.<br/><br/>And 4.) a crawling, stringy hunk of black glop that - for not other reason - crawls out of a meteor crater and pursues Peter. It eventually becomes the catalyst for a challenge to Peter as he finds that he makes him tougher, angrier and more attractive to women (I could only think of those Axe commercials). In other words, it turns him into a jerk bent on selfishness and revenge. Some of this works because we see the darker and more dangerous sides of his personality and gives him a cool black suit (I love the fact that he stores the black suit an a nice large trunk and the red and blue in a smaller, humble suitcase).<br/><br/>What doesn't work are the ways certain plot elements are set up. Harry, for example, (he blames Spider-man for his father's death) has turned himself into Hobgoblin and intends to exact his revenge. During a somewhat confusing fight scene in an alley, Harry is bonked on the noggin and suffers short-term memory loss. It is convenient that he only has a loss of memory that stretches back to before his father died and therefore doesn't ever remember being ill with Peter. How long do you think it will be before it all starts coming back to him? I also wasn't convinced by the strains in Peter's relationship with Mary Jane. Their romance was so beautifully handled in the second film here tends to fall into soap opera territory - the thread being that he doesn't listen to her. The drama switches back and forth with misunderstanding on top of misinformation with the intent that Peter will propose marriage which is never really resolved.<br/><br/>The film never has a clear focus, it jumps back and forth between too many problems and too many characters, closing some and leaving others open for a fourth installment. Having a cadre of villains to deal with, I sincerely hope that the series isn't falling into the same trap as the Batman movies where there were so many villains that the movie lost track trying to keep up. Raimi does a better job of traffic control and the villains are well-defined. Every villain in this film has a personal beef with Peter, not just because he's the good guy.<br/><br/>What Spiderman 3 has are some are dramatic elements that continues the learning curve that Peter is experiencing. This is not the best Spider-man movie but it tries for something that most action movies of this type don't reach for - it's trying to tell a story and not just be a stunt show."
"Flip_McTwist","3","0","1","28 February 2014"," What Was the Movie Called Again?
","On August 18, 2002, the first Spider-Man movie was shown in theaters. It made $821 million worldwide with two Academy Award nominations: best sound and best visual effects. On June 30, 2004, Spider-Man 2 came out. It made $783 million worldwide with three Academy Awards nominations: best sound, best sound editing and best visual effects, which it won. The studio then released a preview one year before its newest movie, Spider-Man 3, and it became extremely popular on You Tube. I had the enormous privilege of seeing this movie on May 4, 2007, at the midnight showing. When the credits rolled up at the end of the movie, I was dissatisfied, but why? I tried to come up with reasons why I disliked the movie. My answer came after I walked out of the theater and overheard a conversation. One person stated, ""The movie was that close to being a chick flick."" Well it wasn't ""that close"". It was that. The creators of the movie completely forgot this film was called ""Spider- Man"", not ""Peter Parker"". The filmmakers put too many villains into one movie, which led us out of the main plot. Plus the dull acting from Toby Maguire and others was awful and embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>The first part of the film shows us that Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) still love each other, as if that was not obvious in the first two movies. Peter thinks he's now ready to ask Mary Jane to marry him, but like every other romantic film, problems arise and they do not get married. But wait, it gets worse. Peter's ex-friend, Harry (James Franco) still wants revenge for his father's death. So, how does he do it? Torture him? Kill him? No. He attacks his heart. Harry forces Mary Jane to tell Peter she does not love him anymore, and Peter Parker buys it. This is just the beginning of this sweetheart movie. Peter starts hitting on other girls and tries to make Mary Jane jealous. Of course, the movie ends with Spider-Man saving Mary Jane and they finally realize they were meant for each other. So let me ask a question: does it take three movies for us to realize that or did we know it from the first scene of Spider-Man 1?<br/><br/>Now even if the romance part of the movie was likable, the action was not. The movie had too many villains. There was the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who turns out to be the real killer of Peter's uncle, Ben. Of course, there was Peter's ex-friend, Harry, and then the late added villain, Venom (Topher Grace). So in total, that's three villains? Sounds like this could be a fun film. It's not. The movie went with four story lines: three villains and the hero. Harry and Peter were explained in the previous paragraph, so now let's talk about the other two villains. The Sandman, whose real name is Marco, has a daughter, named Penny, who's infected with some sort of illness, but we never find out what it is. Then there's Eddie Brock, who half way through the film becomes Venom. According to most polls and surveys, Spider-Man fans love Venom the most, yet we did not see much of Venom in the film. The movie had so much information, we did not know what we should walk away with. It shifted away from the main plot when it needed to focus more on the conflict between Peter and Harry.<br/><br/>The worst part about the entire movie was the acting. Let's start with Toby Maguire. When I was watching this movie in the theater, whenever Maguire would get emotional, everyone laughed at him. Maguire's acting and facial expressions were so lame, it was slightly burdensome to watch. The Sandman, however, had absolutely no facial expressions. Every expression was exactly the same. When he was sad, he frowned. When he was angry, he frowned. Poor Eddie Brock just had dull lines. In one scene, when Eddie had Spider-Man tied up, Peter tells Eddie that he needs to take off the Venom suit because its enormous power is controlling him, to which Eddie replies, ""I like being bad. It makes me happy."" At that moment, the whole movie turned from a chick flick into a kid's movie.<br/><br/>There are two questions that still hold for this movie: was there anything good in this movie, and could it have been done better. Although I may have criticized Spider-Man 3 throughout this paper, there were some moments in the film that worked out nicely; like the one scene at the French restaurant, where Peter was going to hide his ring for Mary Jane in a glass of wine as a surprise proposal. It was a humorous scene allowing us to laugh for a purposeful reason. The film also had esteeming, valuable life lessons, especially at the end of the film when the Sandman explains to Peter that he only robbed to support his daughter. He also explained how killing Peter's uncle, Ben, was an accident. The Sandman only asked Peter to understand, but instead Peter forgives him. We should always be forgiving instead of seeking revenge. Now, could they have done a better job on the movie? Of course they could have. All they really needed to have done was to get rid of some of the distractions in the film to make room for more Spider-Man action. One of the villains needed to have been let go; either the Sandman or Venom. Some of those scenes with Mary Jane having problems with Peter should have been cut, but most of all, the writers definitely needed to fix those corny lines. The overall summary to this movie: disappointing."
"puma31219","4","0","1","25 February 2014"," What was Sam Rami Thinking?
","The Sam Rami Spiderman films were never great. While the first one was OK, the second one was much better but not fantastic. Spider-man 3? Was a pure ABOMINATION!! Where to begin? For starters, having 3 different villains was a bad idea. Even worse was having one of those villains suddenly become a good guy at the last minute. (Because of a confession from a Butler who was not present in either of the first two films yet supposedly cleaned Norman Osbourne's wounds and ""analyzed the wounds for metal fragments"" and compared them with the Goblin Glider, which was nowhere near the Osbourne mansion. And how many Butlers do you know moonlight as Criminalists? i don't recall seeing him on CSI: NY) That element was STUPID!!!! Spiderman's cocky attitude was just sickening. Even before the Symbiote came into play. It was made worse after he became ""Black Spidey"" and the aggression of the suit turned him into an older looking version of Edward Furlong as he appeared in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. And the dancing? Seriously? WHO DOES THAT? What comic book did the writers ever read that had a hero aimlessly dancing through the streets of their cities? I thought Spiderman the musical was on Broadway, not worming it's way onto the big screen. The Symbiote Suit.... ahhh the suit. It looked horrible. How hard is it to animate an all black suit with one big white insignia? The original Spiderman Symbiote suit looked amazing. Why did Rami feel the need to change it? While Rami's version didn't look too bad on Spidey himself, it absolutely did not work for Venom. Which brings me to my next beef. Eddie Brock/Venom. Topher Grace was hardly the ideal choice for this role. Visually, he was not at all convincing. Eddie Brock in the comics and the cartoon was a bulky guy who could bench at least 400 lbs without the Symbiote. And Topher Grace in his 180 pound (max)body was supposed to be that guy? Topher in the Venom suit, was pathetic. Venom is one of the scariest villains in the Spiderman Universe, if not the entire Marvel universe. Why could we hear Topher's sarcastic tenor voice while Brock was in the Venom suit as opposed to a much deeper, heavier, raspy growl? It didn't work at all. Topher was not menacing nor scary in the least bit. Why was Brock's face shown so much while in the Venom suit? In the show and comics, Brock was supposed to be completely subdued while Venom was in control yet he kept rearing his head and showing his face? It didn't work AT ALL!!! Sandman's story was a stretch. How realistic is it that new evidence regarding Uncle Ben's murder surfaces years later, yet there were no witnesses when the investigation first went underway? Considering that the crook that Robbed the fight promoter actually thanked Peter in the first film, does narrowly support the scenario of Uncle Ben's death in the third film. But very Narrowly, considering how many people in NYC would put their own necks on the line for a friend? In other words, if the crook that Spidey chased in the first film was doing a favor for a friend, why was he the point man? Why did he have the money when Spidey ended up chasing him? Why was the man who had the motive acting as the lookout? The story was a stretch. The action during the first fight between Spidey and New Goblin was impressive and very well done. But not enough to redeem the overall quality of the film. Mary Jane once again ending up being held captive by the film's main villain is more than old; it's stupid! you'd think by, the girl would have learned a thing or two. The only other redeeming quality of the movie was J.K. Simmons. He was hilarious as always. With the exception of James Franco, the acting of the cast was also dumbed down when compared with the other films. (Which tends to be a trend with Triologies. Every seems to ""lazy-up"" with their acting by the third film.) Overall, I did not enjoy the film. And while their are other bad films that I find entertaining (Such as ""Daredevil"" or ""The Last Sentinel"") that I can watch multiple times, I've only seen this film once and have NO desire to see it again."

","This movie deserved major editing. First of all, sandman never should've been a villain, nor should he've been the killer of uncle Ben. This latter was a major plot hole that could fit a fat person. As I recall, in the first movie, when uncle Ben lay dying on the street the police said that they knew where the shooter was heading, yet in this one the shooter was in custody by the police. It also threw the canon out the window. The first movie had perfect structure: peter Parker fought crime out of guilt over uncle bens death because he let the robber get away. Now, according to this film, it was okay for him to be vindictive towards the wrestling promoter that screwed him over. Okay. Goodbye spiderman mission statement. Furthermore. The venom story was structured perfectly, but I think that Eddie Brock should've been going on crime sprees(for economic and vindictive reasons) as the doppelgänger of spiderman, and been the one in cahoots with Harry Osborn up until the end, when Osborn has change of heart. Given these changes, the movie could've been a hands down winner."

","In spite of its inherent clumsiness and disappointing villain, the first ""Spider-Man"" remains a great crowd-pleaser with an excellent origin story and more life and energy to it than pretty much any comic book movie made before or since.<br/><br/>Now comes the third film which is as technically impressive as ever, but suffers from being simultaneously pulled in too many different directions. Even being an extra 15 minutes or so longer than its predecessor, the film still has to juggle three villains (Sandman, Harry Osborn, Venom) along with subplots about the rocky roads of new love, a ""Superman 3"" style 'dark personality' subplot, the ongoing Harry-Mary Jane-Peter love-hate triangle, not to mention giving time to a half dozen other characters both new and old.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the film does manage to wrap things up by the end, so much so that it feels like an 'unofficial end' to the series in some ways with no cliff hanging stories left to resolve. Yet how most of these are resolved is done in some rushed and often unsatisfactory ways and that's where ""Spider-Man 3"" falls apart. The elements are there for some great drama, but they're never developed enough to become involving, and often awkwardly mix rather than cohesively gel."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","1","3 February 2012"," Rami simply tries to put way too much into this film
","It seems that this movie didn't go down all to well with the viewing public, and some has even suggested that they had tried to kid themselves into liking this movie, but when they went away, thought about it a bit more, they came to the conclusion that it really did not stack up. Look, I'll admit that I did really like this film, it may not have been on the level of the first two films, but it was still a good film.<br/><br/>I guess the main criticism that people had with this film was that Rami simply tried to fit too much into the movie, and as such it just simply didn't work. Basically we have three bad guys, and two love interests, as well as Peter Parker attempting to struggle with who he is. There are also too many story arcs, trying to track down his uncle's killer who has escaped (and turned into the Sandman), fighting off Green Goblin Junior, attempting to maintain the friendship with Harry, relationship difficulties with MJ, being possessed by Venom, and also trying to stay one step ahead of the new kid on the block. I think that is it, and some people have suggested that even if the film lasted for four hours, it would still not be enough to successfully resolve all of the conflicts (and a four hour movie would probably put too many people off).<br/><br/>The things that I love about these Spiderman movies (and I know there is a new one due out in July, but that is pretty much a reboot – hate that word – where they take new actors, new characters, and a new director, and head Spiderman in a new director, though the problem is that I felt Rami did actually do a really good job of these movies, and I feel that the next series has a high benchmark, it is not like the old Batman movies compared to the Christopher Nolan franchise) is the character of Spiderman. He is a true hero, but more than that, he does not kill his enemies. He will fight them, and he will capture them to let the justice system deal with them, but he simply will not kill them. In the first movie the Green Goblin is killed when his glider pierces his chest, in the second movie Doctor Octopus sacrifices himself to save the city (and that he refuses to die a monster), and in the third movie, Green Goblin Junior realises that Spiderman did not kill his father, and turns from an enemy to an ally. As for Venom, even if it is argued that he survived, it is an alien organism that is killed, and Eddie Brock has seen his life been totally destroyed that he cannot imagine a life without Venom so he would rather die that face his crimes. As for the Sandman, he is forgiven and he leaves.<br/><br/>The movie still finishes a little inconclusively, but as mentioned, that is it for the Sam Rami trilogy, the producers are moving onto a new film franchise now. It is very unclear whether MJ or Gwen Stacy actually forgive Peter for his behaviour (though many have suggested that Maguire completely fell flat on his face when he attempted to play Venom), though we do see MJ and Peter dance as the metaphorical curtain closes. In the comics, Gwen was Peter's first girlfriend (and this becomes apparent in the reboot) but she is killed (she doesn't die in this film, though some have also criticised the film for having MJ up in the tower when Stacey would have been the logical choice). As for MJ, Peter Parker ends up marrying her, though I am not too clear on what happens after that."

"kevinxirau","7","0","1","4 September 2011"," A good film that bit off a little more than it can chew.
","Spier-man 3. Where do I even begin? Of all the Spiderman movies that have had there share of goofy and disappointing moments, this is the film that created the most fuss among the fans. While still a financial success and a fun, action-packed movie, tons of fans like myself are wondering what went wrong with Sam Raimi. Let's swing in to find out.<br/><br/>I'll try to simplify the plot: Everything is starting to go well for Spidey. He gets the girl of his dreams (Mary Jane Watson) and everyone now loves Spidey. Well, almost everyone. A new triple threat has risen to truly test Peter Parker: Harry Osborne, having found out Peter's ID, has exposed himself to the Oz formula to become the New Goblin; Flint Marko, in a desperate quest to get the money to help his sick daughter, accidentally becomes the Sandman thanks to a molecular experiment; and finally there's the alien symbiote whose attachment to Peter Parker will lead to the rise of Venom. Spidey must confront the darkness within him in order the defeat these villains and save the ones he loves.<br/><br/>As you can see, there's a lot going on in this film, perhaps too much. Let's talk about the villains. Now we all knew Harry would go after Spiderman thanks to Spider-man 2 and overall it was a well done part of the plot because not only is it Peter's journey into darkness and forgiveness but it's also Harry's. It's awesome seeing Harry forgive Peter and help him in the final battle (sucks that he dies though). While I still find the inclusion of Sandman questionable (nothing really personal with Spidey in the comics), he's still pretty cool. What I like is how they combined both the villainous and heroic aspects of Sandman into one (he has played hero in the comics) so what we got was a guy who's a criminal who's sympathetic and only wanted to help his poor kid. And then there's Venom. While Sam Raimi didn't want him in the film, when I heard Venom was in this, I thought that was a great idea. Let Peter face his darkness. But when Topher Grace came in, he ruined Venom. Venom was too skinny, too evil, and too selfish. In the comics, while he wanted to kill Spidey, Venom was a good guy who cares for people and to this day still plays hero. Not the case here. While he still looks cool (big teeth, long tongue, etc.), Venom was portrayed badly.<br/><br/>Even with an overly complicated story, like bringing in Gwen Stacy, and some plot holes like how Venom knew about Sandman's daughter when they just met in the end, Spider-man 3 is still good with great action and some character development. If you want a thrill, go ahead and watch."

","This film is a classic example of studio interference. After the masterpieces that were the first two films the words ""Too many bad guys and too much forced humour"" are painfully apparent.<br/><br/>And that is just it, the film has far too many bad guys in it. 3 villains AND a love/heartbreak story is just far too much for any film and so the feel and flow that was so masterfully created in the prequels is lost in sea of underdeveloped new characters and really bad cheesy joke sequences.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Sam Raimi does his best with the material and no-one really could have done any better with what was there but ultimately if falls far, far short of the legacy!<br/><br/>Personally I would have liked to see Sandman and Sandman alone as the main villain, but the Venom story would have been equally as good.<br/><br/>I won't go any further, but just finish on the fact that all the elements were there and done very well, but spread so thinly as to leave you wanting more and much more yet again.<br/><br/>A truly disappointing end to a great series, but as suspected the fault lies with meddling executives rather than directors or actors. <br/><br/>Take note, let the artists do the art!"
"leo-pontinen","Null","0","4","18 November 2010"," Missing the level it could have pretty easily reached
","This movie can be an entertaining one regardless of it strongly missing its full potential. There is a lot to nitpick and the overall quality compared to the first two is highly inferior. Still, it can be enjoyed when just trying to watch it as a movie and not a book of knowledge.<br/><br/>What went wrong with Spiderman 3? For me, one problem was that the film makers weren't that deep with this one. They clearly decided to take another approach. Of course, there was humor in the first two but it wasn't that forced. The level of comedy was just a little too great here. I think it would have worked better if they had had some seriousness and tried to utilize every single subtlety that there was to get. If you compare the elevator scene from Spiderman 2, for example, to the scene were Peter dances in the bar, you can see the difference. The humor in the second one was a balancer to the troubles Peter had in that one. In Spiderman 3, it affects the tone in total, making you think that this was not meant to be taken seriously at all. Still, in order to get its multiple messages across, you need to do so.<br/><br/>The second, and a lot more dominating, problem was the lack of faithfulness to the original material. My favorite villain in Spiderman franchise is Venom. I didn't know how they were going to write the symbiote into the movie. It feels like they were desperate and just decided to make a meteor drop next to Peter. Also, I didn't like the way Venom was portrayed. Sam Raimi clearly doubted the Venom-face being able to convey emotions and credibility so he decided to unmask Eddie during every single speech. I liked who they didn't make him look ridiculously muscular or big. The interesting thing in the symbiote-plus-human -concept is that the result is pure power regardless how strong the person was in the beginning. This way, we can relate to that concept better.<br/><br/>So, it is fare to say that this movie failed to use the potential of the villains and the overall mythology. If you want to have a deep story considering the characters, this is not a movie for you. Still, it was pretty well made visually and it didn't feel like they were just boasting one it."

","My original intention was to write up three separate reviews, one for each movie, but I thought that this would be easier. So before I give my opinions on the latest installment of the Spider-Man series, titled Spider-Man 3, I will give a brief recap on what we have seen so far.<br/><br/>First we had ""Spider-Man 1"", the great introduction to possibly the greatest superhero film series ever. Sam Raimi proceeds with excellent direction, Tobey McGuire plays the noble Peter Parker, his innocence and good heart highlighting the inner sentimentality of the film which is well supported by the just as sentimental characters of Uncle Ben and Aunt May. With a lot of web swinging fun and spectacular visual effects, as well as a great line of talented actors, including Kirsten Dunst as the beautifully helpless damsel in distress Mary Jane Watson, and William Dafoe as the crooked, evil-faced villain The Green Goblin, the Spider-Man franchise kicks off with one hell of start.<br/><br/>Next came Spider-Man 2, the sequel, and a very good one at that. Here, we pick up from Peter Parker's last words of commitment ""With great power, comes great responsibility"", however his thoughts on the prospect of his deceased Uncle Ben are starting to lose meaning when his beloved Mary Jane is engaged to be married and the rest of his world as a superhero starts to crash down on him. With greater depth into the Spider-Man character, even better visual effects, and awesome one-on-one action sequences between the hero and the villain (the villain being Doc Oct, portrayed by Alfred Molina), the Spider-Man series continues to receive considerable acclaim both critically and publicly.<br/><br/>Then we have Spider-Man 3, supposedly the second to last installment of the series. With more villains, more action, and whole lot more visual effects, you'd think that this would be the best of them all, well think again, because this is not the Spider-Man that you know and love.<br/><br/>I don't know what the creators were thinking when they created this picture. Maybe they were just looking for an excuse to put in two of the greatest spider-man villains (Venon and Sandman), or perhaps they wanted to give the Spider-Man character a bit of a new, more compelling look. If that was the intention, then what a mistake it was.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff about this movie, take for example the visual effects. You can't deny that they are some of the most amazing you've seen come out of the Spider-Man franchise. I specifically enjoyed the birth of Sandman, where he slowly rises up from the sand that we was mixed with, that was one of the coolest things ever, but sadly it doesn't way out all the other flaws in this movie.<br/><br/>I guess one of my main complaints about Spider-Man 3 is the script, it's way too complex. The good thing about the previous films was that they were simple and focused. You have the inner struggle, the villain, and the relationship with Mary Jane. It was perfect and easy to digest. Then we were given the third installment, where they completely overstocked on character as well as conflict-ions between character profile. It was exhausting and overwhelming, very hard to sit through. I mean seriously: 3 villains, Sandman's background, trouble with MJ, Harry's changing attitudes, 2 different Spider-mans, competition at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH! <br/><br/>I'm not going to drag this review out any further and pick on the little annoying things, so I'm just going to comment on my second biggest problem with this movie. The fact is that Tobey McGuire can not pull of the bad guy look. We see him only as the sweet, strong hearted young man who does more than everything to protect the one's that he loves. That's who he is, that's what he's best at, and when you make him out to be the cocky and ignorant alter ego a huge meltdown is unavoidable, no matter how much eye-strapping visual effects you try to stuff into it. <br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 is not absolutely intolerable. It has it's moments of drama and entertaining action. But in my opinion, this doesn't stand the least bit of a fighting chance against the earlier installments. If there is going to be a fourth film, and I sincerely hope that there will be, and that Tobey McGuire is going to return to be Spider-Man again (because frankly I can't imagine anyone else playing the role), the one thing that the director has to keep in mind is that tarnishing the recognizing image is not going to do you any good what so ever."

","I've got some really mixed feelings about Spider-Man 3. It manages to divide me like no other film has done before or since. On one hand i find it to be a big, enjoyable, living comic book akin to Superman 2, with awesome action sequences not to mention good humour and heart. On the other hand i remember reading the comic book series on which the movie is based, and will freely admit that Sam Raimi fails to get the best out of the storyline as its presented in Spider-Man 3, and its tantalising to wonder what a director who was a fan of the whole Venom/Alien Symbiote storyline, could have came up with. The movie is about half an hour too long and Raimi really got the mood and atmosphere needed to tell that part of the story quite simply wrong. I feel Tobey Maguire is sleep walking through the role this time almost as if he is fed up with the character, which is a shame because he is required to carry the film to the best of his ability. Also the character of Eddie Brock is presented almost as an after thought as is the character of Gwen Stacey played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is a great actress but seems to be in this film just so Spidey will rescue her. Thomas Hayden Church is spot on as Sandman, looking so much like the character whilst putting a human spin on him. The storyline is a little convoluted but aside from playing a darker side of Peter which you aren't required to like, you end up not liking him all the same. The Alien Symbiote storyline is a worthwhile addition to the Spider-Man movie mythology, but doesn't come off as well as it might and the character of Venom just falls flat. That said there is a lot to enjoy in Spider-Man 3, the action sequences and special effects are first class as always, but its the script, despite being fun, that lets it down. So the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies come to an end, they were at times very enjoyable, and i for one cant wait to see the Andrew Garfield/Marc Webb reboot, should be awesome."
"jake-law123","7","0","4","26 June 2010"," Not bad.
","A lot of people hate this film for several reasons. Yes they were pretty convincing reasons, but it didn't destroy the whole film for me either. I enjoyed the action scenes, which is the main lead to enjoying an ""action"" film, the story was all right, even though it could have had less plot holes, the characters were decent enough, and it followed nicely with the comics.<br/><br/>The villains could have been better though. Not that I didn't want them in there, they just could have been better developed. I was excited as heck when I found out that Venom was going to be in there. When I saw it in theaters, that was what I was looking forward to the entire film. Then when it finally got to him, I was utterly disappointed. 2 minutes and 30 seconds total screen time with Venom, not counting when he's got his face lashed back into Eddie Brock. And how much time do we get with the Sandman, like a lot more. Their screen time should have been switched. Heck, they could have done the film without Sandman. What was he needed for? Did they really need the subplot of Sandman really killing uncle Ben? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The romantic struggle between Peter and Mary Jane, although a little stupid, still gets a lot of emotion put into the film. And the New Goblin, aka Harry, who loses his memory after an accident, forgets that he wants Peter dead, which regains his friendship with him.<br/><br/>We also get introduced to the symbiote, who becomes attached to Peter's Spider-Man outfit, and slowly tortures him into insanity, turning him from a pathetic nerd to a ruthless emo person. The two dumbest things in this film are emo Peter, and the dance scene.<br/><br/>Emo Peter is supposed to be tortured by the suit, yet he's hopelessly addicted to it. Yet soon after he gets it, a montage of him walking around the street acting goofy to each girl that comes by, is just plain silly. The dance scene is the worst. A scene where we jumps around a jazz club, swinging on lamps and sliding on chairs. It looks like a deleted scene from the movie Chicago. Its hard to see the pain he goes through when he's jumping around dancing. The scene did not have to be that silly, nor did the Emo Peter scene have to be.<br/><br/>Still though, the action was great, the characters and dialogue went well, the emotion throughout the entire film is just great, and it follows through with the comics almost perfectly. Although they could have had a lot more Venom time, and a lot less plot holes, it still holds out as a perfectly good comic book based film. Despite it being the worst of the series, its still a watchable film that I can see anytime."
"JustStone","5","0","3","8 April 2010"," Over stuffed and over cooked
","'ll tell you what's wrong with SM3 in one word; clutter. There is too much director Sam Ramini is trying to cram into this movie. There is Sandman's connection with Peter's Uncles killing, Harry Osbourn's revenge, Peter struggling with the alien suit, Eddie Brock turning into Venom, love triangle of Peter, Mary Jane & Gwen Stacy, Peter keeping up with rent.....ahh, I can go on forever baby. Sandman could have been dropped from the film all together and I wouldn't have noticed. As Ramani plays this juggling act he forgets to treat the most important part of the film with care; the black suit. Ramani doesn't even take the black suit seriously when Peter puts it on, even though it was advertised in the commercials as Peter having a dark, brooding struggle with his dark side. This is what the main focus of the movie should have been, but got lost in the shuffle. Anyway, this movie is fun to watch on the big screen, but don't expect it to age well over time."

","What happened Sam Raimi? You used to pull together a quality film on a shoestring budget - but this?! The equation may be the more money that's poured in - the less quality comes out. This was sloppy. The writers even tried to re-pen the first film *spoiler* ""oh, wait a DIFFERENT guy killed your dad!"" UGH! Come on! Several scenes in the film were completely written for laughs, there was a narration of the final fight scene by TV news reporters, and great actors slummed it.

"ZombieMcQueen","4","0","1","16 January 2010"," A disappointment, for Spider-Man and Raimi fans.
","Spider-Man was widely anticipated, especially by comics fans, but it finally arrived, promising to be even more epic than the previous films with its three enemies and symbiote storyline.<br/><br/>almost all of the starring actors from the past films have returned along with some interesting new faces. Tobey McGuire turns a new leaf as Emo Spidey with a chip on his shoulder, Kirsten Dunst struggles with Peter's habit of letting her down as well her own troubles, James Franco finally acts upon his father's death as the New Green Goblin (rather than the Hobgoblin, as he was known in previous incarnations), and we meet new stars in Thomas Haden Church (who gives a fantastic performance as The Sandman) and Topher Grace (Eddie Brock/Venom). familiar faces come back to bring up support as well. J.K Simmons returns to give another outstanding performance as J. Jonah Jamesson, William Dafeo and Cliff Roberston make an appearance once again as the mental flashbacks, and Rosemary Harris makes you love her grandma-like nature once again. all of the main acting is generally good, ranging from acceptable to cosmic. hell, even the small roles of the scene extras weren't half bad (though nothing as wonderful as ""HEY! he stole that guy's PIZZA!!!""). the special effects from the movie have heightened and what was previously unthinkable in live-action cinema has become a reality in terms of bringing such villains to life. the cinematography is even better, and the fantastic feeling of really swinging with Spider-Man is even more captivating now. often the effect of the camera-work and CGI left my mouth wide open. but for me, the best things about this movie were the little things: namely, Bruce Campbell's hilarious spot-on comedy, and Stan Lee saying ""nuff said"" (though i'll admit it was a forced performance).<br/><br/>now, that being said, there's many points about this movie that seem ridiculous. one is the pacing for the whole movie. it's on and off like an overworked hooker on a steam engine, and runs through like the chaotic fantasies of an ADD kid with a 36MM. ever see Spidey swing into action, pausing only to strike a pose in front of a huge American flag? trust me, as awesome as it sounds, it merely comes off as misplaced patriotism here. another bad point is the arrival of the Symbiote substance. not to spoil anything, but it lands in a meteor. am I the only one who thinks the original appearance (crawling out of a fallen space shuttle Spidey had kept from crashing) would have been much more impressionistic on the film? and to think that Parker, with his heightened senses, wouldn't notice a meteor crashing not 50 meters from him? I mean, I realize he's making out with Kirsten Dunst at the time and more enticing things are..ahem..""at hand"", but gimme a break. another flaw is the whole appearance of Gwen Stacy. sure, comic fans might find this a nice nod to one of Peter's pre-MJ girlfriends, but she serves no purpose through the movie. Peter never once shows that he cares about her in any way, he merely uses her to make Mary Jane feel bad, who fusses over it like a child. to me, the entire conflicting love triangle between him, Gwen and Mary Jane seemed pointless and tragically high school in a sense. Venom is another character who was poorly constructed. he's more of a sniveling, scheming, whiny-voiced skinny guy rather than the conniving, intensely frightening brute we all know him as. he doesn't even really catch the attention at all until the climax. ah, the climax. like the pacing, it's on and off. Sandman redeems himself in an excellent fashion, but then provides a ""wtf?"" moment when he simply leaves, leaving no real ending for him. my friend and I literally said ""sooo.....he..flew away?"" ""uh...yeah...but why?"" ""fuck if I know"". as for Venom and Harry...well, i'll leave that up for you to see yourself. if you want to hear my thoughts on that then message me, because I won't go into it here for those who haven't seen the movie yet. i'm thoroughly disappointed with Raimi on this outing, i expected more from him than this sort of Hollywood summer name-brand blockbuster"
"Ziya90","5","0","1","3 January 2010"," Could it be the end of Spider Man? No, it is the end of Sam Raimi!
","Spider Man 3 is a very entertaining movie, I watched it several times later on TV, despite almost hate it, but otherwise it is a very scratchy movie and it doesn't take itself seriously, in other words, Raimi doesn't take it seriously. It seems that the script was written without so much thinking! The movie is really good when it comes to action scenes. The parts which Sandman fights Spider Man are great in terms of visual effect and editing. The scene which he is ""born"" was mesmerizing and even touching. In fact, that scene was unusual for such a movie. It was pure art. As for the flaws, the metamorphosis of Spider-Man and the genesis of Venom weren't handled well. The screen times of Venom and black Spider Man were short. I don't know is it necessary to say that the actor who plays Venom was a ridiculous choice! In the comic book, as I remember, after his costume gets black, Spider-Man realizes that he has some new powers. Then, he gives some of their enemies hard time. When he sees that it is evil and controls him, he tries to get rid of it. The black substance comes to the earth by a spaceship, it infects to it, but nobody realizes. And after an accident, it finds Spider-Man. The change of Peter Parker is mentioned by two ridiculous and pointless scenes; the bar scene and the street scene that Peter Parker dances! He looks untroubled, no anxiousness etc. It is like the movie makes fun of itself or Raimi makes fun of his own movie! Raimi decreases action scenes as much as he can, because, in these years, this is the trend! Less action, much drama, focus on characters instead! However, still the movie is satisfying as an action and as said very entertaining, it has demo scenes. The movie was not slow paced, but it suffered from less action, more drama and humor syndrome at times. And may be the final action was a bit lame! Some people glorify J. K. Simmons's performance, but if you ask me, his acting was overdone. He cannot make us believe that he is J. Jonah Jameson, he tries to be like J. Jonah Jameson. In other words, it is like he imitates that character, so cartoonish. Some visual effects are flawed, especially the scene which Peter Parker fights Harry Osborn at night and the scene which Spider and Sandman fights in the metro. In the first fight, two foes fight without mask which is also the reason of bad CGI and also a bad idea! Also, there are some seriously illogical moments in this fight which a human being cannot survive. We get bored of the routine accident scenes and especially Mary Jane in danger moments. The killer of Ben Parker is far fetched and even ridiculous. In the final sequence, there are also some very illogical moments which Sam Raimi call as ""comic book reality"" such as Sandman's impacts or the sticks trick."

","Yes, I am aware Spider-Man comes from the comic books. And I've read enough of them that the word ""meanwhile"" shows up quite often. Unfortunately, they didn't place ""meanwhile"" in Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>I don't know how many subplots are in Spider-Man 3, but I'll try to list them. All. And with the appropriate word ""meanwhile"" to transition them, as they should've in the movie:<br/><br/>Mary Jane's finally on Broadway. Meanwhile, Harry's still seeking revenge on Spider-Man for the supposed murder of his father, a.k.a. Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter wants to marry MJ. Meanwhile, an alien force lands on Earth. Meanwhile, Flint, related to the death of Uncle Ben, breaks out of prison. Meanwhile, Flint's fighting to make his sick daughter alive and his ex at bay. Meanwhile, Harry gets temporary amnesia. Meanwhile, Brock is yearning to be Spidey's new press agent. Meanwhile, Gwen is dangerously modeling during an accident and Spidey rescues her. Meanwhile, her father, the police captain, grants Spidey the key to the city. Meanwhile, MJ gets fired for bad acting. Meanwhile, Peter proposes and gets turned down from MJ. Meanwhile, romance sparks up between MJ and Harry. Meanwhile, Sandman and Spidey fight. Meanwhile, the black goo, a.k.a. alien Venom attaches to Spidey. Meanwhile, Spidey gets loose and becomes a real person, albeit aggressive. Meanwhile, Spidey loses the Venom to Brock. Meanwhile, Brock becomes a cartoon black Spidey. Meanwhile, Harry's father's ghost visits and convinces him to blackmail MJ and fight Spidey. Meanwhile, Sandman and Venom team up to hurt Spidey. Meanwhile, Peter makes MJ jealous with Gwen. Meanwhile, Dr. Connors warns of the black goo. Meanwhile, Peter's apartment manager, daughter and Aunt gives good advice while either criticizing his place or again, asking for rent. Meanwhile, J. Jonah Jameson is having pill problems. Meanwhile, Peter learns to dance, horribly, but it was meant for comic relief, I suppose. Meanwhile, the ""Alfred""-butler reveals at the most opportune time what Harry needed to hear to move the plot along.<br/><br/>(That last one made me actually crack up in the theatre – Seriously? He chose that moment after 3 movies to reveal the truth behind the death of the Green Goblin?)<br/><br/>Wow. Did I miss any? I understand that's not entirely in order and that's not all of the multiple subplots, but I count twenty-six subplots. Twenty-six??? Seriously? This has to be a record.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie a few times, and though it's not horrible, in fact it's decently filmed and Grace brings a lot to his role as Brock/Venom, there are way too many things going on. It certainly had the ""Batman"" dilemma. By the time the original Batman series got to part IV, there were so many villains, so many characters, so many subplots, it was so bogged down, it was unwatchable. And that's sad. This could've been so much better if they focused on only Venom as a villain. Or just Sandman as a villain. Or signaling out Gwen as a love interest. Or even Spidey going bad. Or the now-age-old New Goblin as a rival.<br/><br/>No, they had to put 26+ ideas in one. The biggest problem with the entire series is pacing. Going on way too long. Here, in part III, they not only decided to actually increase the length, but add way too many ideas.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that was the movie's undoing. Despite some awesome action sequences (Harry Vs. Peter in the opening and the absolute comic-book ending fight) the movie seriously should be skipped. I remember watching this in theatres thinking: ""Oh, I can't wait to watch this on DVD, so I can just skip to the 30 minutes (of 139) that I actually liked.""<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I'm guessing we're not supposed to side with aggressive Spider-Man, made that way with the alien goo. Unlike the other Super-Hero Part 3, where Kal-El goes bad in Superman III, I actually liked Peter/Black-Spidey much better than the red/blue good-guy. At least this Dark-Spidey got paid for once.<br/><br/>Let's hope they get back on track for part IV. Ideas: go back to one villain. Lose the ""love conflict story"" between the two leads – Oh My God, that's been played out for almost seven hours of the series. In addition, if there is a wedding, yeah, like there won't be, make it quick and get back to the action. And, finally, fire Willem Dafoe – enough with the Green Goblin!!!!"
"Zentaurion","4","0","2","11 November 2009"," Not enough black to make the movie look thinner
","In one word I would describe the movie as bloated. Sam Raimi, no doubt now one of the most empowered directors in Hollywood, has really been let to indulge himself with this one. But though the movie seems to really lag in places, the result is that there's no skimping on character development. We've already got to know most of the characters over the last two movies but it's good to see further development, especially for Mary-Jane who has evolved over the three movies, and Dunst is magnetic with the role. Toby McGuire IS Spiderman as usual and takes the new developments with the character in his stride.<br/><br/>We could have done with less Sandman, more Venom. Though we get to know Eddie Brock very well, Venom was very under-utilized.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't seem to have the same sense of wonder as the previous two, but that seems fitting with the theme as it is more introspective. The ending seemed to abrupt, but at least ties up all the story arches."
"blacklist-1","6","0","2","2 October 2009"," One big mess - Overlong and over-plotted.
","When I saw the first Spiderman back in 2002 I thought it was brilliant and that Sam Raimi had superbly conveyed the superhero successfully to the big screen.<br/><br/>Then two years later Spiderman 2 came out and it was even better, with more strands of plot included, but it was tightly packed and the film showed real depth and exploration of the characters emotions with the various stock situations that were taking place.<br/><br/>With Spiderman 2 being so flawless I had extremely high expectations for the third and I have to say I was quite disappointed. But first the positives of this film and one thing that cannot be criticised is the special effects of the suits namely Spidey's and the dark suit and when Sandman changes from dust to figure is awesome to look at making the CGI improved from the second.<br/><br/>The acting from the big three, Magurie, Dunst and Franco is as good as it ever was with the additional support in particular Thomas Church as Sandman was great and the action sequences were exciting, which made it entertaining but unfortunately that is all I could pull that I liked from this film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest of the film and the problem mainly being the plot, it was just too long and too much included.<br/><br/>For example we not only get Sandman and Venom but the return of the Green Goblin and Spidey's dark side coming out and to add Peters relationship with Mary Jane is under threat.<br/><br/>The movie crumbles under it's own weight with so many plot lines. I found the stories difficult to follow and instead of flowing naturally like the second, which if you remember had one main story and a few sub-plots, it felt clichéd.<br/><br/>For example when the Harry bumps his head during his fight with Peter and gets amnesia just felt ridiculous. Not to mention that fight sequence was edited too fast. I felt dizzy when watching it.<br/><br/>But the core problem of the plot was it lacked the emotional involvement of the characters as everything happens so quickly because there is so much to include.<br/><br/>What's also gone is the humour that helped make the first two more humanistic and made that character development go a bit further.<br/><br/>This made me feel as though the film was just going through the motions.<br/><br/>Another criticism is parts of the acting, Maguire for example when he came out with his dark side, his attempt at portraying a villain was pathetically foolish and Dunst became irritating with her character MJ moaning all the time.<br/><br/>Some of the other scenes like when Harry finds out his father killed himself from his servant Bernard who (if you can remember him) was a very minor character in the first two tells him that, but how would he know? You hardly ever saw him.<br/><br/>In the end to put it simply Raimi tried to be too clever by including more than he should have and we have been left with a film that is one big mess.<br/><br/>I would suggest he should have just had the Green Goblin and Sandman for this film as the dark suit and Venom link, which could have been left to the next film.<br/><br/>It was still entertaining and I recommend you see it, but be prepared to be disappointed as this isn't spectacular. Lets hope this is just a glitch is what has been a superb franchise and that Spiderman 4 will be much improved."
"refresh_daemon","5","0","1","25 August 2009"," Too much, too contrived, but somehow still Spidey
","Spider-Man 3 is the first movie where Sam Raimi has disappointed me. It's certainly a Sam Raimi film and it very much follows the previous movies in terms of style, presentation and even in terms of where its story goes, but where it fails is to tell a well woven tale.<br/><br/>The story follows after the events of Spider-Man 2 and both of the previous movies are briefly summarized visually during the opening credits, which is nice for those who have to catch up. Spider-Man has become the talk of the town and Mary Jane is opening up a show. Uh, then a whole ton of stuff happens in a hurry, including the introduction of three villains and a retcon of the first movie, which leads to a whole lot of emo-spidey/Peter Parker.<br/><br/>And there's so much attempted in this story that it just doesn't hold together. Several elements of the stories feel heavily contrived, just to get all the villains present. The Harry Osborn, the the Black Suit and Eddie Brock have enough going for them that they could have all held together their own movies separately, using just the Sandman as an intermediary villain, but so little time is spent developing any of the major story lines that the film literally tells us what's going on most of the time and does things like retconning events of the first movie to fit in motive for the second emo-Parker. Which in itself is an inversion of the whole ""Raindrops Are Falling On My Head"" sequence from the second film. Unfortunately, the charm wore off and the sequence went on far too long this time around. Also, because the film has to juggle so many events, it felt like I was a ping pong ball bouncing back and forth between a heated game of ""let's change up the entire tone of the film with a dramatic twist"" over and over again. I really didn't appreciate that we hit emo-Spidey/Parker three entire times over the course of the film, with him ""getting better"" each time. The stories, the Mary Jane/Peter Parker story, the Harry Osborn story, the Eddie Brock/Black Suit story and the Sandman story all just aren't given enough time to breathe and set before things change over again.<br/><br/>I got bored and I got frustrated. Furthermore, the Sandman, as a character is poorly developed and so are his powers, which ultimately seem overwhelming and it's surprising how easily he's defeated. The only character that gets some interesting development is Harry Osborn, but not enough time is spent with him and it doesn't feel like, at the end, what happens with him is earned by the film. So almost every element of the film seems a little forced.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is up to the standards of the previous films. It looks great and Raimi and company maintains their eye for color, for camera-work, for adding cheese when wanted and providing kinetic action. The actors all remain up to the standards established by the previous films and I really do like how the film feels so much like the previous two in terms of the overall presentation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the only problem with Spider-Man 3 happens to be a huge one. The story essentially tries to sandwich what might be three movies worth of plot into a two hour movie (and yes, the movie really felt too long) and it just fails to pull me into its world, making me feel like I was getting smacked around by a giant plot stick. And it just seemed too obvious that it was trying to do that. And, so, I was quite disappointed by Spider-Man 3. It's not ""the suck"" entirely, because, contrived as it is, it still does try to tell a story (or two, or three) that might be coherent and meaningful if more time was given to it, but it doesn't succeed. I'd say it's fine to stop at Spider-Man 2 and leave the series on a good note. 5/10."

Got all that? A quick read of that opening synopsis tells you all there is to know about what kind of a mess this movie is in.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi seems to really over egg the pudding to produce a bloated, dull, quite unspectacular follow up to the triumph that was Spider-Man 2. The film starts off well with Peter deciding to pop the question to MJ whilst Flint Marko (a criminally wasted Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison but finds himself turned into a sand based monster in a tragic accident. However from the big opening action sequence (a battle between Peter and Harry across the rooftops of New York), the film quickly begins to fall apart as it struggles to contain and develop all of its diverging plot lines.<br/><br/>And that's the main fault. There's is simply too much going on in the film. The Batman films on the 1990's strained under the weight of two super villains but this film almost breaks down by trying to include three super villains. Neither fan favourites the Sand Man or Venom are well served by the storyline at all and it's a great shame because Venom, if done right, could've really worked on film. Here, once the transformed Brock turns up 20 minutes before the film ends, it just seems a waste. Even Harry's Goblin II plot line is seriously fumbled.<br/><br/>There's not just the fault of the too many super villains aspect, there's also the storyline of bad Peter Parker (or should that be Emo-Peter?) which is laughably bad, horribly acted and executed, and culminates in one of the most embarrassing scenes I've witnessed in a modern blockbuster, the Jazz Club scene, what were they thinking?!? It's not all bad, they do get some things right (the first hour of the film is on par with the first two films and the introduction of Gwen and Captain Stacy is spot on and they look like they've come straight off the page) but its a case of too little too late and by the time you get to another climax with a trapped, screaming MJ (another lacklustre turn from Kirsten Dunst) you really have given up caring.<br/><br/>A real waste of the franchise after the highs of the second instalment, let's hope they tone down the excesses for the fourth film. 6/10"

","Spider-man and Spider-man 2 impressed the world with it's slick action, cool effects and it's great adaptation to a legendary comic series. Finally a 3rd instalment is released to complete it's trilogy. It did just that, a decent 3rd sequel, but instead of making it decent, it could have been made brilliantly if some scenes were done with more thought put into it. But still spider-man 3 offers many new features in the series and improved in little but many ways.<br/><br/>To start off with something more positive of the movie is always better. You could say that spider man 3 is a little different from the other 2, but not necessarily in a bad way. The fight scenes were better and panned out, simply flawless, best thing about the movie for sure. There was plenty of them too, it's cool to see them mixed too (not always ""spider man"" vs the villain) so yes they were different in many ways. Camera angles were better, punches, kicks, flips and ""super strength"" were exploited better in that case. The plot outclassed the one's from the previous instalments, i'm sure you all seen the trailers or clips, so without ruining it for you. The idea of a ""black suited spider-man (evil) has everyone exploding of what's going to happen in the movie. So yes, definitely the plot was good thanks to new and old villains involved. Even the acting was brilliant, Tobey Maguire is impressive again and does well. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were good too.<br/><br/>Now saying all that, your probably thinking. If the movie offers all that, what could possibly be wrong with it. And i could answer you right now. Wastefull scenes. I can't really explain without adding spoilers so i will keep it minimum. The director (Sam Raimi) just completely went wrong with many scenes, (despite the fact most amazing scenes) plenty of film time was really wasted on nonsense. Instead of the movie being full of intense action it started dragging onto some boring drama or romance scenes, which were never necessary. The movie got dragging and the long duration of the movie was because of wasteful scenes like that, the director maybe just took to much film time on things that really didn't matter and left out on some things that could be more important. Also the way that the ""villians"" got introduced in the movie were too disappointing, they were rushed in the film in strange ways and too quick, like i said because to much film time was wasted. And that's the reason the film's success was cut down.<br/><br/>Even though the film shows a lot on negativity, it's still a good instalment to the series and quite fun to watch, different and sometimes cool. A definite one for spider man lovers. But if more thought was put into it it could have been a outstanding trilogy, but unfortunately it wasn't. But still a good flick."
"filmbuff20","6","0","1","28 April 2009"," Entertaining, but not up to the standard set by Raimi himself.
","In this third instalment of the popular comic book franchise, Spider-Man is up against not one, not two, but three opponents. A black gooey alien symbiote that's just conveniently crash landed from outer space and heightens the inner evil (or mildly testy, as the case is here) of anyone it attaches itself to, The Sandman who is yet another product of a freak accident and The Green Goblin's son, Harry, who slips onto Dad's glider for a little revenge, plus the addition of rival love interest Gwen Stacy to complicate Spidey's relationship with girlfriend Mary Jane Watson and the issue of Eddie Brock, a photographer who is vying for Peter's job to further complicate matters for the wall crawler.<br/><br/>From reading that overlong sentence, you can just about get an idea of the movie - unnecessarily jam packed with too much information. The movie begins where the last left off, with Peter and Mary Jane very much in love and Peter and Harry very much in hate. On his way home, Peter is ambushed by a newly re-muscled Harry on his glider, providing us with our very first set-piece of the movie. This is a painstakingly planned sequence, director Sam Raimi doing what he does best with his camera. Unfortunately, one cannot help but notice some of the awful full body CGI stunt men doubling for Harry and Peter. If you are eagle eyed enough to notice, you'll see this popping up throughout, jolting the viewer out of the movie.<br/><br/>Next we are introduced to Flint Marko, a criminal on the run who, after visiting his dying daughter, falls into a sand pit in which an unexplained particle experiment is going on (don't people read danger signs anymore?) and becomes one with the sand particles, able to shape shift and get in places people didn't know they could get sand in. The Sandman seems nothing more than another version of The Mummy, but nevertheless, Raimi manages to conjure up some interesting new visuals. The shame of it all is that the poor guy is in fact non-essential to the movie overall. His back story is a wholly unnecessary addition to events in the first Spider-Man movie and serves only to provide evil, black suited Spidey with some questionable actions to execute as a result of emotional turmoil. By the end of the film, Sandman is nothing more than a big, hulking, growling CG creation and finally, a footnote to be checked off the list of loose ends to tie up. The most telling piece of information is in the very first featurette on the DVD. Producer Avi Arad's first words to camera are how Sandman was a great opportunity for CGI. Ah. It all makes sense.<br/><br/>Now we come to yet another plot point, in which the alien goop connects itself to Peter's suit, creating a black suited Spidey, or 'evil' Spidey. Evil Spidey is not given a great deal of evil to actually do. Evil for Spidey is simply combing his hair downwards and behaving like a lad who has had one too many pints down the pub. Maguire does quite an impressive job conveying the 'quasi evil' side of Spidey and is obviously having fun with it, but is constricted by the limitations of the script.<br/><br/>There are some potentially rich character developments which are squandered in favour of packing in as much as possible. Gwen Stacy, a pivotal character in the comics who was forfeited in favour of skipping straight to Mary Jane for the first film, is wasted here in a silly subplot to make Mary Jane jealous. For what it's worth, Bryce Dallas Howard is still charming in the role, but she is short changed in favour of simply having her show up and say 'hi' to comic book fans. There's also a jarring bit of lazy resolution in the use of a shameless deus ex machina to resolve Harry's story, something which sours the rest of the film more than the overstuffed showdowns and multiple endings. Finally, Venom, fan favourite, is created by Peter's leftover goop attaching itself to Eddie Brock, played sarcastically by Topher Grace. Criminally, this happens in the last reel, giving Venom precious little screen time and rendering him another side note. He would have been better served either as main villain or as an appetite whetter for part 4 in the final frame.<br/><br/>This is a prime example of sacrificing the integrity of story, character and structure simply to give the fans on the internet what they're screaming to see. Ironically, it's the same fans that tear the film apart after it's release. Despite that, there are still plenty of things to enjoy about this film. The various action sequences, while seemingly rushed are still spectacular and fun to watch, the now famous Saturday Night Fever strut equally so and an amusing, if slightly out of place cameo from Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as an inept Maitre d' is bound to raise a smile.<br/><br/>As a cinematic experience, Spider-Man 3 is not completely unsatisfying. It contains all the fun, zest and passion for the material as the first two but the over-stuffed narrative and short changing of potentially dynamic characters is an unforgivable mistake and the law of diminishing returns threatens to plague the web crawler still further should this series continue. By the finale, all the story lines have crashed into each other messily, culminating in yet another MJ hostage situation, begging the question, do these villains have no imagination?<br/><br/>THE BOTTOM LINE: Good solid blockbuster fun with all the trimmings of the first two, but bigger, faster, louder and more is not always the best policy. Multiple story lines are deftly woven together for most of the running time but clumsily crash together in the finale. Better than most sequels, but not as good as the standard that this franchise sets for itself."

","Upon first viewing Spider-man 3, I must say that it was one of the bigger disappointments I've ever had upon viewing a film. The first two Spider-man films were both great films, but this one just seemed to lack that magic that made the first two so enjoyable. From the very first frame of this film I could tell that that something was missing, then as the film progressed the film just got more and more disappointing. First off the film was too jampacked, there were too many villains for one film, then on top of all that the film turned in the smart and witty comedy of the first two for cheesy comedy in this one. I mean the scene where Peter Parker dances down the street dressed as an Emo kid is one of the most painful scenes to watch in any film. Overall Spider-man 3 was a huge disappointment and I'm not really sure that I can recommend it to any fan of the webcrawler.<br/><br/>I give Spider-man 3 a disappointing 5 out of 10!"

","Im a real huge fan of spider man really... I've watched the TV series sense i was like 6 years old. But this movie really sucked. compared to the first and second this ain't even a spider man movie. This movie seems more like a video game. It started of OK but then the fighting scenes were not as good as spider man 1 or 2. The ending was really horrible like they were running out of time. I really expected more from this movie because spider man is the best super hero. This movie was HARDLY watchable its a movie you can watch but in the end say OK. Last thing i wanna say is i hope they don't make spider man 4 the same way i really hope they can turn it around."

","I really do love the Spider-Man movies. In fact, up until the Dark Knight came out, I considered Spider-Man 2 to be the best superhero movie ever made. But then they made this movie, which practically ruined the franchise for me. The plot is stupid, cheesy, and completely over the top. It's also incredibly crowded, with almost 5 different story arcs occurring in 1 two hour movie, none of which fit together at all. the acting is horrible, the comic moments are horrible, and they ruined just about everything about the characters, especially Venom, who was in the movie for about 10 minutes altogether, and was never cool or threatening in the slightest. I mean come on! Who was the person making this film who decided to make Venom one of the movies lead villains, and then thought, ""Hey, you know who would make a cool Venom? That kid from that 70's show!"" They didn't even change his voice when he became Venom! He just sounded like Topher Grace, which is a stupid idea for the voice of one of the creepiest spider-Man villains ever. But enough about that. The movie also makes very little sense (Sandman crying? Really? He's made of sand morons! He can't cry!), completely changed Spider-Man's origin story, which made it lose all of it's impact, and served to be nothing but a really over-the-top rehash of the previous two films. In my opinion, this ranks up there with films like Batman and Robin and Spawn as one of the worst movies in this genre, and how it has such a high rating here on this website is really confusing to me. But oh well, at least we'll get Spider--Man 4 right? Maybe that will help fix the franchise. Oh wait, they canceled that, and now we're getting a spider-Man reboot that puts Spider-Man back in high school. Great. I'm sure that will be a lot better. That was sarcasm, by the way. That's an awful idea for a film. I'm getting off point though, the point being, Spider-Man 3 sucks. Big time."
"ViperMan_2000","6","0","1","2 January 2009"," What went wrong here?
","Spider-Man...Spider-Man...The first Spider-Man movie was one of my favorite movies. I watched it so may times when I was younger. After seeing it so much and knowing it so well, I saw Spider-Man 2. I was mildly disappointed at first, but I got over it and realized that though it wasn't as good as the first movie, it wasn't that bad, either. And now I see Spider- Man 3...<br/><br/>This is definitely the worst Spider-Man in the series. It does have it's moments, but it is no where near as good as Spider-Man 1 or 2. After close analyses, (That is what I do best. I can't help trying to figure out what is wrong with things) I have come up with a list of things that could be changed to make this movie better.<br/><br/>First, there are too many villains. How much screen time did Venom have, anyway? Like 5 minutes? There was potential for a great story line with every villain, but they crammed too much into one movie to take advantage of it. They gave Sandman an interesting back story, but couldn't explore it because they had too much going on. Harry Osborn's character also had amazing potential to be made better, but they had too much going on.<br/><br/>Second, the design of the Venom suit. The Venom suit is horrible. I can understand that trying to adapt it from the comic books has to be hard, but they didn't go about it very well. The claws were especially bad. They looked like dirty fingernails. And the thing where Venom's mask comes off every time he talks was a horrible idea. They should have kept the regular solid black suit. The claws should have been something black, like the suit, not big fingernails. And they could have done things to show that the suit was the same stringy black mess that we saw envelope Eddie Brock. They definitely could have demonstrated this around the mouth, perhaps having some of those tendrils connect the top to the bottom or something...<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the end. Several things about the end really messed this movie up. First, the idea that Venom and Sandman did this huge kidnapping thing with all these people just sitting there watching and everything. First, this is the third movie, and it also happens to be the third movie where Mary Jane was kidnapped and used to get to Spider-Man. That's original. The writers should have tried to put a little more work into making new ideas instead of doing old things over again. And the writing in the web was also horrible. Someone in the studio thought that it would be an awesome idea to use the old ""Amazing Spider-Man"" font in the movie, but the whole thing was so stupid. And what exactly was Venom doing before Spider-Man came, anyway? <br/><br/>OK, next...the T.V. news. We can see that Spider-Man is getting the crap beaten out of him and may not survive. We DEFINITELY do not need a news reporter to come up telling us ""Spider-Man is getting the crap beaten out of him. He may not survive."" That, I thought, was one of the worst parts of the movie: cutting to the news program. If that was cut out, the movie would go straight up a couple notches in quality.<br/><br/>And then we have the end fight. Who were the choreographers, anyway? It's obvious that they didn't take any time to work it out. Instead, they took the easy way out. Did anyone else notice that Spider-Man would fight Venom for a while, kick him away, and all of a sudden he's completely gone for like ten minutes while Sandman comes, and then Spider-Man gets Sandman to go away and all of a sudden Venom magically appears out of nowhere again? If you're going to have two villains, have two villains. Choreograph it as such. Don't just fight one, have him disappear, fight another, have him disappear and then have the other one come back.<br/><br/>Finally, we come to the deaths. Venom is the biggest villain of the comic books...EVER. Why did they kill him off after like 20 minutes of screen time. He was a minor character in this movie! If they had put their focus completely on Sandman and Harry Osborn and developed THEIR stories and left Venom for number four where they could have actually done SOME justice to his character, things would have been MUCH better. How about this? Spider-Man is blowing the suit up, Eddie jumps after it, and Spider-Man stops him just in time. He IS knocked back by the explosion, though, and is in critical care...<br/><br/>And here comes MY idea for number four. OK...Connors still has that sample of the suit in his lab. One night, he's working on research and these secret agency people come and kidnap him. As he struggles, he knocks over the container with the piece of suit in it. They force him to experiment on himself to grow back his limb, (For military usage purposes, perhaps) and he turns into the lizard. The piece of suit becomes Carnage. And, perhaps, some of it could become Venom again and give them an opportunity to actually do something with the character.<br/><br/>Please send me your thoughts on this. I would like to hear feedback on my ideas. Thank you."

"MF210","5","0","1","18 October 2008"," Could've been spectacular but ended up being a bloated mess
","My Rating: ** out of ****.<br/><br/>Maybe Spider-Man 3 is the product of huge expectations, maybe even unreasonably so, but it is a massive disappointment. Sam Raimi was crafting one of the better super hero franchises, the first one was solid and the second one was one was outstanding. The trailers for the third film showed promise and there was a ton of potential, hardly any of which was realized in the final product.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film was Sam Raimi was just attempting way too much with the storyline. Not only is the film about Peter and MJ's relationship, which is in full blown soap opera mode, but it's also about Peter's conflicts with Harry, Peter/Spider-Man's ""dark side"", which is introduced by some mysterious black goo from outer space, and two other villains are thrown in for good measure. Needless to say Spider-Man 3 is a bloated mess.<br/><br/>One of the trademarks of the previous two film were the quality of the villains. Willem Defoe was very effective as the Green Goblin and Alred Molina was outstanding as Doc Ock, both were menacing and, even if they had there complexities, you had no problem rooting against them. That is a problem here. If you're counting all the vaillains in the film there is three: Harry, Sandman, and Venom. The fight scenes between Peter/Spidey and Harry are energetic and some of the most effective in the film, but James Franco is not intimidating enough to be a good villain, and by the end of the film he is no longer a villain.<br/><br/>The other two villains are both failures for different reasons. Thomas Haden Church plays Sandman, who we learn was responsible for the death of Peter's Uncle Ben in the first films, and he ends up being the most sympathetic character in the film. Give credit to Church for making us feel for the character but that doesn't make him a very good villain. Sandman's name is Flint Marko and he shows to regret his past actions and wants to help his sick daughter. Not everything he does is right but it's hard to hate him.<br/><br/>The biggest failure is how Raimi just decides to trash Venom. Not only is Topher Grace seriously miscast as Eddie Brock/Venom but the character is unforgivably shortchanged. The character has only 20-30 minutes of screen time and Brock doesn't become Venom till the very end. This is one of the most popular villains in the comics and cartoons and the filmmakers hardly use him? I'm baffled by their apporach. At least you can say he looks good but there's no doubt Venom deserved to be a stand alone villain in another film.<br/><br/>The trailers showed that the film was going to focus on the dark side of Peter and Spider-Man. This potentially fascinating element is, with a few eceptions, executed poorly. The black goo that was previously mentioned attaches itself to Peter and changes his mood,appearance and creates a black Spidey suit. His appearance is ridiculously emo with black hair and an angsty facial expression. He also acts like a fool dancing on the streets, I know Raimi likes to add humor to these films but a lot of these scenes turn the film into a self-parody. This is supposed to be dark? More like ridiculous. The only time this works is when Peter fights Harry and the black Spidey encounters Sandman in the subway, but other than that, this element was a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are also disappointments. The chemistry isn't as strong here and both their performances are weaker. Dunst comes off as whiny and Maguire has several moments where is frighteningly awful. One scene that takes place on a bridge bewtween him and Dunst where he is expected to be emotional is painfully embarrassing. His performance doesn't ring true playing the darker side as well, though that's partly bad writing too.<br/><br/>In short, the film is just an all-round disappointment. The climactic action scene at the end even lacks the energy of the previous films. If Spider-Man 4 is going to come out in 2011, Sam Raimi better have a solid storyline that's not biting off more then he can chew or I'll be officially done with this franchise."

","This movie was definitely not as good as the previous 2. For one thing, Aunt May could have been completely cut from this movie. Also, it didn't feel like a genuine Sam Raimi movie, it relied much more heavily on CGI than the previous movies. The entire main cast seemed as though they weren't trying,i.e Tobey Maguire trying to act evil was just pathetic in my opinion. The storyline was kind of weak with the whole Sandman having a dieing daughter and Harry Osborn became New Goblin too fast (within the first 10-20 minutes.) Venom was a pansy who should have had his own movie AND a different actor to portray him. All in all, this movie is watchable, but not worth buying."
"theodoremartin","6","0","1","28 September 2008"," Fun, But Crammed And Thin
","The strengths of the first two ""Spider-Man"" films are what you'd expect from Sam Raimi - insane action with moments (and many of them) of characterization. With all of the action, you never feel rushed or short-changed, which made his films sorta the ""thinking man's action movies."" The same could be said for Tim Burton's take on Batman in his first go-around with the character. Unfortunately, he fell on his face cramming two brilliant villains in one movie making for a much malaigned hurried pace that ruined what could've been two good movies. The lesson here is obvious - too many things can simply add up to too many things. I had to think long and hard, obviously, about ""Spider-Man 3."" (It took me THIS long to fairly write a review!) Because there's a lot to like - I'm not being sarcastic here - yet there's simply too much jammed into the movie. I'm stating the obvious, seeing what other people wrote, but when you really want to love a movie and see it just coming in slightly above average, one hopes the criticisms will add up, thus keeping producers, studio heads, et.al., from being too ""commercially ambitious."" Attacking the thinness and rushed pace is easy. Mentioning that it's a disappointment when you expected more is a given. Instead, let's look at what makes us love this movie, warts and all. There are still moments of characterization here that makes it more deep than a simple summer popcorn movie. For example, the complicated relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and the important people in his life. Harry (James Franco, much underrated) and MJ (Kirsten Dunst, more than just a pretty face) get a lot of screen time here and none of it is wasted. Harry blaming Peter for Norman's death isn't repetitive, it's refreshed anew by bringing in the traumatic amnesia that plagued the Goblin characters in the comic book (a good, not overstated, nod to comic continuity). Harry's ultimate fate has that much more poignancy when it's played out because of this. The shoe being on the other foot in Peter's relationship with MJ was also a tad interesting, because it complicates things and that's always good for a romance that will be played out in a franchise. It also tends to display how different Peter and MJ are - when Peter's life is going down the tubes, he internalizes it. MJ however lashes out at Peter whan she loses her role on Broadway. Thus the issue arises - IS MJ ""perfect?"" Nope. She can be self-centered too. A conflicted villain is also interesting, which is why I rather liked Thomas Hayden Church's Flint Marko/Sandman. We see a guy just trying to make money to save his daughter. Being made into a silicon-based lifeform adds just enough of the spice to make him tough and tender. He may be a crook, but he's being a crook (now) for the right reasons. That they didn't split up the villains for two movies - giving both of them their due - is more of the shame looking at Church's take on Sandman. Topher Grace also deserved more as he was giving a good sociopathic charm to Eddie Brock BEFORE he became Venom. At first, he's merely Peter's cheerfully obnoxious rival at the Daily Bugle. However, we see hints of his delusional nature with how he inflates a ""coffee"" with Gwen Stacy (sorry I can't remember the actress' name right now, and that's another issue with too much in here - the new people don't have much time to shine) into a ""fantastic night."" But the problem here is HIS story is a bit too rushed. Wasn't it possible to have just the Symbiotic Thing that Venom becomes with Eddie play an (interestingly) understated villain in making Peter ""bad"" in this movie, paving the way for an expanded, and thus much better, fourth movie? Ah, but I'm being drawn into the negatives again. While we're on that subject, I certainly hope there wasn't a real effort to rewrite Uncle Ben's death. I hope not - Flint's flashback of the evening is left, I think deliberately vague, - because it'd be really too weak. The point overall is that ""Spider-Man 3"" is rather entertaining and really worth the buying. But oh, what could've been....."
"brando647","6","0","1","21 September 2008"," What happened?! How did the franchise fall so far?!
","The first Spider-Man film was great fun and ground-breaking in the world of superhero films for Marvel. The second film is still one of my favorite comic book adaptations. So, how do we go from two awesome films to this?! I was beyond disappointed by the third film in the Spider-Man franchise, and I realize I'm not the only one. In this installment, life is finally going well for Peter Parker...Spider-Man is a celebrity in New York City, he's doing well in school, and he's ready to propose to Mary Jane Watson. Everything begins to fall apart when Harry (who is now aware of Peter's alter ego) becomes the ""New Goblin"" to destroy Spider-Man, Mary Jane's career begins a downward spiral, and the police admit to Peter that the man who really killed his uncle has escaped from prison. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg. I realize that sounds like a lot to fit into a single film, and it IS.<br/><br/>One of the most admirable aspects of Raimi's Spider-Man films is his ability to balance story with action. A lot of superhero films tend to lean towards one over the other but Raimi had managed to find the perfect balance between the two. Somewhere between the second and third film, he lost the ability. The movie feels as if it's all exposition, with a few action sequences thrown in. Granted, the action sequences in the film are amazing, just as they'd been in the first two. It just feels as if it's forever between them. As for the exposition, it wouldn't be so bad if Raimi wasn't trying to fit so much story into a single film; I personally feel this movie would've been better if split into two parts. There are at least two love triangles, three villains, the black suit/symbiote, the introduction of a handful of new characters...the list goes on. As a result, each of these aspects feels under-developed and some even feel wasted (Poor Venom...). Bouncing around between so many subplots gives the movie a disjointed feeling throughout.<br/><br/>In addition to the story problems, we get a movie filled with some ""what in the world were they thinking?"" moments. I'm sure you've heard about these moments in countless other discussions of the movie: the symbiote giving Peter Parker an emo/goth-style, the Peter Parker jazz club dance scene (second only to Reed Richards' dance number in the Fantastic 4 sequel when it comes to embarrassing moments in Marvel films), the decision to create the New Goblin's style along the lines of an extreme ninja snowboarder, the decision to use the Venom character (one of THE most popular comic characters/villains) for a mere 40 minutes of the movie, and the Sandman/Spider-Man therapy session. With all of these problems combined, it's easy to see why so many people were disillusioned with the latest film. Has Sam Raimi lost touch with the franchise? I seriously hope not.<br/><br/>All of the key players return for the newest film, though I find myself losing faith in them. Tobey Maguire gives his usual great performance in the title role. Kirsten Dunst did the best she could with terrible writing; honestly, Mary Jane had become seriously unlikable in this film due to what I perceived as incredible jealousy against Parker/Spider-Man's newfound fame. James Franco has done well as Harry Osborn in the previous films but this time, I've come to a realization. The man cannot play a villain. He's far from threatening and comes off as a fool in some scenes. His attempts to be sadistic or evil as the New Goblin fall flat (with the exception of the fight scenes). Of all the returning performances in the movie, I think the only ones that didn't degenerate were those of Maguire, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons (who's a riot, as always). The film introduces a handful of new characters to the franchise as well, and most turned out well with what little screen time was given. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace were great additions to the cast and I hope to see more of them in the future (well, at least of Church...). Bryce Dallas Howard debuts the character of Gwen Stacy; she did great, but I felt it was sort of late to be bringing in her character from the comics.<br/><br/>To make it simple: the third Spider-Man film has it's entertaining moments, but they're scattered through the nearly 2.5 hour runtime. The CGI has continued to evolve and the fight scenes are only getting better. I'm just hoping that this cluttered mess of a film was just a result of Raimi's uncertainty over whether the franchise will continue urging him to fit in as much as possible before it possibly ends. Maybe this was just a fluke and future installments will return to the glory of the first two films."

","When I saw that the villain Venom would make his appearance in this film, I could hardly wait to see it, because I remember how I used to read the magazines with him in them to pieces as a child. The overall story is more or less just a continuation of the previous ones, Peter Parker (Spiderman) and Mary Jane (Mary Jane) are about to take their now rather close relationship to the next level, and the future looks bright. Harry (James Franco) and Peter have become alienated, and are hardly on speaking terms anymore, after the unfortunate demise of Harry's father (Green Goblin) more or less by the hands of Spider-Man. Introduce two new villains, Sandman, a ""bad guy"" that probably is ""good"" but just very unlucky, and a parasitical thing from outer space that multiplies any bad sides in its potential hosts by a hundred, and you've got yourself Spider-Man 3! The special effects are, as always in this series, simply amazing, and they have truly taken it up a notch in this one. The story is also quite entertaining and well written, but there are sadly so many negative sides to this film that it really suffers from it. First of all, all the ""Go America!"" stuff in this film is just so overwhelming that I'm willing to bet one of my eyes that 99 % of all non-Americans (and hopefully a high percentage of Americans as well!) just feel embarrassed and sick to the bone from all this silliness. Another thing is that they overdo the whole ""Ooo look at us, we're from New York, we're so multiracial and everything is so fine here."" I recognize that they take their money from certain sources to make these films, but come on, tone it down a little at least. Also, the number of cheap jokes and cheesiness is just too much, it feels artificial and at a certain bar-scene (you'll know it when you see it), I was about a second away from turning the whole thing off. Granted, I'm probably a bit older and perhaps a bit more cultivated, intelligent or whatever than the target audience, but I do enjoy a lot of the Marvel universe, so I guess that entitles me to an opinion. The film is simply too long for it's own good, not that I feel its ""boring"", but in all honesty there's a limit to how many times seeing Parker swing himself across a street can hold anyone's attention. They should perhaps have had one less bad guy, 3 in one movie with separate fates is a bit much, and if it was up to me, they would have had a lot more of Venom in it than the last ten minutes or so. Quite a letdown. All in all, I recommend this film for those that have enjoyed the previous ones, and it is great entertainment for the effects alone, but it seems to me that either the customers have become dumber or they have lowered the age of the ideal customer. 3,5 stars."

","Tobey Maguire acting like he's too cool for school for 20 minutes just is unnatural and wrong in this movie which is what lowers the rating for me. I can understand him going around and maybe doing uncharacteristic things like pushing and shoving people or so kind of aggressive behavior, but acting like he's Mel Gibson in ""What Women Want"" just doesn't work. They should have had Tobey continue being the mostly nerdy guy that works for him and just add some extra aggression, not try and turn him into the Alpha-Male.

","I never found Spider-man's overall handling by Sam Raimi appealing. All I know from my understanding of the spider-man cartoons and comics is that Peter Parker was suppose to be a tough guy. He had a troubled past. No parents, a dead uncle whose death was in some sense caused by he himself. And to me, it is plain obvious that such a man cannot be expected to be too weak. When life is hard on you, the end product is either a psycho or a man who is controlled and quietened. <br/><br/>I found this kind of a focus in Parker's character as portrayed in the earliest of Spider-man literature. And what do I get here? Someone who can cry! Someone who can lose his senses so much that he allows a chick to kiss him in public knowing very well that his jealous girlfriend is watching out there. Please give me a break! And why? Why does Spidey 3 have to throw in so many characters at once? Why the Venom, New Goblin and the Sandman all in one package? Why does the story of the Sandman have to be made believe to be complex and the Venom have to be so crazy in its origin? Is there some kind of a rule which says that a movie is better if it contains maximum number of elements in it? If no, then why does Spider-man have to accommodate so many characters, have the ever-growing crap of MJ being jealous and so on? <br/><br/>In case you are not getting my point, all I want to say is that the movie should have taken a decent plot and worked on it rather than interweaving so many sub-plots that simply cannot be inter-woven! Sam Raimi sticks to his formula of making Peter Parker look too sympathetic. MJ is made jealous! Why? So that you can sympathize with Peter? I am sorry but that just does not seem to work over here. I don't feel sorry for Peter because of MJ. I only feel like hating MJ. And then what more? You let Venom pollute the head of Spider-man so that he can actually ruffle his hair and dance in the streets winking and gesturing at the pretty ladies. What is that suppose to do? Make us feel bad for Mary Jane and say, ""No, she is not so bad - poor girl!""? What is the meaning of showing a Church and some freak praying for the death of Spider-man and immediately being sent the Venom? I wonder why the religious groups could not see something controversial about that! <br/><br/>All in all, I would like to say that the plot of the movie is poor. You don't have to make a movie just because the previous two have been successful. In fact,the success of the sequel has to pressurize you to think hard. And sad it is for me to say this but the only thing good about this movie are graphics. I finally found something like fighting in this movie. The graphics were well done. But the plot overshadowed this."

Its clear that they had to pull the rush job since none of the principal filmmakers or actors were under contract after the third film; The result was this dreck. There was also no need to have Harry Osborn in this flick either, the guy is flying around in a souped up skateboard for crying out loud.

I know I'm sort of beating the dead horse, but sometimes you've got to let it out.<br/><br/>First off, they tried to do WAY too much with SM3. Particularly the villains plot bit. Harry, Venom, AND the Sandman all in one movie?! Sorry, folks, but it's not gonna work. If you ask me, I think that they should have gotten rid of Venom (though Eddie Brock was good). He is so obviously just THERE all of a sudden that it makes me sick. Save Venom for number 4 or 5 or make him the ONLY villain, which isn't gonna happen when you introduce him about 15 or 20 minutes before the end of the movie! And Sandman! He really could have been made interesting, but the movie was divided into SO many characters and SO little time, that he never really gets anywhere. It seems like they started with a good idea with his daughter, but then just let it die. I know this is just another re-make idea of millions of others, but I'm going to say it anyway: I think they should keep Sandman and Harry. Harry using M.J. against Peter was actually alright. James Franco actually seemed like a bad guy (though maybe that's just because he can't act very well) and you really didn't like him too much. Keep that and the Sandman's daughter, then have Sandman wreak havoc for his kid and that, in turn, forces Harry to join Spidey to stop Sandman. Sandman kills Harry, and Spidey forgives him for that and Uncle Ben's. Sandman then leaves like he did. (I know that sort of leaves Sandman hanging but he could easily be brought back and bumped off in number 4.) Maybe developing all that well would make for another half-hour of run time, but I doubt any of us would be bothered by that if the movie worked.<br/><br/>Next, Spidey himself. My big complaint: WHAT THE **** IS UP WITH THE BLACK GOOEY STUFF?!?! Isn't it painfully obvious how much that ruins the plot?! If you put it in there, everyone says, ""Spidey's gone bad! Oh no! Let's blame it on the black gooey stuff!"" But remove it, and you have to start questioning Spider-Man's will, and whether he's really strong enough to resist revenge. (I like the black suit though. Keeping that and saying his emotions caused it probably could be passed off.) Last, the acting. What can I say? Everyone was Mary dang Poppins in the first two: ""Practically perfect in every way."" Willem Dafoe: Great schizophrenic. Alfred Molina? Also a wonderful villain. Uncle Ben and Aunt May? Great! In # 3, I think the only one who does as well as they did before is J.K Simmons. (Even Rosemary Harris didn't do quite as well as before.) And Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst? I almost threw up.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an alright film, but it had the potential to be the best of the Spider-Man's, and it came out the worst. Why is it that so many great movie series fail at number 3? The Godfather, The Terminator, and of course, Spider-Man, were all brilliant in the first two, then failed and died on the threshold of a wonderful number 3. To me, it's a mystery. I hope and pray that someone, somewhere, will solve it."

The Black Spidey thing especially, which was very cool, all those scenes where Maguire is struttin' it, those worked for me. And Thomas Haden Church brought humanity in spades to the Sandman, plus James Franco was very believable and charming.

","Sam Raimi reinvented the superhero movie with his brilliant Spiderman film and its equally impressive sequel. Can he repeat the magic a third time? Sad to say, Spiderman 3 is a somewhat confused end to the trilogy. Too heavily reliant on CGI, it feels disjointed, moving from action set piece to discussions about the nature of the superhero to Peter's arguments with his girlfriend with little to apparently link them. The inevitable bad guys appear and disappear again for no particular reason, and the result is a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>The lot of the modern superhero is not an easy one. Not only does he have to save the world three times a day, but he has to battle with his psychological motivations, girlfriend trouble and his own personal demons. This time round Spiderman has three villains to contend with, some alien goo which brings out his dark side, and on top of this his relationship's in trouble. Tobey Maguire's geekiness has always grated but he is so pathetic as Peter you just want to shake him. And the sequence where 'bad boy' Peter enjoys his new self- yes, I know it's supposed to be a joke, but I'm afraid it's just risible. Kirsten Dunst does a good job as MJ but she doesn't have the greatest presence, and none of the villains are powerful enough to fill the screen.<br/><br/>That is not to say there aren't good ideas. Raimi's films always look fantastic, and Spidey 3 is no exception. There is at least one interesting idea- how does the superhero keep his ego in check when faced with his adoring fans- but it is quickly forgotten in the rush to the next computer animated set piece. Once again, the girlfriend's main role is as bait for the villain to lure Spider-man to save her- feminism lives! The tame ending left me wishing for the good old days when superheroes turned up, beat up the bad guys and went home without so much as a moment's doubt in their heads.<br/><br/>Still, millions of people love it, and I'm sure this is not the last we've heard of old Spidey. Next time, I hope someone has the guts to give us an old-fashioned superhero flick and leave the psychology at home."

Parker's neighbor: infatuated, super-servile freak. Parker's girlfriend: utterly nauseating wishy-washy milky plump mother-figure wannabe type-of-thing who changes her love interests at the drop of a dime, as one might say.

","Spider-Man 3 is the third installment of the series featuring everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. However, this film was a little disappointing than the first two. The plot seemed to be all over the place with too many plots which were never resolved by the film's end. Peter's ego seems to have got the better of him and he is now taking the whole superhero thing in his stride. He is in love with Mary Jane, but their relationship begins to be abused by Peter, even when he is going to propose to MJ. Harry is all vengeance seeking and becomes the second Green Goblin, although his role is limited to that, as he is knocked into a coma briefly, loses his memory and reverts to his first films role before going back into revenge mode.<br/><br/>The movie's villains are disappointing too. Sandman was the best by far, the sand effects were stunning and unbelievable. I applaud the filmmakers for doing such a brilliant job. Sandman's role in the film has him as being the actual killer of Uncle Ben although it was an accident and now he is trying to get money to help his daughter stay alive. Green Goblin, cruedly named the ""New Goblin"", is there just for action and CGI scenes. The biggest letdown was Venom/Eddie Brock. They got everything right about him until he became Venom. Venom was introduced to late into the film and had only about fifteen minutes on screen before blowing himself up. In the comics, cartoons and games, Venom is a rather evil villain with a good sense of humour but in the movie, he keeps returning to Eddie's form and pathetically mocking Spider-Man. His humour is particularly terrible:<br/><br/>""Hey, Parker. My spider sense is tingling, if you know what I'm talking about!""<br/><br/>What does he mean if he knows what he's talking about? SPIDER-MAN INVENTED THE PHRASE YOU IDIOT! <br/><br/>Oh, and Peter's emo phase was rather embarrassing for him. All the emo-like people I know do not act like idiots, dancing down streets and pointing at every girl he sees. Gwen Stacey's role was rather pointless and limited, acting just as a damsel in distress. And MJ was damsel in distress once again and all she did to escape was too drop a concrete block on Venom's head. However, Harry's ending was marvellous. I do hope in Spider-Man 4, they improve their efforts. Potential villains for the next films include the Lizard, Kraven the Hunter, Vulture and Electro, so hopefully the film will be better."

The first appearance of the sand man is pretty impressive. The action scenes are lively. There's also a cute bit when Peter turns into a smarmy egotist (over all the dual personality thing was less Jekyll & Hyde than it was The Nutty Professor).<br/><br/>The rest of it is all terrible, tedious drawn out dramatic scenes detailing Peter Parker's soap opera-ish troubles. And like the first movie, the script completely falls apart in the end, with some really ludicrous contrivances.<br/><br/>It's a super-hero movie with some good fights, and if you let your brain go blank that's all you need, but it is in no way good movie making."
"Red_Flag","4","0","1","8 June 2008"," I'm so sorry spidey, this just didn't work.
","Spider-man 2 is still the finest thing to come out of Marvel. It's a dazzling achievement in action cinema. That never takes itself too seriously and, though I may have reconsidered at times is, is fully deserving of its five star review. This and the fact that Part cone was a very good film means it's so excruciatingly painful for me to give this film a bad review.<br/><br/>But a critics gotta do what a critics gotta do. It's a pretty lousy film focusing solely on the development of Parker and MJ which is far more irritating than you'd expect. Naturally spider-man 3 looks amazing. Its stunningly well made. But like many of 2007's outing it's a hollow attraction. Spidey 3 is neither as dark or as important as the trailers make it seem. Its merely a series of events with no purpose and much like Shrek the third suffers massively in comparison to its predecessors. Really spider-man 3 is just action packed nonsense that will leave the eyes dazzled but the heart 8unmoved and won't have you reaching into your wallet any time soon.<br/><br/>Your friendly neighbourhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director Sam Ramie's Spider-Man saga. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two instalments, with Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard making their first appearances in the series as Flint Marko (aka Sandman), Eddie Brock (aka Venom), and Gwen Stacy, respectively. Peter Parker (Maguire) has finally learned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs, and the man that Mary Jane (Dunst) loves. All is well in New York City until one night, as Peter and M.J. set gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by.<br/><br/>But this isn't any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape-shifting symbiotic with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. Later, as Harry Osborn acquires his late father's flying board, engineers a powerful new Goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad's death, the mysterious space sludge infects both Peter's Spider Man suit and ambitious street photographer Eddie Brock (Grace). His strange new suit giving him a newfound sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, Peter discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Unfortunately for Peter, Marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded Sandman.<br/><br/>The citizens of New York City must once again call on Spider Man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man.<br/><br/>In all Spider-Man 3 is far more of a chore than a film, forgetting the simplistic beauty of the first and adding so many webs it's hard not to get tangled. The best advice I could give you is not to expect Spider-Man 2 you'll only be disappointed."

","*Warning, spoilers ahead* This one was something of a shock. Of all the disappointments to come from my cinema trips in recent years, this was one of the worst, another sad case in a continuing trend of the assumption that multi-million pound special effects are enough to carry a movie. The sensation of total disenchantment was partially fuelled by the lofty regard with which I held the first two movies. Comic book films had largely been a disappointment to me until those films came along, complete with sharp, witty scripting, fabulous special effects and characters you wanted to see fail or succeed. However, my opinion is also fuelled by the fact that Spiderman 3 is complete garbage.<br/><br/>We'll get the special effects out of the way first, as this film would have easily received the lowest rating possible without them. The vast sums of money ploughed into this department really shine through, rendering Spidey and his ensemble of villains more pleasing on the eye than in previous films, and the action sequences are lined with several smart touches. However, the exceptional J. Jonah Jameson aside, all other aspects of this film are far less than pleasing.<br/><br/>The script is appalling. Seriously, if I walked into a primary school and a teacher informed me a precocious six year old had penned it, I would have no reason to doubt them. It's sickeningly pretentious, and often condescending towards the viewer, something the previous instalments never were. We're treated to such Oscar winning gems as 'Oh, and I fear one more blow may be enough to kill Spiderman' Like she would know Spiderman's pain threshold, if she did, like she could see from down there, and besides that it's a shocking line! Her obscenely stereotypical ""English"" accent paints us all as tea-sipping nancy boys; for the sake of a few lines, would hiring somebody that is actually English be so difficult? This closely follows the laughable scene where Spiderman drops in front of a proudly billowing American flag to the triumphant fanfare of a 'true hero'. While I'm sure this scene was devised to stir and inspire audiences in the USA, I wasn't the only person laughing awkwardly at this contempt inducing, cringe-worthy moment.<br/><br/>Ridiculous plot devices include Harry's butler deciding that, (helpfully) post the millionaire playboy having his face blown off the other side of his head courtesy of his arch-nemesis, he would reveal in fact it was not Spiderman that killed his father, Norman Osborne.<br/><br/>'I tended to his wound that evening. It was indeed made by his own glider.' For the love of Jeff and you waited all this time to say so, why?! Obviously this humble house butler utilised his degree in forensic science to deliver that unshakably sound conclusion. How could he possibly have known for sure? Was the glider still sticking out of his stomach?! And if I were to play devil's advocate, could Spiderman have not feasibly thrown Green Goblin onto the spike, or vice versa? This absurd turn of events leads to Harry having an epiphany of biblical proportions, and immediately hops upon his glider to rescue his good ol' buddy Pete. Their trade-off of friendly banter in the final few scenes makes a complete mockery of the excellent construction of the love-hate chemistry between the pair in the previous film.<br/><br/>I'm not a massive fan of the comics, but from what I can tell, Venom is supposed to be something of a bad-a$$. In this film, he was portrayed as totally pointless, and one of the lamest screen villains ever. Seriously, you're borrowing from a comic, all the work has been done! How could they mess it up so badly? As for Sandman a mentally unstable, monumentally powerful individual who Peter Parker allows to escape at the end of the film so he can show all those kiddies watching that forgiveness is in us all, no matter what. If Spidey had whooped him from Manhattan to Brooklyn, showing that despite being freed from the influence of the parasite the natural darkness within him still yearned for revenge, it would have shown us a darker side of a superhero not often explored. Instead, we have that pretentious candy-cane finale, and by this time should we really have expected more? Hopefully the creators of this abomination will take note of the rejuvenation of the Batman franchise, a return to the days when special effects complement a script, and not the other way around."

Tobey Maguire is okay in the main role however he looks silly when asked to turn on the attitude once the Venom suit gets a hold of him.

","I watched this film a second time this evening, and am just as dismayed by it as when I watched it in the theater. The film starts off great, but just sort of becomes unwieldy towards the end. One can almost tell when the film takes a turn for the worse.<br/><br/>The appearance of the ooze didn't seem to make much sense in the context of the film. Okay, I know that it was supposed to create a doppleganger effect with Peter, but at least they could have done it consistently. In the comics, the suit had a mind of its own, and that really wasn't fleshed out here until the suit attaches itself to Eddie Brock. In the movie, it was almost like Peter had a black suit fetish and turned bad because of it, versus the suit exerting its will on the host. This should have been made more clear in the film. It also would have warranted more sympathy for Peter if the film performed this differently. As it is, Peter is just someone pretending to be bad with a suit fetish.<br/><br/>This inconsistency among others (the general lack of spider sense throughout the film, for example) is what took me out of the film. I'm not against adding villains if it means that it enhances the drama, but in this case, adding the villains didn't do much but overwhelm the film to the point where it's almost incomprehensible. I find the last hour of the film almost unwatchable because of this.<br/><br/>The next Spider-man film will no doubtedly have Marvel Studios in full control. I wish they would do what they did to the Hulk, and pretend the Venom never existed in this one. A Venom reboot, if you will. I truly believe that if you dedicate your movie to just that one character alone as the villain, it will have more dramatic gravitas than all three villains have garnered in this film combined. Make it so, Marvel!"

","I love Spider-Man. He's probably one of the greatest comic heroes in history. The first two films were absolutely amazing. Great pieces of film work. However, Spider-Man 3 fell very short of those standards. I did like it, but I didn't LOVE it as I felt about the first two films. I will first bring up some of the pros, and then the cons.<br/><br/>PROS: Topher Grace was really surprising as Venom. I liked his portrayal of the character, but he was way under-used. I think he should have been the main villain of the film.<br/><br/>The visual effects were the best in the series, except for the cartoony crane scene. Venom looked great, Sandman was cool, and the fight sequences are excellent.<br/><br/>CONS: Tobey Maguire wasn't very good in this film. I liked the way he portrayed red Spider-Man, but once the black suit comes on... he sucks. He just wasn't good at being bad. Oh, and the crying. Come on! And the dancing! What is up with that?<br/><br/>The multiple story lines kept it hard to focus on one thing. In Spider-Man 2, if was perfectly focused. Peter and MJ's relationship, Peter and Harry's relationship, and Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus's relationship. That was it! In this one you get Peter and MJ's relationship, Harry's amnesia, the black suit, problems at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy, Venom, New Goblin, and Sandman. It was just too much for the audience to get in one sitting! My advice would have been to leave out Sandman, Gwen, the amnesia thing, and MJ's whole play thing. It was too much of a serious romance movie rather that a super-hero action thriller.<br/><br/>Venom should have lived. He is my absolute favorite villain in all of Spider-Man's rogue gallery, and he's killed within fifteen minutes after his appearance. He's way too under used and should have been held as a cliffhanger for Spider-Man 4, along with Harry Osborn His part as New Goblin is way too hidden behind Sandman and the romancy garbage that has absolutely no place in a super hero action movie of the summer blockbuster sorts. Sandman looked bad in some of the scenes. At the end, he's that freakin' King Kong of Sand, and I hated that.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an okay entry in the films of Spider-Man, but I don't think it was good enough. I do hope the original cast returns, and that Spider-Man 4 is superior to this inferior film. I did hear of an interview featuring an unnamed actor saying his character appears to die in this film but actually survives somehow. Personally, I hope it's Eddie Brock, but only time will tell. Please don't make it be Harry, don't go all ""One More Day"" on us. He's dead, it's done. I'd bet money Venom's returning. I'm holding out for Spider-Man 4 to fix this slight mess of a film. However, the effects do aid the movie to my liking."

This movie has all the ingredients to be super bad, but is nicely candy coated with special effects and Spidey image that let it slide up a few notches. The plot was so thick I felt like someone was hitting me over the head with the fat script even at the onset of the movie. Does the movie industry really have such a low opinion of our IQs? The movie does not earn the category of action movie because it is loaded with the melodrama of the relationship of Spidey and MJ. If this wasn't bad enough, they also had to top it all off with a good portion of morale. And, my latest pet peeve, the Americanism; a quick shot of Spidey in front of the American flag and the all American music choice even makes the American in me cringe. Is he really the all American hero? To finish my review, I have to mention the strangest concept in the movie. Even though Spiderman and Venom both wear masks, the makers found 101 creative ways to make them both remove their masks for 95% of the movie. Venom unmasks, not once, but twice just to do a chat with our super hero instead of just attempting to kill him. Apparently, no one is interested in Spidey's identity because even when he lands on the ground, not a soul of the thousands of viewers seems to have a zoom camera.

","I love the first two Spider-Man films, and was looking forward to this with great anticipation. But I won't deny that I was disappointed.<br/><br/>This is mostly down to the fact that the director, Sam Raimi, tries to cram too much into the movie's running time. The rumours about how this may be his last time behind the camera for the Spider-Man franchise explains why he may have done this, but it still doesn't stop his eagerness from nearly derailing the movie. Raimi's abundance of sub plots can also make some parts of the film feel underwhelming. <br/><br/>For example, the first two villains, James Franco's New Goblin and Thomas Haden Church's Sandman are complex, deadly and human. This is due to superb dedication from the writers, Raimi and the actors. However, the most anticipated of Spider-Man's opponents, Topher Grace's Venom, comes across as little more than an afterthought. Grace does all that he can with his role, but Raimi's disdain for the character is evident. <br/><br/>There are other hit-and-miss elements in the film. For example, whilst the script manages to retain a tremendous amount of the clever and natural writing and superb characterisation from the first two films, there are some moments where the dialogue seems to slip into melodrama too easily. These moments sometimes clash with the rest of the film, which makes them easier to make out.<br/><br/>However, despite all of its faults, SM3 is still a thrilling and intelligent action movie. The action sequences are all exceptionally staged, with one sequence involving Peter Parker AKA Spider-Man and the New Goblin in a mid-air battle over NYC especially jaw-dropping. There is also another gritty confrontation between the two aforementioned opponents which shows that Hollywood doesn't always have to rely on an overload of special effects to construct a terrific action sequence. <br/><br/>The acting is brilliant on all accounts. Tobey Maguire is perfect in the role of Peter Parker, constructing a human character that we can relate to and also immensely enjoying the introduction of Parker's new-found dark side. Raimi allows us to sympathise with Parker, and to laugh with or at him (the sequence in which he attempts to imitate John Travolta is hilarious), and Maguire has settled into the role nicely. Parker is a human being under the costume, and both Raimi and Maguire realise this and utilise it. As Mary Jane Watson, Kirsten Dunst crafts a beautiful, caring and flawed character, allowing us to care for her throughout the course of the story. The relationship between Parker and Watson is played out beautifully by the two actors, with scenes such as the confrontation in Central Park unfolding exceptionally well. It is a testament to the tremendous skills of Maguire, Dunst and Raimi that this relationship isn't rose-tinted, but that it is passionate, uncertain and all the more powerful because of its realistic approach. <br/><br/>James Franco is charismatic and complex as Spider-Man's most personal foe. The New Goblin may want to kill Spider-Man, but it is for a seemingly good reason. Franco explores these dark shades of his character with relish, without ever allowing his character to slip into the role of a predictable villain. Thomas Haden Church also creates a sympathetic and human villain in the Sandman. The moment when he struggles to come to terms with his new powers is one of the most powerful moments in the film, and is deeply moving and stunningly orchestrated. Of course, half of the making of the Sandman character comes from the visual effects, which are all used brilliantly to portray this monstrous beast. But Church still deserves the majority of the credit for creating a character full of heart and soul, which wouldn't have been realised by visual effects alone. Notable support is given by Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and a brilliant Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, and J.K. Simmons seems to be thoroughly enjoying himself in his small role as newspaper editor J Jonah Jameson. He provides the majority of the film's comedy, along with witty writing and a terrific cameo by Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as a hilarious French waiter. <br/><br/>Visually, the movie is exceptional. Despite some flaws (sometimes the face of a character looks animated etc), the jaw-dropping quality of the visual effects on display is undeniable. The phenomenal action set-pieces in this film wouldn't have been anywhere near as gripping as they turned out to be without the terrific visual effects at hand to aid the illusion. Raimi and co. also use the visual effects to dramatically enhance the impact that some of the characters have on the audience. Aside from the incredible scene of Sandman's ""birth"", there is a genuinely scary and gripping scene in which Topher Grace's Eddie Brock first transforms into Venom. Despite a level of convenience which is involved, the sequence is still terrifically crafted, and is Venom's most memorable moment on screen. <br/><br/>Handling the whole affair is Raimi. He does tend to go overboard at certain moments, but his direction still shows that he is dedicated to the project. As well as this, his background as a fan of the Spider-Man comics tends to have more of a positive impact than a negative one. He directs with an understanding of Peter Parker, and ensures that there is humanity residing beneath the special effects and heroism. Apart from Venom, he also crafts the supporting characters in a sophisticated, caring and powerful way, and constructs most of the sub plots with beautiful confidence and craftsmanship. <br/><br/>The first two films weren't flawless, but whatever flaws they did have were easy to overlook. Here, the flaws are more noticeable, and that is what drags this film's quality down below that of its predecessors. However, it is still immensely entertaining, and boasts a humanity and care for its characters that most special effects orientated blockbusters wouldn't even dream of. So relax, and enjoy!"

","This movie made me want to find the writer and give him a swift yet uniquely painful death. anyone who would seek to diminish the integrity of this great series should be quickly removed from this life and their eyebrows should also be plucked out one by one. The acting went far beyond the realms of terrible and i would easily categorize this movie with the likes of the first incredible hulk. the cinematography and the special effects were definitely compelling and fun to watch, but to be honest it would have been equally entertaining and less time consuming to just get high and light fireworks. the plot, well hate to put in any spoilers, but a lynch pin event in the plot of this ACTION movie was when the green goblin's butler told him he loved him. don't even get me started on the emo spider man bs because i will probably start vomiting uncontrollably and not be able to finish this out. damn even mentioning it did the trick and i think i have to stop, just don't see the movie unless you have already lost all faith in humanity."

","After watching this mess of a Spiderman movie, the first thing that popped into my head was ""where was the editor?"". This is a mess of a movie. Too many characters, too many story lines, and extraneous story lines. The ""dark"" Spiderman personality and storyline was laughable in a bad way. Dialog during many of the fight scenes sound as written by 4th graders. I guess this is what happens when a comic book series turned movie begins to grow stale - like the original Batman series. The writers and movie-makers needed to do some serious story editing and trimming. At least 45 min could've been trimmed starting with 20 min of Tobey McGuire doing a bad Mick Jagger impersonation as his supposedly altered-self. Did not and would not pay to see this unfocused overlong attempt. Back to the drawing board."

","As I sit here writing this, there are 1,783 user comments for Spider-Man 3 on IMDb. So what can I possibly have to say that would be new or different? Well, probably nothing. But reading some of the posted comments, I have to laugh to myself. Why is it that people seem to feel the need to rate everything either a 1/10 or a 10/10? I don't get it. Is Spider-Man 3 worthy of a 1/10 rating? Is it really one of the worst movies ever made? Is it as wretched as some of the truly notorious stinkers like Manos: Hands of Fate or Hobgoblins? No. If you sincerely consider Spider-Man 3 one of the worst movies ever made, then you haven't seen enough movies. Likewise, is Spider-Man 3 worthy of a 10/10 rating? Is it really one of the best movies ever made? Again, the answer is no. And once again, if you sincerely consider Spider-Man 3 one of the best movies ever made, then you haven't seen enough movies. Like I said, I just don't get it. Why the need for such extremes? What's wrong with thinking something is merely average? <br/><br/>(Okay, I'll get off the soapbox for the rest of this.)<br/><br/>For me, while I found Spider-Man 3 an entertaining enough time-waster, it's got far too many problems for me to call it great. I found the action sequences and special effects very well done. Watching Spidey take a pounding from the Sandman near the end of the movie was brutal. Also, I've never been wrapped up in the whole Spiderman comic book scene, so I didn't have a problem with Venom the way some others do. Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace were excellent in their baddie roles. Finally, Bruce Campbell's cameo as the French maître d' was a scream. I loved it. But what didn't work so well for me was the plot. There's just too much going on in the movie and Sam Raimi tires too hard to wrap it all up in for a 2 hour movie. For example, with three bad guys to fight, did we really need the dull as dishwater subplot about Peter and MJ's on-again-off-again relationship? But I suppose they had to include it to give Kirsten Dunst something to do. Finally, Tobey Maguire is really bad. There's no way he could have ever pulled off playing the tough guy.<br/><br/>In the end, Spider-Man 3 is neither the worst movie I've seen nor is it the best. While I was generally entertained, the movie has too many problems for me to call it much more than slightly better than average. A 6/10 seems about right."

","I finally saw this movie, and it's six years in the making for both the trilogy and my reviews on the franchise itself.<br/><br/>This time Spider Man/Peter Parker has three times the trouble. Two bad guys on the loose including a dude who's filling in the shoes of the Green Goblin from the first movie, and an escaped convict who appears to be another trouble maker for Spider-Man. Not to mention the encounter with a black substance that seems to be an improvement for Spider-Man's powers but may also be the key to one of his other problems. That includes his decision on his daily life, career, girlfriend, and his future as Spider Man.<br/><br/>It has action, it has amazing special effects, and everything that was included from the previous two movies. As well as covering up some unanswered situations that were left unsolved in the previous installments.<br/><br/>The problem is I can't except this third installment to be any better than the first two. Which I already posted my comments on(check my reviews on Spider Man 1 & 2 for more info). Again I'm not obsess with the entire Spider Man universe. Which is one of the many reasons why this movie didn't meet my demands on what a second sequel should be like. Nothing really made me like it more than the first two. Probably because it still has too many out of situation scenes that just made my eyes rolled. As in obvious and ""what is he thinking?"" type of scenes. It just made me feel like I was watching Spider Man 1 or 2 again.<br/><br/>If the script was improved in a feel parts of it. Then I might accept it's brilliants. But in the end the whole Spider Man Trilogy isn't worthy of being own on DVD.<br/><br/>Not to offend the fans in anyway possible. I'm only giving my 5 cents of thought on the movie in general. I have nothing against the whole Spider Man series. It's just the live action movies could of been better made.<br/><br/>To come to an end, I only recommend this to any die-hard fan of the series or the Spider Man Movies in general. For those who read much more negative reviews than mine. Then rent it or borrow it in case you're not sure if it's worth owning on DVD."
"Benderbeast","5","0","1","16 March 2008"," Not as good as I had hoped.
","I really love the Spiderman franchise. Spidey 1 was great and spidey 2 was even better. So when they announced spiderman 3, I could barely wait. I was probably looking forward to this movie more than any others. And so was everyone else. I expected it to be completely awesome. But somewhere it fell short.<br/><br/>So the movie starts out pretty slow. Most movies have an action scene in the beginning to get you pumped up and then delve into the action. Not here, You get about 20 minutes of talking and then a 5 minute action scene, then another 30 minutes of talking. And another action scene. And even some of the action scenes where somewhat unimpressive, as if they had been thrown in there just to give you a break from all the drama. So the pacing of the movie was the biggest problem.<br/><br/>Another problem is sandman, He seemed like a pointless character and should have been thrown out so they could focus more on venom and new goblin. Because everyone just wanted to see venom, and in the end he was only given like 10 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Now all of the bad stuff aside. There were some good points. The special effects were spectacular and some of the action scenes where just amazing. And the ending was probably one of the coolest climaxes I have seen in any super hero movie. It's really a shame that they didn't give venom much screen time because they portrayed him perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall it was a decent movie on its own but It did not live up to the high expectations. If they had just cut some of the drama and put in more action it could have been so much better. For my rating I give it a 5/10"
"Rob4535","3","0","1","15 March 2008"," A disappointing possible end to what started out as a good series
","Spider-Man is probably my favorite superhero. The first two movies did a good job bringing elements of the comic books and the cartoon I watched as a kid in the 90s to the big screen. This installment though lacked a lot of the things that made the first two really good movies.<br/><br/>At first I thought the whole idea of Sandman and Harry Osborne(aka the new Green Goblin) with Venom thrown in as a surprise out to ruin our hero's life was a good idea for ending this series. However this idea suffers from the lack of character development and goes over the top. The change that Peter's goes through having the symbiote blend with him worked well in the comics but in this movie it feels forced. The change that Peter goes through in the second one deciding not to be Spider-Man and then deciding to go back when he was needed most worked much better. The whole emo Spider-Man thing didn't work well at all and came off as incredibly campy.<br/><br/>I felt like director Sam Raimi tried way too hard to do what he wanted to do and what the fans wanted to see with this one. He should have just left Sandman out because everyone and their mom wanted to see Venom in this one and could care less for Sandman. Peter's personality change could have still worked without the whole Sandman is the alleged killer of his uncle subplot.<br/><br/>Overall Spider-Man 3 despite all of these problems still has a few good qualities to it. The fight scenes are probably among the best in the series and Tobey Maguire still does a decent job playing Spider-Man. Even though this was a disappointing end to the series I hope they don't make anymore of these because it doesn't look like everyone involved in the first three want to do it anymore and I felt like the ending tied up all of the loose ends of the series."

","As we have seen in previous Marvel Comic based films that make it all the way to a trilogy (X-Men: The Last Stand and Blade: Trinity) Spiderman 3 holds true to the curse of the Marvel trilogies by ruining itself in it's storyline. We have Peter Parker, the man who saved the love of his life, and revealed his identity as Spiderman to his best friends in Spiderman 2. After watching the trailers over and over again, I felt as though this movie would be riveting, an edge of the seat, action packed, thrill ride that would keep me asking for more (that is what the previews said). But, instead I found myself watching Peter Parker dance to Sinatra-esquire lounge music and then watch him do the trademark emo hair flick. Alongside that, I found myself watching Spiderman battle as many villains as I had fingers on my hand. First came New Goblin, who vowed revenge for a father who hated him anyway, he was just too stuck up to notice it. And then we have Sandman, the runaway convict that managed to fall into an open nuclear reactor somewhere in the vicinity of New York City? And then the infamous symbiote comes into play and takes over Peter's body, where he finds himself in a battle with his emotions. Do you see where I'm going. This plot was rushed, the storyline farced. They lacked the ability to make good character development like in Spiderman 2, so they figured that they would add more villains in to fill the void. The storyline was too complex for any one movie. We had only 15 minutes of venom, when we should have had at least 30 to 45. This movie receives a 3/10 for the attempt to finish off a trilogy. One and a half stars for each of the amazing movies that proceeded this one, because if I could vote zero, I would."
"thegeneralJDE","4","0","1","2 March 2008"," Truly Awful
","Considering this movie has had a lot of hype about it, you can imagine the kind of expectations that moviegoers would have of it. Many have said that the distinction between comic book fans and movie fans often reveal two very different sides to films based on comic books, and this was perhaps the case in the two previous films. Unfortunately, this film was a let down for both types of audience member.<br/><br/>The film has good moments: J Jonah Jameson provides most of the comedy that is actually half-funny, and there are some truly good dramatic moments that occur within the first half hour.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film is terrible. The performances are near to painful on all parts, although you cannot blame them in some cases when you consider that most of the mise-en-scene is computer generated. The film is at the very least half an hour too long; there is one too many bad guys; too many back-plots and the cast is too big considering each of them is trying to get the same amount of screen time. There are also things the film really could do without, like the Stars and Stripes flying behind Spiderman as he swings to the rescue...again. Pro-American sentiment is seen too often in movies, and needs to be erased. There's also the extremely corny ending taking place at dawn, and the funeral scene that seems like its recycling the ending to Spiderman (1).<br/><br/>Yet another example that unplanned trilogies rarely work."
"e-bowen2","6","0","1","25 February 2008"," Runt of the litter, but not terrible.
","I remember when I first saw a trailer that showed Venom for the first time for this movie. As a Spidey fanboy, it made me very happy. It excited me as I knew this series was picking up speed. I expected to be blown away. What a got was a decent movie that did a little too much.<br/><br/>To start, the characters as always were good. Tobey plays Peter well, Franco is wonderful as Harry (okay as Goblin), and J.K. Simmons is just masterful as Jameson. Kirten Dunst has caught some crap for her role. I thought a lot of her. Unfortunately, I think her character helped stain this movie. She was paranoid and jealous. Not a terrible performance in my opinion, but something to sneer at a bit. I didn't like the idea of Topher grace as Eddie Brock, and I still don't, but from my perspective he didn't do a bad job. The attitude, personal grief and vengeful feelings toward Spider-Man were well displayed.<br/><br/>Another thing that I believe stained the movie was Peter's aggressive side. Some scenes in the movie truly brought out Peter's dark side manifested by the alien suit, such as the scene where Spidey confronted Sandman in the sewer. Otherwise, it was pretty lame with the dance moves and look/attitude of a common jerk, rather than an evil being.<br/><br/>They also tried to fit too much into one film. Venom should have been left to the next movie (as it appears there will be one) rather than slipped in and dealt with the way he was. Adding the Sandman and Goblin to the mix and you had a mess of emotions. I LOVED how the first two movies had the right amount of action AND drama (the second was masterful at that in my opinion), but there's was a little too much emotion in this movie for my taste (coming from a guy who loves deep, emotional movies).<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy was ruined from the start of the series and never should have made an appearance in my opinion, but she was included and I can deal with that.<br/><br/>But there are also good points. The action is very good, the movie does not fail to entertain, and there are some well represented events and characters, some doing justice to those in the comics. The portrayal of Sandman was a very touching one, and Thomas Haden Church did an excellent job. James Franco did a good job as well, although his psychotic nature (and voice) as the Goblin didn't QUITE live up to the history of the character.<br/><br/>Overall, there were faults that made this clearly the runt of the trilogy thus far, but the movie is still packed with enough action, special effects, emotion and suspense to keep the average Spidey fan (and moviegoer) happy. A solid film at least."
"stewiefan201","6","0","1","18 February 2008"," Spider Man 3 has beautiful special effects, but the storyline is jumbled and confused.
","Spider Man 3 continues the saga of the world of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). This time around he is having on and off relationship trouble with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and also has a load of villains and inner demons to face off with. The villains include Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who steals money to try and help his sick daughter, until he is transformed into an angry, powerful shape shifting sandman. Harry Osborn (James Franco) is hellbent on killing Peter for allegedly killing his father. Harry has turned himself into the New Goblin and tries to exact revenge, until he hits his head giving him amnesia and forgetting the whole thing for a short while. The real villain however lies within Peter after a black slimy entity from a meteorite turns his suit black. This alien entity is bringing out the dark angry side in Peter, and before long he realizes this and tries to take it off. However in that process he creates another villain out of his photography rival Eddie Brock Jr (Topher Grace), turning him into the dark and evil 3rd villain Venom. There are way too many other plot lines to explain so I'll try to get into them a little later.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3 has more than a boatload of great special effects, it has a cruise-ship full of them. The first fight scene between him and New Goblin is an amazing scene, and it looks brilliant and feels exhilarating. The scene where Sandman comes to life out of a sand molecule pit will go down as a landmark in CGI history. To put a long story short the effects are beautiful and the best out of all three films.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is somewhat mixed. Some of the actors such as Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire do a fine job, but they seem to be slightly stale and look as if they're just repeating themselves this time around. The actors playing the villains however seem to be very enthusiastic about their roles. Thomas Haden Church is not given a great amount of lines but still manages to give a good performance. Topher Grace does not have a good amount of screen time, but when he is on screen he manages to make something of his character Eddie. I thought he did a nice job as Venom, but three villains was just way too much, and Venom is only on screen for around 7 minutes. James Franco is without any doubt the best part of the whole movie. His acting is very strong and enthusiastic. The New Goblin looks very cool, and because Harry has the first two films as character development we can believe and understand his rage.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3's script is not terrible, but it is not good by any means. Not compared to the first two Spider Man films. The scenes involving the tension and battle between Harry and Peter are well scripted. Whereas the scene involving Peter's new love interest Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), and her dangling off a building edge with an out of control crane contains horrible dialogue. Gwen's father sees her dangling off the side of the destroyed building top, and without any horror or emotion simply asks ""What is she doing up there?"" I don't know if the dialogue in the crane scene was meant to be funny, and I don't care because it was just plain stupid. <br/><br/>There were a few more scenes with bad dialogue and emotion, but mostly it is the whole plot line that is not well thought out. Three villains is far too many for the movie. Venom is never truly menacing and he is only in the movie for around 7 minutes, which exposes the script's laziness and how overstuffed everything is. I also cannot comprehend why Flint Marko/Sandman has such a small amount of dialogue. Thomas Haden Church is a great actor and deserved to have a more drawn out character. Too many villains definitely made for a jumbled story. But then again I remember the Spider Man comic books packing way more than just three villains into one story, and everyone seemed to be fine with it that way. However it is not the villains that sink Spider Man 3. It is the fact that it promises you a dark evil side to Peter Parker, and all we get to see is his new Gothic look and dance methods. Why in the world Spider Man 3 does not take its storyline seriously is beyond me. Spider Man 3 should have exposed the threatening and violent side of Peter Parker. Instead we get completely random dance sequences, a black suit which we see very briefly, and Peter becoming a womanizer. The dance sequences are obviously the director Sam Raimi's style if you have ever seen his Evil Dead movies. But they do not belong in Spider Man.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3 was created with a 250 million dollar budget, arguably the most expensive movie ever made. The special effects are gorgeous but everything else is mostly shallow and way too silly. It is still entertaining from a special effects and fight scenes perspective. But I cannot deny the problems it has.<br/><br/>I could tell from the sloppy feeling of the movie that the makers just tried too hard to top the first two when they should have been taking their time to make another good sequel. Obviously they I give Spider Man 3 a 2.5 out of 4. If the directors and producers of this film were asked ""If you had to go to a deserted island and bring only one item, what would it be?"" They would not be able to make up their minds trying to choose over a black spidey suit, Venom, Sandman, Gwen Stacy, New Goblin e.t.c. They tried to pack way too much into Spider Man 3."

","The first movie was a great introduction to the character that is Spider-Man. Half kid, struggling with everyday aspects of his life like love and school, half superhero trying to save the world from the bad guys. How Spidey became the fighter for good and justice after he failed to take a stand and stop the man who later killed his uncle, is the core theme in movie no #1. Then there was the development of the Green Goblin, excellently portrayed by Willem Dafoe. There was a simple story line, easy to follow despite short stops along the way, depicting Peter Parker's love interests. The second movie was decent too; once again the film makers had grasped that what makes a good movie is a good villain, and Alfred Molina is a good Doc Ock. The stunning visual effects make his character come to life, and a series of action shots caused for high-class entertainment.<br/><br/>This one is all over the place. Is it an action movie or a romance? Is it about Peter and MJ or Peter and Ursula? Is it about Peter Parker's fight with his evil side, his fight with the Sandman or the follow-up of his encounter with the Goblin and his son Harry? Then there's his rival Brock, entering the movie as Venom when the movie is almost over. There are villains all over the place; the movie jumps from one plot to another and never goes below the surface. It's... shallow. Half the movie is about Peter, the other half is about his fight with various villains. Since you never get settled into any of the many threads, you are left wondering what this movie is all about. You are bored when Peter cries over the loss of his uncle and his girlfriend, you are frustrated when another villain appears and his whole background is unveiled in the course of two whole minutes. As if they had more important things to spend the time on. The action scenes are great, the visual effects stunning as usual. The story, however, leaves you screaming in frustration... or hitting the ""stop"" button before the movie is over."
"blackburnj-1","6","0","1","17 February 2008"," Despite being entertaining, this is a disappointment
","Sam Raimi's third Spider-Man film had awesome potential. After two strong films, the trailer for ""Spider-Man 3"" looked spectacular with the distinct possibility that the interesting character work which had been started in the opening films would be taken to a whole new level. Unfortunately, whilst the third film in the trilogy is entertaining and a great spectacle, it is a disappointment as the film is lost without a proper plot and caught in a mêlée of villains and plot lines.<br/><br/>The film starts off well. We begin with Parker, as opposed to Spidey, dealing with his everyday life and then being confronted by the New Goblin, his friend Harry Osborn. There is no problem with this. We have a plot and we know where we're going. We're heading towards a satisfying end to the trilogy's storyline. But then, that plot line is put into limbo for an hour, as is the action and we go off establishing the rest of the villains and their backstories. Every plot line and every villain is introduced and then abandoned for a long period of time. The plot is easy to follow, but it is shallow.<br/><br/>However, the beacon of light was the inner struggle that Spidey must face. Alas, the really dark moments have little or no effect on the character and he only realises that he is turning into a thoroughly evil dude when he hits someone in a rash of anger, an event where no-one gets hurt. So, what was going to be the big climax of the central theme of the series (duality and the conflict between good and evil) turns out to be a real disappointment and without any great depth.<br/><br/>Having said that, whilst this film lacks the brains that would have made it fantastic and any kind of proper plot it does have spectacle and entertainment in abundance. Whilst the visual effects are a bit lacking at times, all of the set pieces are done well. However, the final climax is almost ruined by the bizarre use of a news broadcast which is condescending and, frankly, unintentionally comical. Which emphasises another failing here. This isn't anywhere near as funny as the previous films or indeed as it should be.<br/><br/>But there are the great cameos from J.K. Simmons and Bruce Campbell which bring some humour, but there are also very solid performances. Maguire has a lot of fun here. He becomes Travolta-esquire in a sequence that has Parker strut down the street. Whilst the idea of this is jarring, the performance is a joy to watch. James Franco has improved and Kirsten Dunst is solid.<br/><br/>But there is nothing too much to ride home about here. It isn't as clever as it needs to be. It's bloated with too many characters and plots. It may well be satisfying, but it fails to live up to the high hopes. All in all, this can only be described as a disappointing end to what was shaping up to be a really interesting, subversive and magnificent super-hero trilogy. There will be a ""Spider-Man 4"" but, frankly, this series has said all that it has to say. It must stop, now."

What I remember-even though I've tried to forget-about Spiderman 2 is the cutesy montages that seemed more like filler than anything (Raindrops song and Hal Sparks cameo). Well similar sequences are infused in this one. A couple scenes reminded me more of a musical than a superhero movie. There were no real bad guys in this one. It was sort of by committee. Honestly, I'm not sure what the director was thinking cramming all those subplots into this creating a tedious mess. The ending drags on with one melodramatic scene after another."

","This movie was done poorly by any script writing standards. Everything was arranged so it would be convenient for the script writer to introduce a character, move from one inconsistent scene to another etc.. Take for instance, Eddie Broch showing up just when Gwen Stacey is hanging on for her dear life from a building, and capt. Stacey her dad is right there too ! Or Mary Jane showing up at Peter's apartment day after she walks out on him night before at a restaurant, and says ""I'm worried about you."" then she goes on and dumps him again at the bridge. What's going on with this chic ? This is just to swing the mood of Petar Parker so story moves forward ? Alliance between Venom and Sandman wasn't very convincing either. Why do these guys need to team up ? and at the end Sandman has another change of heart and turns into a good guy.<br/><br/>For me, character of Mary Jane Watson was a disappointment. If you know the original character of MJ, Kristin Dunst just isn't her. I'd say Tobey McGuire really isn't Pete either. He doesn't come across as a New Yorker to me.<br/><br/>So compared to the first two Spiderman movies, this one really didn't have the fire it could have. They don't have to worry because there isn't going to be Spiderman 4. Did Sam Reimy lose interest making Spiderman movies for this one ?"

","I know I'm a bit behind the times, but I just saw this movie. I don't know very much about comic books, but I enjoyed the first two greatly. With Sam Raimi at the helm again, I expected nothing less than a good time. But this was really, really, really, really, I must reiterate another really, awful. The beginning was very promising, and then took about 90+ minutes to get somewhat exciting again. But even the end was numbed by the wretched romantic comedy that made up 3/4 of the film. It got to the point where I just wanted everyone to blow up without any closure whatsoever. Even the little things in this were bad. I know Stan Lee loves to make cameos in Marvel movies, but it was extremely forced and unnecessary in this one. Tobey Maguire is whinier than ever, save for a ""tough guy"" spurt halfway through that just does not work on so many levels. Apparently if a guy pastes his hair to his face and dance-walks around the streets, every attractive woman wants him. Kirsten Dunst looks asleep for most of the feature, but that's typical of her. If there was a show to be stolen, Thomas Hayden Church ran away with it. He did a good job, though I felt the character he portrayed didn't make much sense within the trilogy. The previous villains were masterminds gone wrong. The Sandman was just a criminal who got stuck in a pointless yet very convenient science experiment. Oh, and Venom showed up for about three minutes to bounce around a bit. All in all, this was really bad and a disgraceful follow-up to the previous two films. If there's anyone out there who hasn't seen it, spare yourself. Go to the video store, and rent Death To Smoochy. And that's that."
"Electrified_Voltage","6","0","1","7 January 2008"," Definitely has some entertainment value, but overall, a bit of a bland third installment
","Unlike the previous two Spider-Man films, I did not see this one on the big screen. In fact, I didn't see any movies in theatres last year, other than ""The Simpsons Movie"". I finally just got around to renting ""Spider-Man 3"" after New Year's. Looking here on IMDb before watching it, it seemed to be polarizing, not as highly praised as the previous two installments, so I watched it with mixed expectations. Since it turned out to be sort of a mixed blessing, I guess I'm glad I had those expectations.<br/><br/>At the moment, Peter is very happy. His life as Spider-Man is no longer interfering with his life as Peter Parker. However, one problem still unsolved is Harry still believes that Spider-Man killed his father, and now knows that Peter is Spider-Man! Peter's former best friend gets new powers, a lot like the ones that possessed his father, and becomes the New Goblin! In a battle between Peter and Harry, Harry falls and has to be hospitalized. While suffering from short-term memory loss, he remembers Peter as his friend again, but will his recent memories come back? Meanwhile, Flint Marko, who unbeknownst to Peter is Uncle Ben's real assassin, has escaped from prison! While running from the police, Flint becomes the Sandman, a new enemy for Spidey! Sadly, Peter's problems don't end there, as one night, he is possessed by a symbiote, one which makes him more powerful, but also makes him lose self control and become more aggressive! <br/><br/>Watching ""Spider-Man 3"" once, I noticed more flaws in it than I ever have in its two predecessors, and I have seen both of them several times. First off, Harry's attack on Peter begins a bit too suddenly. Peter is riding his motorcycle, and Harry (as the New Goblin) just suddenly appears and immediately grabs him. It probably should have shown Harry coming first. Right now, it sounds like I'm making way too big a deal out of a minor problem, but there are more. One ridiculous part is where Peter kisses Gwen Stacy while in his suit at a ceremony in Spider-Man's honour. This is while he is thinking about proposing to Mary-Jane! Why wouldn't he realize that this wasn't going to help their relationship? When Peter becomes possessed by the symbiote, he can't help but become a total jerk, but sometimes, it gets pretty silly, especially the part where Mary-Jane is trying to perform, and Peter interrupts by doing dance moves, apparently trying impress her, even though he's with another date.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this third ""Spider-Man"" movie does have some redeeming qualities, including some good action and excitement (as one would hope for), though there could have been more, and I would say the climax is quite good. In the humour department, there is one major highlight, which is the scene where J. Jonah Jameson is at his desk, and the loud buzzer keeps going off, shaking the desk and knocking stuff around. This part is probably funnier than anything in the first two films. There are some other funny scenes (not as funny as the one I mentioned, mind you), though the movie sometimes gets so cheesy that it may succumb to unintentional humour, which reminds me of ""Power Rangers"". In my book, the redeeming qualities of ""Spider-Man 3"" earn it a 6/10, but the downsides earn it nothing higher than that. Apparently, ""Spider-Man 4"" has been confirmed. Hopefully, it will be better than this one, but there's a good chance it won't be (you know how sequels go)."

","The first real misstep in Sam Raimi's heretofore superb Spiderman franchise. SM3 suffers from an affliction that plagues many action sequelsthe misguided necessity to make each successive movie bigger and louder. Apparently using this logic, Raimi shoehorns three bad guys into a messy plot filled with lame contrivances and thinly sketched characterizations. Sandman and Venom don't get the screen-time needed to make them affective or interesting enemies. The two baddies join forces near the end of the film in a scene so superfluous I had to laugh. James Franco is the only one who stands out among the black hatters. He's excellent as the tormented new Goblin. I would have loved to see the entire film built solely around his and Peter's crumbling relationship. <br/><br/>There's plenty of speechifying and sappiness in SM3. Poor Peter and even Goblin, Jr. get their ear bent a few times. There's a lot of crying as well, but all this emotion and drama falls very flat, unlike the first two films which largely managed to avoid the maudlin and obvious. Peter's transformation after he's infected by the evil outer space gunk is also handled curiously. How can you tell Peter's ""bad?"" Well, he leers at women on the street, wears his bangs over his eyes, and makes the landlord's cute daughter bake him cookies. Ooh, how dark and edgy! Oh yeah, and evil Spidey dances, too. Gave me chills, man."

","I am at a loss for words after seeing this mess. I was expecting a dramatic ending to the spider man trilogy, not this inexcusably flawed piece of crap! For the first quarter of the movie it was fairly decent. We got plenty of action and it looked quite pretty. But then the movie decided ""I don't wanna be an action movie any more. I'm gonna be a drama!"" The movie then tries to take two very different plots and twine them together. The first is Peter finding out that it was actually the Sandman who killed Uncle Ben and becomes obsessed with revenge. This is in stark contrast to the Sandman's back story in which he is just trying to provide a decent life for his little girl who is stuck living in the projects.<br/><br/>The other sub-par sub-plot is Peter Parker being twisted by the alien symbiot that has bonded itself to him. In the comics that was actually a pretty good story run as it steadily made spider man meaner and more aggressive. On the big screen it just turns Peter Parker into a creepy pervert who has no problem using his landlord's daughter who has a major crush on him, hitting on random girls on the street (they looked as creeped at as I was by this behavior), and shamelessly flirting with another mans girlfriend in front of M.J. just to make her jealous.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest let down of this movie was Venom. I found nothing wrong with the character himself. He still looked good (sans rolling tongue) and Topher Grace actually did a pretty good job of pulling the character off. But why give such a highly anticipated character less than fifteen minutes of screen time?! Why?! Soon, (but not soon enough it felt like) the movie came to its end in which Peter reconciles with the man who killed his uncle as well as Harry Osborne who repents of his vengeful ways. It was this so-sugary-your-pancreas-will-go-into-shock ending that irritated me the most. It was not just anticlimactic, it was the end of a great movie franchise rolling over and dying without so much as a whimper.<br/><br/>All in all this movie tanked. Toby McGuire still gives a rather wooden performance as our favorite web-slinging wall-crawler (I am still convinced Topher Grace should have been cast from the beginning as our main hero). And what little action there is is badly overshadowed by what are quite possibly the most poorly written script and story line for an action movie ever."

Hey Hollywood, if one villain doesn't make the film interesting enough, inserting two or three extra foes won't improve the quality of the film! How many guys does Spidey fight in this film? A dude who can turn into sand, a living costume and then the next guy the costume attaches itself to, his former best friend who is now a psychotic pretty boy from ""Party of Five"" and did I forget anyone else? And if that wasn't enough, there's a huge love triangle between Spidey, a hot red-head, and a hot blonde. It's as if Sam Raimi found his 50 favorite Spider-Man comic books and tried to merge them all into one film. After the movie slows down (like when the credits roll), I realize I was just tricked into watching another summer popcorn film that decided to abandon any serious approach to a comic superhero in favor of a two hour battle royale. And one more thing... the rumor is that Tobey Maguire will never again don the blue and red spandex, and after watching him with his new alcoholic flabby jaw, I've come to realize dude is not aging well. Like Ralph Macchio, he has that eternal baby face, and it looks straight up scary on a guy who is entering his 30's. I also think Maguire has only one acting method -- the shy spaced out prepubescent style -- and it was ""cute"" in his first films, but it's annoying as he reaches mid-life crisis.

Even at his very best, Spider Man is still a pretty goofy arch-typical boy hero, dealing with teeny relationship and identity issues. What makes Spider-Man endearing is that he has superpowers and goes on adventures. The problem with this movie is that these normal Spiderman problems were treated way to seriously here, the melodrama between Mary Jane, Parker, and Osbourne got embarissingly thick, with not enough Spidey action to dilute it(though were there was action it was pretty cool). The ""i'm evil and now have emo bangs in my face"" didn't help either, the dance sequence if nothing else helped break up the monotony. The Sandman birth sequence was beautiful though, that minute and half of the movie was the best part of the film. If this film wasn't going for realism it shouldn't have injected the constant tear fests, because this tells the audience they're supposed to be emotionally involved with these ridiculous poorly acted characters. The result can only be awkward laughter and distancing of the viewer from the fantasy world they were immersed in. You can't hero worship someone you don't respect, and the redemption/forgiveness scenario come too little to late, to have their intended effect. This might have made an interesting animated film, but on camera it's just not enough.

Too many things, plots and villains in one movie.<br/><br/>It seems that I belong into some kind of minority, but I still think that Venom is a villain that should not be included in these movies. Maybe I got older at some point, I don't know, but I never liked the damn thing. Also I think that Venom is too out-of-this-world (even if it's supposed to be) and adds to the contrast in a wrong way.<br/><br/>Anyway, Venom was handled in a manner that I can live with. Yes, it was rushed like everything else, but Raimi did his best. Hell, he didn't even want to include Venom into the movie. Sandman looks great, and you gotta love the shirt.<br/><br/>With Venom, you get a few more sub-plots and nuances, and they all pretty much suck. You get a disco-dancing Peter wearing make-up and having to live through yet another identity crisis. You get the Sandman joining Venom in a (great-looking) final fight, thus losing every bit of character development he had so far. This was a shame, because Sandman was a good character, and he kept me interested to a point where his intentions and motivations are thrown to the trash, just because ""EPIC END BATTLE GUISE"".<br/><br/>Now studios, if you have a franchise that does great, trust the director, listen to him. Raimi had a vision what he wanted this film to be, but NOOO, you just have to ignore him with some stupid ideas and make him deal with wrong and too many things in one movie. If I am wrong and this was the absolute best that Raimi could do and wasn't forced into any of the crap involved, then...well, at least the new Amazing Spider-man reboot succeeded.<br/><br/>Raimi doesn't get 10 points for the effort though. Every laughable (in a bad way) part from the previous movies are nothing compared to the evil make-up-Peter. Come on Sam! So yes, there is a lot of nitpicking. But when the action kicks in, your jaws drop open and fall to the floor. You have never seen anything like this. The action, and how it's done, made me watch this movie several times.

"zardoz-13","6","0","1","2 December 2007"," ""Spider-Man 3"" weaves too much of everything in its web to be the fun movie it could have been.
","The third entry in the Marvel Comics superhero saga, ""Spider-Man 3"" suffers from a long-winded lecture against revenge, too many villains, too much plot, and special effects so conspicuously computer generated that the ambitious action scenes look even more like a video game than those in the first two films. One minute we have writer/ director Sam Raimi and co-scripters Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent exhorting us from the celluloid soapbox of their $300 million plus movie to embrace forgiveness rather than exact revenge and that happiness boils down to making the right choices since the wrong ones will destroy you. The next minute the filmmakers regale us with high-flying, gravity-defying acrobatics between characters so indestructible that is comes as something of a surprise in the last reel when they show signs of mortality. Incredibly, Spider-Man appeals for help from his nemesis when it appears that he may be on his last legs. Between this slipshod blend of heroics and homilies, Raimi and company continue to reheat the chick flick soap opera love triangle with Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn that drags out everything to a tiresome 140 minutes. Happily, everybody from the previous ""Spider-Man"" movies reprises their roles, but several are given the short-shrift in this tedious tale.<br/><br/>Earlier ""Spider-Man"" epics wisely kept things evenly matched; the heroic webslinger never battled more than one enemy. Unfortunately, ""Spider-Man 3"" makes the same mistake that those overblown ""Batman"" sequels committed when they pitted the Caped Crusader against tag-team adversaries. The ""Batman"" movies suffered because they wasted lots of valuable time establishing colorful bad guys who never stood a chance against the hero. Similarly, ""Spider-Man 3"" suffers, too, because his opponents here aren't especially memorable. Not only does Spider-Man tangle again with Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, but also he has to deal with the shape-shifting Sandman as well as another evildoer named Venom who resembles Spider-Man, except for his pointed little teeth.<br/><br/>As ""Spider-Man 3"" opens, our hero (Tobey Maguire) basks in the limelight of public affection. New York City officials have finally decided to honor Spidey for his many good deeds and the Big Apple presents him with its key to the city. Predictably, not long afterward, events change for the worst, and Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Durst of ""Elizabethtown"") emerges as the first casualty. Broadway theater critics ridicule her stage debut as a diva, and she loses the lead in the show. Our poor heroine has to stoop to taking an ignoble day job warbling in a jazz bar when she isn't waiting on customers. It doesn't help matters that her boyfriend Peter Parker's alter-ego Spider-Man overshadows her. Moreover, her eyes turn green with jealousy when he puckers up during the key ceremony in classic Spidey fashion with the latest damsel, collegiate classmate Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), another character from the comic book series, that he has saved from disaster. Meanwhile, Harry (James Franco of ""Flyboys"") still wants Spider-Man to pay for killing his father.<br/><br/>Were Peter and Harry's feud not enough, ""Spider-Man 3"" antes up another villain, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church of ""Sideways""), the misunderstood miscreant who really murdered Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) in the first movie. Miraculously, Marko manages to escape from prison, but he has the misfortune to stumble into a mammoth science project where he is transformed into the Sandman. The villainous Sandman behaves like an irradiated character from a hokey 1950s' sci-fi/horror epic. He has the power to transform himself into a towering giant on the scale of Godzilla. At the same time, Peter faces new competition from another shutter-bug, wiseacre Eddie Brock (Topper Grace of ""Traffic""), who aims to replace him at The Daily Bugle as Spider-Man's exclusive photographer. Just when you're beginning to suffer from sensory overload, Raimi and company toss in a mysterious meteor oozing with symbiote, an inky black, gooey alien substance which brings out the evil in humanity. This slimy stuff attaches itself to Peter and preys on his baser instincts. Suddenly, Spidey appears at crime scenes decked out in an all-black outfit. Anybody who has seen the ""Star Wars"" movies knows that Peter has gone over to the Dark Side. Eventually, in keeping with the film's heavy-handed message, Spider-Man learns that giving into evil is not the right choice.<br/><br/>Sadly, ""Spider-Man 3"" never achieves the right mix of morality and melodrama. Indeed, Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Oscar winning scenarist Alvin Sargent deserve good citizenship accolades for advocating forgiveness over revenge, but they should have saved their sermon for another movie about realistic characters instead of shallow-minded superheroes. Things get so woebegone in ""Spider-Man 3"" that after he whips one villain, Spidey accepts the polecat's apology and lets him take off for parts unknown. Credibility should be the last factor to interfere with a superhero movie, but ""Spider-Man 3"" treats its characters inconsistently. Spider-Man and Harry spend the first half of the movie surviving some pretty incredible things. In the second half, however, Raimi and company ask us to worry about these characters as if they were mortals despite their earlier death-defying feats. If there must be a ""Spider-Man 4,"" Hollywood needs to make a quantum leap in computer-generated technology and Raimi needs to remember that summer movies should deliver excitement, intrigue, and adventure, not preach about moral issues. ""Spider-Man 3"" weaves too much of everything in its web to be the fun movie it could have been."

All this,while a weaselly,ambitious rival photog(Topher Grace,probably doing the most dynamic acting here)finds himself at the point of trying to destroy Parker by any means possible.<br/><br/>Director Sam RAimi has this on auto-pilot,and the result is something that has the visual and overall quality of the film to pretty much match the previous two offerings,but overlong,over-loaded with villains and plot contrivances(a possible romantic device involving Bryce Dallas Howard as the bubbly, vivacious police CAptain's daughter seemed a bit much,and James Franco's return as Harry seemed to be somehow squeezed out in the plot,which is wrong),this movie pretty much unhinges the energy and campy fun of the previous two movies. <br/><br/>At this point,I'm not sure how(if at all)the Spiderman franchise is going to carry on. I have no doubt it will,but it will be interesting to see if the principal players(THe RAimis--Sam and co-writer Ivan--,Maguire,Dunst,Rosemary Harris as durable Aunt MAy,the awesome J.K. Simmons as JAmeson,Bruce Campbell,etc.)will want to continue this series,and how it will look. For now,anyway,I guess one has to enjoy this movie as a part of the totality of the trilogy,and resign themselves to this movie being somewhat of a letdown. A sometimes breathtaking,energetic and visually stimulating letdown,to be sure,but a letdown all the same."

","This movie was pale in comparison to the other two. The problem: Too many villains. Despite what Hollywood thinks, not always a good thing. In the first two movies Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus were well-developed and given depth. In 3, the villains were only plot contraptions, especially Venom... who was reduced to an ""evil Spidey"" (what's with Venom being a little wimp and shooting black webs) and a paradox to give the whole ""choice"" message contrasting the character's revenge ideals. The Sandman plot was uninspired and cheesy, despite Sandman being the best developed villain in the movie. The New Goblin was even disappointing despite all the preperation in the other movies. Like I said they were just plot contraptions rather than characters. I think they should have left Venom out of the movie and focused on the other villains, maybe some other minor villain (they wasted one of Spidey's best adversaries by tossing Venom in)and the symbiote (the real villain of the story) and save Eddie Brock's transformation for the end as an opening for Spidey 4. Now who are they going to use for Spidey 4? The Vulture? The series is over and ended on a bad note."

","I liked the first one, I loved No.2, so I thought I had to give No.3 a go. Even during the first few reels I knew I had made the wrong choice. First of all I thought the Harry Osborn/ Spiderman storyline had potential but they underused it. I mean why bother introducing another villain when you could have Harry Osborn taking revenge on Spiderman.<br/><br/>I am not sure if I am the only one but I felt that Spiderman 3 was not that well thought out. At first Peter Parker turned evil when that ""thing"" (sorry don't know what else to call it) took over his body and then during the last few reels the ""thing"" latches onto someone else. As a result of that none of the villains were that terrifying because they didn't have that much screen time, which is a huge drawback. Even the emotional moments, which worked for Spiderman 2 looked corny in No.3.<br/><br/>This movie however doesn't seem that bad when you consider the fact that when it came to the third sequel, Superman 3 and Batman were considerably weaker compared to the first two. One bad sequel isn't enough to deter me from watching any future sequels."

","Many superhero movies are in theaters for one purpose: to make money. Spiderman 3 serves a different kind of master. It not only wants to make money, it wants to get its messages across as well. Messages like love, sacrifice, justice, responsibility, inner demons, outer demons, jealousy, envy, friendship, brotherhood, peace, decency, patience and understanding. It would take three seasons of ""Barney"" to get all that across. Sam Rami decides that it can fit into his movie.<br/><br/>But squeezing the entirety of the human emotional range isn't as easy as it sounds, folks. And bearing the weight of these diverse themes is poor Spidey, Tobey Maguire. While Spiderman himself battles foes of darkness, Tobey surrenders the battle of the script and plays out the page.<br/><br/>Maguire looks silly, and while the audience may have sympathy for him, there's no empathy. We're lost in the mess of characters and plot lines that have been sacrificed for half-witted melodramatic moments. The action is pulsing, but it's no spectacular and the fight scenes are dully paced (excepting an early duel of Harry vs. Peter but of course that's completely useless - Rami uses the scene to bring emotional distress on Peter and emotional resonance from Harry so we cheer for Spidey but feel for Harry and can't decide and oh whoops there we go...). Anyone ever seen 'The Adventures of Robin Hood?' That's what a fight scene is supposed to be like. Which fight scene am I talking about? Pick one.<br/><br/>The acting is the only thing that will truly leave a tear on your cheek. And this acting is not the stuff of Maguire, a dull-but-delicious James Franco, the eerie Bryce Dallas Howard or the miscast Topher Grace. It's the sweet Kirsten Dunst one weeps for, as well as the peerless James Cromwell. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this latest Hollywood bonanza. It may seem like more then a special effects show at first glance, but the self-righteous melodrama is only concealing the true nature of this blockbuster - yes, it's a popcorn tween action flick that just happens to be boring."

Or they were thinking, ""Making super hero movies is the best way to make money in this day and age.

","Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN films are something of legend amongst the comic-book-to-film fans. The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.<br/><br/>But no...<br/><br/>Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.<br/><br/>This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, THE GOOD German) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco (TRISTAN & ISOLDE); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily ""more,"" if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.<br/><br/>Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud! It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (ELIZABETHTOWN) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.<br/><br/>Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.<br/><br/>It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.<br/><br/>Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as ""the bad one."" We can all hope that Mr. Raimi gets back to doing character shots that help strengthen our superhero rather than making him appear like a crybaby."

I must say, however, that Topher Grace does a great job portraying the obnoxious Eddie Brock, but there is no real development of the character (or it is very superfluous).<br/><br/>And can someone explain me what's the Sandman doing in this film? Wasn't it enough to have Venom as the villain for this one? And why they both become ""partners"" to kill Spider-man? And then he explains himself about the death of Uncle Ben at the end in the most lame way? What happened? I believed it was too much for just one film, and was not good enough for what Sam Raimi did previously.<br/><br/>And what about Carnage? Is he not the most wicked arch-rival to be conceived in the Marvel Universe? Where is he?

","Straight to the point. Obviously this movie was made for children with some nice messages for the little buggers about forgiveness and that there is no distintion between good and evil, circumstances might force people to do things and that's an important lesson. Mix that with nice special effects the little guys will get crazy! However, for mature people who had their fair share of movies, you will recognise all the typical cliché Hollywood shots of reunited friends and lost loves. The first half was actually quite interesting and OK written (few clichés you can get away with) but the second half after venom is coming alive was just plain ridiculous. ""I really wanted to like this film"" (another cliché line for many IMDb reviews :-) because Spidey is part of my early memories and first comic book heroes (along with X-men and Batman) but after the second half things started to fall apart.

"CrazyLazy99","3","0","2","6 November 2007"," Are you kidding me?
","You must be kidding me. There is no way this movie is this bad. Its Spider-Man for crying out loud. This must be a joke. I must be dreaming. There is no way.<br/><br/>No! It does suck! Say it ain't so! There are so many things wrong and terrible with this movie, its unreal, but first I'll start with a review (not critical) of the first two movies.<br/><br/>The most disappointing movie I have ever seen. You know how Saving Private Ryan or another movie like that is a punch in the gut? Well this is a punch in the face a kick in the groin and while you're on the ground it jacks your money! I walked out of the theater wanting to put Sam Raimi on a hit list.<br/><br/>Now its not all bad (it does have a 3). The movie starts out pretty strongly. In the first 15 minutes or so, it seemed like it would be good. There was acting, a seemingly visible script and a breathtaking action scene involving an armored truck. Then, it sucks substantially.<br/><br/>The acting is atrocious. Even Tobey Maguire can't salvage decency out of what he has in a script. He becomes a freaking emo. Kirsten Dunst brings nothing to the role. She's just a spoiled brat who doesn't get what she wants. J.K. Simmons is even forgettable. He's completely toned down to mild-mannered. However, Topher Grace was a pleasant surprise as Eddie Brock, Jr. He was a sarcastic little jerk and played the role very well. But he still wasn't right for the role. And why was he Junior? Then there's the direction. What was Sam Raimi thinking? I am not completely sure about the boundaries between writing and directing. Nonetheless, they were both terrible. Peter dancing down the street as an emo retard. He made a complete idiot out of himself. He spins around on the street looking at women who stare back at him in utter disgust. I wounder how much Tobey Maguire asked for before he went through with it. Then, doing a swing dance with Gwen Stacy to get back at Mary Jane. Oh, they couldn't have made it not suck. They couldn't have made it actually good. That must have been the staff's motto. It was painful to watch.<br/><br/>This I know is God-awful writing. Venom is in the movie for 15 minutes. I don't mean screen time, I mean in the movie. He also constantly pulls his mask back and has fanged teeth when it is pulled back. That means Eric Forman has a bunch of fangs. WTF? Then there's no character development. Mary Jane's character does a complete 180. Instead of trying to accept the fact that Peter's Spider-Man (which would have given her room to develop) she just whines and moans and is one-dimensional. Not two. One. Peter sucks! Emo dance, and a cry-baby. Since he was supposed to be dark, this is just an even bigger slap in the face. He should have struggled with his inner demons differently, like being ruthless and merciless as Spider-Man. For example, Peter should have been seen in a scene in the black suit and he goes overboard in protecting a citizen. He should have beat him up so bad he was all bloodied up. And every time he looks at the suit he should have some sort of mad look on his face to show what he was thinking, and then have some Batman Begins-esquire music (composed by Danny Elfman, of course) when he puts on the suit. The writers basically flipped the audience the bird and gave them a truly terrible script. Another bad part of the writing is character usage. Mary Jane seems to be in it more Spider-Man, the main attraction. Did Dunst's contract require that she sing two songs? That is the only way she could have gotten the screen time. Peter Parker: well, I mentioned his emo retardation. Sandman is a wuss. I can understand trying to go a different angle by saying he was saving his daughter and not really a bad guy, just making bad decisions, but they made him weak. Sam Raimi liked this character so they glorified him.<br/><br/>However, no one was more misused more than Venom. His presence was a complete atrocity to the source material and insulting to me, personally. Venom was in it for 15 minutes I already told you. But the bad part is that he dies! Eddie Brock, Jr. dies in the end. So who's to carry on the Venom name? One of those afterthoughts in the comics? Please. Venom could have been used so well. <br/><br/>Even the score sucks. Danny Elfman's should have stayed. When I heard the different score being played, I knew it was a sign of a lackluster movie. It was so bad. It was the most generic score I've heard in a superhero movie, a genre that usually has a lot of good or great ones.<br/><br/>Also, its filled with tired or weak story line. Old or tired: the triangle between Peter, MJ, and Harry. Can we get past that now? How about Harry trying to kill Peter for a little longer than 4 minutes? And this half-a##ed storyline, ""uh, Sandman killed your uncle, not a thug like in the comics."" Oh, nice guys. What, did that take a whole three freaking seconds? You couldn't have put a little more thought into the story (not that they did with anything)? It was ridiculous. They didn't even try.<br/><br/>Oh yeah: there's barely any action. Talky-talky. The first two had some talking but it didn't suck and make me want to stab my ears. They cry and dance and its just insulting."

I still have to hand it to the cast, because they do such a great job of capturing the true personalities of the characters in the way that Stan Lee first envisioned them. The action scenes, which have a lot of special effects, are very good as well. There was one thing that I did not like. That was Peter hitting Mary Jane.

Then when the film was released many people didn't understand it, yes it was cheesy, but so were the first two. Probably what screwed up the audience was the totally out of this world (literally) plot line, and IN human villains. But that also made this film very distinct from the first two.

Of course people are gonna bi*** and moan it's way different from what we've seen before. I myself understood the film perfectly from beginning to end, and what made me actually like this film more than the first two was the fact that Sam Raimi actually put more comic book than film and only true fans would understand. I actually enjoyed the dance sequence because it was comical just like the comics, and the creation of venom and sandman was flawless and extraordinary, and once again it was super cheesy but it just made the film more fun and campy.

But if you can manage to get through that 15 minutes without turning it off, then the rest of the movie is actually pretty good. Overall I give it a 7 out of 10 because the action was great and there was more than the second, but it did have some dull moments where it seemed like the director was trying to kill time and make it longer.

Now this is still a good movie, the acting is excellent and the direction and effects are handled with aplomb. Unfortunately these ingredients don't add up to a satisfying meal. Venom is wasted as a villain and Sandman's motivations never quite fit the levels he goes to. But the biggest disappointment is the New Goblin. After the nail biting conclusion to Spiderman 2 where Harry breaks the mirror and uncovers his legacy I was expecting Harry to be the new great villain, he isn't and the conclusion to his story arc smacks of an ending contract.

All this, tied to a couple other lapses in judgment, have Peter trying to find quick answers to solutions. One solution literally clings itself to him and makes things only worse.<br/><br/>It was hard to taste, watching Peter look emo as the face of aggression, scaring his landlord and MJ, while creeping out passer-bys and Jonah himself. A particular scene, where Peter takes Gwen to a jazz club where MJ works, just didn't work. I feel Avi Arad made a mistake in convincing Raimi to put Venom in the film because by the time it took to establish the character and it's reasons for being, that time already wasted two-thirds of the film and Brock just doesn't last too long after. That's not to discount the eventual confrontations between Harry and Peter though. Their relationship became more complex throughout the movie, made even a little more bizarre by one agreeing to help the other in the wake of all what happens. It's also something I believe that Alvin Sargeant was right on: they should have made two films of Spider-Man 3, with the first ending very much like The Empire Strikes Back. Spider-Man 3 was a very good movie, a potential to make it better is gone now, but the end product is nothing to complain about. Fans of the first two will not be disappointed and seeing the battle royale at the end is worth the price in itself."
"marksidebottom","2","0","2","1 November 2007"," A Trilogy's bad end
","Having seen the previous Spider-man movies and considered them to be the strongest of the Superhero genre, it was a huge disappointment when the third in the trilogy failed in so many respects - despite the potential for so much more. Out of the many problems the fact that there were too many bad guys aching for screen-time meant that there was no clear story arc for any character, despite some powerful performances. Also, the scenes when 'Spidey goes bad' leave the audience feeling that they've just cringed through an episode of Mr. Bean as opposed to a serious metamorphosis by a malevolent alien.<br/><br/>A disappointing experience but due to the success at the box office a fourth film could be likely, hopefully they will iron out the weak spots and bring our friendly-neighbourhood Spider-man back to full strength."

","let me start by stating that i didn't like the 1st nor 2nd spider-man movies, however compared to spiderman3 the other 2 look like Oscar worthy movies.<br/><br/>My biggest dislike in this movie (which is the same in spiderman2) is the over use of computer graphics, (i wasn't sure if i was watching a movie or an animation.) Moreover, i would argue that the cg was less than average, the modeling of characters is done very well (and that's the reason posters and trailers look so cool), however the character movements are very unrealistic, and as always extremely fast fight scene (to hide bad cg) where you can't tell what exactly is going on, except the fact that one guy kicked the other.<br/><br/>Moreover, it seems that the less than average director (feel free to quote me on that) was given a free card to let loose of his humor all over the movie and any spider-man fan will be outraged by that kind of humor.<br/><br/>So to all spider-man fans ""and good movie fans in general"", let us unite against the making of another spider-man movie and if the world still wants another spider-man movie, could we at least get a better director!!!"

"Hannibal_Chigurh","3","0","2","25 October 2007"," A Great Disappointment
","I was all ready for the third installment of Spider-Man 3 as soon as I saw the excellent Spider-Man 2. SM2 was maybe the best superhero film of all time (if it isn't, only Superman 2 is better), and the promise of Venom had me unable to wait for this flick. Then I saw it opening day. It's like they took all the flaws from the first two and left out the good parts. Peter Parker's efforts to cope with his powers always set the comics apart from the comics at the time. Here, Raimi jumps the shark and makes the boy emo. How is any intelligent person supposed to take emo seriously? Gwen Stacy, a very important figure in the comics, is reduced to minimal screen time and few lines. I don't even read comics, and I know she's significant. That's an indicator you should probably give the lady some lines.<br/><br/>The main villain is Sandman, a misunderstood criminal who has maybe the least scary powers ever. Oh no, it's the Sandman! He's gonna get stuck in my crack! Sandman is played by Thomas Haden Church, who actually gives the part the depth and feeling that should have been given to Peter Parker. James Franco is back as Pete's former best friend Harry, and it's painfully obvious that Franco pushed that part as far as it could go in the last film. Venom is reduced to about 15 minutes of screen time, which is the greatest travesty of the film. Venom is the greatest of all Spidey villains. Topher Grace doesn't have enough time to build up Eddie Brock or his fiendish alter-ego, making him yet another victim of the film's bloating.<br/><br/>Venom's not the only bad villain. The New Goblin, Harry Osbourne's vengeful alter-ego, is a mess. Harry, who would have failed out of high school without Peter's help, somehow managed to build an all-new array of weapons and suits. Okey-dokey. As I understand it, the substance that he took to gain the Goblin's heightened strengths also increased his intelligence, but I don't know for sure because it wasn't explained. Next, he doesn't wear a mask. James Francois not menacing in any way, shape, or form. It's such a great irony that the animated Willem Dafoe was restricted by a mask yet James Franco gets to show his pretty mug. He bore almost no resemblance to the Green Goblin, and his weapons were over the top even for a superhero film.<br/><br/>Here's a bit of advice: don't hire good performers like Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, and James Cromwell (who plays Gwen's dad), and then not let them develop their characters. Don't interpret the mood swings and aggressiveness brought on by the black suit as emo. Most importantly, don't put a dance number in a superhero blockbuster. I hope they fix these bugs in time for Spidey 4. Sony, let this be a lesson not to go crazy just because a franchise is successful."
"striljr","5","0","1","23 October 2007"," Revenge is like medeocrity... it makes a great spidey series into a story not as good as the first two.
","First of all let me just say that I'm really into the Spiderman Series. I enjoyed the first one, and the second one even more! I was so looking forward to this movie a lot! I was very excited when I got in the theater getting my expectations very high and SPOILER WARNING!!! at the beginning I was pretty pleased with the narration, how it started from where the second one left off from and the battle sequence with Osborne (New Goblin) was cool and then after that I though the story line started to collapse a little to about a lot! Harry Osborne had fallen and lost his memory of anything he could remember then all of a sudden just by looking at his dad's painting he becomes a villain and steals Parker's MJ. Acting was very poor at the central park scene where MJ says she's dumping Parker and I couldn't believe Parker would just betray MJ by kissing that other girl Gwen (Bryce Dallas Howard)! I was outraged! I had no idea that Peter would start cheating on MJ! The story got even more tangled with Sandman (thought to be his Uncle's actual killer), Eddie Brock (Played by Topher Grace, who was a huge arch enemy of Parker in the Bugle and just seems to come out of nowhere!), and how he becomes a little aggressive and vengefull, but very retarded (especially when he struts down the street with all girls in the background) when the black is on his suit. This movie had action, but just not enough. Too much love plots! Too many crooks! Not enough of a story to enjoy as well as the first two. But if you want to enjoy it then lower you're expectations a bit or just be somewhat disappointed like I was."

","Even though I knew the outcome of the movie It was just Amazing. From the fight scenes with harry to the Visuals of Sandman, everything just clicked in this third Installment of Spiderman. Even with Tobey being the main character the best acting goes to James Franco who plays Harry. All of his scenes were Oscar-worthy and memorable. From his Hospital scene up to his death. All Amazing. MJ's character didn't expand as much as i hope for. I was hoping for more from the Kirsten Dunst. Maybe her character is just getting old. Even though people said they had too many villains, I disagree completely. 3 villains made the storyline better. Thomas Hayden Church is amazing. know wonder Sideways won an Oscar. His character Sandman is a perfect role for him. Topher Grace had plenty of screen time,but his villain Venom didn't. Only 20 minutes was the time and then he dies. There's been dispute on whether he dies. Doctor Connors who is Dylan Baker is once again a Fantastic Actor. The visuals were amazing from the beginning scene all the way through the final cut-scene. Movie was long and not got boring. It was in your face action. Even though I knew How and when Harry was going to die I still had a tear going down my face. Best Acting during his death scene and final goodbyes to Peter Parker and MJ. The way they ended was somewhat of a disappointment. I was hoping for a cliff hanger or something but it ended with Mary Jane and Peter Parker hugging at the end. 2 thumbs way up and A+ across the board. Lets hope they make 3 more like they planned"
"MaximumMadness","6","0","1","20 October 2007"," ""Spider-Man 3"" is an action-packed treat... If you are in the right mindset...
","""Spider-Man 3"" seems to be the most debated film of the summer. On one hand, some love it... on the other, some despise it. I personally loved the movie for what it is... an enjoyable, fast and action-packed thrill-ride, that may not be quite up to par with the previous film (the neo-classic ""Spider-Man 2""), but is still a great movie nonetheless.<br/><br/>Like many, the only real complaint I have is that too many characters and stories are crammed into the film. Though, I actually think it all functions well as one complete story.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Peter has finally found some peace and attained the happiness that has been eluding him the past few years. He plans on asking MJ to marry him, the city finally accepts him as a hero, and all seems well and dandy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, things are about to change.<br/><br/>First, Harry (still convinced Peter murdered his father), becomes the devious ""New Goblin."" (His storyline in the film is somewhat complicated, so I won't go into it yet.) <br/><br/>Then, it is revealed that a new figure (the tragic Flint Marko) was there the night Uncle Ben was shot, and he may be the real killer. However, Marko inadvertently exposes himself to a particle demolecularization experiment, which crystallizes his genetic material and turns him into the dreaded ""Sandman"", a hulking ""villain"" that can fly, transform his body parts into weapons, and in several cases become a giant beast! <br/><br/>Finally, a meteorite lands on the Earth, unleashing a gelatinous being (similar in style to ""The Blob"") that eventually latches itself to Peter, transforming his costume and turning him into ""Dark Spider-Man"", which causes Peters emotions (particularly anger) to amplify beyond normal bounds. It basically turns Peter into the ""ADHD-Spider-Man."" <br/><br/>On top of all that, MJ can't get that break in show business she desperately wants; a sinister and arrogant new photographer (Eddie rock) is trying to out-do Peter at every turn; and the sexy Gwen Stacy seemingly has eyes for Spidey, causing tension between Peter and MJ.<br/><br/>Now, mind you, that is a simplified version of just the first half of the movie! From there on in, the plot-lines develop and intersect at various points, feeding off of one another, until we get to the climax. We even get new sub-plots on top of everything else! <br/><br/>""But if the movie is so overstuffed, how can it possibly be any good?"" So glad you asked! You see, normally if a movie has anywhere near as many intersecting plots and ideas as there were in this film, I seem to tune out, as it gets way to confusing.<br/><br/>With ""Spider-Man 3"", somehow Sam Raimi (the director of all three films, and co-writer of this entry) manages to keep all the goings-on grounded to a certain degree, and simplifies them just enough that you don't loose your mind.<br/><br/>Would I have preferred a simpler story? Definitely. But did the movie at least do a good job of juggling the 800 (or so) plot lines going on? Again, definitely.<br/><br/>Believe me, I could go on for hours on the structure of the film, and how it all works out. But that would just become monstrous and pointless.<br/><br/>So, before I wrap up, let me quickly go over a few of the points I have missed...<br/><br/>-Venom... Yes, Venom is in this movie, which is an established fact by now. And many complain that his role is too small, but for me, it works better this way. The story lines in ""Spider-Man 3"" all revolve around the human aspect of the characters. With Venom, you don't have any humanity to ""feel"" for. He is basically portrayed as an arrogant man (Brock), who attains the suit and decides to use it for revenge on those he feels have wronged him. The suit is really just used to show how arrogance and power can corrupt. And Eddie is only used as an agitator for Peter. So it makes sense that Venom's usage be limited... Once the ""Dark Spidey"" and Brock story lines are done, there isn't much call for Venom, as he doesn't add anything new... (Other than to help make the final battle really cool!) <br/><br/>-Harry... As I mentioned above, Harry's story is interesting and somewhat complex. He starts the movie as a total villain, attempting to kill Peter in an action sequence I can only describe as ""dazzling"" and ""amazing."" However, he ends up receiving a severe head injury which causes him to suffer memory loss. (He has amnesia... get over it!) I thought this was a very appropriate story-telling point. By giving him amnesia, he forgets about all his hatred towards Spider-Man. And we are reminded that beneath all the callous, empty rage, there is a real human... Someone sweet and kind. That way, even when he regains his memory, we still feel sorry for him. Trust me, it works! <br/><br/>-Sandman... I feel that Sandman is a wondrous character, that I would rank right behind the perfection that was Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus. We learn early on that he only resorted to crime to get money he desperately needs to help his daughter, who is suffering from an unnamed illness. And the influence his daughter has over him is what propels his hatred towards Spider-Man, who foils his attempts to get the money. Thomas Hayden Church proves perfect, turning in an outstanding performance!<br/><br/>-The Effects... The effects in this movie are indescribable. For the first time ever, I often forgot that I was even looking at effects. As far as I was concerned, everything was real!<br/><br/>So, wrap up time! ""Spider-Man 3""... a solid 8. Not the greatest movie ever, but a lot of fun, with emotion and ""real characters."" A treat in the usual line-up of cruddy sequels! 8/10"

","""It's Brock sir, Edward Brock Jr. I'm here humbled and humiliated to ask you for one thing... I want you to kill Peter Parker "" <br/><br/>This film is an action packed superhero flick which delivers what any superhero film requires to deliver. Superb sequences of actions with a sprinkle of iconic storyline.<br/><br/>The first spiderman was the worst in my opinion. But it did well to introduce the trilogy. The second spiderman was a brilliant installment of the trilogy. But i personally think this spiderman is simply the best of the series so far (hopefully) There was a lot of speculation on whether the film could be able to deliver a good way of shuffling the 3 villains together. However, the story proved this speculation wrong and the story was well crafted. I don't want to go too into the story or the ending, its for you to see.<br/><br/>The only bad points of the film is the fact that we didn't get to see more of Venom which was disappointing and there were a lot of far-fetched moments but then again, this is a superhero film! In conclusion, this is definitely the best superhero film ever made, towers over superman. A must see 8/10"

","Spider-Man 3 (2007, Dir. Sam Raimi) <br/><br/>Life finally feels good for Peter Parker. He has managed to balance life as both Spider-Man and as Mary Jane's boyfriend. He is even planning on proposing to MJ. But life isn't always going to be easy for the webbed hero. Harry Osborn still hasn't forgiven Peter for the death of his father. He has developed the perfect technology and crowns himself the 'New Goblin'. Harry isn't the only problem. It is revealed that an escaped convict, Flint Marko is the real killer of Peter's uncle. After an accident, he is now the invincible 'Sandman', who has teamed up with Venom to target the superhero, who is struggling to handle his life.<br/><br/>'Spider-Man' was introduced in 2002 and was an instant success. 'Spider-Man 2' was released two years later and was even better. The third movie of the series isn't as great as the second film, but is still a great film to watch. The main problem is does has is the amount of story they are trying to give. It's great with so many new and interesting characters, but there is just a lot to fit into a 2 hour film. The great special effects are back, with amazing shots of Sandman and Venom. Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace are amazing as villains. There are some fun highlights during the story, but also some cringe worthy moments, such as an emo style Peter Parker dancing through the film. Still it is a great part of a great trilogy (so far). If you've never seen this superhero in action, you really need to watch this trilogy, even if your not a comic book fan.<br/><br/>""Woah...Spidey.

","Watched this on DVD and was seriously tempted to fast forward over huge chunks of this film. About an hour could be cut without losing anything but seemingly endless shots of Mary-Jane in yet another mood, or suffering from PMT or blubbing from some pointless tiff. Puh-leeze, we just don't care about her. Dump her from the film and you might end up with a decent one-hour action movie where you don't forget who the villains are after yet another ""oh let's go check on how Mary-Jane is coping with yet more angst"" scene. Sheesh...<br/><br/>Seems I need at least 10 lines to qualify for a review. But seriously, there isn't anything more to be said about this film. Well OK, let's try...<br/><br/>Yeh OK the special effects are good, but then pretty well every film these days comes out with effects, so that's just not enough to impress any more. Maybe that's a good thing since films will be forced to return to what made good cinema in the days before flashy graphics: a decent plot and engaging script.<br/><br/>Nuff said."
"kenvandenbussche-2","7","0","1","13 October 2007"," A different Spider-Man ...
","Whatever the differences are between the Spider-man movies and the comic-books, it's futile to talk about it because I have never read a single comic-book. I have heard that not all changes are good ones, but I didn't notice any of those because in my case: ignorance is a bless. Unfortunately: all of this is a moot point given the fact that one doesn't need to read the comic-books in order to grasp the flaws this film holds.<br/><br/>Nothing is really bad though, but some stuff just doesn't work out nicely. The big battle near the end is a little too hectic for its own good. Also near the end: we get two emotional scenes but neither one of those really do the job since they lack the intensity. The moral speeches by May Parker, who serves more as a mother than an aunt for Peter, become repetitive and we see too little of actor J.K. Simmons who is ever-excellent in playing the chief of the New York City newspaper The Daily Bugle.<br/><br/>But there is some good stuff too. The only way for this film to be even more spectacular than the previous one was to add an extra enemy which is why Spider-Man now faces more than one enemy at the same time. And the new villains are indeed quite fascinating. There is Sandman who is exactly what the name tells you: he's a man of sand! And there is also Venom which is some sort of a sticky black substance that is actually alive. And when it comes into contact with a human being, it brings out the worst in them! Also: a new version of the Goblin comes into play, but this character is tied between the love for his friends Peter and Mary Jane and getting the proper revenge for his father's murder.<br/><br/>The special effects are spectacular and this is of course a must! The birth of the Sandman is arguably the single most breathtaking scene of all three Spider-man movies. It reminded me a little of the 1999-adventure movie ""The mummy"" where the evil creature Imhotep also does a very nice trick with sand. The shapeless creature Venom is undoubtedly the strangest but also the most vicious of all superhero villains ever depicted in a Spider-man movie (or any other comic-book adaptation; for that matter). It produces a few laughs when we get to lay our eyes on the new Peter Parker but brings out just as many semi-thrills when - near the end - the real Venom makes an appearance. The many battles are also entertaining to watch albeit some of those are a bit overdone perhaps. In the first two films J.K. Simmons provided the most laughs and while he is still amusing, I thought that the funniest moment this time came from Bruce Campbell playing a French waiter.<br/><br/>In short: ""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as its predecessors due to a few flaws that could have been prevented, but still entertains and that's the main thing! It's a typical good popcorn movie that focuses more on SFX and action than on any of its characters and their storyline."

Harry's servant tells Harry that Peter didn't kill his father. He knew that the whole time, and decides to tell Harry after getting a grenade in the face. And guess what?

Then Peter goes down to Harry and MJ. MJ is crying, and you might think that Peter would do the same at first, but NO! He smiles again and says ""HEY PAL! HOW YOU DOIN?""

But the movie basically abbreviated most of the important spidy facts that lasted years in the comics i.e. his relationship with Mary J and put it in less than an hour of movie time while they kept prolonging stupid sappy, weeping scenes of him crying!

"suthsydkiheiboy75","10","0","1","29 September 2007"," It was a good movie.
","This is a, pointing out stuff, review.<br/><br/>I didn't have very high expectations for this movie. I liked the first one. For a superhero movie, it had good acting, good camera work, special effects etc. Then came the sequel, Spider-man 2. That was an amazing movie, I usually find most sequels to be worst then the original. It was much deeper and the action scenes were fantastic.<br/><br/>Now for Spider-man 3. Is it a great movie? It really depends. As a superhero movie, it was just amazing. It was like a comic book in real life on the big screen. And isn't that what it should be? The storyline had a lot of ideas. And I guess they decided to use every single one of them. Some may say that's a bad thing, but I think it just made the movie much more entertaining to watch. It felt like there was always something new each scene. I just think the talking just had to be turned down a bit.<br/><br/>Some parts were really silly (If you've watched the movie, you should know what I'm talking about). And it seemed that they had a great time making those scenes, and shouldn't that be able to reflect upon the audience. I even found those scenes pretty damn funny.<br/><br/>I kept hearing from critics that there were just to many villains in this movie. Have you seen Batman the movie, it has the Joker, Penguin, Catwoman, and the Riddler. The movie was pretty cheesy too, but classic. Another pretty lame complaint is that the villains weren't developed enough. Well through my opinion, if they did add more scenes for them to develop. And I'm pretty sure that wouldn't help, it would just make the movie longer and make even more complaints to cut down the crap.<br/><br/>And what's the big deal of the American Flag part? It's just like 3-6 second shot of Spider-man on a pole. What, did that become the trade mark symbol of Spider-man, no of course not.<br/><br/>Although this can't be helped, even if all the complaints that people made were to be re edited, there would still be flaws in the movie. Movies like this will always get mixed reviews, it can't be helped."

","I noticed this film got bashed a lot, mainly due to the fact that Venom didn't get the screen time he deserved. I'll admit it, I was disappointed by the lack of screen time for Venom and the black suit. But that is my only complaint. This movie kicked butt and I enjoyed it to the fullest. Everything came together, the special effects and the action scenes were a lot of fun and kept the film flowing. I thought Topher Grace made a great Eddie Brock and Venom for the amount of time he had on screen. A lot of people think his reasons for wanting Parker dead were not realistic enough. I've heard about real people wanting others dead for even less reasons, so his motives were just fine. This movie was better than most people give it credit for. Everybody did a great job and Peter in the black suit was still sadistic and evil and not just cocky (let's see, examples would be killing Sandman (or thought he did), saying terrible things to Harry, smacking MJ, blah, blah, blah. He was pretty bad and it was perfect. I still deem it the best of the series and my alltime favorite. Go, Spidey."
"Hitchcoc","8","0","1","31 August 2007"," MIld Disappointment
","I have to remind myself of my age and my less than exciting view of high tech and computer generated images. In some ways, if you've seen one Spider-man movie you've seen them all. The action scenes have a similarity. It mostly has to do with people about to hit the ground, suddenly being swooped up at the last second. As experienced viewers, we know there isn't going to be a splat, especially if the victim is young and pretty. The best of the story rests with the villains and there are some good ones here. The Sand Man is really a fun creation, morphing and blowing around and coming back to his initial form. In this particular setting, there seems to be a lot of danger of innocent bystanders being victimized by forces over which they have no control (bitten by spiders?) <br/><br/>In this film, Peter's turning over to the dark side could be understandable. He gets no credit for anything and the world has about a ten second attention span. Heroes become goats in a millisecond. Still this is a rapidly moving, fun film with some issues still up for grabs."

The first 2 where very good movies so when Spiderman 3 was announced I couldn't wait for it to premiere.When I first saw the teaser trailer summer of 2006 I was ecstatic. Then after watching the new full trailers I was even more excited, it looked so good. I loved the idea of Venom as the baddie. I was telling people days before the movie came out how it was gonna be the best movie ever. Then Friday night I saw it. And was bitterly disappointed. First of all the special effects were awesome especially Venom and Sandman. Unfortunately just about everything else that made the first 2 shine weren't in this movie. Tobey was given horrible, campy lines as Peter Parker and the whole dark side, a good idea in theory was ruined by bad dialog. Even what happened between him and Harry just wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be. Venom was under developed and wasn't scary or bad enough as he should have been.<br/><br/>This movie was a perfect example of over hype. Sadly the spiderman I loved was not this movie."
"Winds_of_Destination","6","0","1","10 August 2007"," Ruined what could've been a great trilogy
","It is very easy to bash a movie like Spider-Man 3. It has it cornball moments, its overflowing story lines, and a terrible montage sequence. Not all the villains work. Harry loses his memory and becomes the cornball of cornballs. Mary Jane fails to tell Peter about why she is truly depressed, making you want to slap her. The last fight sequence was a disappointment. Yet it is only upon reflection when you can say such things. This is my Spidey 3 review, take 4.<br/><br/>The first time I watched the movie, I was so absorbed, and it fulfilled everything I had hoped for (aside from the montage sequence). But as time passed by, I began to notice more and more things and it has finally sunk in; the movie is a reduced shell, the monster that needed to escape after the great success of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is at the prime of his Spidey life; the city adores him and even has an Appreciation Day for him. But of course, happiness never lasts long in the life of young Peter Parker. His friend Harry attacks him, the case of the murder of Uncle Ben opens up once again, and MJ is having problems communicating with him. And once all these things begin taking their toll on him, a symbiote finishes it off by taking over him and he loses it.<br/><br/>The symbiote, sadly, is like watching a really bad parody of Jim Carrey in The Mask. He parades around the town trying to win over the ladies (which he never succeeds), and even begins dancing. I've seen the movie two times, and I cringed and turned away both times I saw that. It was devastatingly painful to see what Sam Raimi had done to Spider-Man. Thankfully, this didn't last too long, and right after, he removes the symbiote in probably the best Spidey scene yet.<br/><br/>Speaking of best scenes, Spider-Man 3 contains many. As the symbiote takes over him physically, you find yourself so absorbed that you feel like the symbiote is taking you over itself. It also has my favorite fight scene which is the second one between Harry and Peter. It is a very brutal and dark fight, perfectly exemplifying how the symbiote really should've been. But that retarded montage sequence follows right after it.<br/><br/>I also liked Kirsten Dunst's performance in the movie. In the past two films she had an occasional semi-corny moment, but that's gone. She has matured as an actress and does good in her role (too bad it was poorly written).<br/><br/>James Franco also did a nice job- when he was a baddie. When he loses his memory you do feel for him but yea, he's corny. As a baddie, the guy is a genius. Too bad it was only during the beginning and middle/end of the movie in which he was GG2.<br/><br/>Speaking of villains, I have to say that 2/3 villains worked. Tose villains were Sandman and GG2. Sandman was nearly as good as Doc Ock in Spidey 2, but he was really only there because Maguire and Raimi liked him. They had to include him being the killer of Uncle Ben just to try to give him some purpose in the film. Thomas Haden Church did a magnificent job in the role and his villain was a marvel to watch on the silver screen, but he was probably the least important villain in the film and should've been taken out. Like I already said, GG2 I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>But Venom. Tsk tsk, Raimi, tsk tsk. One reviewer said Venom was really just bait to draw in viewers and they could make more than they spent ($250 mil is a lot for a movie). The reviewer was probably right; I liked Eddie Brock and Venom was more powerful than Spidey but his one weakness kills him and his fight is poorly done. As a matter of fact, most of the battle between Spidey and Venom was Spider-Man falling down and Eddie Brock talking to Peter. Eddie Brock had enough screen time to be developed as a character, but was misused, making him the least effective of the villains.<br/><br/>Other small roles include Gwen Stacy and a quick scene with Willem Dafoe. Willem Dafoe is brilliant but the brilliance is shortlived since his scene ends as soon as it started. And Gwen Stacy probably had 2 or 3 scenes total, which was certainly not enough time to give her even 2-dimensional character development.<br/><br/>Action sequences and CGI were good as usual. Aside from Harry vs. Peter the second time, none of the action sequences lived up to the ones in the first two. I did like Venom's with MJ on the web but his fight afterwards was pathetic. And Sandman degraded the fight.<br/><br/>The love story was very tight, and was so sad. This probably worked best. But because the film had the longest running time they had to cut it off and end the movie leaving their relationship questionable. The movie ended with one of these scenes and I was very disappointed; the movie ended too soon.<br/><br/>This is a sad movie in the Spidey saga (since they now have confirmed three more Spider-Man films). While the movie certainly had its highlights, each one had at least one flaw and whatever wasn't a highlight was severely flawed, degrading the presentation of the film. The trailers were deceiving and the hype they built up around the movie was full of lies. We can only pray that Spider-Man 4 will be better and that Sam Raimi will have learned to follow in the footsteps of Spider-Man 2 rather than take the script into his own hands. 6.7/10.<br/><br/>By the way, Bruce Campbell's cameo is great!"

","Out of all the sequels I've seen, this is possibly the worst ever.<br/><br/>* The special effects seem very ""digital"" and unrealistic<br/><br/>* The script is obvious, full of bad lines and really just pathetic<br/><br/>* The actors don't really get much to work with, so they seem bland and uninterested<br/><br/>* The director has tried to cram too many stories into one move, and you never get to sympathise with any of the characters<br/><br/>* It feels like the movie is full of obvious product placements<br/><br/>* Everything you see is very black and white, the characters are so spelled out that nothing becomes exciting. They become caricatures of characters, not someone you could be interested in.<br/><br/>* Instead of flowing naturally, it's very sequence-oriented and stiff, and the transitions from sequence to sequence often feel very contrived<br/><br/>To sum it up - this is a movie made exclusively to earn big money, with no heart, no soul and no passion. Even the special effects can't save this pile of commercial crap.<br/><br/>Shame on you Stan Lee and Sam Raimi! You could have done something much better than this."
"Davi-Jones","7","0","1","4 August 2007"," Though a harbinger of novel horizons in visual effects, Spiderman3 is not even in keeping emotionally with the previous Spiders.
","Tobey Maguire is marvelous as usual.He has given us a believable earthly Peter Parker as Christian Bale has done the same with Batman. Peter Parker is a down-to-earth character. someone just like one of us and actually, in some scenes, he becomes ONE OF US.I cannot wait to see the fourth and even the fifth time Toby performs Peter because so unbelievably believable he does his job that one cannot tell Toby from Peter apart. As for the young Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst, she's a beautiful actress, I mean a perfect one, and in some scenes she shows what she is made of, but generally her performance is not comparable to that of Toby Maguire. Kirsten Dunst has done all her best, but I do believe as a young and of course Promising young actress she can do it better.<br/><br/>But there are some horrible mistakes in the last Spider movie,for example Harry's steward comes just out of nowhere, he comes out of blue and with a simple short saying changes an angry young man's insatiable appetite for revenge.... This steward wasn't even in the previous movies, at least he wasn't mentioned as an influential character.<br/><br/>And for James Franco I do believe he is a great Harry Osborn but his change of direction, his shifting of horses in midstream and sacrificing his life for Spiderman that he has been so earnestly desiring to kill is bizarre.But we mustn't be oblivious of the fact that his performance has given us so much passion and pleasure in the previous movies and in here he has done the same job.<br/><br/>One last and MOST IMPORTANT mistake of the movie or the producers is showing the stars and stripes too much, I cannot tell whether we are watching a movie or an advertisement of America's flag?? Why does Spidy always holds to the flag when this act seems most out-of-place??????? I DON'T SAY THAT AMERICA'S FLAG IS UNIMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE TOTALLY REMOVED FROM THE MOVIE,but the director and producers must show it more wisely and more cautiously,because in this last 3 pictures, the flag has been too much shown and too much exhibited."
"mgchainsaw","8","0","1","28 July 2007"," It delivers, but...
","First of all, I want to say that I gave the movie an 8 and I do recommend it, but the comments here may be more about what's wrong with the movie than what's right. In the end, however, it had all the excitement and thrills that you paid for, and actually does have a message and in the end delivers that message in a satisfactory way. That's why I really recommend it, and feel I got my $10 worth.<br/><br/>Now, let's nitpick. I can't help but feel that the main 3 actors in the movie (MaGuire, Dunst, and Franco) pretty much mailed in their parts this time. And it really is a shame. The main theme through the movie of everyone battling the good and the evil within should have given these folks the incentive or the ""meat"" to really give a better effort. I really did like MaGuire in the first movie, but he's just not suited to sustain this part through these sequels. His heart isn't really in it any more. Never liked Kirsten Dunst, and she really just portrays MJ as a b*tch more than anything else. Franco played Harry too corny when he was ""good Harry"" and too - I don't know the word I'm looking for here, wimpy? stupid? overmatched? - as ""bad Harry"". I couldn't help but start thinking about who WOULD have been good in these roles, and for fun sake I would say - Ryan Reynolds as Spidey. Rose Byrne as MJ. I don't know, maybe even Tom Welling as Harry. Don't feel like writing a book, so I'm not going to go into the whys about this.<br/><br/>Anyway, there were certainly spots in this movie that seemed forced, they tried to get a lot of plot in a very short time, and some of the supposed to be funny scenes were just plain dumb (the ""bad Peter"" scenes where he's dancing were just embarrassing).<br/><br/>All this said, through the good work of the director, special effects, Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman and surprisingly, Topher Grace as Venom, the overall message of forgiveness and ""there but for the grace of God go I"" manages to come through in the end with full emotional impact, and for that I am thankful. The story and message were quite a task to fit into an action movie, and they did, in the end, pull it off. Still, it bothers me that the main actors in the movie cashed their huge checks and did not feel the onus to put forth commensurate effort. To Tobey and Kirsten (maybe Franco, I'm not really convinced that he just isn't any better, though): Yes, we all know sci-fi/action movies are beneath you, but you accepted the role, and I feel that the work of everyone else in the production deserved a better effort. There, I said it."
"brian8057","6","0","1","23 July 2007"," To much Love story not enough spidey!!!!
","Firstly I would like to comment on the good points about the film. The action was brilliant, from the sandman to venom it was great. The CGI was flawless and I really enjoyed seeing Venom off the comic book and onto the screen.<br/><br/>Now onto all the things I hated about this. The love story between Peter and Mary Jane bored me to tears I just wanted her to get squashed by the taxi to end it. I really like Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Mcguire but they were both very poor. The dancing and singing parts were cringe worthy and it turned into a comedy rather than an action film.<br/><br/>I had been really looking forward to seeing this film but I am afraid it was totally spoiled by the dancing and singing and the fact the love out weighed the action.<br/><br/>Come on we really wanted to see spiderman not the peter parker show."
"daltonml-1","10","0","1","21 July 2007"," He's Back For Number 3, And He's Still Spidey!
","I finally saw ""Spider-Man 3"" and will say, despite what others say negatively, I say positively. This movie was great! Tobey Maguire scores another hit in the movie saga of Marvel's Wall-Crawling Top Dude. Kirsten Dunst remains hot as Mary Jane Watson, and J.K. Simmons is even better than ever as J. Jonah Jameson, only more meaner and hot-tempered since part 2. The villains were Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and New Goblin (James Franco), also known as Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, whose dad was Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) in part 1. I don't see what all the big bad complaining's about, I loved this one, not as much as I loved part 2, yet Spider-Man's still got it in him to be the hero to save the day. However, in this one, he shows a dark side to his personality that reminded me of the dark side of Superman in 1983's ""Superman III"". And like all other heroes, he must get this dark side out of the way if he wants to be loved and respected by the people again. Redemption is the name of the game here. I might sound a bit preachy here, but two themes are also shown in a Biblical way in the movie: Sacrifice And Forgiveness. I refuse to say how or when it occurs, but it's there. Look for it! Altogether, ""Spider-Man 3"" was great, and if for some reason the cast and crew decide to ""Spider-Man 4"", I'll be along for one more spin, because nobody plays Spidey better than Tobey Maguire. 'Nuff Said!"
"georgevader","8","0","1","19 July 2007"," A fine but flawed third outing
","The first Spider-man movie for me, alongside 'Batman Returns', was, and still is one of the great comic book movie adaptations ever, great story, characters you cared about and some great action set pieces.The second Spidy movie gained even more plaudits, except for me, yeah it was still great to look at but it was starting to get bogged down in Peter Parker's private life, and more so, Mary Jane's.<br/><br/>So we come to Spider-man 3, and I have to admit was wasn't expecting that much, but over-all I was pleasantly surprised.Let's deal with the major minus point this film has, one inherited from the previous film, Mary bloody Jane.This character spends the entire movie, moaning and complaining about how her career isn't panning out as hoped, how Spider-man is too busy to pay her enough attention.Please, if there's a fourth outing can we please kill this irritating excuse for a woman off!The scene in the restaurant when Parker slaps her made me stand up and cheer, yes that's how much she annoyed me.Another minor niggle was that there were a lot of villains for one movie, I thought Venom was nothing more than Spider-man with nasty pointy teeth.<br/><br/>Let's limit the amount of bad guys so that the one's we do have get plenty of time to smash things up,fight Spider-man and generally cause havoc. Now onto the good stuff, again the film is a visual feast, the scenes involving Sandman were spectacular and also the scene early on involving the crane.An appearance by Bruce Campbell is always a bonus, especially when his character is a snooty French restauranter.The action is fast and furious, yeas it does get a little bogged down with the amount of characters but this is two hours of fine pop-corn entertainment.<br/><br/>8/10"
"zaluchu","6","0","1","28 June 2007"," A Disappointment... really!
","Spiderman 2 being better than the first movie didn't make the third one better... People are highly enthusiastic to see it, true! but the moment that they stepped out of the theater they might wonder if the movie they'd just watched was really the movie they had waited for. don't get me wrong, this movie was not bad.. it's good but just waaayy below expectations.<br/><br/>The special effects was excellent, the acting was great (except when Peter wears the black spidey suit and become the 'bad' Peter. i think that was too much). it's just lacking of character development, especially the villains (Venom, Sandman, and Harry..? Come on, there was even no character building at all). the most ridiculous part was when the Osborn's maid tells Harry to help Spidey (not exactly like this, but you'd know what i meant if you've watched it)<br/><br/>Now I've heard that Marvel might want to make the second trilogy. well, if that really true, Marvel, I beg you: please make them better, at least from the third. Spend more time and budget on scriptwriting rather than advertising and marketing, PLEASE..<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good movie, but have put the trilogy down a notch.<br/><br/>I would thank Disney, though, to have released Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End not too long after Spidey 3. At least it could cure my disappointment.<br/><br/>6/10"
"ParanoidAndroid879","Null","0","1","25 June 2007"," Fairly Disappointing
","The third spidey features the classic foes The sandman who can turn himself into sand. Venom who is an alien symbiote who transforms the wearer into something totally different. Sandman is a crook on the run and runs into a atomic particle testing area this turns him into the particles they were testing, sand. Meanwhile peter faces issues with harry now the Green Goblin 2. Eventually the alien symbiot takes control of peter completely altering his life. Thus the battle within himself begins.<br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed in this movie. It has its usual scenes with spidey kicking the baddies butt. but the movie has some extreme problems.The biggest problem with this movie would have to be the lack of Venom. He seemed way to forced into this movie. There is also a half hour scene that focuses way too much peters love life and personal issues. The problem with this is that its kind of hard to take comic book characters seriously. Kids also love to go see spidey and they may get bored through some of it.<br/><br/>I understand how they are trying to give villains more morales but i think they go a bit too far in this one. Especially because Venom is the one in the comics who has some morals in this movie he has no morals. The movie is semi decent but drags on at some points and extremely disappointing because i expected fantastic. Well spidey 4 might have carnage and hopefully the whole story will revolve around him."

","With wifey away, decided to go and catch a flick. Wasn't heaps out, so settled on Spiderman 3, a movie I figured would be best viewed at the movies.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 picks up with MJ(Dunst) and Peter/Spiderman(Maguire) in love and all things are going great. Things get much better when early on Harry faces of with Spiderman and comes off second best, badly hitting his head which causes memory loss and for him to forget that Pete is Spiderman. Just when it seems life is perfect things take a nosedive. MJ's career is dealt a massive blow when she's dropped from her just released theatre show, a new photographer comes onto the scene at the Globe and a new enemy rises, Sandman. Soon Pete is going through a series of crisis's and things go worse when he is somehow dealt a black spidey suit, which takes over and makes him feel indestructible and overconfident.I won't go into much more detail, but Spiderman faces his biggest challenges ever in all facets of his life.<br/><br/>The movie is OK, but things happen a little too conveniently, even for a superhero movie. The action is just too overdone and actually gets dizzying at times. Tends to drag at times as well. A great performance by Maguire, who carries the movie, with little support from Dunst who just has to portray two emotions- despair and sadness."

","This movie stinks. While the plot is easy to follow, and the individual performances are fine (but not great), the movie is confused.<br/><br/>It's lacking action for an action movie. This is probably it's worst failing-it simply does not have enough action. <br/><br/>It's lacking real romance for a romance movie. <br/><br/>It lacks comedy for a comedy or spoof. <br/><br/>In short, the director did not have a clear idea of what he wanted, and it shows.<br/><br/>Spiderman was one of my favorite comics as a child, but this one would be a great disappointment to most fans, IMO.<br/><br/>Beter than Pirates 3, but that is nothing to brag about."

","This movie rocks! The John Travolta tribute seemed a little dated, though. Zena's writer and creator has come a long way from the Evil Dead series. His cut on Raimi style movie making hits home with a formula of pleasing Hollywood and satiating the appetite of comic readers at the same time. The trilogy of villains seem to indicate the pulling out of all stops to make the movie jump off the screen. I even like the way he finds characters for his first hit maker, Bruce Campbell. The way he cuts straight to business by showing the the heart of each character is interesting but also a bit disappointing to the true comic readers. Still, it brings the expedience of movie making to light and allows any viewer to accept them without reading the backgrounds from the Marvel comics. I can't wait for Spidey four."

","The Movie was really good, lot of action in the begging then got a little slowed down and turned in to a chick flick at the end. And there was one big disappointment...Venom, now this is how I remember Venom from the comics and cartoon, Venom was this strong, built, Anger Management kinda guy; like Arnold with black goo on him. Not the small weak guy off the 70's Show...and besides the whole reason I was waiting for the movie to come out was to see Venom...and I only got to see Venom for 15 minutes. What would have been really good was to see Venom and Carnage fight Sider-Man, not the goblin and sandman and then Venom just shows up randomly...but I like the bell tower scene that part they did very well on; just like the cartoon and comic book. But Come on Venom is the best Villain there is, that whole movie should have been about him. But overall it was a good movie and I enjoyed it I even saw it again after opening day."
"liveloveburndie_x","8","0","1","3 June 2007"," What's all the fuss about?
","Okay so no, I am not a huge spider man fan. I enjoyed the first two films as everyone did, but I have never read a comic or touched a toy. But seriously, what's wrong with this movie? If you've been living under a rock, the geek-turned-superhero Spider Man is back for his third adventure. This time, he's not fighting one, but two - Sandman and Venom - villains whilst keeping his relationship with Mary Jane in tact. Harry Osborne is the ""new"" green goblin, revenging his fathers death. I saw Spider Man 3 on opening weekend - of course - and really enjoyed it. The action, characters, everything works fine.<br/><br/>With the films length being the longest in the series yet, you would expect more action and more character development. When the action hits, it really hits. The technology is amazing & the sandman fights are stunning. But depending on what you prefer, the lack of action could be this films main flaw. The final 'battle' could have been longer and personally did not hit quite hit the nail on the head. The fights with Venom and Harry are, as always, well done and effective. All the special effects are just mind blowing, some of the best I have ever seen. You could sum the action and technology up in one sentence; Although it is rare in this third film, when our friend Spidey gets himself into trouble it is amazing to watch and the technology just gives it the kick it needs.<br/><br/>The storyline and characters I found were not as good as the second film, but far better than the first. Thomas Haden Church plays a great Flint Marko/Sandman and the backing story for him is interesting to say the least. Topher Grace's character Eddie Brock/Venom brings in more depth and I believe has much less screen time. Both characters are enjoyable and both Thomas and Topher are satisfying as their villains. The one major flaw in this film for me is simple; I did not like Peter Parker. I just didn't. I thought the dark Spider Man was great but they ruined it with the so called 'emo' Peter Parker. That did not help my opinion on Peter either, but overall I just thought Tobey made Peter into a bit of an ass. Mary Jane was not one bit different, I could not see her character develop whatsoever. I found Harry to be the most interesting, and I despised Gwen Stacy. All characters in Spider Man 3 have their flaws and most have their moments but overall I thought the characters let this film down the most. The storyline was on par, nothing too great. It is of course hard to write a superhero movie with 3 villains and maintain relationships, have a job, and defeat them all - all within 150 minutes - without letting the quality of the script slip a little and have a few dull scenes etc etc. The acting was defiantly on par, I thought everyone did a great job. I must also note that the humorous scenes were indeed that - hilarious. Being a die hard horror fan I of course have seen - and own - the Evil Dead series and I was delighted to see Raimi gave Bruce Campbell another cameo. He was fantastic, I enjoyed his performance more than the second movies cameo. Although I did not like the 'emo' Peter Parker, I did enjoy bringing out the shooters and dancing down the street, it was hilarious.<br/><br/>Spider Man 3 is NOT a masterpiece, but I do not understand why everyone is saying it's awful or it's boring. I enjoyed the film, yes there were flaws in it but every film has flaws - yes, even The Godfather."
"AdderCowley","6","0","1","2 June 2007"," Disappointing
","Spider Man 3 promised so much but delivered little. Firstly too many villains. Sandman was not really a great part of the film, apart from the device of being Ben Parker's true murderer. He delivered little in my opinion. Secondly, the character of Venom (not mentioned by name) was brought in too late in the film, really he was only used for the climax of the movie. Unfortunately the main flaw of the film was its concentration of about 88% on the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary-Jane. This meant the film was stretched over 2 1/2 hours of screen time, about the same length of POTC: At World's end, which has been severely criticised for its length.<br/><br/>Finally, god, shut up with the romance. There was only about 4-5 fights in the film, about 1 every 1/2 hour. All the rest was Parker and Mary Jane talking...Talking!!!!! All the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All in all disappointing."

","When I first saw Spiderman 1&2 I was not very impressed. However, when I went back to them i quite enjoyed them. They were, in my opinion, not the best comic book films, but not the worst, either. This one was a disappointment. Not only was it quite boring (the whole film followed the same romance-fight scene-romance sequence) but the villains were unspectacular, and in Venoms case,pointless. This annoyed me in the sense that Venom is one of the most famous villains, and his desperately short screen time disappointed me. Sandman was an interesting character, but not a great enemy. In my opinion it should have been Rino. Peter Parker and Mary Jane are OK characters, but hollow and predictable, even if their acting is top notch. So, I find myself drawn to Harry Osbourne. He is the best character in the film, and his performance is not overdone so is easy to watch. The Directing, is good though, and the fights brilliantly mastered, but few and far between. Bruce Campbell is great in his small part.<br/><br/>So, it is OK. May be better as a rental, or if you are a really big fan of the Spiderman series.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Comic adaptations, I recommend the following: Ghost Rider, Batman Returns/Begins, Superman, Blade (1+2), and Fantastic 4 rise of the Silver Surfer."
"Victorious_One","7","0","2","31 May 2007"," I just came back from the theater, and I WILL defend Spider-Man 3 against all of those who had this one common criticism about the movie...
","I'll try to write a comment as briefly as I could, and I'll start off by saying that I had such high expectations for the third sequel of Spider-Man. And one lesson I learned is to never expect too much from ""things."" Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man 3 was a great film, but it had too many flaws. A lot of the dialog was a little...cheesy, or should I say, corny. But I guess that's something we should probably expect from a comic-based Spiderman movie. Another thing, is that I didn't get that sense of spidy impression I got from the first two, which I really loved. The impression and mood I got from the third sequel was a little...twisted? But it could be just me.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Spider-Man 3 has some great special effects that had me jumping out of my seat. Another positive note is the movie's plot. I thought its story would be predictable, but it turned out to be full of surprises.<br/><br/>I have read many comments from others criticizing Spider-Man 3 of having too many things going on at the same time. Let me tell you this: THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE THIRD SEQUEL NEEDED. Imagine having to follow up with only one side of the movie's story. In other words, it would be BORING if the movie only centered around one villain or the main character. <br/><br/>People, making a third sequel to a great franchise is not easy! Nevertheless, it was done. How? The movie had all the extra side stories, which tied in maybe a little too perfectly, yet good enough to make the movie interesting and not as boring as it could have been.<br/><br/>So is the movie good? It's great! Is it better than the first two? No! But it definitely did well to hold up as a third sequel!"

","First off, Spider-Man 3 is an exciting, dazzling and absolutely great Summer popcorn blockbuster; But it's nowheres as superb or dynamic as Spider-Man 2 and it's just barely better than Spider-Man. The stunts, special effects, performances and action sequences and the villains are the main attraction here, although one should feel slightly disappointed that we don't get an adequate amount of Venom in this installment and we get too much of the Sandman. The character developments (in a way) lack depth and not very much is explained, especially for the Sandman, who at points, can be punched through, knocked through the air and even transform into a huge sand-monster. Spider-Man 3 is a great installment in the series and fortunately it doesn't really fall victim to the ""Third Installment Curse"" which has consumed Star Wars, Batman and Superman entries, but it has it's flaws. Spider-Man 3 is an adventure that will wow you and tickle your eyes and it's actually enjoying, but if you think too hard about it or view it with a closed, too serious mind, it won't be really great. ****1/2 out of *****"
"ven2s","7","0","2","29 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 a bit long...but
","Spiderman 3 is a bit long but gets its message of forgiveness and redemption across quite well. The other message; allowing one's dark side to take over and all the consequences, is very obvious; like StarWars, there are consequences or choosing a wrong path. Unlike the former installments, which used there time more effectively and told poignant stories. This installment is a bit too long winded and borders on preachy. But who cares, it's Spiderman and the special effects are great! There are also some memorable scenes between Mary and Peter and between Harry and Peter and even the Sandman. Forgiveness is the key that moves one from a dark past, into a brighter future."

","I remember seeing the first Spiderman at a drive in, and I remember being stricken not by Peter Parker himself, but by his opposition. One thing I must commend the makers of this franchise for is the amount of heart put into the bad guys! As the bad guy torch passed from father to son right at the end of number 2, I knew we would be in for something awesome in the third. And I wasn't disappointed. Then the best of the worst came onto the screen with the Sandman, and I was completely blown away. I really have to give these movies the award for giving the most heartfelt stories to the baddies, between Sandman, Harry and Venom, I declare this movie completely, insanely awesome!

When i got in and me alone i was the only person in the cinema i was blown away with this film. The special effects were great the acting to the villains and even the humor was great. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact in the end everybody was feeling sorry for each other and forgiving each other like nothing had never actually happened which does not happen in real life under any circumstances.

"atlastorm","6","0","1","24 May 2007"," You don't impress every time you swing
","If the Spiderman series is to continuously rake in profits, it must try to emulate movies like Harry Potter, where the character is developed with each installment.<br/><br/>This is the main thorn in the latest edition of Spiderman, in which we learn nothing new about Peter Parker except that he can be bad (but only if an alien invades his body). Mary Jane continues all the expressions that come under 'wishful thinking' and 'frustration'. <br/><br/>The Villains are all good guys-turned evil. I wonder why the producers of Spiderman have forsaken really evil villains. It is easy to see the pattern: Spiderman gets invaded by an alien - he becomes bad - then becomes good. The Sandman gets turned into sand - he becomes bad - then becomes good. The Green Goblin still gets haunted by this father - he is bad - but then gets bumped in the head and turns good. Brock just happens to turn bad, and gets unlucky.<br/><br/>And there is only so much swinging you can take. After a while, like a roller coaster ride, it loses its charm. In my opinion, the worst in the series so far."

","The thing about this movie is that it's just unnecessary long! I don't think it sucks, but it would have been a lot better if they had cut it down a bit! It did end up a bit boring a few times and sometimes some scenes felt repeated. Some of the effects could have been better (after all these types of movies we are used to these amazing effects), but in most of the movie it worked fine.<br/><br/>The actors did a fine job. Tobey was supposed to be getting big headed by all the fame right? Well he really made me just dislike him for some parts. But all in all, I like Tobey and he did a good job. Kirsten has some sweet moments in the movie and I think she's a good actress, but I didn't really think much of her here. She was just there kinda. And all the singing! Common! I liked James Franco a lot and how his character changes from being revengeful to all friendly again and then ""evil"" again. Just sweet role. Made it more sad at the end though. The music were really cool as well.<br/><br/>So to sum up. The length pulled the movie down a bit, but I give it a 6!"

","My fiancÃ©e is typically a person who does not watch comic book-based movies. However, after this movie, even she came out of the theater wanting to be Spiderman. I thought that the movie was well done. However, the one thing I hated about the movie is that Venom was vanquished pretty easily. I know a lot of nerds are giving this movie bad reviews JUST for this very reason, but that is ridiculous. You have to admit that this movie is good because it is a comedy, a tragedy, and an action film all at the same time. It is hilarious with the way Peter acts with the Venom symbiote on him, it is sad when Harry gets killed, and it there is plenty of action all around. I think they should have used Sandman in Spiderman 2, and let Venom have his own movie and made him more formidable, or they could have saved Sandman for Spiderman 4. However, I think that the movie was very well done. It may have not lived up to comic book nerd standards, but I am not a comic book nerd."

","This movie was not very good, but then again I didn't really expect it to be (after seeing the 2nd one). To tell you the truth, the only reason I saw this movie was because of James Franco (who looked wonderful by the way). The acting was horrible (as usual) and it was way longer than it needed to be. Am I the only one who is tired of that old lady's talking?! The only reason I was entertained by this movie was because it was funny. But I don't even think the writer or director meant for it to be as funny as it was to me. It was just all the stupid-sounding lines that everyone had and the odd faces they put on when they were angry or upset. Thankfully it wasn't quite as horrible as number 2!"

Although the film did at times feel episodic it was never boring or muddled. Its such a good ride i'll even forgive them changing their own story and saying Sandman was involved in Ben's death(!). For once Tobey Maguire's curious/comical face and expressions didn't put me off (like in the Train part of SM2). The only bad part of the film was the cheesy bar dance sequence (as unfortunate as the wrestling scene from SM1) and the usual ""God bless America, look at me on a flag, isn't New York great"" bit.

"Robert_duder","8","0","1","22 May 2007"," Spiderman 3 single handedly takes on the question...can you have too much of a good thing??
","You can definitely have to have too much of a good thing. Spiderman 3 is the first film to truly be so packed it's practically bursting at the seams. I expected to see this film and disagree with all its critics but instead I found myself agreeing with everything they said. The film is busy and drama heavy, and story driven but the content of Spiderman 3 is enough for literally 3 different films so you feel like you're often watching 3 different installments of Spiderman. It's like they decided to give you Spiderman 3-7 all in one shot. If Spiderman 3 wasn't...well Spiderman 3 this could have potentially killed this series but fortunately despite heavy negatives in the film Spiderman 3 also had some MAJOR good that really balance the scales. The one definitive thing about Sam Raimi's Spiderman since day one is that it's very down to earth, they are the guys and girls next door and the stories have always been emotionally driven and packed full of action and Spiderman 3 still holds true to that formula.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker and Spiderman. There was something lacking from this performance, perhaps a bit of boredom on the part of Maguire. He seems to have milked the character all he could and it was more a job to him than something he believed in. That being said he still pulls off the hero better than anyone else could. Kirsten Dunst also returns as Mary Jane Watson. Dunst has taken all three films to really hone the character of Mary Jane to balance it between the script, the fans and her own performance and I think she's come a long way and does a terrific job. Her and Tobey have terrific chemistry and are good together. James Franco returns as, the bent on vengeance, Harry Osbourne who gets to return to his old self when he loses his memory. I think Franco is very talented and has had some truly terrific roles and Harry Osbourne/The New Goblin is one of them and the turning point for him in the end really make this a terrific character. Maguire, Dunst, and Franco have had truly great chemistry since day one and Spiderman 3 is no different. Newcomers include Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko and The Sandman. Church is a strong performer but the script here doesn't give him a lot to work with although they really do try to give him a back story. His character is the type of bad guy that deserved an entire film dedicated to him but instead he gets one fourth shared with the other villains. Most of his performance is CGI which is done brilliantly so I don't think Church is given his fair shake and I hope he gets a future Spiderman flick to make up for it. Topher Grace is the slightly slimy adversary to Peter Parker who eventually gets turned into Venom. Grace is good, there is nothing wrong with his performance but he gets ripped off because if ANYONE deserves an entire story line dedicated to him it would be comic book legend Venom and in fact it's not until the last 45 minutes of the film that he gets revealed. Grace is one of several of the new characters who gets buried beneath the multiple villains. Bryce Dallas Howard is the newest gal on the block and I think her addition was a good one. So far Dunst's Mary Jane hasn't had any competition for the leading lady and Howard does a decent job and she's sweet and complex and a good addition. Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons (who is hilarious and gets some great lines), Dylan Baker, Bruce Campbell, and Willem Dafoe all return in various degrees to reprise their roles from previous Spiderman flicks.<br/><br/>The action scenes are brilliant, the fights are intense and the mid-air acrobatics appropriately stunning and the CGI is probably the best it has ever been in the series. So here's the beefs. WAY TOO MANY VILLAINS!! Sandman, Venom and even New Goblin all deserved their own film instead of forcing them all into one film that got very crowded for some very cool villains. I found some glaring inconsistencies with the story like how Spiderman manages to take a colossal beating from giant sand fists and still walk away from it?? The one thing for me that really got to me and it's always been present in the Spiderman films but Spiderman always ends up with his mask off or torn to reveal his face and he's gotta be one of the worst super heroes as far as keeping his identity a secret. Every villain discovers his identity and he seems to spend a lot of time with his mask off. I think a Superhero and his alter ego need to be kept distinctly separate because there is this aura of power to each side of his identity and that line is very, very blurry in the Spiderman movies. Keep your mask on and get a better tailor so your suit doesn't rip every time you get punched. The entire story of the black suit could have been done a little differently...I think the entire segment of Peter disco dancing down Times Square was cheesy as hell and completely unnecessary. There were a little downs to this third installment BUT it is still worth seeing because of the glaring positives and incredible action and great story from this trilogy to date and Spiderman 3 has already moved into position of being the highest grossing film of all time. Go see it in the theater and just take heed that it's a little heavy on some things but they got carried away and a little excited. Hopefully this won't be the last of the web slinger and his friends. 8.5/10"

","Oh Spiderman, I really wanted to like you. And overall, I did. But the few glitches and problems that fluttered throughout the movie were enough to dampen my experience in the movie theater while viewing the film. The action sequences were fantastic. Fast paced, wild, acrobatic, everything that enhaces an action scene. But...the acting. Every time Harry Osbourne opened his mouth I wanted to shoot myself. And Kirsten Dunst singing? C'mon, did NOT need that. Plus the entire middle of the movie with Peter supposedly becoming ""evil"". Evil? If you call emo piano playing swing dancing badasses evil, then sure. And I'm sorry but I couldn't help but laugh after seeing Topher Grace with fangs. But although these flaws I complain about make it seem like the movie was not at all enjoyable to me, it's not true. I liked it's just a little less overall cheese out of the movie would really have made this a less laughable film and another good entry to the Spiderman series."
"armalite1016","5","0","1","22 May 2007"," This is a review for VENOM
","Again I would like to remind you this isn't so much of a review of the movie itself but for how they did Venom in the movie.<br/><br/>First off I'll say the things they got right with Venom. His suit was really cool, I liked how they made it look almost just like the comics (with the exception of the webbing patterns, but that didn't really matter), and I liked how they gave him that sarcastic dark comedic nature when he was Venom, that he always has. (such as when he says ""my Spidey sense is tingling, and I think you know what that means..."") Venom without his dark humor is not a good Venom at all, so I give props to that. Also I liked the touch of making his webbing black, AND get this, he even shot web from the top of his hand, which was a nice detail. The way they did the bell tower was also pretty good, and fairly close to the comics.<br/><br/>The bad stuff about Venom is that he didn't put up much of a fight against Spiderman, (which he can easily do in the comics, if not beat Spiderman, all Spiey has is sound, which he does end up using in the movie to beat Venom, but it was too fast) Also, Venom didn't talk much he mostly just screeched a lot like a dinosaur all the time, which is more of a carnage thing if you ask me. The far worst aspect of Venom though was his voice. He is supposed to sound like an awesome monster with a low type voice, in this he had a whiny teenage wanna be ninja turtle type voice. It was disturbing, because his voice was one of the best parts of him. Also, he din't refer to himself as ""WE"", instead using the term ""I"" for everything, and never even said his name. He was hardly in the move, too, and the fact that they killed eddie brock is a disgrace to the Venom name.<br/><br/>Overall they did some aspects cool, but mostly it was an insult to Venom fans."
"azerkainen","4","0","2","22 May 2007"," This movie was a real disappointment!
","This movie was a real disappointment! I'm not sure what happened, but I hope they get things right with number 4.<br/><br/>I don't understand why they squandered Harry Osbourne in this movie. Developing him more would have been a wise move. He could have competed with Spiderman in this film to be the best superhero, all the while fighting spidey here and there at night while the rest of the city thinks the guy is a hero. Something, anything would have been better, well maybe not anything...<br/><br/>I would have focused more on the Peter vs. Eddie dynamic. There was a lot of potential for storyline and character development wasted because the film was already too busy.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy - why did they cast someone who was of equal height to Tobey Maguire? The Sandman was a wasted space in this movie! His storyline was rushed and could have easily taken up a whole separate film. It would have been nice to have a whole film devoted to the problem spidey would face when he stopped the sandman from saving his daughter and as a result was responsible for the death of the girl. How does this work...easy...health care for the poor is a lot harsher and you're a lot less likely to get the help you need. They could have dealt with ah huge social issue.<br/><br/>Lastly, what was up with removing spidey's guilt over being responsible for killing uncle Ben? Bad writing, poor directing, global warming??? And another thing, what was up with all the romantic triangles? I understand their presence...but they were poorly executed and poorly brought to conclusion And another thing, why o why did peter have to be soooooo cheesy as bad guy spidey...why...<br/><br/>AHHHHHHHH...<br/><br/>please make part 4 better...please make part 4 better...please make part 4 better On the upside...My favorite sequence in the movie involved Bruce Campbell at the restaurant...I liked how they played out the whole mj's acting demise and spidey's fame taking off.<br/><br/>I also liked the fight scene between bad guy spidey and harry because you finally get to see spidey takes off the gloves. The question is, how much of that was Spidey and how much was the suit...<br/><br/>I really mean it this time...lastly, I would have had spidey really hurt someone in combat, maybe even kill them, as a way for him to realize that the suit is making him violent, aggressive, and generally bad."
"monk_e_fish","6","0","1","22 May 2007"," Does whatever a $250 million budget can
","With Spider-Man 2, Sam Raimi basically set the benchmark by which all superhero blockbusters are judged, exciting, funny, action packed, spectacular, with characters that you care about and a great villain, it is virtually everything you could want from this kind of movie. Naturally, this means that expectation has been incredibly high for the third and final, for Raimi at least, instalment of this super series. Unfortunately, by his own high standards, it is hard to consider Raimi's third Spider-Man to be anything other than a disappointment. That is not to say that it lacks moments of spectacle and pure summer blockbuster fun, not to mention the odd moment of genuine emotion, but it certainly does not hold together as a film and swings quite wildly from the sublime to the ridiculous.<br/><br/>That Raimi has stated pretty strongly that this will be his last Spider-Man feature even if the series continues, as it almost certainly will, is just the problem here. The film feels a lot like Raimi getting all of his good ideas in wherever he can, packing what is really two movies worth of quality material into one not only damages that material, giving it no room to breathe, but also sullies that excellent work Raimi did in the first two films to set this one up.<br/><br/>With each villain given limited screen time, they have poorly fleshed out backstories. Thomas Haden Church is a very watchable actor but even he can't sell Flint Marko's clunky sick child plot or the awkward insertion of his story into Peter Parker's own history, something that heavily undermines moments from the first film, meanwhile his actual transformation into the Sandman comes in a rather ridiculous moment in which he literally stumbles into some unexplained scientific testing site. Secondary villain Venom fares little better and the director's dislike of his villain is clear in how underused Venom is here. Indeed, in trying to juggle multiple plot lines, the film has a tendency of just losing them and then picking them up much later. With all these extra characters and plot lines, the film really does feel quite long in places despite only being about ten minutes longer than its predecessor.<br/><br/>So, the movie is deeply flawed, but this is not to say that it doesn't have multiple strong points at the same time. In his third Spidey film, Tobey Maguire is perfectly comfortable in the role and having great fun with it, nicely reflecting the newfound self confidence and pride with which Peter Parker begins this movie. His turn to the ""dark"" side is very entertaining. Critics of the film have derided the emo hair, eyeliner, finger clicking, jazz dancing sequence as not a convincing turn to evil and laughable but that is rather the point. The sequence is pure Raimi, every bit as silly and entertaining as the Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head montage from Spider-Man 2. Indeed, it is pleasing to know that in all the pre-release hype about its dark edge, Raimi hasn't lost his light touch with Spider-Man and the film is still very funny in places with J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson act still stealing scenes and the inevitable Bruce Campbell cameo his best yet, playing a French waiter whose accent is only marginally more ridiculous than his moustache.<br/><br/>Raimi has always handled the soap opera relationship stuff well and that continues here with inevitable difficulties entering Peter and MJ's relationship, leading to a new love triangle with Goblin's son Harry Osborne.<br/><br/>Ah yes, the third of the film's triumvirate of villains and Spidey 3's one unequivocal strength. With a couple of films behind him, Harry actually has sufficient backstory and motivation to give his clashes with Spider-Man that extra edge. Meanwhile, James Franco, such a promising star in TV's Freaks and Geeks all those years ago, finally has something to really sink his teeth into and he seems to relish bringing out both Harry's charming side and his vindictive one. Even the slightly ridiculous amnesia plot works well, allowing Harry some moments of genuine bonding with Peter that highlights the tragedy of the way their relationship has gone. Of course, Harry at last gets the chance at some proper superpowers and a chance to have a real go at Spider-Man, or rather at Peter, because their clashes play out while our protagonist is not in his Spidey persona which just makes them extra effective. The first is a very cool looking action sequence which showcases the much better New Goblin costume and a great moment in which Peter does his wall climbing thing on a wall tumbling to the ground, their second is a down and dirty scrap that ends with the dark Peter in his one moment of genuine nastiness.<br/><br/>Indeed, Spider-Man 3, even while it doesn't quite match the train sequence in Spider-Man 2, does deliver on some explosively entertaining action sequences. While the Sandman's transformation is poorly introduced, the moment that the sand comes together again to form a man is a triumph of special effects as is the scene in which Spidey sheds his Venom suit and it latches onto Brock.<br/><br/>A film of poor plotting but great moments, then, rather than the final triumph some would have hoped for after Spidey 2, Spider-Man 3 is a flawed but entertaining slice of summer blockbuster fun. ***"

All the actions sequences were looking like being played in fast-forward, may be just to cover up, the similarlity to the action scenes in the predecessors.<br/><br/>While the director speeds up the action sequences, he does'nt do any editing of the useless repeated melodromatic moments in the movie. Mary Jane keeps on struggling with her emotions throughout the movie, and for no apparent reason Peter Parker is not able to sense that.<br/><br/>If the director really wanted to make an 2:30 hour epic, then he probably would have needed some more songs from Kirsten Dunst, or probably Shakira thrown in for an item number.

","Not bad except for that hour in the middle:) Too much cryin, not enough dyin. The story just kind of wanders all over the place, like it was written by someone who had never seen what a movie script looks like. Probably the worst superhero movie I have ever seen and I really liked the first two. Too many villains, and Peter Parker's social ineptitude is getting really old. At the end I didn't really care about any of the characters, although the Sandman villain was the most interesting.

The scene in which Peter starts dancing in the club was for me the moment where the film started to jump the shark. The special effects were excellent, but there were too many villains- they could have left Sandman out of the picture. I could see the shock at the end coming a million miles away (my hubby saw it was coming too). There was too much going on. Spiderman 3 needed cutting- cutting out all the musical numbers would help tremendously. I agreed with the critic: Mary Jane's singing sucked.

And seeing him come out of the store pelvic thrusting..i busted up laughing.<br/><br/>This is really hard for me also to write this comment cause i was in love with the first 2 but this was just bad.<br/><br/>Hopefully the 4th one will be better."

","I went into Spider-Man 3 thinking it was going to be the best of the three. From the first to the second, you could definitely see a huge improvement. The special effects had improved, and the actors were comfortable in their characters by now, and the story just sucked me into the movie, wanting to see what happened next scene after scene. In the third installment of the Spier-Man series, I was not pulled into the movie at all. I didn't once feel anticipation, besides when i first walked into the theater. I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was finally going to be over.<br/><br/>I felt as if the special effects had sunken back down to how they were in the first installment. but they got away with it because it was the first. By the third, they should be spectacular! The script seemed slow and poorly written. The actors had seemed to lose the fire they had built up in their characters in the second, given, that could also be a script problem. Tobey Maguire seemed a little different in Spidey's shoes, and Kirsten Dunst seemed uncomfortable with her character. And James Franco...lets just say he did not ""avenge"" Willem Dafoe's character very well.<br/><br/>Some of the parts were good though, don't get me wrong. The beginning was good, and the ending was almost as spectacular as the action scenes in the second Spider-Man. New characters, Venom, Sandman and Gwen Stacey, are well portrayed by actors, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard.<br/><br/>I'd say this movie was average, not in the horrible section, but not on the must see list. Overall, I think this movie is just a disappointment to all the built up excitement many fans had."

","This movie dose a very good job on special effects. There is no question. However, the script is a total disaster. I can tell that they were trying to develop multiple aspects such as friendship, love, hate, becoming and so on. The problem is that these elements can not be smoothly implanted into one movie. That is why this movie is a mess. Due to the short length of a movie they had to compress the detail. That is why they had to use exaggerate the scene so the audience can understand the story. Some of the scene has been spoiled as a result of compressing detail.<br/><br/>Alien ectozoa is probably the worst part of the script. It has no relevance to previous series. It just came up no where. I wonder if the screenwriter was on drugs during the writing. Beside all that, the personnel character of Spiderman himself has changed entirely. He was an understated hero, but now he kiss in front of the crowd."

We've seen the trailer time after time and we're still not bored about it. Why? Because the first two Spider-Man were great and we all love the friendly neighbor hood Spider-Man.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer I was blown away by the CGI on Sandman. Green Goblin...I mean New Goblin suit is cool although he looks nothing like a goblin. And then trailer after trailer they finally showed Vemon and well...he looks kind of small. And finally, I went to watch Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>I'll try to make this short. The story goes like this. Peter Parker/Spider-Man is still protecting the city and now he finally wanted to pop the question to Mary Jane. Later out of no where New Goblin came and attack Peter. Then Ben Parker actual killer became sandman and terrorize the City. Then an alien came to earth and takes over Peter and Peter became more powerful, then a photographer, Eddie Broke, is threatening Peter's job and Peter is stuck in the middle of Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>The story is great and it's slightly longer then the first two. Great CGI here. CGI on Sandman blown me away with all those Sand. The action sequence are well planned and beautiful shot and CGI-ed. Vemon is well CGI-ed but still he is still small in size But great work anyway. Everything in this movie is well made. Great script, camera movement, sound, CGI, Director, etc.<br/><br/>A must watch for Mavel fans/Spider-Man fans. You'll have to watch it to believe it.

Not even on DVD. Yep, I think it's that bad. The act of the ""TV Reports"" was amateur at best.. it felt as if they are reading their lines (and the lines were fairly cheesy).

It was not so because it didn't have riveting action or moments of comedic levity as was the case in the prior two Spidermans. Its just with all the story lines going on nothing really came together. Just as you were about ready to get into this movie it jerks you away and throws you into another storyline. Spider-man was an A-Rated franchise but this last installment reminds me of those lesser comic book films like...the Phantom or the Shadow that were alright but never good enough for a sequel.<br/><br/>It was very obvious that the studio factor was weighing in on this film. And this time the cash hungry executives said, ""To heck with a sensible story; instead, lets rev up the marketing on this celluloid cash cow. Lets keep every gimmick of the first two films in play, even though they really don't belong; while overplaying the romantic nonsense of boy catches girl, boy looses girl, boy ends up with best friend of boy, best friend turns out to be a bigger jerk, boy gets girl back. And because people do eventually tire of franchises after the third film lets jam-pack this movie with all the villains and subplots, and get all of the money out of it now. Of course any serious character development or finer plot details will have to be scrapped because there simply won't be any-time."" <br/><br/>Geeze studio guys with all the extra junk, there was barely any time to actually see the real (Red & Blue) Spider-Man in action with his mask on. I mean 3/4 of the time Spider-Man is either with out his mask or its torn to shreds. What is in Tobey McGuires' contract; that there has to be so much face time? I mean its great to establish the humanity side of Spider-man but Tobey and the director, Sam Raimi, has really taken it too far and has made him into a....sissy boy.<br/><br/>Bottom line is there is entertainment value to be had with this film. Heck its better than most shows on the networks. (TV is dumb, except for HOUSE) With that said, however,Spider-man 3 is just such the expected disappointment that I was hoping it would not be."

Sandman never was involved in Uncle Ben's death, Venom did not die plus Eddie Brock was way older and muscular, the suit was a gift from a cosmic character called the Beyonder in an Event called Secret Wars.<br/><br/>X-Men did not follow comics totally either but they stayed within original characters permutations - I mean come on! Harry Osborn becomes GOOD? Please, he was insane and on drugs! The issue was a classic as the use of pills made the Comics Code Of Authority refuse to put on their stamp at the time... Gwen Stacy and Capt Stacy her dad was okay, the characterisation for the cop was better using the farmer from Babe. Brock or Venom, whose name I never heard called in the picture was eventually a good guy albeit rough Bounty Hunter with The Punisher.<br/><br/>The acting was the worst I'd ever seen from Toby MacGuire, the Venom guy or even Harry seemed better as Parker!

If you don't know what I mean just think of Spider Man standing proudly for a few seconds in front of the American flag, it says it all. Boring, yet a tad entertaining. However the narrative cohesion is too calculated. For instance I didn't like the fact that Peter's class mate was seen everywhere as a victim, as a class mate, as a girlfriend, as a rival' girlfriend... etc... Everything seems to happen expectedly and unsurprisingly. A classic Hollywood good versus bad mass hit! Good for kids, but for the more discerning minds, it's a total moment of gasping annoyment."

","I, like many others, had been anticipating this movie since the first trailer came out. I guess we weren't wrong in anticipating this movie, since it looked amazing. I loved the first two films and I got my tickets right away. I walked in the theater on opening night, only to come out feeling like I had just wasted my money, which is never a good feeling.<br/><br/>The movie was very poor. I actually felt like walking out after Peter Parker started dancing. The script was the equivalent of something you'd find in a cheesy Michael Bay action movie, it was almost groan worthy. The movie tried to be too over-dramatic and came out as a rushed mess.<br/><br/>The biggest fault was with the villains. Venom seemed as though he was squeezed into the film to make more money. Sandman appeared for all of 10 minutes before disappearing. Venom was in the movie for all of 5 minutes. After the final fight, I was realized that this movie was just a rushed cash cow and nothing more.<br/><br/>If you were a fan of the first two, I suggest you stick with them. This movie is a gigantic mess and is just a very bad movie. Whoever wrote the script should be shot. The movie's only saving grace was it's special effects, but since the movie had hardly any action, it's not enough to warrant a view in the theater."

The script was really bad, the plots lacked focus, and there was too many emotional scenes that came off as really fake. Oh, and to top that off there is a scene with Peter Parker dancing in the middle of New York with his hair slicked down (did the movie people think this would make him look cool?). I think at this point I pinched myself to see if I was really awake and watching a movie whose two predecessors were so good. This moment was only topped a few minutes later by a jazz number.

","This movie is one of the heart breaking ruinations of beloved childhood memories. It has NO respect for the memory of Gwendolyn Stacy (who is played fantastically, she, Eddie Brock and Sandman each get a point, totaling the movie at 3 out of 10), who's story is in the first movie. M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) needs acting lessons and why oh why is there jazz in the movie? MJ is not a singer. She is an actor/ model. I liked Eddie Brock, he (Topher Grace) would have been my choice of Peter Parker. Maguire just does not have the Peter Parker vibe, he is portraying him as a loser, while Parker, not Spidey, is the real hero. It is all about how he handles his life, cursing the great responsibility that his great power brought him. This movie does not reflect that at all. It is all about how many bits they can put in there, not minding the rich Spider-man tradition. I mean: doesn't Harry get to marry and have a son??? It really limits the future of any Spider-man movie. I really hated this movie, which is too long, although I love spider-man. But you cannot treat Gwen this way, she is the original sweetheart. After the spider-bite and the death of uncle Ben Gwendolyn's murder by the Green Goblin is the most important factor that shapes Spider-man (you will remember that this scene was violated in Spider-man 1) Thomas Church is brilliant and shows the only aspect of the comic still surviving: villains are not naturally evil, they just turn out that way at a certain moment. But why the creators thought it was a great idea to connect everyone so closely to Peter Parker is beyond me. And why is Gwendolyn a science student? Ah well, she looked great and acted (along with Thomas Church, Topher Grace and in the first 3/4 James Franco). I can only say: I am actually hurt by this movie."

The venom part if well done could be enough for a film along with the goblin. I will not speak about Tobeys acting, the nerd Peter is way to much boring, confusing, stupid; i kinda liked the bad Peter at least he does something, he reacts, and it's funny.

","I really don't know what happen to this people in Hollywood. Sam Raimi got 3 years to finish the trilogy and everybody was expecting the ""big show"", ""the best one"", ""the golden key""... so, everybody was expecting so much and then he brings a mess.<br/><br/>The resumé of the story is simple, fragile and interesting: Peter Parker starts liking his suite more than ever. He knows how to live his personal life with his super-hero's obligations but he's starting to forget who he really is. That's a simple plot like the first 2 movies and it starts well till the audience see that it's not simple like that.<br/><br/>The mess starts with the visual effects. They are the worse of entire trilogy! It's so plastic, so unnatural... I mean... it blows on your eyes that it's truly fake that even Hulk looks better. It's not something like X-Men: The Last Stand, that you see and think: ""Wow, this visual effects are great!"" but, yes, ""WOW, THIS VISUAL DEFECTS ARE GREAT!"". Too much chroma key, even at unnecessary moments. So, if should be like this, why Tobey and Kirsten are still being cast! Let's just make a CGI Spider Man movie! Final Fantasy shown us that this is a possible thing.<br/><br/>Then, the camera: Sometimes things are too fast, lot of CGI scenes, so much action and movements making you lose points and focus. You get dizzy, everything is dark to make a camouflage over the CGI imperfections and finally... you see anything. It's something like throwing a magazine in a liquidizer, that's what the movie is all about sometimes.<br/><br/>And now, the final point: Too many villains. Too many stories. I think that Sam Raimi was so desperate to put all together just for the pleasure of the fans that he made real mistakes here. 1) all the stories loses its focus; 2) people was expecting an entire movie just about Sandman, or Venom, or the Green Goblin's return.<br/><br/>The movie goes slowly 'till its final part, then everything happens fast enough. I can see Sam Raimi at the editing room: ""OMG, 120 minutes have been edited and... where's the action??? I had 3 years of my life to make this but I could only find the right color for the black suite now, so, everything needs to be done until tomorrow morning because Saturday is the premiere! C'mon everybody, fast! Fast! FAST!"".<br/><br/>Why should you see: well, it's the end the trilogy... if you already saw the first 2, why not this one?<br/><br/>The best part: Stan Lee camel.<br/><br/>What I really think: Spider-Man is done. Sam Raimi should move to other projects, he's a great director, but he seems kinda tired of so much spiderwebs."

While watching this I had a feeling like the director didn't care and just meshed it all together, to be honest, did Sam Raimi even direct this, because it doesn't feel like any of his previous stuff? There are some good things about Spidey 3, the visual FX were outstanding compared to 1 & 2, but that alone cannot save this mediocre story. The trailers made the black suit out to be such a great story line and in the film it is barely touched upon, and what was with the musical number? I mean seriously the whole jazz club routine was completely lame on every level.<br/><br/>While watching this I was hoping Sam would have brought us back to Spidey 2 with a little horror element like the kickin operating room scene of carnage. After seeing that in Spidey 2 I said to myself nothing can top this, this is Raimi at his best. I am sad to report I was right.<br/><br/>The villains are cookie cutter paint by numbers. Neither Venom or Sandman are given enough screen time to even care about them and when they do show up it is so quick and fast it is over before you blink, and would someone please tell James Franco to go to acting classes, god he was even more horrible here than in Spidey 1.<br/><br/>I am sorry to report that Spidey 3 was a let down, at least for me, but someone has to admit it.

"signsoflife","4","0","1","16 May 2007"," Hollywood Tries to Get Serious with Spiderman ... and Fails
","Spiderman 3 did not fail as a movie because of the multiple story lines/villains, as many people have suggested. Spiderman 3 failed because it was too easy and emotional. As a result of this, the comic story lines were ruined and the true nature of Spiderman got lost.<br/><br/>I was excited to hear that Raimi (& crew) were going the traditional Spiderman route of multiple villains. At any given point in the comics, Spiderman was battling two or three villains - slinging around, shooting insults, and kicking some butt. Film (like many things) has developed beyond the point of a singular storyline. Hollywood is just getting a hold of this, which seems to be working both for and against them.<br/><br/>The idea of having multiple stories in one script is to have different people with a personal story combine to reveal a larger story. Spiderman 3 worked with three different villains, yes, but their stories were lost in Parker's overemotional and unrealistic attitude. Parker complained his way through most of the film. When he finally showed up for battle, everything solved itself.<br/><br/>Typically, good comic book films find a balance between the original storyline and a story that modern moviegoers will appreciate. This film has neither, because it failed in both respects: the emotional attachment was overdone and the original stories were basically ignored."

And the feeling hasn't left.<br/><br/>I agree, it was a lot to cram into one movie. Venom, Sandman, New Goblin, Black Spidey AND the Harry/Peter issue (but that sort of goes along with New Goblin), AND the whole Peter/M.J. problem. But I thought it made for an amazing movie. I have to admit, I kept thinking it was going to end, but I didn't want it to at all. Usually with great movies, they're over too quickly, so I was prepared for an early ending. I didn't get it. And that was great.<br/><br/>I especially loved the fight with Peter as Black Spidey and Harry as New Goblin at Harry's place. That part held some of the best quotes in the picture, and was one of the more emotional parts, for me. Two best friends, fighting. The way it differed from their original fight at the beginning was that Peter was out of it, so he kept shooting awful and hurtful comments. Harry has been my absolute favorite character for a long time, and you gotta feel sorry for the poor guy.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""Look at little Goblin, Jr. You gonna cry?""<br/><br/>I loved pretty much all the fight scenes, though I am getting a little sick of the whole ""Mary Jane: Damsel in Distress"" thing. I know it's the way these superhero movies are done, but you can only have so much of a screaming girl trapped high above the ground. Really, people.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie and the freakiness of the Green Goblin a lot. It is my second favorite Spiderman movie, next to the third. I didn't think the second was as good, because I didn't like Doc Ock, didn't like Harry, didn't like M.J...didn't like any of the characters, actually. <br/><br/>But Venom takes the cake as my favorite and the scariest villain! I wasn't so impressed by a giant Sandman. But Venom has a set of sharp teeth and a strong want for vengeance that is enough to give anyone a little shiver and a fervent hope to never meet anyone like THAT in a dark alley! <br/><br/>Overall, really great movie. My favorite, and I sort of hope they don't do a fourth. The ending was sufficient for a series, though there hasn't been a definite make-up between Peter and M.J.

"Polaris_DiB","3","0","1","14 May 2007"," No, it's actually really bad
","Most other reviews have been very good at pointing out that this movie is ""over-stuffed"" and ""weighed down"", but most other reviewers have been way too kind. This movie is ridiculous. Simply stated, any movie that thinks a hero donning an emo-swoop is a key dramatic moment deserves to be scoffed at.<br/><br/>But emo-bashing popularity aside, this movie is still bad. A third of this movie (namely, the Sandman situation), should have been cut entirely, and I mean entirely. It did nothing to serve the plot and characters, until Raimi contrived a reason involving ol' Uncle Ben's death, which has been upsetting to Spider-Man fans of all types--but still doesn't do anything for non-fans either.<br/><br/>Secondly, the resolving of the lengthy three-film arch of Peter and Harry would probably have been a good service to the characters, minus the horrible, HORRIBLE moment of selective amnesia on the side of Harry. If anyone took that and the subsequent relationship between them seriously, then they deserve to be served the fluff Hollywood is pumping out these days. Awful.<br/><br/>And thirdly, importantly, comparing this movie to the Schumacher Batmans isn't that far-fetched, considering it's overindulgence of narrative lines that eventually culminate in a weighed-down and uninteresting story of too-much-villain. No single entity in this movie except for Peter Parker and Mary Jane are given enough of a complete development to even be given sufficient screen-time (Gwen Stacy literally disappears when she's not needed, and something some reviewers don't mention often is that she's only one of THREE love interests in this film, another aspect the movie didn't need).<br/><br/>As I understand it, Raimi, Maguire, and Dunst have a pretty poor working relationship. I think it shows. Everyone looks tired, uninterested, and frustrated. Even the special effects seem rubbery and lazy, as everyone rushes to just finish up their part. As duly noted by fanboys of various types, only Bruce Campbell shows some real energy... but that's because he's Bruce Campbell, and he's awesome, and everyone knows it.<br/><br/>Leave this movie for rental or a dollar theatre. It's successful because it's a franchise, and darned be the people who don't do their civic duty in seeing it so that everyone can be cultural aware in shared mediated experience. And yes, there will be more sequels. They may not have the same people in them (but considering the money, it's still possible), but as long as we have a self-functioning profit like this, why let it go? --PolarisDiB"

The movie was all over the place, the relationships were clichéd and by the end we were just praying for it to be over. It was almost as if the Raimi's had decided this was enough of the Spiderman franchise for them so they decided to kill it rather than make another one in the future.<br/><br/>Here's hoping the Pirates and Shrek movie this year can stay true to the formulas that worked and deliver on their expectations."

","""Spiderman 3"" doesn't disappoint at all like some reviewers commented. Of course this movie has flaws but overall it delivers on many fronts! Everything looks great. Spiderman and the villains all look very real. This third part contains even more action than the previous movies! The green goblin, the sandman, the symbiont (the alien black stuff) and last but not least Venom make an appearance in this third part.(Although he doesn't appear as long as I wanted to. Also Venom spoke in the I form and not using the first person plural case (we) like he did in the comics! A minor flaw. But could have made a huge difference.) At first it seems that Sam Raimi wanted to do much. But if i think about it isn't that unusual for Spidey. In the comics he encounters many villains in one storyline all the time! I think Sam Raimi stays true to most of the stories in the comics and that is one of the main reasons why Spiderman is so great. ""Spiderman 3"" has some surprises in store (meaning that some plot lines deviate from the marvel comics). A great part of the story is consistent with the spirit of the Spidey universe! However that doesn't mean that ""Spiderman 3"" is perfect. There are some mistakes that can't be easily forgiven. First of is the character Mary Jane. She is so different from the character in the comics. Which becomes painfully obvious in this third part. In the comics she is much stronger and more confident and loves Peter for who he is. In ""Spiderman 3"" she gets jealous because Peter/Spidey gets the fame she longs for.Especially when Gwen Stacy shows interest in Peter. (In the comics it is the other way around. Gwen is Peter's first love and she is jealous of the feisty Mary Jane Parker). And if that isn't enough she even goes as far to betray Peter with his best friend Harry Osborn. Kirsten Dunst portrayal of Mary Jane doesn't help either. It is clear that she isn't familiar with the comics which is a big shame. A second mistake is the twist concerning Ben Parker's murder (Peter's uncle). I know that this plot line is inserted to add some depth to a certain character but ultimately totally unnecessary and ridiculous compared to the first two movies and the comics. The third mistake is the under use of Venom. Archenemy of Spiderman. Surely he should have gotten more screen time. There is however an explanation for this. Sam Raimi is a fan of Spiderman in the early years. And therefore is more familiar with the villains of that period. And that is the main reason why he didn't want to put Venom in ""Spiderman 3"". My guess is that end result is sort of a compromise. Even with the little flaws and mistakes ""Spiderman 3"" is an action adventure not to be missed. It still is a lot of fun!"
"dsa_ca","4","0","1","12 May 2007"," Spidey put on a show for the die hards
","The kind of situation Spiderman franchise has been put in by its creators was expected sooner or later, but not so soon, simply not in the most anticipated third installment. He is now simply a show, a clown in a circus with no background. He is using his spidey webs for impressing his girlfriend M.J by making a large web within the N.Y's green buffer for them to stare the stars and making his millions of female following wish for the same. If spidey-1 was great introduction and spidey-2 was the best superhero movie ever then this time the creators decided on milking the friendly neighborhood (cow) Spiderman with asking for more thrill and stunts. So in this movie spidey saves more damsels than ever ,whom we all together forget in the climax, fights with more number of villains and also jiggles and woo girls along the streets of Manhattan like john Travolta in Saturday night fever!!!aahhh!!! As the story goes Parker is ready to pop up the question to M.J. But Harry Osborne has different ideas. But that is not enough we need more or the marketing team needs more emotions to flow. So there is twist in the murder of parker's grandfather, the real killer has ran away and due to some scientific experiment has become the Sandman. But that also is not enough so a biological virus from outer space has taken over our spidey and has made him the villain within himself, so he should now also fight with himself and when that is removed the virus takes over his professional rival, who wants to destroy guess whom! SSPIDEYY!! Isn't that just great. So this time spidey has no time at all he has too much on his hands actually more that he could bite. Oh and in the mean time I guess the script has been misplaced and the stunt and special effect guys are giving the direction.<br/><br/>This spidey potboiler is for the die hard spidey lovers. Each and every plot is half baked and none of it has got enough screen time to blossom effectively. The climax was the most overdone and was also a bit childish and made no sense. Go and watch if u really care for spidey."

The plot and storyline was wonderful and very attention-grabbing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I really hope that there is going to be a Spiderman 4.

Spiderman 3 seems to have a few too many of these story lines, and was not able to make them flow as smoothly. Let's count the story lines just to show how many there are.<br/><br/>1. Story of Peter Parker and getting revenge for his uncle. 2. Story of Flint Marko/Sandman 3. Story of Eddie Brock 4. Story of Mary Jane 5.

"DarthBill","6","0","1","11 May 2007"," Topher Grace as Venom? What were they thinking?
","Plot in a nutshell: picking up where #2 left off - or maybe a year or so after #2 - it almost looks like Peter Parker's life has turned around for the better. He's excelling in his studies despite being hit with spitballs by lesser intellects (spitballs? come on Sam, even first graders don't do that anymore!), he has the love of his life, Mary-Jane Watson by his side, MJ just got the lead role in a Broadway musical, he's thinking of popping the question to her, and New York is loving his alter ego, Spider-Man. After the first showing of MJ's play, they enjoy a moment in a big web, staring at the moon, being romantic and affectionate towards each other, so for our hero, life is finally good.<br/><br/>But then the real world brings Pete and MJ's fantasy world crashing down around them. Old friend Harry Osborne is still out to avenge his father, Norman's death, as Norman died as Green Goblin against Spidey - derailed only by a brief memory loss - MJ gets fired from her play due to bad critical response over her singing ability or lack thereof, Peter is so high on the love he's getting from the NY populace that he's not being quite as sensitive to her as he should while she's not giving him the grounding he needs, and Gwen Stacy, a cute classmate of Peter's, seems to have her eye on him. To make things worse, Peter learns that a villain named Flint Marko, now the mutated Sandman, was the real killer of Uncle Ben ala Joker killing Batman's parents in the 1989 Batman film - though Sandman reveals it was an accident - and Peter's spot at the Daily Bugle is now being threatened by a smarmy rival photographer named Eddie Brock Jr. Then Pete's Spider-Man suit gets slimed with black goo that turns out to be an alien symbiont, that augments his powers as well as his aggression. When Peter finally realizes what the black symbiont is doing to him and what it will cost him, he rids himself of it in a church, using the noise of the ringing bell to knock it off - only to have it fall on Brock, who came to the church to pray for Peter's death by God's hand after Peter got him fired for submitting photo-shopped pictures of Spider-Man doing evil. This results in the creation of Venom, who allies himself with Sandman to kill Spider-Man. Who will survive? While it stands head and shoulders above last year's barely broke even super-turkey ""Superman Returns"", a super-heroic dud if there ever was one, Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problems that plagued last year's runaway swashbuckler hit sequel ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest"" in that it over-stuffs itself and loses some of the idiosyncrasies that made the first go around so appealing, and also works against its themes of hubris and forgiveness. The actors do their best, but the material isn't up to par. Maguire appears to be having fun during his ""dark"" montage (the walk down the streets while pointing and pelvic thrusting at women who look at him with disgust obviously meant as a dark flip-side to the lighthearted 'Raindrops' montage of #2), but his fling with his dark side really should have been handled more seriously. Dunst, not the greatest actress by any means, gives her all but the film isn't always complimentary towards her. Franco perhaps fairs better as Harry, the friend haunted by old demons and a father's specter that he cannot shake.<br/><br/>Sporting what must be the worst bleach job in cinema history, natural red head Bryce Dalla Howard, almost unrecognizable with ice cream blonde hair, makes the most of the underwritten Gwen Stacy, here given a connection to Eddie Brock that never existed in either the mainstream or Ultimate Marvel universes. But Gwen, the ill-fated lover who was brutally murdered by the Green Goblin back in the 1970s, is little more than a MacGuffin, a plot device to annoy Peter and MJ.<br/><br/>Villains... oh there are too many. Thomas Haden Church makes the most of his Sandman character, a complex but fairly low ranking villain who gets the spotlight mostly because director Sam Raimi seems to like him, but he only appears sporadically, and the thing with him as Uncle Ben's accidental killer not only feels forced but undermines the guilt factor that drives Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Rail thin Topher Grace is hopelessly miscast as Brock/Venom, playing him as basically a mean, jerky version of his 70s Show character, and he's clearly in over his head because he has neither the physicality or intense range to pull it off. Grace no doubt hoped Venom would do for him what Batman did for Michael Keaton, but it just doesn't work. This is what happens when directors are forced to use characters they clearly don't like and then create watered down hybrids of them from their mainstream/Ultimate universe counterparts. <br/><br/>Well, the action sequences are still superb, and the film does have an obviously deep love for its title character. It's biggest crime is that it over-reaches its grasp, as seems to be the fate of so many comic book film franchises. So it's entirely great, but it's not entirely bad either."

","Spiderman enters the Dark Side as a strange black entity from another world bonds with mild mannered photographer Peter Parker, and causes inner turmoil as he contends with new villains, temptations, and revenge.<br/><br/>In a somewhat desperate attempt to enhance recalcitrant Year 11 classes with the concept of relative versus absolute Morality, we dissected some scenes from the first movie where Our Hero has some very tough calls to make. At the end of the Year they all remembered watching the film clips, but as for the concepts I enjoyed these films more than the the Batman franchise, as to me they seem a bit lighter and with more humour as the former film got a bit unrelenting in the end.<br/><br/>The action, which is what holds the thing together after all was fantastic making good use, but not at the expense of the cast, of the available computer enhancements. The opening fight sequence has the feeling of one on one intensity but with a superb backdrop of back street New York.<br/><br/>The story shows Parker dealing with his ego and the added power afforded to him by the new entity, which gives him a black costume to go with the temptations to abuse his gifts, but the blackness is made up for with some good comedy scenes in a restaurant and then in a Jazz Club where the erstwhile photographer discovers his inner John Travolta, much to everyone's surprise.<br/><br/>The character relationships, complete with the usual romantic complications continue in this picture and we see Parker growing up and becoming far more Worldly Wise, having to deal with adult situations and emotions which osmosise into his alter ego's behaviour. Trouble at work and with his girlfriend, with the added angst of the fallout from his Uncle's death in Part One, add a decent story to complement the action.<br/><br/>Sandman is a new character, and an excellent villain engaging in the usual skulduggery (I actually sympathised with him which I'm not sure the writers wanted) but as usual, and predictably the ending turned into a moralising, flag waving tribute to the concept of ""America"". If only the truth mirrored fiction.<br/><br/>That's churlish. It's comes with the deal when you buy a ticket and doesn't detract from a fun experience, which is perhaps twenty minutes too long."

","""Who,"" one may ask, ""is Buddy Love?"" Well, it's like this: in the original ""The Nutty Professor,"" Jerry Lewis plays a nerd scientist who invents a Jekyll/Hyde formula that turns him into a suave, sophisticated, irresistible, arrogant ladies man who calls himself ""Buddy Love."" In this movie, Peter Parker comes under the influence of some type of alien life-form that turns him into a suave, sophisticated, irresistible, arrogant lades man who calls himself--well, he still calls himself Peter Parker. Not that being influenced by Mr. Lewis' film is bad; actually it's a pretty humorous part of the movie.<br/><br/>Other highlights: <br/><br/>1. Bruce Campbell should be the next Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Take a look at his supporting performance and see if you don't agree that he has that Clouseau thing down pat. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise to learn that he was purposely imitating the great detective.<br/><br/>2. The score was exceptional. It reminded me of the kinds of scores you might find in movies of the 30's and 40's.<br/><br/>3. Kirsten Dunst sings Irving Berlin, and you can't beat Irving Berlin. I thought she was going to sing Peggy Lee's ""Fever"" (the introduction to the song is played in the nightclub scene), but she didn't. And Chubby Checkers sings ""The Twist."" <br/><br/>In fact, this movie, to me, hearkened back to great action films of yesterday. It has the feel of a 1940's serial, with one action scene built upon another. Truthfully, expect for some minor cussing and maybe one violent part, this movie would fit perfectly into that time period.<br/><br/>I have only three negative criticisms: one, it's too long. I enjoyed it once, but I wouldn't want to sit through it again in the near future, unless, maybe, I wanted to visit an IMAX theater. Second, too much of it is obviously a cartoon. It looks like the computer generated images it is. Third, as in all action movies today, the film is populated with action shots made of closeups and herky-jerky motions so that the viewer really can't see the action the filmmaker is supposed to showing him.<br/><br/>So, great move; just a little too long."

","I think the way they ended the Green Goblin storyline was good and a lot of people think that saw the movie that Venom is dead but everyone who is a Spidey fan knows that is not true at all and hopefully they continue to go forward with the Venom storyline. Because if not because the director doesn't like Venom then he is really making a fool out of himself like the people who did X-Men did by killing off Jean Grey and Cyclops. But yeah regardless of what other people think I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to the next segment in this already entertaining and delightful movie franchise. I think in the next movie it would be cool to see Venom comeback and then see a twist with Carnage and the Lizard as the new villains with Venom helping out Spidey and Doc Ock coming back to help Dr. Conners find a cure for his transformation as The Lizard.

And you thought Venom should've lasted longer than 2.3 seconds in the film(I thought so also). You complain of the fight sequences for being ""too shaky"" or as one commenter so eloquently put it-""Like a child holding a camera"".All right, super! Since it seems as though the majority of people who've seen the film is so intent on ""finding"" things to say about,in my personal(oh so personal)opinion, one of the greatest superhero films of all time easy,it's amazing how minor and insignificant the ""problems"" are in the film. Now, I'm no biased critic. I mean, there of course were the excessive story lines and... wait a sec, who said that this film would garner any Citizen Kane/Casablanca/The Godfather/American Beauty kind of praise anyway? I mean, this movie wasn't being hyped or built around any Oscar buzz, neither was this film going to be involved in any Oscar implications so one should take these facts into strong consideration when critiquing the film. Now, think of ""Spider-man 3""... and I will continue to say despite the very minor ""off"" moments during the movie(I'm now guessing even the American flag shot is some type of blow to the movie's overrall quality-which is absolutely insane),that Spider-man 3 is and will remain 1 of the greater superhero films ever. One could easily see where that record,mind-boggling 258 million dollar budget went,and also the mysterious direction of the film franchise(any and every one can say Eddie Brock,Jr bonded with the symbiote before it was executed by the pumpkin bomb,but we really don't have a clue) as evidenced by the controversial ending and cliffhanger... I think if more and more people could just look at this movie and see it for what it was/is intended, and that's to entertain and please the kids and die-hard FANS OF THE COMIC not, the Academy... and if that is possible, I think people will start to see the movie as I forever will... well, until the DVD drops, this is Corell Temple signing off..."

"NewDivide1701","8","0","2","10 May 2007"," The web slinger meets expectations.
","The basics of Spiderman 3 is Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) fighting 3 villains, specifically Venom (Topher Grace), the new Green Goblin (James Franco) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) while both struggling with his darker side in an alien enhanced costume, and fighting for the love of Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). All wrapped up in a complex, segmented story with awe inspiring visual effects. And wouldn't be surprised if Oscar nods comes to Spiderman 3 as with Spiderman 2's Oscar win for best visual effects.<br/><br/>One of the basic components of the movie is Peter Parker struggling with his dark side, which is augmented by an alien symbiont that increased and feeds off of his aggression and hate. But the ""where does the costume end and the man begins"" concept started before the alien even joined with Peter when he was allowing Spiderman to control his life, that also interfered with his relationship with Mary Jane Watson.<br/><br/>One of the downsides of the movie is that it needs more story support, in other words additional back stories and details to silence the critics. Due to its overall complexity. But in order to do that, they needed to extend the movie's story so much, they would have to have either made Spiderman 3 a 4 hour long movie, or even longer, or split Spiderman 3 into Spiderman's 3 and 4 to effectively tell the complex story.<br/><br/>Even though an extra hour's worth of story telling would have given Spiderman 3 additional support, the ""short"" 2-1/2 hours did a fine job in getting the basics. Not as good as Lord of the Rings, but much better than X-men: Last Stand, which desperately needed the additional stories to have kept it from sucking.<br/><br/>It even helped with the intro that did a ""fast forward"" of the first 2 movies to get the audiences up to speed as to what happened in the first 2.<br/><br/>Give the first Spiderman ..... 9/10 Spiderman 2 ..... 10/10 And finally give Spiderman 3 ..... 8.10"
"buckeema","7","0","1","10 May 2007"," Spider-Man 3 is an effects spectacle with a satisfactory conclusion to a great trilogy...
","Spider-Man 3 is without a doubt the most hyped film of 2007. It was the first trailer to give me shivers since I saw the (Star Wars) Episode 3 trailer, and I simply couldn't wait for the arrival of one of the greatest villains in comic book history... Venom.<br/><br/>I went to see it on opening day and of course I had huge expectations, I mean Spider-Man 2 was great, and it seemed like Sam Raimi could do no wrong to this flourishing franchise.<br/><br/>So the lights dimmed, and the show began... I have to say I was thrilled with the first half of the film. The first fight between Peter and Harry was ground-breaking as I was witnessing a Special FX phenomenon right in front of my very eyes, and that was only the first of many eye-popping moments.<br/><br/>As the movie continued the story's characters became more intertwined and the conclusion was approaching. Everything up until the conclusion was extremely well done. Many of my initial first questions were answered: Topher Grace was indeed a good Eddie Brock and Thomas Haden Church was the best possible casting for Sandman. Let me just say this: The villains in this film are downright amazing.<br/><br/>Then the final 2-on-2 fight scene began. It really is a comic book lover's dream come to the big screen. The action reminded me of watching the Spider-Man cartoon and just being sucked into that crazy Comic book-World.<br/><br/>I would have given this film an 8.5 out of 10 since I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, but once again like Bryan Singer did with the X-Men films, Sam Raimi took a drastic turn from the Comic book storyline and killed off Venom in one of the last sequences in the film. Sam Raimi originally never wanted Venom in the film, and only incorporated him for the fans. So it angers me he would kill Venom off simply due to his personal resentment for the character. In the comic books and cartoon series (for all of you who had never read or watched Spider-Man prior to the films) Venom never dies, but simply ""dissapears"" for times due to Spider-Man rattling up his symbiote suit with a loud noise (like the bell or poles in the movie). However if you watch the scene where Venom dies his rib cage disintegrates in the blast.<br/><br/>I simply can't believe they would kill off such a great villain, where in the movie Raimi spent so much time with the suit and Topher Grace.<br/><br/>Very Disappointing. However I have read (off IGN.com) that someone who dies in Spider-Man 3 could have survived... Lets cross our fingers and hope somehow a piece of the symbiote survived with Eddie's DNA and it can somehow form into Eddie's body at any point... Kinda like Sandman does in the film."
"kierz-2","8","0","2","10 May 2007"," Better than the second one.
","I have to say I am a bit biased. I like the Spider-Man franchise. So it just being a Spider-Man movie it automatically gets a good vote from me (unless it somehow got dropped into the hands of that guy who ruined Daredevil -- eesh). That said as far as sequels go, this one captured the camp and fun of the original Spider-Man TV series as well as being up to date, exciting and having a popcorn friendly plot. I had the Spider-Man comics where he got and lost the black costume and other than the cheesy cream filled donut of an asteroid bit (seen Slither anyone?) it followed canon pretty well. What people obviously seem to be wanting is a gripping epic Spidey/Venom saga a la Todd McFarlane era but this is clearly drawing on the less slick, more goofy, pre-McFarlane era books. Admittedly the Sandman plot wasn't as emotionally deep at Dr. Octopus, and I agree with my good pal that the Harry plot was about the best it had going and losing one subplot to give it more room would have been a bit better. In a structural sense the movie needed the double jeopardy of the two villains to bring the whole thing around. Even though the plot was a bit crowded it was still easier to follow than the Pirates sequel. So definitely a good installment of the franchise, sorry to hear it will likely be the last Maguire/Raimi install (another reason it was so jam packed) but definitely a far cry better than almost all of the crap out there these days. And those saying it is the worst of the series, I dare them to try to remember the 'good points' of the second one. Not many. This one had far more 'ooooh' moments."

Finally, the fights between Spider-Man and the Villains were really good and so the middle part of the movie, you know, when Peter turns ""agressive"" (for me he turned ""EMO"" instead of ""agressive"" because of the hair and the black suit), it was so funny, i couldn't stop laughing."

Are we so jaded that we expect the character to actually jump from the film and smack us in the face? I like plot in the film. You can't just throw in the characters with no story line. When all the complainers buy the DVD when it comes out and they will, that is when you fast forward through the slow parts. This movie had a pretty good story line detailing the bad guys and why they turned out the way they did. This movie also had incredible action throughout. I think the amount and type of action was better than the previous two movies and I liked them both. I think this was a great addition to the Spiderman movie legacy. Sure SM3 was over the top, sometimes cheesy, and funny in parts. That is what makes it Spiderman. When I want dark and brooding, I watch Batman."
"IamPhineus","5","0","1","10 May 2007"," So bad that it's good!
","Spider Man 3 is by far the worst movie I have seen in a very very long time. I should note that having just started studying film at university, I haven't been exposed to many 'block busters' within the past couple of months, in fact I've only really been watching the so-called classics of cinema. So to go from films like Raging Bull to Spider Man 3 was quite a shock. However, despite all its very significant failures, I think that absolutely everyone should go to see this movie because of one incredibly entertaining part: seeing Tobey Maguire as emo.<br/><br/>I suppose no review is complete with out a synopsis of the film. I can only say that Spidey once again faces trials and tribulations while attempting to save the world and manage his own personal life. Really the plot of Spider Man 3 is a lot more complicated than that. Not in the sense that there are many inter-playing elements that contribute to the action, but that things simply occur one after the other until you don't know what the central plot really is! This is THE major fault of the film. It's simply too long. There is enough stuff in it to fill three films! As soon as one issue is resolved and you think the film is about to end, something else happens and then something else and then the original issue somehow comes back again. And it continues like this over and over. After a while, everyone starts to look at their watch...The two and something hours turn into what seem like 3 plus hours.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the exhausting action is not supported by either good acting, interesting dialog, an appropriate score, not even an satisfactory jokes. The dialog, for example, is very cliché and fails to envoke any sought of reaction from the audience. Its delivery is nothing short of laughable. The leading actors may be bearable but the supporting cast is absolutely shocking, a group of amateurs... <br/><br/>These elements when combined together produce something more along the lines of a comedy than an action film. It's one of those movies that is so horrendously bad that it's actually extremely funny. I found myself wondering whether the film makers had had enough of the Spidey series and were purposefully taking the p*ss out of it. Either that or they were all on crack because no-one in their right mind can believe that Spider Man 3 is by any standards a quality film. <br/><br/>Even by Hollywood standards this film is poor. The CGI, or graphics or whatever they use for the action sequences, was very poorly done I thought. I, who know nothing about this stuff, could see exactly which parts were computer generated. Same goes for the special effects, which were far from believable. For a film with such a large budget and, I assume, access to the most modern technology, this is very poor. <br/><br/>Overall, not a very promising picture. So why then should you see it? Well, one part of the film for me completely redeemed everything else about it. Without revealing plot details, the part involves a change in Spider Man with some very entertaining results. Tobey Maguire demonstrates his abilities as an actor by taking on a completely different role. In particular, the physical transformation is stunning, kudos to the make-up department. Tobey becomes one hell of a sexy emo-looking kid. Honestly, I think he should adopt this style permanently.

","Spider-man 3 is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The plot is excellent and it comes with the humor that the first two movies present. This spider-man movie has more stylized action than the first two movies put together. The special effects are awesome. They are unlike any I have seen in a superhero movie. The acting is perfect. It is amazing how spider-man has to fight three supervillians in one movie. That must be why they call him the amazing spider-man. If you were a fan of Spider-man and Spider-man 2, you will love this one. If you are an action/adventure movie goer, Spider-man 3 is a must see. SPIDER-MAN 3 IS THE BEST!!!"

","What can I say,I loved it.I have heard both good and bad stuff about this film.Yes it did have it's flaws but I disagree with some of the negative comments.It was not lame in some parts, and there wasn't so much happening all at once that it was hard to follow.I am sick and tired of hearing people whine and complain about how Sam Raimi slapped enough material in this movie to make 2 or 3 films.That is not the impression I got at all.I am glad this one was different and not like the other 2 movies.Yeah there was a lot going on and it was fast paced but it did have it's slow moments and they weren't dull.I think the movie should have been a bit longer because I agree a few characters could have used more airtime but loved it for what it was and just found it very entertaining and fun to watch.I mean isn't the whole idea of a movie to be entertained? I can only speak for myself because obviously some people are gonna judge it and criticize it no matter how the movie turned out.It doesn't matter how it was made or how the story was told,even if the movie had no noticeable flaws,people would still find something to complain about. Hopefully there will be an extended DVD with at least 30 minutes of additional footage.The acting was really good.I especially liked James Franco(Harry),he blew me away this time and gave one of his best performances in this 3rd one.Seeing a whole new side of Peter Parker(played by Tobey) was humorous, but I think he could have gone way darker when wearing the black suit instead of being funny.The thing I didn't like was the Eddie Brock character.I didn't like the actor chosen to play him and I didn't understand his hatred for Peter & Spiderman.An unknown actor would have been better. I think the character should have been explored more and explained better.I understood he was a jerk and felt Peter was his rival,but his hatred for spider man came out of left field,and I didn't like the scene where Eddie was in the church praying for the death of spider man.God isn't about killing anyone! Eddie Brock should have been either introduced in part 2,or there should have been additional scenes showing some of his past and the different sides to him as well as a reason why he went from a regular guy to being hateful & evil so quickly before wearing the symbiote-suit.I am not familiar with Eddie Brock or Venom in the comics,but I still think it was rushed.At least the Sandman/Flint character was continued from an earlier storyline (from part 1)even though it was added in later. The special effects and all the action was outstanding.With so much story and all the action in this installment I want to see it again.The computer generated effects looked very real. What an improvement from the 1st spider man film.I liked these new villains especially the Sandman,and am gonna miss James Franco as Harry.I kept reading this was the last movie Sam,Tobey,and Kristen will do, but after the money it's made and the success of it obviously there will be another one especially since Dr.Connors keeps showing up in them.He'll likely be one of the next villains.Gwen Stacy and Betty Brant need more airtime since so much is focused on MJ,and it would be nice to see more of the Eddie Brock character unless he really was killed. As soon as the 4th one is announced,i'm looking forward to hearing who the next villains will be.It's gonna be hard to top this one!"
"wsheit","8","0","1","9 May 2007"," Third time's a charm! (slight spoilers)
","So Spiderman 3 has broken all of the records Pirates of the Caribbean 2 set last year. Is it a worthy successor? Yes and no: It's no secret that I'm not a fan of Sam Raimi's take on Spiderman. The biggest problem I see here is casting: Tobey Maguire is too soft- even for Peter Parker. I would have cast Jake Gyllenhal or someone of that ilk in the role. Parker is supposed to be vulnerable to some degree, but he also has the confidence to throw quips in addition to webs at villains as he battles them. I've also been disappointed with some rather problematic departures from the comic. Since when has Doctor Octopus been anything but a sociopath? Since when are Spiderman's webshooters a part of his mutation? These may seem insignificant, but as someone who grew up with Spiderman, they introduce issues of believability.<br/><br/>When I heard that Topher Grace had been cast as Venom (?), I prepared for the worst.<br/><br/>It would appear that the third time is the charm, as Raimi and co. managed to do far better than the worst. In fact, Spiderman 3 is a great action movie marred only by some more frustrating departures from the comics. Let's start with the problems: 1. Gwen Stacy- In the comics, Stacy is a girl Peter dates before MJ. The Green Goblin kills her. That's her significance...she dies. Since the Green Goblin isn't in the film, you know from day one that this, at least, can't happen. So why was she thrown into the film? While Howard is beautiful as Gwen, using the name Gwen Stacy was a poor choice.<br/><br/>2. Slight Spoilers here- once Peter gets the suit, he goes on an ego boost. There's about a minute of film where he's dancing on the street...in terribly flamboyant fashion. I'm not sure if I was supposed to be laughing, but I was. It seemed out of place. Also, during the costume phase, the director decided to change Peter's hair and dye it black. He ends up looking textbook emo...it REALLY doesn't work.<br/><br/>3. Topher Grace managed to pull off Venom, but I can't shake the feeling that someone with a larger build should have filled the role.<br/><br/>4. There's a tad of artificial plotting; in several cases, the characters display losses of reason that stretch the bounds of credibility- particularly Mary Jane.<br/><br/>BUT the good far outweighs the bad...<br/><br/>Action: FINALLY, someone tapped into the truly fluid movement Spiderman should be capable of. The fighting choreography is truly imaginative and some of the best I've ever seen. The action scenes are so fast that I'll need a second viewing to understand every twist and turn, but I love that they trust the audience to unwind them. Plus, the level of suspense they create is tangible. I will say, though, that the first real action scene turns out to be the best.<br/><br/>Score: Elfman turns out some really memorable cues here. All of the old themes are back, but the new ones for Sandman, especially, help audiences to really feel Sandman's subplot.<br/><br/>Plotting: While I've mentioned a few problems above, I have to admit that the movie largely drew me in. As I so rarely do, I realized halfway through the movie that I was having fun and didn't want it to end. The story is engaging, and Maguire does come across a bit less whiney than he did in past iterations. Some critics have argued that tossing in so many villains made the film less cohesive, but they must have watched a different movie. Raimi uses each of the villains at different points to develop the couple of themes he promotes. It all comes together rather nicely at the end, though I will say that I found the FINAL scene just a tad too short.<br/><br/>Even with it's problems, Spiderman 3 still ranks as one of the best superhero movies ever made. While it isn't as good as Batman Begins or Blade 2, it's easily as good as the best of the X-men franchise. So, for the first time with the Spiderman films, I'm really hoping for a sequel."
"TheNorthernMonkee","8","0","2","9 May 2007"," A rare quality third film of a series
","SPOILERS So it comes to this. Yet another superhero franchise moves beyond it's two film maximum. Just like how Batman went downhill after two films and Superman went beyond farce post it's second film, so you'd expect a similar pattern with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films (led by an awkward Tobey Maguire and your standard damsel in distress Kirsten Dunst, this series has all the makings of any other tedious example). So how come this third film is actually good? There are major flaws, but on the whole this is an incredibly enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Life for Peter Parker (Maguire) is great. He's doing well in class, his long term love adores him, and everyone else in the city loves his alter-ego. When a film starts this positively, you know things are going to go wrong. Sure enough, when multiple ""bad guys"" arrive on the scene, Peter's life goes downhill as he must deal with not just new threats, but his own personality flaws.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire remains a weak actor. Whether due to his own skill, or parts of the script, Maguire is at times excruciating to watch. Managing to look out of place both when serious or doing a John Travolta style dance sequence, Maguire's Parker is possibly the weakest part of this film.<br/><br/>It's amazing how these stories seem to unfold but yet again for all the weak superheroes, the story is saved by a well played super villain. In Spiderman 3, this character is Flint ""Sandman"" Marko played by Thomas Hayden Church. Both visually stunning for his CGI scenes, and well acted when human, everything about the Sandman is practically perfect. This is so accurate in fact that when Church is absent from screen, so the film suffers.<br/><br/>The CGI of the Sandman is even more impressive when compared with the cartoon like nature of Venom and the increasingly tiresome special effects of our hero. When the first film was released, Spiderman was fresh and beautiful on our screen. Years later though and the originality has gone. It's a tiresome fact, but I suppose there's no way around it.<br/><br/>All in all the third Spiderman film doesn't quite follow the typical Superhero trend. Whilst it is definitely a weaker film than the second, and the series is obviously getting tired, it is still a sufficiently pleasing experience to merit your time and attention. Go see."

","Spider-Man 3 is a spectacular movie. It's the best of the three and it certainly has the most depth. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel. Characters and plot lines that were introduced in the first two films are now given room to thrive and find their own voice and their own distinctiveness. The plot becomes more intricate, the situations become more dire. No comic book movie has ever dug as deep as Spider-Man 3 does here-- these are not only the most complex characters I've ever seen in a super hero movie, they are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they transcend their origins and become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures. Harry and his emotional baggage, Peter and his multiple dilemmas and inter struggles, Marko and his tragic reason for being a villain, Aunt May and her wisdom all advance a story that we deeply care about. Then, when super powers collide it means more but it's also some of the best action ever presented on film."

After all this is in NY City and they are everywhere! How perfect was it in the first one on the flagpole?? Venom sure could have been in there longer and less of the Sandman. They really tried to put too many ""the moral of the story is"" messages in there, forgiveness, everyone has a choice, one man can make a difference, accidents do happen and some criminals do things for what seems to be decent reasons.

OK it is definitely the weakest of the 3, the storyline revolves around his love for Mary-Jane, his friendship with Harry and the fact that everybody loves Spider-Man now a little too much, but the action scenes are amazing and the special effects are the finest I've seen on a movie, especially the Sandmans baby steps scene...wow! the fight scenes with Sandman & Venom are unbelievable but unfortunately you are left begging for more as they are too short.

","First of all, Spider-man 3 was awesome. <br/><br/>I believe that the single largest factor that can ruin a _good_ movie is having too high of expectations. The previous two movies set the bar high and I think this caused may people to expect spider-man 3 to be the greatest movie ever. I wish it were, but Spider-man 3 is not the greatest movie ever (or it would have get a 10 :-). It is, however, pretty damn good. I think people were disappointed and became over critical when it didn't live up to the unreal expectation. I also had extremely high expectations, but luckily I read some of the reviews before going to the theater. I say ""luckily"" because after reading the reviews (saying that it was only ""O.K."")

"gandalfwiz10","Null","0","1","8 May 2007"," A solid 3rd Spidey
","OK, first of all, lets get some things straight. With Spider-man 2 being such a ridiculous success, everybody was expecting 3 to be just as good. The expectations were amazingly high, and I'm sure everybody working on the movie felt the pressures. More special effects, more villains, more depth, more battle... Its incredibly hard to get through all of that and stop comparing it and remember that its just trying to be a good movie, not primarily a better sequel. In that, it triumphs. But to be a better sequel, it isn't. Spiderman 2 was better than it, but not by much. Another reason why people are probably slamming this is because of the end with Spiderman and Sandman. It defies logic sure, but it portrays something that not many people find the power in themselves to do at all, with elevates Spiderman to an even greater superhero status, though true a lot of the point of these movies so far was to show that Peter Parker was only human... with special powers.<br/><br/>The acting was alright, given the screen time. Another problem is that Sam Raimi tried to pack too much in. The idea of two villains is a great idea, to add more punch and more excitement, as needed to satisfy movie-goers after the first few movies. But the three villains were too complex to fit even into the 139 minutes of movie. Topher Grace, did not get enough time, but again did well with what he gone. Thomas Haden Church, did very well with what he got, and did extremely well as the Sandman, the villain one can understand. The New Goblin is easily understood, but that came from the first two films, and still James Franco just not get enough screen time. The story is basically centred around MJ(Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), and their problems and Peter's battle within. A movie with a lot of potential, but too rushed and too packed.<br/><br/>The effects are stunning. Absolutely paramount. The aerodynamic New Goblin, the freakish Venom, the magnificently giant Sandman, perfectly choreographed, everything is amazing. But the battles just don't seem as good as they did in the second, but that again is because of the screen time. The special effects are the best I've seen since The Two Towers, with that charge down that slope remember? Oh man that charge was awesome...anyways...yahhh...<br/><br/>All in all, a great third venture. I'm waiting to see if Shrek the Third and POTC 3 are as solid as this."

So what? It tied in some good parts of the story that were left untold at the end of Spider-Man 2. I will admit that this movie needed more of Venom and a little less of Sandman. And, I will also admit that the Sandman looked like crap in the final battle. Other than that I say that Spider-Man 3 was still a good movie overall. That's why I chose to give it an 8.<br/><br/>P.S.

"v_aravind","3","0","1","8 May 2007"," Spiderman (the movie) commits suicide
","I don't go to watch a Spiderman movie expecting anything intelligent, but I at least expect it to keep me entertained. Spidey 1 and 2 did the job, Spidey 3 didn't. The movie can be divided into two parts, one where it seems so overflowing with ideas that the movie can't to justice to it all, and the other where it seems like they are so lost for ideas that they have to go back to parts 1 and 2. Too many villains and the love-triangle are cases in point. Let me talk about the love triangle first. If you thought that the love scenes in the Star Wars prequels were bad, the Spiderman love scenes are worse. It is stale, predictable and terribly acted (except for the half decent bridge break-up scene). Spidey and MJ have been going back and forth so much that it's making me motion sick. Stop it already. OK now the villains. Why three, with the third one appearing just for the climax fight? Black Spidey vs Red Spidey, the conflict within, would have been a good movie all by itself. Throw in one villain, and you will have a really good movie. Two and you shove the gun up your mouth, three you blow your brains out. So what else is wrong with the movie? Tobey Maguire can't dance! If anything needs to be CGI'd, him dancing should have been on top of the list. Oh, I will probably get lynched for saying this, but jumping in front of the flag was so blatant that it took all the symbolism out of it. Swinging on the flag-pole was a nice touch, but this stunt just is so gaudy that it actually borders on disrespecting the flag."
"andrej-zupanic","9","0","3","8 May 2007"," The Best of The Three
","Spider-Man 3 is not a perfect film, but it is a great popcorn epic that has certainly all the elements of a great summer blockbuster. While the first one was too much focused on the character development and neglected the storyline and the second quite the opposite, the third one hit the middle road.<br/><br/>First of all the character development was good, although it lacked at some places and some characters were completely cut out of it, but this is nothing wrong with it. The good thing about creating sequels is that you can always develop the characters that are important at a later moment.<br/><br/>If we move on, the storyline is near being perfect but it has some holes, which are made on purpose in my opinion. For instance, we don't know why or where did Venom com from. It just happened. Well, I am certain this is meant for the future films if they are going to make them to explain. As we all know, a part of Venom still remains in doctor Connors' lab. So it still isn't over yet.<br/><br/>So, you all think this were the holes in the movie-making process, well I don't think so. It all shows that the story just continues and we will have to wait for all the further explanations, when the fourth installment hits the theaters.<br/><br/>It is true that some scenes were really unnecessary, but the director's intention was to make us hate and like the main character at the same time. Well he really succeeded by me. I just started to hate Parker's ego. It was more than hating. It was really annoying, but I agree with Sam. Fame really doesn't always have a good effect on some people.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie closely, you can find several moral things in the cheesy sentences, such as you should always forgive people, do not hate and so on. It is good that the lines sometimes sound so clichÃ©, because it is easier for the audience to read between the lines.<br/><br/>The movie has also great CGI and the battles are this time really epic. But the CGI is not completely flawless, but we can also find the flaws that are not in any connection with the CGI. Watch the movie more closely and you may see them.<br/><br/>And a great plus is the ending that is very unusual for this kind of films. It almost fits the profile of a manga such as Basilisk or its movie version Shinobi. It's not happy ending and this is something that I really didn't expect this until near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>So, if you like the first two Spider-man movies, don't try to watch this one, because it is different and many people could misunderstand it. It is darker and more clever than the first two and if you really expect to be exactly like a comic book, you are really really wrong. It is emotional and stylized epic and a great sci-fi experience in years. It really is a great finish to the trilogy, but it still has an open ending and what is more important, there is no spider-man swinging through the city at the end.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, you really did a great job and you have shown that you can also be a great storyteller, but let me remind all of you who hated this film that this is not an art movie but a movie with the intention to entertain people and it really delivers the entertainment. And for those who like sci-fi movies it really is a refreshment. While X-Men 3 after a good start with the first two movies failed to deliver a great finish, Spidey 3 gives us a bombastic end.<br/><br/>But remember this, the story still isn't over, the characters will still evolve and more things will be explained in the future. And maybe we will find the answers for the things we didn't understand yet.<br/><br/>All in all, an enjoyable popcorn epic with overwhelming CGI and a great storyline, bu not without flaws. Recommend for everyone who likes a Sci-fi/action/romantic/adventure/comedy kind of movies. With other words, it has a little for all tastes."

The parts that were meant to be funny had the entire audience wetting themselves, and the serious parts had everyone on the edge of their seats. All of the characters were explored enough and, even though it cost a very fast beginning 45 minutes, the last half made up for it. .Topher Grace wasn't that bad as Venom and, not being a fan of the character myself, Venom was a strong villain.

","After thoroughly enjoying the first two installments of the series, (and personally thinking that Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins to be the best of the superhero movies) I was really excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was to be dreadfully disappointed. The movie was a hodge-podge of side-characters, bi-polar emotions, and terrible script writing. Tobey Mcguire was at his best when he was a CGI spiderman and not actually acting. The sandman's entire character and backstory seemed forced, and since this is not the only ""bad-guy"" that spidey faces, but one of three, there is definitely not sufficient character development. Not only this, but there were some terrible choices in the writing of the movie. For example, but not limited to, are the following: Once peter parker is taken over revenge, how does it affect him?? Well, apparently, it turns him into a moody, punk-rock looking emo-kid who gels his hair down straight out of my chemical romance, and now he can suddenly dazzle any lady on the street. he loves to buy new suits and dance and hump the air. Oh, and I guess since he's so ""bad"", that means that he can go into a jazz club, pull off crazy dance stunts that no human could do, and everyone just claps and yells ""yay!"" without even thinking about the fact that what just happened was completely unreasonable. The movie definitely started to lose me at this point. Then, it got worse. Venom, the darkness in spidey that everyone is so excited about and wanted to see come to the big screen, is a big disaster. He isn't introduced until much later in the film, and really probably should have been saved for a 4th installment because his development was terrible. Basically, Peter Parker's fellow photographer (Eddie Brock) photoshops a false pic of spiderman, and so is called out by Peter and humiliated and fired from his job. Then Parker takes out Eddie;s ex-girlfriend (kind of) on a date, and suddenly Eddie is in a church praying to God that he kill Peter Parker. LAME! Venom's entire reason for trying to kill peter parker is ""you humiliated me in front of my co-workers...DIE!!"" Venom deserved better. Better development, as well as a better and bigger (literally) actor portraying him. Hard to believe Topher Grace as a jacked bad-guy. (Haven't you seen him on That 70s show??) I could keep going on, but let me just finish with these two points. For me, the absolute low point of the movie was near the end, right before the big showdown when spidey is running across the rooftops to go save mary-jane. Suddenly while he is running, a giant American flag fills the entire background of the screen, and spidey runs in a slow motion pan across it. I just died laughing. Oh, and apparently, the sandman can cry human tears????? I don't get it. Please, don't make another spiderman Sam Raimi. Leave him in peace."
"schultzclan6","8","0","1","7 May 2007"," 7.0/10?
","The ratings are going to change a lot until the movie is out of theaters, but I am visiting right now and see Spidey 3 with 7.0/10. 7???? Excuse me, but there is something wrong here. I'll start out with all the things that went wrong with this film.<br/><br/>1. Montage Sequence: Peter has turned darker, and seeing him flirting with ladies in the street was very painful the first time I saw it. Second time I was able to laugh it off because you realize how much the symbiote is affecting him.<br/><br/>2. Adding things: This is honestly the last thing I found wrong with the film. I disagree with character development, I think they gave just enough character development room for us to figure out who everybody was, but they were so dangerously close to falling short that people really believed they fell short. But you can honestly describe all the characters in the film; if you couldn't, then there would be a problem. Gwen Stacy had the least character development but she was only a tool to make Eddie Brock hateful and MJ jealous.<br/><br/>The first minute or so of the film was also cheesy but that was so short that it didn't distract too much from the film. Now onto the positive notes: 1. Villains: Who cares if there are three villains, they were all still cool. Sandman was a classic, Harry was the best, and Venom had terrifying power, beating up Spiderman the whole time and practically killing MJ. Harry was the best by far, I loved the fight in his apartment/mansion. That leads me to a little more about him.<br/><br/>2. Harry: After Harry's ""accident"", he becomes such a lovable guy and his character was the second best (next to Peter). Plus he become evil just like his father did and his death scene is phenomenal.<br/><br/>3. Emotional Scenes: The other films haven't tried that hard to make you cry, this time around you want to cry so bad. When Peter and MJ break up I was on the verge of tears, it was so hurtful to see what had become of their relationship and Peter was so in love that he could barely maintain himself (and this is when he loses it). Harry's death scene also had me choked up, since he was still good at heart and sacrificed his life for his best friend, and knew it was his time. How sad.<br/><br/>4. Darkness: I was reading one review that said in the film's attempt to be dark it become light-hearted and humorous and was not effective. I find this to be completely untrue, except for the montage sequence. After Peter's fight with Sandman in the subway he sees himself in the mirror and it is very scary to see him. Then comes the painful montage sequence, but it's still dark because of how cynical and distant Pete has become. The club scene was dark once he went up to MJ after his little dance number. When he hits her he sees the monster he has become. Before this though, the darkness and tension was almost unbearable for me. Once Peter runs away I wanted so badly for Peter to come back because I felt so bad for him (the last time I choked up during a film was several years ago, and I'm a guy so I normally don't get that sad). The church scene then comes and the transition between Peter removing the symbiote and it landing on Eddie was probably the darkest scene I was terrified out of my mind.<br/><br/>Fight scenes: All the fight scenes were well-handled; a little bit short but still epic in its proportions. My two personal favorites were Peter disorienting Harry's face and the Venom/Sandman vs. New Goblin/Spider-Man. The other two with Sandman and Harry were thrilling but didn't measure up to the fight scenes of Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>Mary Jane: Mary Jane is finally becoming a woman, but with no one there for her (also kind of her fault since she never told Peter she was fired), but I feel bad for her too.<br/><br/>Overall there wasn't too much wrong with the film. I think the movie originally was three hours or something and they cut out anything that they felt didn't need to be there. I also was disappointed with the closing because there is now a cloudy future between MJ and Peter's extremely fragile new relationship. I really think they just needed to extend scenes and push the movie up to three hours, and make the montage sequence truly dark instead of painful. 7.0? Spider-Man got a 7.4, and this film was way better than that. It deserves a 7.6 or 7.7 at least. If they make a fourth film, they should not let Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi help; blame them for letting them work with the script, Alvin Sargent worked alone on Spidey 2 which was outstanding. We WILL Spidey 4 because of the unknown future of Peter and MJ.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this a movie an 8.4. I don't mind if it dons't get ratings higher than Spider-Man 2, but it is better than Spider-Man by miles. Go Spidey go!"

","OK lets get the positives of this movie out of the way cause there is not that many of them only 3 and these 3 are why this movie got that rating. 1. venom 2. sandman 3. bruce funny as usual god love him. I went in wanting to watch spiderman 3 i felt like i was watching peter parker part 1: the chick flick. Every 15-20 mins someone was crying they wasted precious seconds on crying that has nothing to do with the movie. Sandman looked awesome, bruce as i said well hes always awesome. venom is why i went into this flick HES MORE FAMOUS THAN SANDMAN but the character of venom, not in the peter form, only gets about 15 mins maybe 10 of screen time WHAT A DAMN INSULT he shouldve been the main villain and sandman comes to life at the end. Spiderman hardly got any damn screen time also it was all about peter not spidey. they may be the same people but the name of the film is what boys and girls? SPIDERMAN. worst of the 3 don't believe the hype if you want to see venom come late and watch the final 20 mins and sneak in for bruces bit! Saying this Venom did look awesome at least they didn't disappoint with him I'm still amazed how awesome he was. If they make a number 4 Don't MAKE IT A DAMN CHICK FLICK. And gwen stacy got 10 mins of screen time? wtf was that."
"greekxboxmaster","8","0","2","7 May 2007"," Good, but not in comparison
","As a kid, I always loved Spiderman. Alas, I have somewhat of a bias in my review, since I give him some credibility that some do not think he deserves. On top of that, I love Sam Raimi as a director.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 had way too much on the plate to feed the audience. A lot of things were all over the place, and the story just did not flow smoothly and naturally. For some films, multiple story-lines can be pulled off correctly and have a wonderful outcome, i.e. Sin City. In Spidey 3 though, the good result is not seen.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone film, I thought Spiderman 3 was good. However, when you compare the movie to Raimi's past work, i.e. Spiderman and Spiderman 2, the film is just depressing. The style changed completely, and I was really disappointed with what Raimi came up with. I loved what Sam did with the first two films because you could see he loved the comics. The first two movies created an authentic atmosphere and world which was believable. Spiderman 3 seemed like some high-budget yet mediocre Michael Bay film, e.g. The Island.<br/><br/>There were some parts that were completely bizarre. I was not crazy how Raimi's brother wrote the infected Peter Parker part of the story. The whole ""emo"" look for Peter was jut stupid and inappropriate. Dancing down the street, playing the piano and rubbing it in MJ's face, it just seemed so out there in comparison to the rest of the film. I also wasn't crazy about Sandman's character. I like Church as an actor, thought he was great in Sideways. But, his character in this story was not only incorrect, it just didn't fit in.<br/><br/>I think Spiderman 3 was originally going to be a great film. Raimi intended for the included villains to be Sandman and Harry. I can see that working out really well. Not too much going on since Harry already relates to Peter's personal life. Throwing Venom into the mix was just a joke though. It ruined the story because there just wasn't enough of him to have a solid role, and thus took screen time away from Sandman and Harry's ""New Goblin"" development. This movie just seemed way over done with the three stories.<br/><br/>Honestly, I would have loved to seen Spiderman 3 be primarily about Venom. Give Venom versus Spidey the first half of the movie, then bring Carnage in for the second half. Staying true to the comics, Venom and Spiderman would have to join forces to defeat Carnage. That would have been a great movie. Unfortunately, that won't happen since Venom is pretty much done at this point. On that note, the CGI, primarily for Venom, was horrendous in Spiderman 3. One could tell that the CGI director of the first two films was different than this film. Venom's eyes and mouth just look weird the few instances they are seen, and when you can see Topher Grace's face while in the symbiotic suit, the end result just doesn't look great. I thought a lot of the action besides that was good.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to its predecessors. 1 and 2 were directed by a man who loved the comic as a youngster, you could really tell by what he made. This film though, its as if Raimi did not direct it. The movie has its great scenes including the French restaurant and the celebration parade (I was bummed when I found out the Spiderman theme song played by the marching band wasn't on the soundtrack) make the movie notable. However, I never felt the power and immensity the first two films left me with. Still, as a Spidey fan at heart, I can't give the film a bad score. =)"
"capunk2441","3","0","2","7 May 2007"," A cheesy story and even cheesier acting
","I'm sure everyone had high expectations for the the final spider adventure, but sadly to say, I was quite disappointed. You can tell they were struggling with the story in this one, because there was constant weird plot changes that really made no sense and took away from the movie. Also, it slowly began to turn into a corny love story, instead of a action comic movie, which it should be. Tobey Macguire and Kirsten Dunst perform one of their worst acting performances of their career. There was line after line of cheesy dialogue that took away from the story at hand. Of course the movie will be a hit, its spider-man. But I hope that Spiderman has spun his last web."

","I saw this movie yesterday and I was completely disappointed. I wasn't expecting any shakespearian drama, but even for a mindless action flick the ""plot"" was horrible and utterly predictable. The characters (villains and heroes alike) were so one dimensional, they could have come from a soap opera - the characters motives are either nonexistent or worthy of a three-year-old. Sure, comic book characters are usually exaggerated, but the characters in this movie were so boring, I couldn't have cared less about any of them at the end of the movie. Well, and then there's the action sequences. I think movies these days try to heighten the tension by cramming more and more completely over the top stuff into action sequences, which, for me, actually makes more and more boring. Yeah, it's nice to be able to do things with cgi that are impossible to do in real life, but how about keeping the action at least remotely believable? That way you can actually get sucked in and feel the tension instead of thinking ""That looked cool, but I don't buy that for a second"". To sum it all up, this movie was a soap opera with superheroes and totally over the top action - completely unentertaining."
"liggins14","9","0","1","7 May 2007"," Less Cheesy than Spider-Man 2
","I see all the complaints about this movie being too cheesy...what kills me are the people who make this claim and say that they loved Spider-Man 2!!! Remember in 2 after Petey lost his powers how he was walking down the street to the tune of ""Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head""??? His lame attempt at poetry to impress MJ??? The elevator scene where he revealed his suit ""rides up in the crotch""??? If that movie wasn't cheesy, I don't know what is. But I still liked it overall. On to SM3...I thought it fit perfectly with the other 2 movies and picked up right where 2 left off. I was not surprised at the ""Bad Peter"" bopping down the street scene because the cheese bar had already been set in SM2. I thought that scene was funnier than anything in 2, as well as the bar dancing scene. The action was much better and more frequent in this one...you don't have to wait for the big scenes like you did in 2 (specifically, the train scene in 2). My only complaints: Why doesn't Sam Raimi let Peter keep his mask on for just one movie??? We get the point--Petey's the man under the mask. But why must he either get his mask taken off or have it torn in half every other scene? It's supposed to be a ""secret"" identity. Second, where was his spider-sense in the movie? That early warning tingling is a major part of his powers, and my complaint in the first two was that he didn't use it enough. In this one, I don't recall him using it at all. All in all, though, an excellent blockbuster with great action, acting, and special effects. Go Spidey!"
"gritfrombray-1","8","0","1","7 May 2007"," Too many baddies....
","Watched the first film with a wary eye and didn't like the Power Rangers bad guy. The rest of the film was perfect. Then along came Spidey 2. Perfection. No complaints. Was really hoping that this level of movie making could be maintained. Sadly, this movie tried to do too much and the character of Venom was introduced WAY too early, and horribly underused. Spidey has an awful lot of baddies to get through before this guy. Was really impressed by James Franco, who brought a brand new Harry Osbourne to screen. His role in Peter and Mary Jane's lives was perfectly orchestrated. Exactly as I remember it from the original story. Sandman was brilliant. One of Spidey's original adversaries. The back story involving Uncle Ben was surprisingly interesting and didn't detract from the film. Action was good and involved. Mary Jane's screaming sounds almost taped at some stages though... Last point of contention, ultimately with the director, why did he not just give Kirsten a pair of green contact lenses and let Mary Jane have those beautiful emerald eyes in all three films that us fans are so used to. In all, Tobey gave a corker of a show though and I'll be real disappointed if there's not a fourth film."

","If you want to know how to doom a Marvel franchise to three with smashing success at the box-office, watch X-3. If you want to know how to come back from a big-turn out, too much sappy music, too much Hamelet-esquire pontificating on love and identity, too much screen time given to Gee-Wiz comic-science, and not enough bad-guy action, and hit a home run, Spiderman 3 is the answer.<br/><br/>The movie was genuinely fresh. The bad guys were complex and yet simple, in a way that made the poignant image of a number tattooed on Magnetos arm look flat. And the special effects were extraordinary. I'm not just talking about eye candy that shows up in every sci-fi movie and TV show now. There is a rapid decent free fall with full on fist fighting so complex and realistic, I can only imagine what it looked like in I-Max. The sandman special effects during the armored car fight were extraordinary. The funny business of strutting down the sidewalk in New York, or the enthusiastic french waiter were all employed to add some levity to what otherwise typically ends up a formulaic super-hero exercise of (1) Tell Good Guy's Story/Make him good (2) Introduce Bad Guy/make him bad (3) Make them Fight.<br/><br/>Part of this film was shot in Cleveland, but the visuals from New York were extrodinarily well placed ... and I don't mean an obligatory shot of the Chrysler building or the Empire State. There are shots of the top of the AT&T building casually woven into the background. There is the partial destruction of the Fisher building by a crane. Probably only New Yorkers and architectural fans will get these images, but it shows great attention to detail.<br/><br/>One criticism: it runs a little long. Cut action, and it would have dragged like Spidey 2. Cut the interludes with the singing and dancing, and it would have failed to impress on the order of X3. The one thing that could have been cut were the sappy scenes with Aunt Mae. Her presaging the difficulty between Peter and MJ, was completely unnecessary - it's a story that can tell itself."
"badcoffee","8","0","1","7 May 2007"," Spidey 3 better then Spidey 2
","A good flick, yeah it's sometimes campy but so were parts 1 and 2. This one was faster paced then 2, and was about as good as the first one, which was not perfect(cheesy Goblin mask anyone?).<br/><br/>And as for cheesy montages, everyone complains about the scene where Peter struts around thinking he's hip (which I thought was funny) how about the scene from 2 where he ""quits"" being Spider-Man and walks around wearing his glasses and falls down, all the while that oldies song plays in the background?? That was straight up retarded. How about the bank robbery scene where Doc Oc steals the giant bags of coins, throwing them at Spidey?? That was straight out of Looney Tunes. It's like people forgot how cheesy 2 was, I could go on and on...too many Aunt May advice giving scenes, the reading stupid poetry sch-tick, etc..<br/><br/>3 could have benefited from cutting out the Gwen Stacy story arc(even though she's hot)and not had the nightclub sequence at all, and introduced Venom about 20 minutes earlier. This could have paved the way for a solo fight sequence with Venom and Spidey and this would maybe have made all the fan boys a little happier. Plus, Venom would have been creepier with a scary voice. <br/><br/>But that'll probably be in the next one.Because he's not dead. I saw the skeleton, but this is a MOVIE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!! A movie based on a comic book, he'll be back. The suit will regenerate his body. Oh it can't do that?!?! Because it didn't happen in the comics?? Well Spidey doesn't shoot webbing out of his wrists in the comics either but he does in the movies.<br/><br/>Besides, didn't the same pumpkin bomb explode next to Harry's face, and all it did was give him what appeared to be bad acne scarring on his face?? It's not real, they can do anything they want. Spider-Man could fight Robocop if they wanted. By the way that's being made, seriously."

","I lowered my expectations for Spider-Man 3 after seeing the critics slamming it ruthlessly. Don't worry friends, this movie is in essence equal, and worth of the other two. The difference is, to my impression, you're getting two Spidey movies crammed into one. By now fans are too familiar with the vertigo-inducing action sequences, and the video game- ish FX. They decided to try something new: Even more vertigo-inducing sequences, video game-ish FX and not one, but three supervillains to fight (3 1/2 if you count the Symbiote). These changes work with mixed results. As I said earlier, the movie had enough material to do Spider-Man 3 and 4. There are plenty of story lines and subplots coming even from issues not solved in the first movie. By the end of the movie, not only old issues will be solved, but new ones too. We'll know by the end if Spidey best friend, turned nemesis will be able to forgive him, if Spidey is able to forgive his uncle's killer, if he can put his girlfriend before himself, if he can resist being seduced by his own power... in short, all the cards will be played here. It's a little sad because to me the magic of the other two is they left me wanting more. With all this, the Symbiote storyline, which deserved a whole movie for itself, was underdeveloped. Little we know about the Symbiote and it's second host: Eddie Brock/ Venom, the most underdeveloped character of the movie. Still, almost every other character has a moment to shine. This includes surprisingly tender scenes involving the villains. One of the villains' story was quite moving. In the supporting roles, J.K. Simmons and director's Sam Raimi's most reliable actor: Bruce Campbell, provide some comedy to the cause. So let's review: It has action, it has comedy, it has drama, it has romance. What's not to like? Sometimes it bites a little more than it can chew, but critics, you got it wrong again."

They were amazing and it was the best of the other two spiderman movies. I loved the story as well. It was really interesting and it had me guessing the whole time what would happen next. Sandman and Venom were the best villains out of all the other Spiderman movies and Topher Grace once again makes a great performance playing as Spiderman which is a big plus. Now time for some bad things. Acting was of course mediocre as always. Topher Grace was only one that showed any type of good acting in the movie. There were also some cheesy parts in the movie. For instance, Spiderman getting the key to New York City??? Then when Peter Parker is dancing on the streets acting all cool and then he goes to some jazz bar and starts playing the piano. That was just too out of the ordinary. I know it seems like I'm getting too technical with the movie but c'mon. Those scenes should have never been in the movie. Those two scenes alone were put in there to make Peter Parker and Mary Jane's relationship get worse and worse. Plus it would have made the movie a lot shorter.

The choice to cast Topher Grace as venom was brilliance he really did justice to the character of Venom.<br/><br/>The only real downside for me was the awful patriotism of Spidey in front of the Stars and stripes. The dark side of Peter Parker in my view was brilliant it added to his ego and yes it was funny and people were probably laughing but not at the film at the humour you would expect from Peter Parker. As i said I am really happy with this sequel and will definitely look forward to the next instalment."

","The highly anticipated final chapter of the popular Spider-Man trilogy sees Peter and Mary Jane finally together, but three new enemies, the Sandman, Venom and Spidey's old enemy, the New Goblin, his best friend, Harry Osborn, threatens the lives of people close to Peter.<br/><br/>I don't know if I could include this in one of the best superhero films ever but this is a very good one. In contrast with the critics who didn't like the film because of too many plot lines, too many villains, and just too long, I have to disagree with them.<br/><br/>Yeah, I believe it was too long but I really thought it was great for them to make more plot lines to finally solve the sub plots from the last 2 movies. And I love the fact that there are more villains, which means more action. The action scenes are very good in the film, as you can suspect. You can feast your eyes on the fantastic visuals from the beginning credits to the last battle scene at the end. Oh, and it's darker meaning the small family film from the first two movies is gone. It's more adultish right now.<br/><br/>One problem with the movie is that the pacing is too fast. It's the beginning of the movie and about 10 minutes later, there's a huge fight sequence. Yeah, I like that but there are a lot of action in this movie. I also didn't like the fact that most of the characters of the film is changed. Their personalities had changed. Mary Jane isn't the sweet girl anymore and so on...<br/><br/>As you can also suspect, there are the cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell, which surprisingly both have a longer screening time and actually has talking roles, well, for Stan Lee and a longer talking role for Bruce Campbell. The acting by Tobey Maguire was decent but nothing great like the second one.<br/><br/>This film is already a box office hit and you might as well see it to participate in the film's breaking record in the box office. If you haven't seen the first two films and you want to see this, I should tell you the credit scene in the beginning spoils the first two film.

","""Spider-Man 3"" is THE ""Michael legacy"" film. He had this film on his must-see list for a couple of years, especially since he heard his favorite villain, Venom, would be involved. ""Spider-Man 3"" did not disappoint. The film is actually very similar in theme to ""Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"", as Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) begins to turn to and embrace his darkest thoughts. This is a darker film than the previous two and there are times when Peter Parker/Spider-Man are considerably unpleasant. As the movie begins, Peter's friend, Harry (James Franco) is still angry over his father's (Willem Dafoe) death and is bent on getting revenge as he assumes the mantle of the Green Goblin. At the same time, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) escapes from prison and Peter learns he may have had some connection to his Uncle Ben's murder. As if that is not enough, a new hotshot photographer, Eddie Brock, is trying to muscle into his gig at the Daily Bugle. As Peter tries to deal with all of this, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), is feeling more and more detached from him, putting a strain on their relationship. Peter is joined by an alien goo which forms his costume and Black-Suit Spidey is born. As touched on earlier, Black Suit Spidey is kind of an angry dude and does things Spidey would never do. Peter enjoys the feeling of strength and power he gets from this new suit, so he wears it under his clothes constantly. Therefore, Peter starts to become a very unlikeable person himself. Flint Marko becomes Sandman, a very formidable foe, and Spider-Man has his hands full. Peter eventually realizes the costume is doing things to his head and he discards it, leading to Eddie Brock's discovery of it and the birth of Venom. This all leads to a fantastic third-act finale with a battle royal involving Spider-Man, Venom, Sandman and the Green Goblin with Mary Jane once again in the middle as the damsel in distress. This final battle is a grand display of special effects and action. Of the three films, the special effects in this one are clearly the best. The Sandman effects are amazingly realistic. There are only minor critiques here. One is the middle third of the film when Peter Parker is wearing the black suit under his clothes. At times, the ""New Peter"" is used for comic relief and some of these sequences are a little over-the-top. Although this is not a criticism, the ""bad Peter"" scenes are downright uncomfortable at times. Another minor criticism is the lead-up to the finale. Mary Jane is being held hostage as Sandman and Venom wait for Spider-Man to arrive. The crowd in the streets look as if they are attending a big WWE title match. A little odd for a life and death situation with some very scary bad guys! We loved the movie overall and Michael would have been absolutely thrilled. We are so sorry you weren't physically there with us, best friend. We hope you were watching through our eyes."

While i have never liked the actor for Mary Jane; Kirsten Dunst she actually is a good actor in this movie. Toby Maguire is not at his greatest. Sandman actually is a very good actor in the movie and shows very good emotions when it comes to his daughter, and protecting her. Despite what everyone says, Venom was a very well made character.

Having read most of the comments by IMDb users, I felt compelled to put in my two cents' worth.<br/><br/>Whilst Spidey 3 was, IMHO, not in the same league as Spidey 1, it was definitely not rubbish as some people have opined. True, there were numerous loopholes in the story-telling (as noted by several viewers already) like (1) Whatever happened to Spidey's spider sense? (2) Why did Osborne's butler take so long to reveal to him the truth about his father? (3) Where was he when Harry and Peter were fighting? The list goes on... However, one of the things that remained consistent with the comic book that was retained and emphasized in the movie was the friendship between Harry and Peter (in the comic book, Green Goblin junior also saved Spidey's life before he died...albeit under different circumstances). This for me, was one of the more poignant moments of the film...and IMHO, the primary saving grace of the film. Sure, there were the other themes of revenge and what not, but the friendship between Harry and Peter was the only thing that stayed true to the comic book.<br/><br/>Thus, the movie was not all that bad as far as sequels go. In fact, I'm not entirely convinced by the argument that Spidey 2 was better than Spidey 3. Both have flaws and if any difference exists between them, it's probably marginal; any notable differences only exist if you were to compare Spidey 1 with Spidey 2 and 3, with the original film coming up tops without breaking a sweat. In fact, I somehow get the feeling that Sam Raimi and Co. are beginning to get jaded over the Spidey franchise...as such, I feel that there should not be a Spidey 4...this ought to be the end of the franchise...at least for now...and not till at least 10 years later...<br/><br/>In the end, Spidey 3 probably deserves a better than average review although not one that breaches a rating of 8. It's probably a 7.5 out of 10. For IMDb users who have yet to watch the film, I'd say don't take my word for it (or any other commenters' for that matter). Go watch the film for yourself and make up your mind. No two persons will have the same opinion of one film...one man's meat is another man's poison...unless you are talking about clones.."
"racerx3000","8","0","2","6 May 2007"," Why do people always hate things? Give it a shot..
","OK, I have a lot of spider-man comics. I even have a tattoo of spider-man on my arm. It's safe to say I'm a pretty big fan. Even I admit there are plot holes in the new spidey flick, and a lot going on, but in all, it was a fun movie, and did what it was supposed to do, entertain you.<br/><br/>The Good -<br/><br/>1. CGI was incredible, especially the sandman forming for the first time. That was very neat.. 2. Humour - lots of it and from lots of different angles.. 3. Good action sequences for the most part.. 4. The dynamic between Peter and Harry. I like how that was done..<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>1. Harry butler and his ""revelation"" was a bit silly.. 2. The alien costume that was very cool, but did not really flow like in the comics. Plus, Peter didn't need to have bangs just to let the viewers know he was bad..seemed silly..but his turn as a Wattabe brother was classic.. 3. I like Lowell as the Sandman.. :) (Wings fans?) 3. The bad guy teamup seemed forced. There's no reason for Sandman to go after Spiderman (his character seemed driven by needs for his daughter, not revenge..) with Venom. It would have made it more interesting if Venom had kidnapped the kid to make the Sandman fight Spider-Man and the police.. 4. Topher Grace is good as a little conniving Eddie Brock, but in the Comics, Venom is a huge guy, and it did not really fit.<br/><br/>All in all, I was happy with the results. I would give Spider-Man 1 an 8.0 rating as well to match this one, with Spider-Man 2 probably a little ahead of each..<br/><br/>Thx."
"TimBradley2011","3","0","1","6 May 2007"," Not the Best movie of the Season
","Spiderman movies have done really well. Spiderman 1 did very well, Spiderman 2 was somewhat better. And with this momentum, I was expecting an even better movie that Spiderman 2. To a certain degree I was not disappointed. There is a great film in Spiderman 3...the only problem is that I had to search for it.<br/><br/>First of all, I feel like the length of the film should have been trimmed down to like, an hour and forty minutes. This movie is 2 hours and ten minutes. Way to long!!! Although throughout the film, my attention was held...I felt like someone's story was neglected. Spiderman's arrogant selfishness hogged the story line. You weren't truly given a chance to see the different sides of the villains story. There were small scenes involving the villains. The other scenes were long, dragged out Peter Parker going Emo scenes...(AKA, Dancing in a suit in front of Store...Pointless) Sure, we see how Venom has changed him...but I felt like the editors and the Director were given permission to make the film two hours long, just because it was another spider-man film.<br/><br/>Not only was the movie too long, the casting was not at it's best. In spider-man two, the cast was AMAZING!!! Who plays Venom in Spiderman 3? A stoner from the 70's. Great choice. I had a hard time believing his character at ALL.<br/><br/>But no all of the movie is Bad. There are actually some good qualities to it. The film was decent. I just think it was to long. I'm sure that the movie out now would have made a GREAT Directors Cut DVD, but I'd hate to see the Directors Cut of THIS movie! There were also some hilarious scenes in the movie. The story was great...to a degree. And Sandman's character was flawless. I love his story and what he was fighting for. I loved the fact that he didn't kill Ben Parker on Purpose, and I love how Spiderman Matures by forgiving him for what he did, just like how Harry forgave Peter.<br/><br/>But the Best thing about this film is Harry Dying Hands DOWN!!! When Harry says, ""My Best Friends, I'd die for them..."" and he ends up Sacrificing himself to save Peter...Excellent. His death was perfect.<br/><br/>On that note, I gave the film 6-10. It's definitely could have been better, and I'm sure as soon as the Spiderman fan base STOPS seeing the film, it will easily be replaced by the Next Summer Blockbuster."
"travis115","9","0","4","6 May 2007"," Incredible!
","As the third installment of the Spider Man series (and probably the last) its quality excels that of the first 2. The actors/actresses in Spider Man 3 did an incredible job of playing there role, and making the characters seem like they were just normal people (well mostly normal, I'm refer to the geeky dancing scenes were they seem like normal people just goofing around) The fighting scenes were well put together, the C.G.I. was very very good, hell the whole movie was just great. It also answers many questions as to the death of Peter Parker's Uncle Ben, and his killer (such as motives, identity, how the death took place, etc.).<br/><br/>Besides all that the movie just rocked!"
"sarastro7","8","0","4","6 May 2007"," The bad hype just isn't true
","Personally, I loved Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>I usually say that Americans tend to understand pop culture (esp. sci- fi and superheroes) much better than Europeans (who, for instance, loved the pretty awful British sci-fi movie Sunshine, which still hasn't opened in the States, and will get a heck of a beating when it does). But in the case of Spider-Man 3, it seems to be the other way around. Its plot-lines, themes and characterization were too complex and subtle and long-winded for a lot of Americans. Spidey 3 had an IMDb rating of 8.2 after being seen by a few thousand Europeans, which dropped to 7.9 on the U.S. opening day, and now, a couple of days later is down to an almost unbelievable 7.1! Now there we see a demonstration of what bad word of mouth will do. Once the rumor is out that the movie sucks, a lot of people will force themselves to go with the flow and unthinkingly agree with the popular position. Europeans will do this, too, but Americans do it with so much more gusto, and have more practice.<br/><br/>I knew going in that Raimi & co. had wrestled with a difficult script, and worked very hard to make everything work. And I wasn't too hopeful, because although I kinda like the two first Spidey movies, I don't actually think their entertainment value is that great. I have seen them twice each (which includes once on DVD), and that's it. There is a strange stiffness to them, some kind of missing chemistry (made worse by the fact that I'm no fan of Kirsten Dunst), both among the cast and in the overall visual look. So truthfully I was actually a little bit disappointed by both of the first movies.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 was quite different. The cast seemed to work very, very well together, the characters and their emotions came alive for me, and everything they did was part of clever plot-lines that were all interconnected. All the characters made mistakes, and all had a part of the blame for things not working out the way they felt they should. The characters now looked like genuinely flawed human beings. Every element of the movie contributed to this. Spidey became super-popular precisely so his self-centered elation would lead to his lack of empathy with MJ, who in turn neglects to tell Peter what's the matter, compounding their lack of connectedness. Perhaps, as many are fond of saying, this is chick-flick material, but superhero comics have always been soap operas. What matters is that it's told well; that motivations and actions make sense and feel real. And they do here. The relationship with Harry was also impressively well portrayed, even to the extent that I didn't even mind their using that most time- honored of soap opera plot elements: amnesia. And everything was tied in with the Venom symbiote boosting Peter's emotions, which produced a lot of great entertainment and ended up making Peter understand the value of forgiveness, both of himself and others. The movie did things that have never been done in the comics, and it did them very thoughtfully. It made the Spidey persona extra-popular, to compensate for the bouts of extra-bad luck the Peter Parker persona had to be dragged through, which was integral to the plot. It made Peter forgive his uncle's killer, understanding that there were (in the movie's universe) strongly mitigating circumstances - an event that could never happen in the comics because it's so fundamental a part of his whole being and motivation. But it worked beautifully in the movie. The story and the characters all ended up coming together beautifully. With the possible exception of the first X-Men movie (well, and perhaps Mystery Men), I think Spider-Man 3 is the best superhero movie ever made.<br/><br/>It wasn't quite perfect, though. It's true that both Sandman and Venom didn't get enough background and development. What was the deal with Sandman's daughter? Was she just sickly, or was it something Sandy did that crippled her? Well, maybe they'll tell us in an extended edition DVD. I know I'd buy it.<br/><br/>My rating: 9 out of 10."
"timhayes-1","4","0","2","6 May 2007"," Third in franchise goes darker
","Franchises are difficult. Its hard to keep a series going with fresh ideas. If done poorly, you get a slasher series such as Friday The 13th which just goes over the same basic scenario over and over again. So it is that I entered Spiderman 3 with a bit of trepidation as I wondered if the franchise-itis would begin to set in. Luckily, my fears are quelled as Spiderman 3 continues where the first two left off.<br/><br/>New facts are learned about the death of Uncle Ben, there are 3 villains plaguing New York, and Spiderman himself must deal with the perils of a bloated ego. In the beginning we are dealt a lot of scenes of Peter and Mary Jane, who are dating again. There are a lot of courtship scenes as Peter prepares to propose to his true love. Spiderman is at the height of his popularity and this seems to be going to Peter's head as Mary Jane experiences a low point in her professional career. Soon, an alien symbiote that has crashed landed on a meteor on Earth attaches itself to Peter. On the surface, it merely changes Spiderman's suit black, but underneath it is also eating away at the core of Peter, taking his weaknesses and exploiting them. Soon Peter is more aggressive, vain and ego driven than anyone can actually believe.<br/><br/>At the same time, we learn that a common crook named Flint Marko was the real murderer of Uncle Ben. Turns out he was a partner of the robber from the first film and that he shot Ben for the car. On the run, Flint accidentally falls into a particle research test site and becomes joined with the sand in the pit. Thus, the Sandman is born. Learning these facts, Peter goes on a quest for vengeance for Uncle Ben's killer.<br/><br/>Realizing, however, that the new suit is controlling him and not the other way around, Peter rids himself of it only to have former rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock be the next host for the symbiote. Yes fans, Venom is born! As it is, Brock has a bone to pick with Parker, who stole his job away when he revealed Brock had doctored old photos of Spidey to win the position. Add in that Peter hooks up with Brock's girlfriend Gwen Stacy after falling out with Mary Jane and there's some big time payback.<br/><br/>While all of the above is happening, Harry begins juicing himself up in his father's lab and takes over the mantle of Green Goblin. He still believes Peter to be the cause of his father's death and wants revenge as well.<br/><br/>Does all of this sound complicated? Well, it is. Three definitely ups the ante in terms of plot as more happens in this film than either of the other two. Thankfully, despite all these new story lines, director and writer Sam Raimi manages to keep things moving fairly well and juggles the plots well.<br/><br/>To mirror the inner war of Peter, everything about this film is darker. Clothes are drab colours. Scenes are shot largely at night. This is Spidey at his worst and Raimi has chosen rightfully so to show it in the surroundings as well.<br/><br/>But all is not dark. There's some comedic moments to lighten the tension. Fans can look for Bruce Campbell as a maitre'd at a French restaurant, and J. Jonah Jameson is a riot as always.<br/><br/>One can only wonder what may happen should a fourth film in the series be made as several plot lines are finished and a couple of new ones are just beginning."
"mattriley3","7","0","3","6 May 2007"," great addition to the franchise...
","I know there are a lot of people writing negative reviews of this movie but I noticed in those that many of the authors compared this film to its two previous ones. That's really not an option with this one and, that aside, this movie is good in its own right.<br/><br/>To begin with, the film picks up well from the second one and life seems great for Peter Parker. What the movie does a great job with is showing that every person has their inner struggles and battles. Some we win and some we lose. The story is predictable. That could be a good thing though because the special effects were good in the early action scenes and the evolution of Tobey Maguire's character is visible.<br/><br/>The film's ending left me with something to be desired in that it brought many things to a close but left more questions than answers, especially when it comes to where Peter and Mary Jane's relationship goes. Some other comments have stated this is the last film for this franchise but until there's an official announcement by Sam Raimi I seriously doubt it. There's just too much money to be made off this kind of film.<br/><br/>Beyond the money aspect of it though, with all the bad guys in the Marvel Universe that could go after Spidey, the likelihood for a fourth movie looks good and that's something any true comic fan would smile at.<br/><br/>My last comment on this film is simple...don't expect the grand intro the first film had nor the same love story/character development of the second one. It's a great story of a hero fighting through his own inner battles to find himself and that point is the big sticking point for it."
"loganunrein","9","0","4","6 May 2007"," probably going to be the best movie of 07.

"rboehm572","8","0","1","6 May 2007"," An opinion from an average movie goer
","For the most part, this movie was great. Plenty of action, fights, and special effects. Everything you want from a summer movie.<br/><br/>I felt that the only flaws were the corny moments. I, like everyone else I think, could have done without out Peter's little dance number. The British news reporter seemed a little out of place in NYC, and she really hammed it to try to add some drama. It got a little ""cartoonish"" near the end when every body clapped and jumped up and down when Spidey showed up to save the day, but I kind of expected it from Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun movie to go see in the theater. They did cram a lot in to two an half hours, but you don't feel disappointed at the end. Don't let all of the crying fanboys bashing the movie scare you away if you are on the bubble about seeing it. It's a good time, and a pretty good ending to the trilogy if it ends here."
"mtv_the_maxx","3","0","1","6 May 2007"," A dark day for Spiderman fans...
","I went into this movie expecting the blockbuster sensation that I got when I saw the previous films. Instead I got characters who were dropped on us with little or no development and then whisked away into the wind before we even realized they were there. We got a Sandman who at one moment wants to destroy Spiderman then the next instant only wants forgiveness and could care less about our wall crawling hero. We get a Venom who refers to himself as ""I"" instead of ""we"". Venom doesn't say ""I"" or ""my"", Venom is a character comprised of two personalities and always said ""we"". We have a ""new"" goblin. Harry didn't take up the role of Green Goblin 2, Hobgoblin or any other goblin. Harry became a flying snowboard riding weenie who cried more than he fought and went from murderous Spiderman destroying psychopath to ""Pete's my friend again"" in the blink of an eye. As frustrating as all that is we get stuck in this movie watching the Parker, Osborn, Watson triangle of love for the second time?! What's wrong Mr. Raimi couldn't you come up with some fresh ideas for this script. I won't even comment on Emo Peter and his stint as a wannabe Jim Carry from The Mask. All in all this movie was hyped up to be the best movie of the year and it'll be lucky to land number 7 on that list. Not very impressive and will be glad to see it go."
"RichardTorkan","8","0","1","6 May 2007"," Good movie
","I loved this movie. Without giving anything away I liked how Harry Osborne developed in the movie, and the fact that James Franco got more camera time. As far as the story, I thought it was well written, some-what rushed, but I highly doubt if ANYONE wants to be in a movie over 3 hours. You might say you would, but that would be a lie. This could have been done badly considering the amount of characters, but it was done just right, with the right amount of character build up, I think they did a wonderful job showing us the world of Spidey and making you believe it. The humor was also great, just like Spider-man 1 and 2, this movie is on top of my list as an all time favorite. Thank you Sam Raimi for a great experience."

Many are complaining about the darkness of it all, the length, and even little points like the crying of spider man. While maybe it all was a bit too corny, it was modeled after something from the past, meaning the cliché' points weren't really cliché at all, rather, the points mentioned 40 or 50 years ago.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie a lot personally, and it included everything I was looking for."

Don't listen to the nay sayers."
"bigstuff2020","6","0","1","5 May 2007"," A Web of Deceit
","In a movie series, one comes to expect the sequels to be a cleaner, slicker, more refined, and generally better versions of the original. Several series have done this, for example the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Others have not, such as the Batman series of the 1990s, which was only brilliantly saved by Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Spiderman 3 follows the formula of the latter series, completely veering off-course into a direction no one, possibly not even director Sam Raimi, could have seen. Riding high on the success of the first two films, I had very high expectations for this film, but was thoroughly let down.<br/><br/>For all its flaws, Spiderman 3 begins with flying colors. In the first act, we rejoin Peter Parker, once again played by Tobey Maguire, with a level-headed sense of well being and general happiness. His performance in college has improved, as has his relationship with Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst. However, his bond with his best friend, Harry Osbourne, as portrayed by James Franco, has become strained in light of the events of the previous film, spurring on Harry's transformation into the ""New Goblin"". Still, Spidey finds time to be honored in a parade for saving New York's inhabitants from certain destruction on a daily basis, such as falling cranes that try and obliterate a now blonde Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Gwen Stacey, Parker's classmate and could-be girlfriend.<br/><br/>With this much to work with, Spiderman 3 seemed to be headed in the proper direction, and even found time to introduce the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), a do-good evil-doer whose crimes are motivated by his crippled daughter, and the Symbiote alien, which latches on to Peter, giving him a new dark suit and an even darker personality that is bubbling at the surface. Peter also finds personal enemies with the annoying and oh-so-arrogant Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace, better known as Foreman from ""That 70s Show"". Even with a double dose of villains making the plot somewhat cramped, Spiderman 3 still seemed to have it right. The first hour had me eager to see what would happen next as each plot line developed.<br/><br/>But then something strange happens. Spiderman 3 takes a break from it's normal direction and ventures into an exposition of Raimi's comedy, giving Peter Parker new motivation with the effects of the Symbiote, and turning him into a parody of John Travolta circa Saturday Night Fever. Peter wears his hair in a pseudo-emo-locke fashion (which really more resembles Hitler's styling) and seems as though he's been using his Aunt May's eyeliner. He dances awkwardly as he walks down the street, pointing at young, attractive hard bodies in an obscene manner, and embarrasses Mary Jane at her new job by demonstrating his new skills with Gwen Stacey. This discomfited bridge section teeters on tongue-in-cheek humor, but makes the viewer laugh at its complete stupidity and utter misuse of time. For almost 45 minutes, the movie plays on peculiar humor, rather than the one-liners we've seen in the first two movies, which were also few and far between. The viewer is left reeling and puzzled from this turn, even when intermittent with CGI-filled action sequences, which fluctuate between excellence at many points, and sheer Hollywood garbage at several.<br/><br/>The film does not pick up again until after this phase, when Peter decides to remove the Symbiote, coincidentally transforming Brock into Venom, who was given not nearly enough screen time. The film ends on a down note, with both Venom and the New Goblin being vanquished, and we last see Peter gently rocking with Mary Jane to smooth Jazz. By this point, I could not comprehend how the quality of the story had waned so severely, and I was thoroughly disappointed.<br/><br/>Personally, I grew up on the Spiderman cartoons of the 1990s, and was hoping that this film would keep faithful to not only those cartoons, but Raimi's vision and (of course), the comics. We didn't need to see Peter being a self-absorbed pervert from the Symbiote's effects, but should have seen him gradually break down his relationships with those around him in a real way, through truly evil abuse and anger. As far as villains go, we could have done without the Sandman (though I did enjoy his portions of the films), and I felt this movie should have focused expressly on Venom, who was given a meager 25 minutes of screen time, rather than the 2 hours he deserved, and Harry Osbourne. In the previous films, we saw individual focuses on the Green Goblin and Doc Ock, in the first and second films respectively; why didn't Raimi do this for Venom, a fan favorite who is well known as Spiderman's archnemesis. Topher Grace could have possibly been the worst choice for Eddie Brock, who was meant to be an over muscular prick who antagonizes on and bullies Peter. Also, the plot involving the New Goblin felt half-developed and half-assed, as we see him put out of commission due to amnesia within the first half-hour.<br/><br/>Generally, I was extremely disappointed with this movie, which lacked the heart, charisma, and personal stories of its glorious predecessors. Director Raimi is at his worst, as he ventures into expository stupidity with this film, and deviates from the style we fell in love with in the original two films. I would not recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the first two and expects to encounter a similar formula. The story lines start off strong then run thin, and eventually, stupid. We aren't given what we expected, and though at many times this is a good thing, this movie pales in comparison to the other 2; this is an extremely vapid and dissatisfying way to begin the summer's influx of blockbusters."
"phosphorusred","2","0","3","5 May 2007"," No Good
","I was hoping that after two mediocre films that the Spiderman team of Sam Raimi and his writers would wise up and provide us a movie that stayed true to the comic. Again, I was disappointed. Not only was I disappointed, I was angry. The main reason: in this 2 1/2 hour snooze of a flick only 20 minutes actually pertain to Spiderman. What is it with Raimi and his refusal to allow Spiderman a big fight scene that lasts for more than a minute? Or how about giving the fans what they want? An entertaining movie. No one goes to a film like this thinking, ""I hope they show Peter Parker more, and Spiderman less."" Enough rambling, lets talk about the film. The actors do what they can with the stinted dialog, especially Maguire. Thomas Haden Church does more excellent work here, absolutely running away with his half hour of screen time as the tortured Sandman. Topher Grace plays the same sarcastic, whinny character here as he did in That 70's Show and Traffic.His presence as Venom neither detracts or adds to the film. The special effects are so-so, looking like a video game at times. The script is essentially bad. It is a cliché ridden, uneven, annoying, overlong, and most importantly, boring mess. It seems like that the writers became so consumed with Peter and the gang's plights as friends, they totally forgot that they were making a comic book movie. They then added the last ten minutes of the movie, remembering what they were trying to do in the first place. It is especially sad that the coolest Spiderman villain ever, Venom, is shown for about ten minutes, does nothing to amaze us like good villain should, and is killed fairly easily. There is also a weird montage involving Peter and his new black suit, walking down the street cruising for chicks. It left me wondering, ""What the hell is wrong with these people?"" The bottom line is, Spiderman 3 is easily the worst comic book movie ever. It may even hold the title as worst sequel ever. (Congrats Godfather 3!) It is long and boring. It is completely void of thrills and purpose. I have been a Spiderman fan for as long as I can remember. It gave me joy and an escape from life. This Spiderman gives me nothing. Thanks Mr. Raimi!"
"kinky_friedman","6","0","1","5 May 2007"," Well-done, but flawed
","Sam Raimi was doing a great thing with the Spiderman series. The action was high quality, and the stories stellar. The first two are perfect comic book movies. Spiderman (2002) had the best story of any superhero film, and Spiderman 2 (2004) had the best use of license and action of any superhero film. Both had consistently good acting and production qualities.<br/><br/>The good news is that some of the qualities of the first two carry over. There is still great direction and production qualities. The acting is still great, because the fine dialog is still in the movie.<br/><br/>The bad news is... everywhere. The story isn't that good. It's really the most flawed part of the movie. They try to fit so much into one film. Three villains headline the movie: New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom. At first I thought the film felt rushed with three villains, but this proved to be a bias I shouldn't have. Though it was a bit rushed, the villains and their battles flowed pretty easily. Sandman was well-developed, but Venom was entirely too rushed. The development of Venom worked well, but once Eddie Brock became Venom, he was ready to kill Spiderman. We were propelled directly into the climatic fight. It should be noted that Sandman's creation is a bit cheesy, and unrealistic. For a Spiderman movie...<br/><br/>A lot of comic book material was handled poorly. Eddie Brock was horribly cast. Venom shouldn't be laughable. He should be frightening and menacing. They failed to capture the true heart of the character. Sandman was well-done, minus his before-mentioned far-fetched creation. He seems to be ripped straight out of the comics. The best part of the movie was seeing the New Goblin. We've been waiting for the moment the entire trilogy, the moment two friends must fight because of ignorance. It's handled well. But since the fight between the two happens in the first ten minutes, it feels a bit rushed. You'll also feel copped-out; Harry gets amnesia and forgets his bane with Peter. It seems redeemed, though, because all of Harry's screen time is used regaining his knowledge, eventually following back in love with MJ and gaining his hatred of his past and Peter.<br/><br/>The action of Spiderman 2 is a hard act to follow. Part three falls short, but that doesn't mean it sucks. Sandman throws an interesting dynamic into the fight scenes. His sand powers are an advantage and disadvantage. It's up to the protagonists- yes, it's plural- to harness the sand to their advantage. Ultimately, Sandman may be more powerful than Doc Ock of Part 2, but he's not as smart, and thus the fights aren't as smart or thrilling. It's more about brute force, here. New Goblin is essentially the Green Goblin, except a more maneuverable glider, some cooler gadgets, and New Goblin is in better shape. The Venom sequence is a perfect emulation of a Stan Lee-quality comic. Venom is a menace. Even if you're not satisfied by his build-up, you will be happy with the fight. And of course, many punches are thrown in free fall. Thank you, Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>From previous performers, expect more of the same in acting. Both the good and the bad. Topher Grace is awful. Though the part is written well, he plays the role comically. It's just not Eddie Brock. And he's not menacing both in voice and physical features. Howard is a nice Gwen Staci. She is very girly and very in tune with the character. Cromwell is also an all right Chief-of-Police. But not stellar. I have no complaints about Church's performance as Sandman. He is surprisingly as bitter as he should have been.<br/><br/>There's some scenes played solely for laughs. This annoyed me, because the story should have been the darkest of the series. It's all about revenge! Oh, and there's one scene I simply wish didn't exist. Peter, entranced by the Venom symbiote, goes to a jazz club with his new girlfriend. A crazy dance scene results. The scene is there to express how the symbiote has changed him, but it simply wasn't the right way to show the symbiote had a negative affect on Peter.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a B-."
"joce_wall","6","0","1","5 May 2007"," Spiderman 3
","This movie was very good and Venom was awesome but the actor that was chose to play Venom was suited to play him. I envision Venom as being a large guy with a deep voice and jokes with Spiderman. This actor that played Venom in this movie was nothing but a boy with a squeaky voice. This suit was great that Venom was wearing but they shouldn't have revealed his human so much. The point is to show how scary Venom is and he was portrayed as a weak person. As far I am concerned everyone loves Venom even if he is a villain but this movie did him so justice. There was too many lovey dovey sad scenes when there should have been more action between Spiderman and the villains. The actor for Sandman was an excellent choice for his character."

","OK ! The three stars are also just for the final fight sequence of twenty minutes that could catch your eye.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie seems to move at an extremely slow pace in the first half, with more emphasis being paid to the emotional and romantic part of the story and not the fighting that we know spiderman for.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie increases a little in the second half, but it still fails to catch the eye. The fight sequences in S-2 looked realistic. The fight scenes in S-3 look not realistic but graphical mistakes. Plus the speed of the first fight scene might make you think whether the scene is too fast or there is some problem with your eyes.<br/><br/>In the end, there is again the emotional hue and cry to end what is a 150 minutes long boredom. The movie does not stand up to expectations, instead it falls absolutely dead flat.<br/><br/>When the audience in the cinema hall start chatting among themselves and yawning in the middle of the movie, you know what the movie is like.<br/><br/>Boring !"

","For all of you who thought this movie wasn't worth watching, shame on you. The movie was great. Why?<br/><br/>Drama - You know that in the second movie that Mary Jane and Peter hooked up, finally. This movie shows you that even the perfect match can have it's ways of near destruction. They have problems. Why? Because this movie wanted reality and fantasy. You expected it to be the perfect relationship, right? Wrong. This isn't a romantic comedy. This is, like I said, a mix. The two have their moments of fights in the movie, but the love is strong. Though I was expecting a wedding on a hilltop at the end, its still well that the two came back together after Mary Jane was forced into breaking up with Peter or die at the hands of a crazed-for-revenge Harry Osborn. The scene were that did so, was so dramatic. The acting was superb with the tears. They looked REAL. Beautiful. <br/><br/>Action - The movie had a heart pounding way of getting to you. You wanted to predict the movement, yet not want to at the same time because you know the Director does it better. The fight between Harry and Peter in the beginning was perfect. How he got the short term memory loss was no surprise after hits to the head from a fall he taken. And using it to his advantage? Even better. Thing is, we did not see as much of the Goblin as we wanted to. We saw plenty of Venom and literally tons of Sand-Man, but as for GG, nope. The Battle within seeming related to myself as I'm practially going through Hell's fire also. Parker makes a mess of himself whenever he wears the black suit. Clearly intented for battles, but sticks around for fun and draws back we he loves the most. With my anger rising, I'm trying to get into fights as much as possible. In Parker's case, doing so almost makes everything worst. But in the process, entertains you. The end battle is up there with the first one. Though blood wasn't really shown, with fist-to-fist, effort was. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the first Spider-Man set good action, good end battle, and decent drama. The second, great action, and decent drama. The third, Great action with lack of blood and/or showing injury and GREAT drama. <br/><br/>What can I say? Spider-Man 3 is in between the fist two. <br/><br/>1. Spider-Man 2<br/><br/>2. Spider-Man 3 <br/><br/>3. Spider-Man"

","It's not worth the wait, everyone. Spider-Man 3 is not good and not worth the money either. I love Marvel movies, too...seriously, this is the worst one since ""Elektra""....and I'm a Jennifer Garner fan! Wait for it to rent. Get it cheaper...and that way if you don't like it you can turn it off and watch something else.<br/><br/>The previews were better than the actual film. And the previews of future movies before ""Spider-Man"" started were better than the feature presentation. Fantastic Four looks INCREDIBLE, and there were a few other good looking flicks coming soon. But basically, I just spent 2 1/2 hours of time in that movie where I could be sleeping or studying...2 1/2 hours spent in a hot, stuffy cinema with a bunch of college kids who mostly didn't like it either. Seriously. 'Twas bad.<br/><br/>If you REALLY want to see it, don't read this review. But I'm telling you: It's like the time me and my mum watched ""Bewitched"" with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell...except this time I couldn't turn the DVD off and watch Mary Tyler Moore instead. It has the newest three Star Wars-type dialouge (translates to: BAD AND Corny AND CHEEEEEESY!) and I was fully expecting Mary Jane Watson to say, ""Peter, you're breaking my heart,"" at some point in there. It had a lot of Phoebe Buffay moments (""Oooh no"") but more ""MAN ALIVE, GET OVER YOURSELF!!!"" to all the characters, but mostly directed to Harry and Peter.<br/><br/>Definitely not worth taking the wife and kids to, I'll tell you that. Spider-Man fans will be sorely disappointed. Candace, a teammate who I saw it with, said ""if they put the first half hour and the last 45 minutes together, it'd be a movie."""
"aurelius-13","2","0","3","5 May 2007"," Way too much drama in the beginning!
","Now I am the type of person that brings both positives and negatives about movies but Spiderman 3 didn't do much for me. I mean in the beginning, luckily I've forgot most of the stuff, had way too much drama. Too sappy!<br/><br/>SPOILER: Don't read the positives or negatives. Proceed to the last paragraph. <br/><br/>Positives: Some good acting by Rosemary Harris (Spiderman's aunt) and J.K. Simmons (J Jonah Jameson), and Bruce Campbell (Maitre'd). That's all I know! The story gave us some laughs; like when Peter Parker in his dark side attitude starts dancing down the sidewalk while all these 'attractive' females looks at him either shocked or astounded. Some of the fight scenes are excellent as well. Sandman steeling money for the love of his daughter, Peter and MJ cries at the depressing death of Harry at the end, and oh yes who could forget about Mr. Jameson, the wisecrack-short-tempered employer and editor. The self-conflict of Peter Parker made the story more interesting and believable: 1. He let his anger consume him while fighting against Harry. 2. Fighting the guards in the club, Peter at the end slaps MJ at the ground. 3. Stealing the photographer's girlfriend. <br/><br/>Negatives: Although the fight scenes were cool, the special effects seems like you're in a video game. What most directors that adores special effects should think is that it only works for movie theaters, not the story behind and DVD or VHS players. Next is the Venom's role. Why even bring the Venom in the story if you're only going to show him in the last fifteen minutes and gets destroyed by sound vibration? The crying scene when Harry died kind of made me chuckle a bit because of how Peter cried. I SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT SPIDERMAN IS IMMORTAL OR INVINCIBLE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN KILLED MORE THAN ONCE IN THIS MOVIE. The guy got clunked at the head more than George in the Jungle! By pipes, bricks, trains, streets, etc. It's get annoying after awhile.<br/><br/>Well there you have it! Too much drama in the introduction. I would have written more complaints and support but I kind of forgotten rest of the movie except the fighting scenes. The director, Saimi, did a splendid job in Spiderman 1 and 2 but I think he had the Soap-operas in him. This movie was more depressing than its predecessors. It tried to become like the LOTR's trilogy but what Saimi forgotten was that you can't change the sequels' characteristics and atmosphere. Star Wars can't be overly-dramatic like in AOTC for example. You can take my word for it but everyone has their own set of ideas. Like I said before, I look at both sides of a movie, not just one set. I would give it a three but it was just too gloomy."
"TheMovieCritique","3","0","1","5 May 2007"," Oh Spidey, what intricate webs you weave!
","It had to happen. A classic Spidey one, then came the even more enthralling sequel. A disaster just had to happen with the franchise. I mean if the 'Out of this planet' Superman and 'Dark and Sinister' Batman had to go through bad sequels, then Spidey is, after all, the friendly neighborhood kid - I guess he had to take one.<br/><br/>To all the fanboys out there - don't even bother! I'm one of you dudes! One of those who thinks that Spider-man is up there, with the best of the best, one of the best comic book characters ever created. So with Venom as a villain, one would've expected the whole 'taking the Peter Parker character to the next level of maturity' thing to happen. My oh my, for Pete's sake (pun intended) - Mr. Raimi, you made him a prancing egoistic sissy! He's crying, dancing and saying 'Yeah, babe' like the pothead who lives down the street. Really? This chap's the icon New York is worshiping? This movie managed to convince me that a cross dressing Rudy Giuliani is a far better mascot for New York than my favorite comic book hero!<br/><br/>You know a movie will go wrong when the production team loses sight of what the movie is. For the record - it's a super hero movie, aka Action/Adventure genre. Why the heck are they trying so hard to induce melodrama and comedy into this? Don't get me wrong, I know the whole Mary Jane love angle is intricate to the story. Spidey one starts by saying this story is about a girl. But, jeez! So much of it? Remembering Unc Ben, the ill conceived love triangle, Sandman's dying daughter, Dual versions of uncle Ben's shooting, marriage advice counseling, Forgiveness - stop that train to La-La land already! <br/><br/>I enjoy the odd comedic outlook of the Spider-man movies, the cheeky one liners or the wide eyed Parker look. But, this movie just has too many of them forced comedic moments for the taking. And the comedic elements actually add nothing to the narrative. The ill timed Jazz club dance by the Venom infected Peter Parker is probably the best joke of the movie - without intending to be one! Character development and humanizing the characters was the strength of this franchise. Poof! Gone into thin air this time round.<br/><br/>It's not a question of what's not there in the movie, but a problem of 'too many'. There are too many plot holes despite me suspending belief for the superhero movie. Too many gimmicks. Too many characters. And yeah, too much time! The runtime of the movie tops two hours and then some, but when you have so much to pack into the movie - it feels like they've rushed through the 300 million dollar extravaganza.<br/><br/>And for the last time, there's a reason why Spider-man puts on that mask. It's part of superhero folklore. When he let the mask down to save a train full of people in Spidey 2, that was one of the most real moments in the movie. Seems like now he's just fighting without the mask! No! Too much of anything good is bad. Very bad. <br/><br/>I could go on. But, I feel bad lashing out further against my Friendly neighborhood pal. So lemme put in a good word - the first ten minutes. That's it. There's a little bit of lovey-dovey stuff (again, I can take it. Just don't turn Spider-man into an episode of the OC!), but the first fight sequence with Goblin 2 and Peter Parker is sudden, unexpected and in short, kicks some serious ass! You know that Spidey won't lose, but you definitely don't know how it'll end. So I guess that got my hopes up, but what followed the next two hours was equivalent of taking a cold shower after lounging with models from Victoria's Secret. <br/><br/>Bad start, Summer of '07. And Spidey, puh-leese get someone like Christopher Nolan to direct your next outing. Realism - that's what you need right now."
"sjchelsea","3","0","1","5 May 2007"," All good things must come to an end...
","The first two entries into this franchise were nothing short of magnificent and I will be the first to admit that I had very, very high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, this turned out to be yet another example of the ever-increasing disposable blockbuster.<br/><br/>Along the way, some suit at Sony demanded that for Spiderman three, there needs to be... wait for it... THREE villains! That would be totally fabulous! Well, you may as well forget the three villains because the film's pacing was the only real villain that actually showed up to the party. The plot was thin to the point of being incoherent. Don't get me wrong, the Sandman, Venom, and Goblin Jr. story arcs all had enormous potential by themselves. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace put on great performances for their 15 seconds of fame. But they did not have enough screen time to have any lasting impact. Instead, their potential was wasted by mashing all of them together into a convenient 2 1/2 hour box so that we could endure Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst going through the motions for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I don't know if Maguire came to work everyday with images of Seabiscuit 2: Son of Seabiscuit dancing around in his head or what but the entire returning cast's wooden performance was painful to stomach on a scale only matched by one of those insipid Lucas prequels. The movie literally felt like watching a child play with toys. What's worse, these emotionless, cookie cutter character interactions were merely segue to redundant action sequences that have all been done before, only better in the previous two films. The opening scene went right into a really weak chase/fight between Spiderman and Goblin Jr. that lasted way, way too long. Reminded me a lot of the car chase in Star Wars II. No real point, no buildup, just mindless SFX for 10 minutes. 100 million dollars later, we have Gwen Stacey (an utterly useless character) falling off some random building... for no apparent reason at all. Hasn't that already been done before? Plus, correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't Mary Jane been left suspended in mid-air in a different vehicle at the end of EVERY MOVIE??? God, I wonder which vehicle they use at the end of Spiderman 4? I hope it's a Segway.<br/><br/>This movie was unforgivable precisely because I could guess what was going to happen. There was never any sense of urgency by any of the characters because nothing was ever on the line. The whole thing stunk like a bad episode of Murder She Wrote and I was waiting for the Angela Lansbury cameo. Instead I got Bruce Campbell and Stan Lee. How distracting is that? In the end, product was a obvious rushed hack job which really should've been two movies. It added nothing positive to the franchise and sold out to the toy/video game companies who financed this train wreck. The overload of useless action and lack of real story is proof enough. This movie was a glorified toy commercial... and oh yes, there will be toys... and games. Raimi has squandered a great deal of goodwill on this film and maybe you think I am being unfair in taking him to task and giving his film such a low grade. But my dollar is my vote. So now I am going out of my way to get the word out that this movie is terrible and as long as blockbusters continue to wear outrageous price tags as a sense of accomplishment, they deserve to be knocked off their pedestal with an equal amount of due criticism. Effects do nothing to a movie that sucks. Any movie can have good effects if you throw enough money at it. It's the story which makes or breaks a film. Less pointless action and more character development would have saved 100 million dollars and the franchise. I shudder to think of the turd that will eventually become Spiderman 4."
"kosmasp","5","0","2","5 May 2007"," Watch out for the soap
","Not an actual soap of course! I'm talking about the soap elements, that run through this film (as they also did in the previous Spider Man movies by Sam Raimi). But I will go into that, later in this review!<br/><br/>Let's begin with the credits. They are in the same style as they were in Spider Man 2, but they use another main color here (suitable for this movie). They also tell you the story so far. So even if you forgot a few things, you'll see them in the intro again. The beginning of the movie is quiet and revolve around the characters. There's a sense of danger here and there, but you're not getting the vibe that you're in a Superhero movie (which must have been intentional).<br/><br/>Once the movie kicks off, you get great action pieces aplenty. Sam Raimi also humanizes his villains. Which isn't a bad thing per se, but not if it is done in that form of kitsch, as it's done here. Other weak points are for instance the scenes that were shot, but only were funny for the people who shot them (concerning Toby Maguire). These scenes, were just to long and lost the gag due to that.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say not a bad movie and it certainly doesn't need the reviews here to make it's money back. But if this really should be the last, they could've done better! A little less clichés would've been nice too!"
"Kyle_N_Dex","6","0","1","5 May 2007"," An Entertaining Mess
","Very disappointed. After 2 stellar movie classics, Raimi and Co. fumbled this one. Maybe something happened in the editing room, maybe the cast and director are burnt out on Spider-Man, who knows.<br/><br/>This is a tough one to write, because ""Spider-Man 3"" is definitely not blatant crap (""Batman & Robin"") or ill-conceived creativity (""Hulk""). It is actually, often, a very rousing and entertaining movie. You can see where the filmmakers decided to give Peter a new lesson to learn, and had the conflicts with the THREE (!!!) super villains reflect that lesson. Very smart, and a lot better than you get with other films in this genre.<br/><br/>HOWEVER . . . there is so much going on here, so many plot lines elbowing for space, that it is just a convoluted jumble. I couldn't tell you the main, most important plot line if I tried; they are all that equally measured. I can tell you, however, that the plot line involving Peter and Mary Jane's relationship, and the one involving Peter's own inner struggle with his dark side, are given enough exposition that the other plot lines involving the Sandman, Venom and the junior Goblin - you know, the villains, the antagonists, the guys who traditionally give a story like this its dramatic tension - sadly get shortchanged.<br/><br/>Finally, they commit a cardinal sin in movies: A character (or characters) standing and explaining something to another. I will not give spoilers, but at least twice in this movie, a character explains either their motivation or a crucial bit of information, which then helps get us to the next scene. In movies explanation is a sin because movies are a visual medium. Discovering a character's motivation, or a crucial bit of information, is typically done non-verbally. Their behavior / actions tell us the story, which is kind of the point of motion pictures. I am shocked and, again, disappointed that a master like Sam Raimi let this happen more than once in his movie.<br/><br/>Hey, go see the movie, it won't bore you. You'll probably even like it. But sadly this third chapter does not join its predecessors on the DVD shelf of classic genre cinema. What a shame."

","Spider-man 1: What a masterpiece Spider-man 2: Could you do any better Spider-man 3: What on earth happened<br/><br/>The film plots around after the second instalment of the Spider-man franchise, where Peter Parker/Spider-man (Tobey Maguire) has fallen madly in love with the beautiful Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) who has now become a star on Broadway. Peter is basking in all his glory as the whole of New York City love Spider-man, with parades and giving him the key to the city etc. But Harry Osborn (James Franco) has still got a vendetta's against Peter and Spider-man for the death of his father, with using the green gas that his late father had created to turn himself into the Green Goblin, he himself turns into the new Goblin (but not as creature like) and sets out to kill Peter with his new equipment and super human abilities. If that is not bad enough, escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who has now been declared as the real murderer of Peter's uncle Ben (in the first film)is on the loose, Marco intentions is to get the money that could save his daughter from the cancer she has got. Marco stumbles into a particle experiment chamber, where they are experiment on particles using sand, Marco gets caught in this experiment and his DNA structure tangles with the particles of sand, and The Sandman is born. But wait there is even more, a strange small comet crashes in the out skitrts of New York City, where funnily enough Peter Parker is at that précis moment with MJ, out of this comet comes a sybiot (Black living slime)witch later on in the story attachés it self to Peter to create Dark Spider-man and Dark Peter Parker as well. And yes there is even more, Eddie Brock Jr (Topher Grace) is in town and is hoping to become the newest member at the Daily Bugle, this character is a rival to Peter Parker and soon Spider-man. After Peter realises that the Blck suit is changing him after some bad events, he rids himself of the suit, but Eddie unintentionally gets some onto him self and becomes Venom. There is also a new girl in town, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is also the girl friend to Eddie Brock Jr, she has feelings for Peter Parker as well as Spider-man and this causes problems between MJ and Peter.<br/><br/>This film may sound excellent as i thought it did before i saw the film, but it all most seems like a completely different film, where u don't see hardly anything of Spider-man swinging through the city like in the first two films, but more centred on the relationship with MJ and Peter, also there seems to be stupid one liners and completely perfectic dancing in the street (as Dark Peter Parker). As it says in the adverts ""This may be the end of Spider-man"", well this film truly is in my opinion the end of Spider-man. I believe it comes down to Director Sam Raimi, who made two very excellent films with the past Spider-man, but with the third instalment he thought he would take a dabble at doing the Screenpaly of the film, and this was where it went wrong, as Raimi should stick with his directing.<br/><br/>I would still suggest seeing the film, but purely because the first two were excellent and you might as well see the third, but be don't have the hopes of seeing another superhero classic."

","OK, so I'm not an enormous Spiderman fan anyways, but I decided to see it anyway, because clichés aside, the first two were entertaining.<br/><br/>This was painful to watch.<br/><br/>First off, this movie suffered from the same thing that hurt X-Men 3. There's way too much going on. We have three villains. That in of itself isn't a bad thing. But there are also several sub plots involving peter and MJ, Peter and the Bugle and Peter and Gwen.<br/><br/>The fight sequences were fast, but very predictable.<br/><br/>1. Peter gets thrown into a steel beam or something 2. He does the same to (insert villain here) 3. Rinse lather, repeat.<br/><br/>The dancing, emo hair, pelvic thrusting scene in the middle was painful. Actually painful. I kept waiting for Jim Carey as the Mask to show up. It would have made more sense than what we got.<br/><br/>The villains are one dimensional. Sandman is reminiscent of Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. The same ""deep"" angst over a family member with no exposition of what his daughter has. The character itself wasn't very interesting, either. He's there, he 'dies', he's there, he's good, he...apologizes? Just a little bit schmaltzy.<br/><br/>The new Green Goblin was just a two dimensional portrait of rage that really wasn't convincing, plus an entire sub plot in which he loses his memory and gains it back that does nothing to the story.<br/><br/>Venom (once he actually showed up) was really awesome and could have been so great if they had actually made this movie about him. Topher Grace was wonderful and was the only villain who I really wanted to learn more about. They really didn't introduce the symbiote well. Crash lands in a meteor, infects his suit, he takes it to a scientist who says, ""Oh yes, this is a symbiote."" and the story goes on.<br/><br/>If Venom had actually been the villain, this movie would have been good, but the director is juggling so many plot lines and devoting so much time to Romantic issues and relationship problems that it really isn't convincing as a movie.<br/><br/>The plot was very contrived and relied on a lot of deus ex machinas. It's like, there was no script, but it felt like they were just making it up as they filmed it.<br/><br/>The romantic story is the same as all the rest. <br/><br/>1. Peter doesn't really understand MJ 2. He makes a mistake and she second guesses their relationship 3. he saves her life and says something silly and they get back together.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard had a lot o potential, but was never used enough. She's playing a physicist/model and we got more of the model than the physicist. It seemed like she was either trying to dumb herself down, or didn't make her character smart enough. We get flashes of this brightness in her eyes here and there, and in other scenes, she's just fluff. It's disappointing because she's an incredible actress and could have been a really interesting character.<br/><br/>Overall, though, it was predictable, contrived, jumbled and unorganized."
"aguynamedgi","2","0","1","4 May 2007"," First Half Good, Second Half...
","After I got in to the packed theater of people just waiting to see the 250 Million dollar movie that is Spider-Man 3, I was thinking through the first 30-45 minutes, ""Hey, this is pretty good. Not as good as 1 or 2 but still it is good enough."" Then everything just kind of started to fall a part. Right when Harry started to remember things is when it all change. Like with him winking at Peter and then a car roles by and he disappears? What is that? Is this Michael Myers here? And then after Parker put on the black suit and went emo and started to make weird jokes (which I still laughed at) I thought, ""Did I leave Spider-Man awesomeness and walk into Fantastic Four?"" There were so many problems after that it was just not, Sam Raimi or Spider-Man. It was just a series of jokes for the most part after that. And they lost all that the first two had done to build characters. Peter throughout the movie seemed cocky and not like the Parker we knew. Harry was just weird in his two different versions of himself. When he was the nice before the death of his dad Harry he seemed extremely different from Spider-Man 1. And then when he was ""I will kill Spider-Man"" his confrontations in dealing with it were different. They packed so much into that second half that it felt very rushed. <br/><br/>But I will mention some good things about this movie are it wasn't torture, Bruce Campell, and the special effects. The special effects were incredible they made some unbelievable effects with the Sandman, especially when they first introduced him as the Sandman. If I was judging only on the special effects it gets a 10 out of 10. <br/><br/>Now I think really the worst part of this movie is the editing, it felt like the first draft of a movie not what you would see on screen. And Venom in the movie was to brief for being the biggest baddest villain in all of Spider-Man. He also should have never been a guy in a suit, I could really tell. And in the movie he is just a fighter not the way I think of him. When he is really Venom is when Spidey is looking around and can't find him and then Venom's hands just come from above and grab him. And the other one is where Brock is not Venom and it is just a huge mass of Venom. That is VENOM! Venom should be like when you saw the Queen Alien in Aliens, just a huge monstrous villain that is just amazing to look at and at the same time terrifying. Besides Venom the script also needed some work in its structure and believability (I know this is a movie about Spider-Man), but when the stuff that forms Venom and the Black Suit falls to the ground just by Parker. That seemed to convenient for the story. What they should of done (and don't tell me they don't have the budget) is do what the TV show from the 1990s did and I believe the comics as well. In the show Jamison's son is as an astronaut (as in the movie) and on a trip to outer space they find the stuff which makes up Venom and the Black Suit. Then they take a sample back to Earth. Along the way as they enter the atmosphere the sample starts doing what it does and tries to morph onto them and then the ship gets out of control. They crash land into the Brooklyn Bridge, where Spider-Man comes to help and gets the stuff on him and that is how it should happen. It would be a great special effects shot which they could and it would be exciting. <br/><br/>So that is my review, if you are looking for a good time at the movies with nothing to do it is fine to watch but from someone who loves the Spider-Man series and knows why it was good, unless you need to, do not see this movie.<br/><br/>And all I have to say now is 250 Million Dollars for SAND?!?"

","At 2 hours and 20 minutes Spider-Man 3 is a bit long but even at this length, there isn't enough time to fully realize all the stories. The film is a bit bloated and it feels like 3 different films lumped into one. Some of the story elements work well while others fall absolutely flat. The one glaring mistake is how the character of Eddie Brock/Venom is handled. This is a villain worthy of his own film. For fans of the comic book, Venom is probably one of the greatest Spidey villains in the comic book's history. His popularity resulted in his own comic book and when the films began to come out, many fans longed for the addition of Venom. I'm going to assume most hardcore fans, and perhaps the casual moviegoer are going to be disappointed with how the character is represented. The main issue is a lack of screen time. Eddie Brock isn't given any time to form into a real character so when he is transformed, you feel very little sympathy. When he finally becomes Venom, he is rendered with wonderful special effects, but he isn't given enough to do. I won't even speak of his demise which is anti-climatic at best. This is a major misfire and the fact that such a major villain was lumped into a film that was already overloaded, is a shame.<br/><br/>The best story involves the one that has been establishing since the first film. The conflict between Peter/Harry/Mary Jane is actually handled very well and I think it works more than the other stories because we're actually connected to all of the primary players involved. They've spent three films developing the characters and we've grown to care about each of them. The biggest success of the first two films is how it handles the human stories of love and lost. This is a classic example of why the comic book and films have been so well received. They touch on something very real in all of us and even though its presented against a very unrealistic backdrop, the emotions are still very much real. James Franco is especially effective in this film and I believe he's mostly the reason why this aspect of the story works so well. His character goes through the best arc and he manages to make Harry conflicted and very interesting. Adding the personality altering aspect of Spider-Man's new ""black personna"" offers some great parallels between the two characters. Peter's thirst for revenge against Flint Marko mirrors Harry's thirst for revenge against Peter/Spider-Man. The change in personality also offers some interesting darker elements to the story. The scene in the jazz club with Peter, Mary Jane, and Gwen Stacey is equal parts funny and disturbing as it escalates to violence. This element of the story isn't given enough time to shine but when it does, the movie becomes much more interesting.<br/><br/>The action is very good, even though this another case of quick edits substituting for ""true action"". The first action sequence with Harry and Peter is effective and well handled and all the CGI scenes with Sandman are a wonder to behold. Sam Raimi is definitely utilizing every penny of the budget and you can tell it was money well spent. The action only takes a wrong turn during the final battle because everything sort of ends on a rather anti-climatic note. All the action sequences that come before it are more compelling.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, even though the cheesiness of the script sometimes threatens a few effective performances. Tobey Maguire is at home in this role and he's quite good here. I didn't realize this until now but this guy can cry with the best of them. The break-up scene between he and Mary Jane on the bridge is heartbreaking mainly because his emotion feels so genuine and intense. He also handles the transition into more aggressive material quite well. At first I thought he wouldn't be able to play mean, but he does it very well. Kirsten Dunst is effective as well but the script cheats her the most. The script makes her character rather unlikable and it's a testament of Dunst's talent that she can make you feel sorry for her despite the way the character is written. She also handles her emotional scenes quite well and she has a very good chemistry with Maguire. Franco and Church were already mentioned for their good turns and newer additions like Topher Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard are good, but vastly underused. This is especially a shame for Grace because he's really good in his scenes but the movie doesn't develop him enough at all, even though he's being set up to be a big villain. Noward is suitably likable and sexy as Gwen Stacey and she offers a cute performance but in the end, she isn't given enough to do. I will say that whenever she was on screen I wished Peter would drop Mary Jane and focus on her.<br/><br/>I really think that people are going to come out of this film feeling the same way they did when they saw X3. That film was a fun popcorn movie but lacked the emotional depth of the first two films. It was also rather bloated and tried to add too much within the story. Spider-Man 3 is a decent way to start off the Summer movie season and it's still a worth companion piece to the other films but I do hope that the other major blockbusters to be released this summer just give us a little bit more than this film did."
"joestank15","6","0","1","4 May 2007"," Fun movie, though WAY too much camp and Sandman.
","Spider-Man 3 - After having his life virtually suck every which way in #2, Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)is the hero of New York in #3. He's beloved by the public, open about himself with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and Peter gets a bad-ass black symbiote suit. What could go wrong? Three things (well more like two, but more on that later). His Uncle Ben's killer is not the man we saw in the first movie but actually Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church in a plot change I do NOT like) a low-level thug who obtains sand-powers and super strength. Peter's former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), aka Goblin Jr., knows Peter's alter ego and is hellbent on revenge. And lastly Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), Peter's photographer-rival and antithesis gets the symbiote suit to become.....VENOM. Oh, and Peter's relationship with Mary Jane breaks down, again.<br/><br/>If that sounded like a mouthful of a plot, trust me, it's not when you see it on screen. It's pretty easy to follow if you've seen the other movies. And as for the scoffing at the mysterious and convenient plot device of the symbiote suit, no one complained at Peter inexplicably losing his spider powers in #2.<br/><br/>I've read several reviews of this film, good and bad, and braced myself for the worst (and hoped it wasn't true). This is a decent movie. It's not anywhere up to the level of the 2nd movie, which was less of an action movie and more of a focus on Peter (seriously, no one else in that film got even a quarter of the screen-time he did) getting sucker-punched every which way. All the adults liked it, and I grew to love it.<br/><br/>This time, there's action all around, with at least five very fun action sequences that show us just exactly what that ungodly sum of money they spent on this film went into. The aforementioned symbiote suit augments Peter's strength and agility and turns Peter into an Emo beatnik jerk that watched 50's gangster musicals way too many times, and it's absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>The whole ""bad-Peter"" worked for me (it may not for other people) because I've known all along that Peter's a nerdy boyscout, and a nerdy boyscout going bad is just going to think of archetypes of badness. James Dean anyone? With all the old Marvel groups getting a revamp into now-time approximately, it IS disorienting to see Spidey still into the 50s and 60s. Maguire's at the top of his game here, and I liked his performance a lot.<br/><br/>However at times this movie seemed too funny for a Spidey movie. J.K. Simmons and Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell were all hysterical but the film accessed the cheese and camp factor a little too much, suggesting that Raimi looked to his own roots for this picture, which can be a bad thing depending on your feelings for the Evil Dead series. Topher Grace and James Franco were a treat for me, they were having fun and loving every minute of their screen-time as rightful bad-asses. After two films Franco is finally given something to do, and he was wonderful. Grace is funny and quirky, and his turn as Venom should not disappoint to all but the stingiest of fans.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church as Sandman turned out to be the crutch of the whole movie for me. It wasn't his fault. He's a good actor. The writing in of him being the *accidental* killer of Uncle Ben, as well as giving Sandman an ""ill"" daughter to make us feel sympathy for him, stung of cheap manipulation. Why not give him AIDs and an animal shelter to run as well? The effects used to show his powers were wondrous. Why bog it down with melodrama? The whole ""give the villains some pity"" was Sam Raimi trying to replicate the ""good doctor"" thing with Doctor Octopus from Spiderman 2. Raimi doesn't realize that villains don't always need a long sympathetic back-story. Some people are just @ssholes. This film needed less of Sandman and waaaaay more of Venom. HE was terrifying and his situation understandable. If Raimi had done more with him the film would've been better.<br/><br/>It's still a good film, though from all the backlash I hear, you'll probably love or hate this movie depending on your tastes. I give no definites on liking this one or not. If you liked Spider-man 2 but not 1 you'll probably dislike this movie. In any cases you'll probably have a few gripes as I do, cause it's not a perfect film. It has a good conclusion and does the first two justice for the most part. I know I'll probably see it again.<br/><br/>I give it a B-"

","Your untalented brother (TEDDY) should have been left on the editing room floor, rather than James Cromswell's scenes, but that's politics isn't it Sammy boy?<br/><br/>Most comments about the drollness of this film are correct, however, their comments won't effect the box office. Afterall, Spiderman is Spiderman (SUPER Hero), and is mainly for the ""KIDS."" And where did the idea of Black crawling Liquorish come from? Writers block, and a dense Director?

"edzelr","7","0","3","4 May 2007"," The ending was poignant
","Spider Man 3 opened on May 1st here in the Philippines. I went to see it on IMAX, it's themes now is about revenge and forgiveness. I liked the concept of Peter Parker getting his success into his head especially when he dons the black suit, He's like a geeky bully much more worse than Harry Osborn and the other villains.<br/><br/>The flaw in this film is really the ending it's not triumphant, maybe it's because of Harry's fate and there's no reason for Spidey to swing for one last time, well I hope we get to see an alternate ending to this on DVD.<br/><br/>The real star is of course James Franco, he really is a promising actor and we hope to see him more, he really is Darth Vader of the Spider Man world, you'll get to see why when you see the film.<br/><br/>Overall this third or possibly the last installment is the most emotionally charged of all. and what a poignant way to close the series with tears from your eyes."

","Hello, I work for Newsarama, the most popular comic book website on the web. Check out my full review here: http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111390 It's not terrible--it's actual very entertaining but it's not perfect.<br/><br/>I think that Thomas Haden Church's Sandman steals the show. Also, James Cromwell looks just like Captain Stacy from the old comics. I had a problem with a lot of the CGI rendering looking ""fuzzy"" and Venom was somewhat ""cheesy"". Topher Grace was in the movie just long enough to not be annoying. Go see it--but you'll agree it's not something you'd pay to see a second time."

","So, it is the third and the last spider-man movie. Due to that it couldn't but be epic, heroic,... Well, it surely does.<br/><br/>You haven't seen so many battles, special effects, character twists and brainwashes in previous two parts taken together. You haven't seen so many behaviour clichés without any reasonable motivation and far-fetched links either. It's undoubtedly very hard to pull everything together in one movie and avoid creating a kaleidoscopic slide show, but sometimes screenwriter passes all bounds and creates unnatural event sequences.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding all my previous grumbling, there're some marvellous scenes, which you inevitably ought to see. They are completely different from what you've seen in previous parts. No more jolly guessing on how to use the spider web. Even humor is darker, more ambiguous and more... mature (well, it seems to me the only appropriate word). And it's a definite advantage, cause you wouldn't like to see all the same in the whole trilogy. Every part should be distinctive and vivid, grasping your attention with some new attitude to narration and character developing."
"Lmiklowitz","Null","0","2","4 May 2007"," Special FX 10, acting 5 = Eye Candy
","We're not supposed to take this movie seriously. It is comic strip with live actors. I told myself that after each implausible occurrence, contrivance, and camp acting. But the special effects are amazing. It was eye candy, tasty at first, but 2:20 will make you diabetic.<br/><br/>Rosemary Harris was wasted as Peter Parker's Aunt May, his mother figure. Her acting brought gravitas and pathos as the aging widow deeply devoted to her nephew. She thought she was in a drama rather than a comic book.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire is engaging, if not an expert actor. His moves during his personality change showed a fascinating side of him.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell, who has had cameos in the previous two Spidey flicks, stands out with this shtick as a snooty French maitre d'.<br/><br/>The set of Manhattan with apparently some bogus street names is quite realistic.<br/><br/>If you're 10 years old, chronologically or otherwise, you're gonna love it!"
