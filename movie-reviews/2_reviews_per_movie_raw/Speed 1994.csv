","Generic? Yup, Contrived? Of course, Fun? Absolutely! A brilliant first time Watch I can't lie, Fantastic all round performances and brilliantly tense action sequences there's not much wrong with this piece of film here and I can't recommend it enough, the original (and best) of over the top action ala 'The fast and the furious' franchise it's totally worth a watch, nothing but fun!"
"ivo-cobra8","10","70","81","15 November 2015"," Will forever remain one of the greatest best action movies of all time!
","Speed (1994) is one of the best action movie ever made!!!! It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves action movies. I just wish they wouldn't made sequel because it doesn't even compare to the first one. Speed 2: Cruise Control can't hold a candle to this movie. For me the sequel never happened. I only own this movie in Blu-ray collection and that is all. I love the theme score in the beginning of the movie and I love music at end of credits. I just love this movie, alongside with The Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic and Point Break is one of my favorite action film of Keanu Reeves. <br/><br/>This movie is one of those films that is worth of watch and money. It seems like now this days, action films force themselves into a wickedly strange plot to try to be the next sixth sense and put more money into each explosion than into any actors. This is a film that you just love everybody in the movie because the acting is great as well as the original story line. Sure, its no Oscar winning type of film, but if your at home looking for a fun film to watch, SPEED is the right movie for you. Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock's chemistry really made this movie work. This movies Is a badass! It is directed by Jan de Bont the same director who directed the god awful sequel. This movie is just great, it is Die Hard on a bus. Speed is simply similar to other sequel movie like are Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) that come out one year later, when Sandra was handcuffed on the train and Keanu was saving her, the same cuffing scene was later used in Die Hard With A Vengeance. McClane been on a train that explodes and goes off the barrels out of an incomplete stretch of track and crashes, the same scene was used from this movie. Die Hard With A vengeance borrowed out some scenes from this movie including China Town line. <br/><br/>I still love both of these movies, they are both great action films of the 90's and one of my all time favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Speed is a classic in modern terms and one of Keanu Reeves best performances. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene. One of the iconic movies of the 1990's, Speed is a highly entertaining, slick and polished action movie. It's a benchmark movie of its genre that was high in tension and excitement without the unruly gore of a 1980's action flick. The story itself is very good; it has some important depth to it that missing from most action movies. The cast is rock solid; Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as Jack Traven, a smart, agile but reckless police officer with a tendency to disobey orders and creates inventive solutions to get the job done. Jeff Daniels plays the sympathetic, wise polar opposite partner, Harry Temple, well. Dennis Hopper chews the scenes excellently as the charismatic and twisted maniac of villain. Sandra Bullock Annie couldn't be more likable and innocent. Joe Morton's character as the Chief is lively enough to support the lead and the rest of the cast is definitely solid.<br/><br/>The movie is a near perfect one for me. It's like a minor terrorist who knows the police force and knows how to work w/ bombs which is really cool. Not only that Keanu Reeves makes an awesome cop and they have a great cast and supporting cast. Dennis Hopper makes a great villain, Sandra makes a great tough girl, and Jeff makes a great partner. I love the plot and the length of the movie. First starting off with a bomb on an elevator and then on a bus. And since it revolves around the bus ride the entire time they do a good job with adding little problems they must overcome to ensure the bus does not explode, such as sharp turns and getting on an unfinished bridge so they can stay over 50 mph.<br/><br/>Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD cop on SWAT detail, has a fearless nature and a keen understanding of the criminal mind. That, and some luck have kept him alive. But Jack's luck is being put to the ultimate test. An elusive bomber-extortionist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is seeking vengeance after his latest ransom scheme is thwarted. Payne gives a personal challenge to Jack: A bomb is rigged on a city bus, which will detonate if the speedometer drops below 50 MPH. Poor Annie (Sandra Bullock) gets shoved into the driver's seat, while Jack does his best to save the day.<br/><br/>That is the basic plot, it is a slick film about a young cop who must prevent a bomb exploding aboard on a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph. and stop a terrorist by executing his plan. I am giving this movie a 10/10 it hell deserves it! I have fun watching it and I still love the score of the films. Great solid action flick of Keanu Reeves I love it!"
"jeremyglick","8","81","97","1 March 2005"," Thoroughly entertaining
","Speed is one of my favorite action movies of all time, just a notch below contemporaries like Terminator 2 and Die Hard. The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was ""I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'.""). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.<br/><br/>What distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.<br/><br/>There is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an ""actor's director"". He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.<br/><br/>The overall performances really serve this picture well. Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain. Plus he has one of my favorite bad-guy lines of all time (Traven: ""You're crazy."" Payne: ""Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric."").<br/><br/>8/10"
"Mister-6","9","62","76","30 April 2000"," ""Speed""-y delivery...
","Pop quiz, hot-shot - what's the most exciting action movie you've ever seen with a bus in it?<br/><br/>Right, the answer is ""Speed"" and if you've seen it then you'll have to agree that there is more action in this one movie than any ten generic action flicks that have been released in the last ten years.<br/><br/>A trend-setter the likes of ""Die Hard"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Speed""'s premise is simple - a bus is wired by a madman (Dennis Hopper) to blow up if it drops below 50 MPH.  This is to give the cop (Keanu Reeves) who ruined his last effort a run for his money in trying to save the day.  In the ensuing efforts, a woman (Sandra Bullock) is recruited to drive the bus and keep it over 50 MPH at all times.<br/><br/>And for as deceivingly simple as it is, ""Speed"" pulls out all the stops by making every scene a nail-biter (the bomb discovery, Keanu getting aboard the bus, Sandra driving over an incomplete gap in a highway, etc. - the list is endless) and all the main characters (and a few of the supporting ones) are about as smart as your average movie-goer and have enough of these kinds of movies to figure out what the other guy's move will be and act on it.  I LOOOOVE movies like that.<br/><br/>Keanu is far more heroic in this movie than he has been before (and since); Jeff Daniels is born to play best pal and does so with good-nature; Sandra is a delight to watch as well as hear - she has a voice you literally can wrap yourself up in; Hopper adds to his nutso roles with some droll lines that sound all the spicier delivered Hopper-style.  Everyone is great and gives their all.<br/><br/>The movie is all one long action set-piece, which is what the action fan expects when they plunk down their money then sit down with their popcorn. They get their money's worth here and then some.  ""Speed"" was obviously written by someone who loves action films as much as the action film fans that watch them.  Good match-up.<br/><br/>Nine stars for ""Speed"", and let's hear it for the magic of surveillance cameras."
"tfrizzell","Null","117","149","25 July 2000"," A Great Action Film That Is Actually a Great Film
","""Speed"" was a runaway success in 1994.  It was a block-buster in every sense of the word and critically speaking, it is an excellent motion picture.  The film deals with an LAPD swat officer (Keanu Reeves) who is playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with crazed ex-cop Dennis Hopper.  After Reeves stops Hopper from blowing up a high-rise building, the next obstacle is a city bus.  Hopper has rigged the bus to explode if the ""speed"" ever drops below 50 miles per hour.  Sandra Bullock, in her star-making role, plays an unlucky passenger who becomes the center of attention when she is forced to be the driver when the original navigator is accidently shot.  The great thing about ""Speed"" is the fact that it never tries to be more than it is. It goes for non-stop action, thrills, chills, and spills.  However, Dennis Hopper's character is somewhat complex and his performance probably should have garnered him an Oscar nomination.  A great film in spite of the fact it is from the action genre.  5 stars out of 5."
"sbanner-58949","10","9","9","15 August 2018"," I was 10 years old when I first watched Speed & rewatched it yesterday
","I was indeed 10 in 1994. Even back then I loved watching action movies with my Dad. Actually just recently my Father & I watched The John Wick movies (also great). 
Being 10 there's a lot of things you don't notice... like how mind boggling gorgeous Keanu Reeves was! WHEW. I'll be rewatching Speed a lot more often now that this has been brought to my attention. <br/><br/>The movie itself is a nail biter. Even as an adult I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was also very realistic. Not counting a few very minor screw ups, I was actually impressed with the special effects and stunts in the movie. Oftentimes if I watch a movie that old, i end up asking myself how I ever believed such a horrendous performance but that isn't the case with Speed. It still keeps up with today's action movies as if it were released yesterday. <br/><br/>I'd give it 11 stars if I could find a poster of Keanu's 1994 arms."

"smatysia","7","54","70","16 January 2002"," Enough action for three movies
","Enough action sequences for three movies. Sandra Bullock has the cuteness controls set on HIGH, and Keanu Reeves plays it straight, a lot like his part in ""Point Break"". Dennis Hopper is, of course, one of the most believably creepy movie villains in the business today. (See him in ""Blue Velvet"") OK, there were some physical impossibilities in the film, but c'mon, most action films have them. (I've driven buses before, and they will not do many of the things in this movie.) This movie kept my eyes glued to the screen throughout. Grade: B+"
"Doylenf","Null","51","67","18 May 2001"," Guaranteed to give you a rush...the ultimate film for action fans...
","'Speed' has to be the ultimate action film, involving you in an intense experience from the opening credits until the smash-bang climax. Not only do Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do top work, but Dennis Hopper makes the most compelling villain of the '90s.<br/><br/>It all starts with a revenge-driven extortionist letting authorities know he has planted a bomb on a bus. The catch is it will explode if the bus is driven at less than fifty miles an hour. The script races along with non-stop action and surprise twists, without ever giving the audience time to stop for breath. It's a little too intense for its own good and could have used some lighter moments to give us a break!<br/><br/>Taut and suspenseful, with excellent effects and gripping suspense that keeps you riveted. Some of the stunts seem too incredible to be believable but in a film of this kind you have to go with the flow. The stunt work itself is breathtaking and makes it easy to see why the film is one of the most highly rated action films of the '90s."

","Pop quiz...There's a space on your DVD or Video rack.  What do you do? What do you do?<br/><br/>Beat the rush hour, run the red lights, stay above 50mph and make your way to your nearest video supplier to buy or rent Speed.<br/><br/>This film is a definite MUST for those people who enjoy a good Action Thriller type film (and maybe even for those who don't).<br/><br/>I have a lot of love for Speed and no matter how many times I see it; it STILL continues to deliver non-stop action and incredible stunts & special effects.  Jan de Bont did a fantastic job directing this and I can't believe that the same guy who made this also made such a dire sequel like Cruise Control (but that's another story).<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves once more proves what a great actor he is and that he is well suited for these types of movies.  Speed also helped launch Sandra Bullock's career.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne is fantastic and Speed is a worth addition to his already impressive CV of films.  He makes a great villain.<br/><br/>The main three stars of Reeves, Bullock, & Hopper is strongly supported by Joe Morton (Terminator 2) and Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber) and it's also nice to see supporting actors actually doing something.<br/><br/>I am proud to say that Speed has a place on my DVD rack.  A rack that won't be getting its space used up by Cruise Control (Special Edition or not!)<br/><br/>I have so many more positive things to say about this film and I think I said most of them in my User Comments for Cruise Control in which I compared that film with this.  There's NO comparison.  I think I all but destroyed Cruise Control with my comments leaving Speed as the clear winner.  Speed most definitely stays above 50mph.<br/><br/>My vote:  10/10"
"shakercoola","7","6","6","27 March 2019"," Masterly precision of action storytelling
","An American action thriller about an LAPD cop who tries to rescue civilians on a city bus rigged with a bomb programmed to explode if the bus slows down below 50 mph. There are breathtaking aerial shots, mind-boggling stunts, and camera positioning which puts the audience right at the centre of the action. The film won two Academy Awards for Sound production. Sandra Bullock gives very good support with a twinkle in her eye and Dennis Hopper is very well cast as the diabolical villain. Keanu Reeves gives a corny but commanding performance.
While on the one hand it's a film which centres on action, foregoing character development or personality, it's a terrific adventure and embodies the perils and thrills of speed. One of the strongest action films of the 1990s."

"eamon-hennedy","9","20","27","27 January 2004"," Fast paced (see what I did there?).
","Sheer adrenalin from beginning to end, Speed is one hell of an action film, but it is one that is both simple, yet deviously complex. First of all, the plot is well done. It really is. It sound good on paper and writer Graham Yost (with a little help from Joss Whedon) takes full advantage of what might happen when stuck on a bus that has to stay above fifty miles per hour in order to stop from blowing up due to a mad bomber. Every obstacle that Keanu and Sandra could possibly face arises; children crossing the road, a woman with a baby carriage, a traffic jam, a hard right turn and of course, a big huge gap on the road. Logic is not only stretched, but it is thrown out of a very high window, but when a film is this much fun why complain.<br/><br/>The script is very well set up, not only in terms of plot but in terms of structure. Each act has it's own set piece. Act one features the elevator sequence. Act two, the biggest act of the film takes place on the bus while the third and final act takes place on the train (a controversial contribution from Whedon and one that Yost was very unhappy with). Of course none of this would work without a great director at the helm and Jan de Bont rises to the challenge. While his career after this has been hit and miss (critics have slated his work but audiences have been forthcoming), here he shows that he has learned from being a director of photography for Paul Verhoeven and John McTiernan with a visual prowess and a handling of action sequences that is superb. In fact a lot of the film recalls Die Hard with the suspense arising from a plot that is quite simple yet deviously more complex in its execution. The biggest surprise at the time was that Keanu Reeves does wonderfully well in the role of the hero, Jack Tavern. He is charming, yet tough and while he doesn't really have to 'act' here, his performance is well done and he should be proud. Likewise Sandra Bullock in what is really her breakthrough role, even though it is her second major film after having been the female lead in Demolition Man. Her performance has all the hallmarks of her lovely girl next door act and her chemistry with Reeves works well. It is especially funny when he keeps calling her 'mam'.<br/><br/>However the film is stolen from everyone's favorite psychopath Dennis Hopper. Brilliantly evil as Howard Payne, Hopper clearly enjoys playing a bad guy who enjoy being a terrorist (""the whim of a mad man, I like it""). While the role is not of the disturbing variety that Frank Booth is (this is a mainstream film after all), the role is great one and is instantly memorable, as is his death scene.<br/><br/>If you have still to watch this film do. It is brilliant and is one of the best Hollywood action films of the nineties. Just don't watch the abysmal sequel."
"Lev821","Null","27","40","2 June 2004"," A classic action film.
","In what is certainly Jan de bont's best film, and Keanu's best role before Neo, this has earned its place as one of the best action films ever. Good action films have good story lines to justify the explosions and violence. There is no exception here. The story is a simple one, which sets up the scenes for plenty of tension and action. If I was to make one criticism, I think it was in the part played by Dennis Hopper. He didn't come across as entirely convincing, but the rest of the film made up for this and it seems alright. It's a pity that de bont thought he could do it again in speed 2, and another pity that Sandra bullock agreed to be in it. Keanu made the right decision to not appear in this, as this seems a polar opposite to the first film. Ignore the second, the first is, to me, a classic in its genre."

Howard decides plant a bomb on a bus. When the bus hits 50 MPH, it is armed. It does so, and now Jack has to keep this bus going above 50 MPH, or else it blows up. He also meets Annie (played by Sandra Bullock) and she does the driving, while Jack does the defending.<br/><br/>I really liked Speed. Keanu Reeves was awesome, and Sandra Bullock did a great job. Her character was almost like a sidekick, and Reeves had pretty solid chemistry with her. Dennis Hopper did a pretty smooth job at playing the villain, and the other cast members did a good job as well. The plot is nicely done, not confusing, and well understood.

If the bus's speed down 50, it explodes. The starring hops on board but the driver is wounded and a valiant passenger (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel.

Enjoyable relationship between two main characters, Reeves and Bullock, based on risked circumstances work out pretty well. Sandra Bullock steals the show as feisty passenger and Keanu Reeves is fine as brave, intrepid police. Witty argument that dispenses excitement as well as entertainment. Packs atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or hand-held camera by Andrej Bartkowick. And stirring musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is stunningly and effectively realized in his firs-time as director by Jan De Bont, a successful cameraman (Basic Instict, Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's usual and occasionally director (Speed 2, Twister). It's followed by inferior sequel ¨Speed II¨ with similar technician and artistic crew , starred by Sandra Bullock, Jason Patrick, Temuera Morrison and Willem Dafoe.

","""Speed"" is the perfect example of what movies are all about. Centered on the job of Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD bomb squad officer, this movie grips one to one's seat from the opening scene. Titled ""Speed"" for good reason, this movie never lets up in its suspense. From a booby-trapped elevator to a bombed bus 2525 to a runaway train, this is one pulse-pounding, nitro-fueled film. The acting is also top-notch, and this film is most definitely one of Keanu Reeves' most superb performances. The film that launched Sandra Bullock into super stardom, ""Speed"" qualifies as one of her most intense performances yet. We also can't forget about Dennis Hopper, who brings to his villainous role a sense of morbid humor.<br/><br/>What really pulls the film ""Speed"" together is the exceptional romantic chemistry between the two lead roles, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Their refreshing on-screen relationship is certainly one of the most believable I have ever seen. The musical score by Mark Mancina (Con Air) is one of the most compelling action movie scores, and really makes you feel as if you are on bus 2525. And while ""Speed"" is over a decade old, it still seems so current, and a film that can be watched over and over.

Featuring young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock ( this was her breakthrough role, and some people even today view her through this role) on a bus that can't drop below 50 miles per hour, or it will explode, you have a great concept. What you get from that concept is a 1 hour of pure action and that 90-s movie chemistry between the characters (especially between Keanu and Sandra) followed by negotiations with the bomber. It's a real blast (no pun intended) from the past, and with that said, you can easily overlook it's little flaws and unrealistic scenes.

"KaZenPhi","8","3","3","6 August 2018"," Aged exceptionally well
","It's interesting to revisit movies I've seen a lot as a child either on grainy VHS or on tiny TV sets in their full splendor on recent HD releases. For a fan of movies this is one of the best possible future dystopias. <br/><br/>The landscape of action cinema has changed dramatically in the last 20 to 30 years. With the dominance of comic book movies there are a lot more movies with action in them but fewer films that I would actually call action movies, ie where action has a meaning, drives the plot and the emotional connection with the audience forward and has a palpable danger that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In a lot of big modern movies the action lacks weight, both physically and emotionally, a notable if rare exception being Mad Max Fury Road. Furthermore they fail to tell action with a keen sense of the visual language of cinema. The late eighties to mid nineties gave us a few classics that might not have been smart movies but were made in incredibly smart ways, like the first die hard, terminator 2 or speed. Despite being completely dissimilar they share a few key elements that make them stand the test of time. The most important element being rhythm. Much like a musical piece there's tension and relaxation and exciting action doesn't work without build-up and the investment of the audience. This also translates into the visuals as well. It is much more evident in the golden age of Hong Kong action in the eighties, where the fight movies can be registered as elaborately choreographed dance moves, but Hollywood action used to share this strength albeit done with different props. For people who only watch movies and have never worked in the medium itself this may sound strange or unbelievable but a movie constantly leads the attention of your eyes from one point to another, much like a stage magician, and composing an image, especially one in motion is a tough challenge. So even movies that noone would call art because of their banal content can be serious pieces of art if you ask me.<br/><br/>Speaking of which the premise of Speed is simple and genius for a thriller (although not entirely original since it was already done in a similar fashion in the japanese movie ""shinkansen"" decades before) it's almost a parody. If you were to scribble out the set-pieces for someone who hasn't seen the movie it would sound like the most absurd trash imaginable, however the language or should I say magic of cinema makes it work and Jan DeBont sells it to you piece by piece, much like John McTiernan and James Cameron did in their prime. What surprised me most about Speed upon revisiting it after many years is how gorgeously it is shot. DeBont's main strength as a cinematographer is showing strongly and fortunately it's not just eye-candy as the bone and grisl of the action is captured perfectly. There was some serious thought put into how to tell this movie visually that I miss in a lot of modern blockbusters. Think of a Tony Scott movie but less ridiculous. To be fair though 1995 would see the rise of Michael Bay, a vulgar plagiarist without taste and flair where every shot is so over-engineered and polished as to be absolutely meaningless. I can see how a parallel universe Speed may have looked like under his direction and I shudder. Not everything is shiny in retroland.<br/><br/>As for the few negatives: Reeves (whom I honestly love as an actor) is a bit wooden, Dennis Hopper is hamming it up like crazy and despite the great presentation the finale goes a bit too much over the top and thus loses a lot of the believability that made the rest of the movie so exciting. A smaller scale would have been preferable here. Earlier in the film when we see Reeves just centimeters above the asphalt at breakneck speed we get a better sense of danger than can be achieved with the special effects shots of the ending.<br/><br/>Still, a simple and entertaining movie that doesn't insult your intelligence, with relateable characters with enough nuance that they feel like people. Speed doesn't pretend to have a deep plot and lofty messages, it's just there to take you on a ride - and after being inundated with comic book movies good and bad the last ten years that simplicity and honesty is very refreshing."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","5","30","55","5 March 2012"," Just blow up already!
","For some reason Speed seems to be above criticism. It doesn't deserve this regard. I've never liked this film, and for a long list of reasons. I remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit. 'Die Hard on a bus' they called it. Erm...no. More like 'The Poseidon Adventure on a bus'.<br/><br/>Everybody knows the story by now, which is the sign of a high-concept idea. But I'm not captured by it. A bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot. The LAPD cannot allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking one-foot per second into the basement (it honestly moves at this 'speed' with none of them affected by zero-gravity). The bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan, but overnight he conjures-up a better plan (all with just a single oppose-able thumb) in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph.<br/><br/>Half-witted cop Jack Traven races to the rescue. But instead of blowing-out the bus's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop. He doesn't. Once on-board they barge through traffic jams, hard corners, magically jump over 50-foot gaps (launched by invisible ramps it seems), and argue among themselves. The passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs (burly worker in hat, long-faced African woman, whiny old crone, unemployed bachelor, geeky tourist) who never once get our sympathies. Many of them don't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence. Also, if I were Jack Traven, I'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying Helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint.<br/><br/>Directed by former cinematographer Jan De Bont (who is actually responsible for making Die Hard look as good as it does), it's a high-key movie (to the point of almost being sterile) with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action, but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character. Between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should say poor re-writing. Though Graham Yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by Joss Whedon, who made many changes. Originally the bomber was revealed to be Jeff Daniels' character, but after Whedon created Howard Payne the character of Harry Temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he's needlessly killed off. Other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow. There are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that I just can't forgive. Jack Traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when Payne refers to Sandra Bullock as 'the wildcat', despite the fact that the ancient camera Payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the Wildcat logo on her jacket (which she is also leaning against).<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' acting is so bad it makes Seagal look like Olivier. Don't get me wrong, I like Keanu, but he's excruciatingly awful in this film. His puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives Jack Traven (already an unlikeable character) a semi-retarded edge. I longed for Payne to get away with it.<br/><br/>Apparently Vic Armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for Jan De Bont because of his lengthy camera credits. The success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept. It's nothing to do with De Bont's ability as a director (which is why he hasn't worked since 2003) and I know that Armstrong would have made a better movie, even if he was stuck with Keanu (who he worked with a year later on notorious flop Johnny Mnemonic ), who couldn't even act ill if he had the flu.<br/><br/>Speed is not a good film. It's a badly-written early 90s relic. I just cannot even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years."

","Speed is a fantastic well acted action movie. This was made in 1994, set on a Bus in a city. This was a great action movie to follow.

I give Speed 10 out of 10 because it is a great movie and there are great actors in it."

","Yeah, I know this was a huge hit, and I enjoyed it when I first saw it, too, but on the second viewing, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves - two of the dumbest-sounding actors in recent memory - made this too annoying for future viewings.<br/><br/>Bullock, an airhead who has made very few, if any, good movies, must have majored in using God's name solely in exclamation, because that's about all she can say. This is probably Reeve's best role, which isn't saying much because he's normally as wooden-sounding as Pinochhio. To have both of these ""actors"" in the same movie, and still have it a big hit is a tribute to how well the suspense was made in this film, and how indiscriminating the public is when it comes to their actors, or the dialog in a film which is even worse in this movie than the actors.<br/><br/>Nobody, but nobody, would make the kind of remarks the characters make it this film. Dennis Hopper's villainous character also gives us the Hollywood cliché of talking- instead-killing to the maximum here - another insult to any viewer of any intelligence.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, the film gets points for having a simple-but very involving and interesting premise and a few spectacular action scenes that got everyone excited about seeing the film back in the mid '90s. So, if you can just put brain in a freezer for two hours, you have an entertaining film, and that still is worth something."

At the time it came out it was a huge hit because the main leads had really good chemistry, so it didn't matter if the acting or dialogue was cheesy. Adding the civilians to it and getting them involved in the drama made it feel more suspenseful and the tension never wavers in this film, so it goes by surprisingly quick.

","Going to see this film, was one of thew most cranked up, fuelled adrenaline rides, I've had in a movie theatre. The movie's cranked up on coolness, from the get go. This 94 actioner was a rare treat. Rarely does such an original, and unbelievably exciting film come along. It's much a revenge driven tale, not just judged by Reeve's taste of blood for mad bomber Hopper, but embittered, ex employee- Hopper's reasons for doing what he's doing. Hopper, such a highly underated actor, when you judge his large show of work, again creates a character we love to hate. My half brother had once told me, ""He's the most morbid actor I though"". He's really in his top form here, like he was in Ticker. Of course this film, launched sexy Bullocks career, who unwittingly becomes, Reeve's right hand man on a bus set to explode, if the needle, falls under or goes over 50 miles a hour, and I mean hey, it's that a great intense premise for a movie. Her cast here, couldn't be more perfect. Reeves plays another hotshot here, basically. The excellent script, also explores the workings and stressful environment of bomb disposal guys, when dealing with bombers, who sabotage lifts, as well as sabotage and thwart Hopper's initial plans. 94's Blown Away also did this to a quite, intense and suspenseful degree, but Speed does it more excitingly and smartly, again thanks to Yost's script. There are intensely tragic moments as are intensely suspenseful ones. This is a movie that thrill's and never drops it's pace or intensity factor. The movie doesn't treat the audience like an idiot. It's a very real movie, and not very far at all, from an actual reality. Frightening to think, especially if there's someone out there like Hopper, or his character inspires a real nutter."

","'Speed (1994)' gets straight into the action and barely lets its foot off the gas for a second, barrelling straight ahead with full force and gusto without stopping for a moment to let you catch your breath. It's an extremely fun, exciting and thrilling adventure that's wonderfully tangible and is sure to keep you on the edge-of-your-seat throughout. Sure, the third act seems out of place and like an unnecessary repeat of what came before, the flick is occasionally a little too cheesy for its own good, Dennis Hopper sometimes gets a bit too hammy and Keanu Reaves, ever so often, shows just how far his acting talent has come since 1994, but this is an incredibly entertaining, wholly engaging and breathlessly exciting action-triller that takes its relatively simple, slightly 'Die Hard (1988)' like premise and does wonders with it. It really is a fantastic, frenetic blast throughout; certainly one of the best pictures of its kind. 8/10"

","Speed is a film that I've watched and re-watched time and time again, and would still happily watch today. With the added bonus of time, Speed has become more than just a great action film, it has become a nostalgic one, firmly planting its feet in time and memory. It was one of the first films I watched that had me on the edge of my seat and had a clear hero and villain contrast. Howard Payne (the late Dennis Hopper), the maniacal bomb expert trying to secure his retirement and Jack Travin (Keanu Reeves) the relentlessly will powered maverick cop who won't stop until he gets his man.<br/><br/>Speed is one of my all time favourite action films. Scene after scene I feel the movie builds with edge of your seat, muscle tensing action, as well as a side of ""I don't care how crazy this plot is, I love it!"". Speed has it all, action, thrilling scenes, romance, a great villain and a great hero. It has been and always will be a film that I look back on fondly for the joy it brought me as a child, and the fond memories it brings me as an adult."
"themonkwithnoname","10","2","2","6 October 2017"," What watching a movie after 20 years feel like
","Masterfully crafted!<br/><br/>That's all I can say. I watched Speed in my early teens after it came out in 1994. It has been 23 years and I had vague recollection of the specific scenes in the story. However as I watched the film after decades long gap, I realized why this became a classic household, water fountain action film.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves was born to play this role. He exuded an ungodly calmness that is so rare a trait that every man wishes he possessed. The chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock's character Andy was just the right dosage in an unlikely coupling. If Keanue was the epitome of a man's assured calmness, then Sandra was just the opposite. Possibly she is the only one who can make a damsel-in- distress, overapologetic, tad bit clumsy and slightly nagging character so sexy.<br/><br/>Before you read further I must warn this review contains many spoilers.<br/><br/>The fact that I love about Speed is that it is a movie within movie. Even if the movie finished after the elevator saga, it would still be considered a decent flick. There are layers within layers and supersubplots within subplots.<br/><br/>At one stage, Keanu after saving the world and hostage from an exploding elevator, he kept sweeping the area to locate the bomber.<br/><br/>There was quote once I read - which is mostly probably apocryphal - regarding Einstein where he said: ""The difference between other people and I is that when asked to find a needle in a haystack, I keep going.""<br/><br/>The intro was a three minute long of dizzying credit. But I still gave it 10 out of 10 and the scene reminded me of Einstein's quote.<br/><br/>Keanu should really author a book on ""How to be cool, calm and in control under pressure 101"".. in fact, even the way he just stepped off the 'runaway train' exuded so much suaveness that it was as if he performed walking on water and it was 'no big deal'.<br/><br/>There are so many details that stands out that made up the subplots and subcontext within the main theme. For instance, every character had his or her own space, niche and personality, starting with Keanu's partner, the 'Jamaican(?)' looking driver to the bus driver who even after getting shot signaled the entry with the latch to the 'communicator' who after giving robotic communication translated 'oh f**' to 'oh darn' to the criminal who reacted only to be assaulted by another hero... every character told a story and every frame was interesting. In is unfortunate, that producers do not spare so much detail into movies like they used to in the past.<br/><br/>There was also the right dosage of comic relief. For instance, after repeated attempts when Keanu was drove up to the bus driver Sandra had a 'you got be kidding' look in her face as she said: ""He is out of his mind"" made me laugh like I haven't in a long time. Of course, it was only trumped by ""...I received a ticekt for speeding..."" scene later on that was dead on witty.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the way the couple of stunt drivers veered the cars putting the cop cars to 90 degree blocking the way in the airport complete halt smacked of entire badassery.<br/><br/>Can movies procure religious experience? I often wondered; not to be nutjobby. It is said Rothko's paintings could make people tear up. As I laid on my bed thinking about the calmness with which Keanu handled the entire programme, I couldn't help but think that so often people cut was in traffic, spill their coffee, mistakenly slam the door catching out finger, or accidentally poke with form and so often we lose it triggered at the slightest press of our buttons. So often! However, when calm and collected mental composure is held, no obstacle seems impossible.<br/><br/>Movies like this opens the portal to the doorway on what really is possible for a self-actualized man to achieve once he was conquered himself."

","I am not normally a fan of action movies but I don't mind Speed as a sort of sit down and watch without thinking movie. But the only thing about this movie that is terrible is Sandra Bulock. She is utterly terrible. A flat, nasal, monotone voice interspersed with banal moments of horrendous acting is the only bad thing. And I couldn't get past the first ten minutes of Speed 2 due to her excruciatingly presence. A lot of films from this period have a lot of big name stars in them either as a way of selling the film or because the 'big name star' sees his or her career on the wane. This is what I think about Dennis Hopper. He was amazing in True Romance, but felt that he wasn't the best choice as the mad bomber in this movie."

I can't imagine a bus can actually do this without any damage.<br/><br/>On the airport the bus is driving over something that is on the ground. Strange as the runway should always be clean.<br/><br/>And why has Jack to fasten the metro train to let it be derailed? Isn't it much easier to decrease the speed so it stops?

I was only 9 when it was released and my parents never bought or rented it, so I was just thinking of the movie when I saw it on I love the 90's on VH1 and rented it along with the sequel. I have to say that normally a Keanu Reeves movie is only sometimes enjoyable to watch, but this was a very exciting action movie, in fact one of the best I've seen. I know that it was very over the top and a little silly, but it was just so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>Keanu plays Jack, a police officer who has just foiled another crime by EVIL mastermind Dennis Hopper. When Dennis gets very upset, he plants a bomb on a bus, the only way to prevent it from going off is to keep the bus going 50 miles an hour or above. Jack jumps onto the bus and tries to explain, but a criminal thinks he is after him so he pulls out his gun and accidentally shoots the bus driver leaving the driving to a passenger, Annie. They must go on a driving spree to make sure that everyone can stay alive with trying to figure out a way off the bus.<br/><br/>Speed is a very great action movie that everyone needs to see, it's just one of those movies that really gets you excited and never lets you go. Keanu and Sandra did a terrific job and had great chemistry, despite their cheesy over the top kiss, it was definitely needed to complete the cliché action genre. I think you'll love this movie if you just like films in general. So grab the popcorn and enjoy the ride, it's a good one! <br/><br/>8/10"

","Speed is set in Los Angeles where disgruntled & bitter ex-bomb squad psycho Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) holds an elevator full of people to ransom, either he gets three million dollars or he blows the emergency brakes but his plan is thwarted almost single handedly by LAPD cop officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves). Afterwards Payne feels even more bitter & angry so decides to play a deadly game with Jack, he tells Jack that he has placed a bomb on an LA bus & when the bus goes over 50mph the bomb will arm & if the bus falls below 50mph it will explode killing everyone on board. Jack risks his life to board the speeding bus to warn the driver & passengers, unfortunately the bus has already reached over 50mph, a way to disarm the bomb must be found or pay Payne his three point seven million dollar ransom...<br/><br/>Directed by Jan de Bont this is a highly enjoyable fast paced action thriller from the 90's the likes of which they don't seem to make anymore. The script by Graham Yost was apparently rewrote by script doctor Joss Whedon who went uncredited & is an action packed adventure film that is very entertaining although is rather silly at times. The idea behind the film is great, I mean we all love a good car chase & Speed's plot basically gives us an entire film based around vehicular mayhem which is no bad thing. The thing moves along like a rocket, at over 110 minutes in length it certainly doesn't feel that long & it's hard not to like a film which is so single minded in trying to provide plenty of action, thrills & excitement for it's audience. I liked it & I think most people will like it, I certainly think most 90's action film junkies will love it. The character's are just about given enough development to bring them to life although I'd have liked a bit more motivation & explanation behind Payne's actions as it's said he was pensioned off & that's his whole reason for the bombings. Sure some of it was pretty silly & very far fetched but what the hell when a films this downright fun & entertaining who really cares?<br/><br/>Director de Bont does alright, he certainly keeps the pace going & there are numerous memorable set-piece action scenes from the speeding bus dodging it's way through the LA traffic to a fight on top of a speeding train to exploding planes to a taught hostage situation at the start. I do have to say that while it's well made there's not much style & the opening credit sequence is maybe the most repetitive & boring I've ever seen in a big budget Hollywood film. There are some continuity issues here, the amount of times the bus hits something head on (smashing that cars door off, hitting the other car up the tow truck ramp & hitting other various sign posts & parked cars) without sustaining any visible damage is stretching things a bit, I mean there isn't even a scratch on it for the first half. It's also nice to watch a film where the majority of the stunts & action was filmed live rather than created using CGI computer effects like most films these days do. The actual violence levels are low & the body count kept to an absolute minimum which is a surprise.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Speed didn't have as big a budget as I had originally thought, maybe they were allowed to film on that unopened freeway for free? Apparently Speed ran out of money during it's production & the subway sequence at the end hadn't been filmed but after good preview screenings (with the subway scene present as storyboards) the studio stumped up the cash to finish it. The acting is alright from a decent cast, Keanu Reeves is OK but doesn't have much presence & Sandra Bullock in her breakthrough role fares much better & comes across as more likable, Dennis Hopper is good as the villain but then he's a great actor anyway so it's expected.<br/><br/>Speed is one one of those great macho big budget action thrillers from the 90's with huge amounts of mindless carnage & mayhem that are so enjoyable, it's a bit more silly than usual as well especially the ridiculous jump across an incomplete freeway which is as far fetched as they come. Followed by Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) which has seemingly killed the franchise."

","This movie blows, and for one very particular reason: the Incredible Leaping Bus scene. At one point in the film, the characters in the bus -- unable to slow down or they'll be blown up -- are faced with the choice of taking a road under construction, which might involve driving on dirt or other unpaved grades, or taking a bridge that is missing a section and thereby involves certain death. They choose the bridge. We are then treated to several seconds of tension as they approach the dropoff where they will obviously all be killed. Just as they approach the gap in the bridge -- where there is no launch ramp, the bus will clearly plunge downward as soon as the pavement ends -- the bus inexplicably leaps into the air, not even waiting to reach the edge of the pavement. It then sails perhaps thirty yards as if the laws of gravity have been suspended and lands pretty as you please on the other end of the bridge.<br/><br/>As a viewer, you tell yourself ""Oh, so magic is involved!"" The movie is ruined. There is no more suspense because clearly, whatever trouble they get into, they can just snap their fingers to get out of it.<br/><br/>The critics told us Speed was great, and then the audience was treated to this garbage.

","This movie is a 100% pure rush of adrenalin to the heart, mind and your desire to be entertained. ""Speed"" has been called ""Die Hard on a Bus"" since the movie centers on a cop named Jack (Keanu Reeves) who is out to stop an insane bomber (Dennis Hopper) who put one of his little friends on a city bus and when the bus hits 50 MPH it will be activated and if it drops to 50 or below, it'll blow up, while taking all the passengers with it.<br/><br/>And this is why the movie has seemingly never-ending surprises, twists and suspense. It's a great idea that is executed so well. For most of the movie the hot driver Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Jack have to find a way to get around traffic and an incomplete freeway to keep the bus going and another thing, keep in mind that they can't keep going around over 50 MPH forever, because think about the bombers demands getting his money in just 3 hours. And also, if they try to get the passengers off he will set the bomb off and use a little common sense, gas doesn't last forever. So how the hell are they gonna get out of this mess? Watch it and find out.<br/><br/>Is this a Die Hard rip-off? Yes. Is it the best rip-off of Die Hard? Absolutely. ""Under Siege"" (Die Hard on a ship) was a bit dull and since it was Steven Seagal, I don't think I need to say more. ""Passenger 57"" (Die Hard on a plane) was poorly executed and didn't have a shred of intelligence; in other words; it was dumb.<br/><br/>This one ""Die Hard on a Bus"" is freakishly awesome, Reeves is at his best without being so wooden as usual (""There's enough C-4 on this thing to put a hole in the world""). Dennis Hopper makes a classic, creepy bad guy named Howard Payne who blows Hans Gruber out of the park (""Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric""). And Sandra Bullock creates some really good chemistry with Keanu in this, and her acting is flawless because she gets into a very humane character than can be seen by her reaction when she accidentally hits a baby carriage. And she's also clearly vulnerable since she occasionally breaks down when something bad happens. And I say Sandra Bullock's acting is the one of the best parts of the movie and her magnus opus of her whole career. Also Jeff Daniels wasn't too shabby as Harry since, like Bullock, provides some human sense into this movie (""That's our scumbaaaaag!"")<br/><br/>The supporting cast on the bus has a few people who are worth pointing out such as the cussing Ortiz (""Man sure has a hard-on for this bus"") and Stephens, the annoying tourist who tries to act cool to impress people but he's really timid and totally loses it when he realizes the situation on the bus.<br/><br/>The stunts are also really cool, you get to see Jack go under the bus to try to disarm the bomb at high speed and when he uses the crane to hold the elevator in the beginning. And the film won a couple Oscars for Sound and special effects, I think. And it deserved them, 'cause the movie looks AND sounds like if a real life bomb threat happened. SPOILERS!: And the part when the bus collided with the plane at the end was perfectly done with the bad@$$ explosion.<br/><br/>This is over 2 hours long, (thank god!) unlike most action films that are about 90 minutes or less and don't have a a lot of suspense or development because of it. And the suspense in ""Speed"" will NEVER stop until you see the credits roll. This is well worth your money and your time, make sure you watch this before you die, because I'm glad I did."

The hero characters are played by Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, in one of his few good roles. Keanu pulls of the action hero very well in this film, and Sandra Bullock appears as a likable heroine who has more to do than scream as people are killed around her. Dennis Hopper also stars as the deranged bomber, delivering a classic line; ""No Jack. Poor people are crazy, I'm eccentric!"" He seems larger than life, probably due to his low screen time.

","Speed is a terrific thriller/action film that gives new meaning to the word ""suspense"".  This and the fugitive are the only true thrilling movie of the past decade.  Keanu Reeves, actually not that bad, plays a cop who is going after a mad-man (Dennis Hopper who is great as the 9-fingered terrorist) who has put a bomb on a bus which will explode if the bus goes under 50 mph. This wouldn't be much of a problem, but in LA it is as much of a problem of pising off Hopper in this movie.  The most action packed, thrilling movie I've seen in a while, maybe equal to the terminator.  Favorite Line (after Hopper's head get's knocked off) Reeves- ""Yeah, but I'm taller.""  Terrific entertainment.  A+"

"Li-1","Null","5","10","16 March 2004"," One of cinema's best pure action films.
","*** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is a rarity: he's a second-rate actor (at least compared to other big movie stars like Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford) who has kept his career afloat courtesy of a critically and commercially successful film every now and then.  These films usually have the tendency to keep his big-screen acting career going steady for another five to six years, by which then he somehow latches on to another big hit.  I hear he's going to be starring in the period epic Tripoli, so expect his career to extend to at least 2012.<br/><br/>Speed is one such film, his second after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but it's actually worth of all the acclaim it's received and then some.  Bringing together a highly unlikely cast (Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and a then unknown Sandra Bullock) and first-time director Jan De Bont, it must have spelled a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>But by miracle or just pure filmmaking bravado (more the latter than the former, though if the film had been made yeseterday, I might be more inclined to agree with the former), they pulled off a great action film, one of the best in big-screen history.<br/><br/>After beginning with what must be one of the most intense opening credits sequences, the plot quickly gets underway.  Mad bomber Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) has just rigged explosives to drop an elevator and its apparently wealthy occupants down quite a few floors to their deaths.  But his plan to extort $3.7 million is foiled by quick-thinking LAPD cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his partner (Jeff Daniels, in pretty much the thankless role that really doesn't go anywhere).<br/><br/>Out for revenge, Payne raises the stakes further in his ransom demands by rigging a bomb under a city bus.  Once the vehicle goes over 50 mph, the bomb will be activated, and once the bus goes below 50, it'll be detonated. Traven makes a mad dash for the bus, arriving after it's already passed 50 mph, but able to keep the bus from going below.  Unfortunately, the driver is shot in a mishap, leaving spunky passenger Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) to take the wheel.  To make matters worse, they're in the middle of morning rush hour; staying about 50 mph will be almost an impossible task.<br/><br/>Speed is divided into essentially three acts and setpieces: the opening elevator sequence, the centerpiece with the bus, and finally a climactic (or post-climactic as some may see it) resolution which I won't divulge here. The bus sequence is easily the movie's highlight, quite possibly the longest action scene I've ever seen.  The whole setpiece lasts just a little over fifty minutes and throws in every imaginably plausible hindrance there is to keeping a bus over 50 mph.<br/><br/>The stark simplicity of the premise is what fuels the film.  There's probably no greater compliment I can pay the movie than to say that I can't imagine the plot being pulled off better.  Every strand related to story and script is merely a means to keep the action and suspense going; I've rarely seen films maintain such a high level of intensity and pure thrilling, crowdpleasing fun for such a lengthy period of time.<br/><br/>Director Jan De Bont's work here is probably among the best feature film debuts out there (only Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead comes to mind, but was that even released in theaters in the U.S.?); he keeps the editing super-tight and the pacing frantic, but still putting the action together with crystal-clear comprehensibility.  That's a fantastic accomplishment. Whatever happened to the De Bont who knew how to deliver such kinetic thrills?  Each of his successive films are progressively worse, and he's even gone as low as making a Tomb Raider sequel.  Mr. De Bont, you're better than that.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue are adequate enough that they don't distract from any of the action or thrills.  limited as his talent may be, Keanu Reeves is just one of those actors who I can't help but like.  His performance here is better than usual and occasionally even quite good, but still fraught with obvious moments of poor acting.  Still, he's a pretty damn easy guy to root for.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is perhaps the real standout of the picture.  As feisty and sexy in a girl-next-door way as any heroine, Bullock is appealingly down to earth and entirely convincing as just a normal bystander caught in an unbelievable situation.  She also has damn good chemistry with Reeves, one of the vital elements missing in the sequel.  Dennis Hopper is fine as the villain, this isn't really anything we haven't already seen from him in one form or another but his schtick was still amusing at the time.  Cast directors must also be applauded for all the extras and character actors they used to play the bus passengers; there's a genuine sense of teamwork and solid chemistry at hand.<br/><br/>At no point does Speed ever crumble; its perfectly lean storytelling ensures that it never strays from the thrills on hand and it's so exciting only the biggest hard-hearted churl would try to nitpick the implausibilities.  The last few minutes might seem a little excessive when one considers how exhausted we already are from all the non-stop action.  That said, the third act is still very exciting, just not as inventive as the action that came before it.<br/><br/>Speed was inevitably followed by a sequel, which wasn't entirely unenjoyable in its own right, but misses a lot of the spark that's evident in this picture.  Hell, I'd even say it needed Keanu Reeves, but by that magical Keanu rule of blockbuster hits, he wisely passed reprising the role of Traven and went on to star in The Matrix.  Yup, I don't see his career extinguishing any time soon."

In retaliation he sets up a bus that if it goes under 50 MPH it will blow up and kill all the people on board. Naturally Jack gets on the bus and with the help of spunky Annie Parker (Sandra Bullock) tries to deal with the situation.<br/><br/>OK--this movie is REALLY stupid. It has an incredibly dumb plot full of implausible situations and jaw-dropping coincidences. Add to that stupid dialogue, one-dimensional characters, a totally unbelievable (and unnecessary) romance between Bullock and Reeves and truly terrible ""comic"" relief and you got one horrendous movie. However this film does have absolutely astounding action sequences. They're loud, realistic and shot so you're right there with them. Despite the stupid plot these sequences kept me watching. Reeves gives another wooden performance but he looks great with a buzz cut and all pumped up. This is the film that made Bullock a star and rightfully so. She's just great in a severely underwritten part. Hopper surprisingly is pretty bad in his role. He usually plays these parts to perfection but he seems going on auto pilot here. Daniels barely figures in this. So the action is astounding but the really dumb plot kept working against it. I can only give it a 5."

","When I first saw Speed in the theaters, I thought it was average at best. Then I saw it about every other day on cable and I've found that this it is even worse than I originally thought. The only good thing to come out of this movie is that it put Keanu Reeves on a top list of Hollywood actors and enabled him to do great movies like Devil's Advocate and The Matrix. This movie is totally based on the materialistic wants of today's young audience and completely ignored realistic plots or even a plot at all along with down-playing the abilities of Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper. I did a report in school on the 51 things in Speed that couldn't possibly happen in real life and in fact, the whole plot by Hopper is impossible at the beginning. When Reeves receives that phone call, he could've easily phoned the bus services in L.A. and had them call the victimized bus before it reached 50 miles an hour. Even without all that, the fact that Reeves made halfway across L.A. in 10 or so minutes is bulls**t, just ask anyone who lives there. Reeves does ok, but shows nothing of what he's capable with in the future, which makes it even more surprising when he does those future movies. This movie is what made Sandra Bullock and why I don't know. She's not gorgeous and she has little acting ability. Any cute girl with a little wit could've played the part. Dennis Hopper has the best role in the movie and does as good as he can with the lousy script he has. Hopper remains one of the least used talents in Hollywood. Why is Jeff Daniels in this movie? Daniels was in this movie for no reason accept to get his name in there. What a sad waste of talent. None of the bus passengers show anything accept average abilities and when the bitchy lady dies halfway through, I feel bad because I'm happy about it. This movie has a few neat scenes and is ok to sit through the first time. Hopper and Reeves are enough to watch for a while, anyway. I give this movie a 3 out of 10. It is probably the most overrated movie in the 1990's."

","We are dependent everyday on motorized transportation whether it's by car, plane, motorcycle, anything else to get us from point A to B in the least amount of time. However despite these things in working order like with all machines there is that looming possibility that something can go wrong and usually does.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite action films of all time, it's just so thrilling and so much fun. <br/><br/>This film has a lot to offer at the quickest amount of time it runs on. The cinematography and effects are great because it's all practical and real. You really do feeling like you moving at high speed. The music score is exciting the theme song is one of my favorite themes of all time, and this score may have been a partial inspiration for the score in the video game franchise ""Metal Gear Solid"".<br/><br/>The characters are really good: Howard Payne by the late great Dennis Hopper is a good opponent, he's a villain you love to hate. His character is a smart greedy psychopath who is menacing, a short fuse when things don't go his way, and he's got some charisma so he's got some really good lines.<br/><br/>Protagonists are also good from the main one Jack Traven played well by Keanu Reeves, he's tough, knows how to keep his cool and be in control of an out of control situation, smart, and also has charisma he has some good lines as well as humorous moments like unintentionally giving a guy I call the Tuneman some grief.<br/><br/>Annie Porter played by one of my favorite actresses Sandra Bullock whom I think is hot and has the persona to boot. She feisty, funny, witty, has some fire in her, she can also handle herself under pressure, has driving skills which are obviously useful, she should of been a race car driver.<br/><br/>Even a few of the passengers and two people that help them Harry Temple (Jeff Danniels) and Capt. McMahon (Joe Morton from the TV show ""Eureka"") are also really good, contribute and have their moments and good lines. This is part of what makes the suspense of the film work is actually caring about the protagonists and hoping they'll get out alive.<br/><br/>The plot I really like it's simple but feels plausible, whose to say no bomber had this in the back of their minds. And the best thing about the film is in it's suspense and pacing. I love the way it's structured it's sort of like a video game you just can't afford to take a breath, where in this film you have three different situations which are the Elevator, Bus, and Train, much like how each level of a game is always a different challenge; and all require for everyone to constantly move if they stay still for even a mere moment then it's game over forever.<br/><br/>Also as the action is going along there are constant obstacles whether it's something in the way or even time itself, I like how the protagonists have to think throughly fast on how to get though this or survive that. It's true certain solutions are implausible like the one for the infamous 50 foot gap but it's a movie like with the TV show ""Macgyver"" it's fun to think some of those things could work. All this just kept me on the edge of my seat, just constantly worrying what else will happen, how worse can things get, and how are they going to survive this or that. Those are questions like the bus just constantly race though you mind the whole time which is another reason why the suspense works. <br/><br/>Well thats as far as I go, Speed has enough millage for action.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"jzappa","10","3","5","28 May 2010"," Just the Meat and Potatoes, Please.
","Stripping the action genre to its narrative core, the classic Speed draws equally from the disaster cycle, and is structured upon three extended set pieces in which a falling elevator, a speeding bus and a rushing train fulfill the sensory pleasures suggested in the title. This is what I believe makes Speed such a delightful revisit for us. It's a classic vehicle (pun intended) for a cop riding roughshod (double pun) to foil a scheme, but not inherently about any moral or legal maze, or a vendetta, or good vs. evil. The cops aren't saving the day from the bad guy so much because they're good guys, but because they have the resources and skills to do so. The bad guy himself isn't much more than a blank-slate psychopath and shouldn't be, because the real antagonists are the laws of physics themselves, fifty-storey elevator shafts, the finite nature of a full tank of gas, highways and other sorts of paths that are under construction. Speaking of which, why would a public subway car be on an incomplete track in the first place? So that it can burst through concrete into a street? There aren't detours and shoulders like a bus on an expressway. It would've saved L.A. and 20th Century Fox a few million dollars if Graham Yost's script made more sense. But what makes Speed such an enthusiastically gratifying experience is that it centralizes to the bottom line, inducing the pure effect of causing us to clench up.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are not exactly thespians known for their versatility. They're movie stars who were young and hot in the 1990s, and played relatively the same characters in various scenarios. But neither are incapable of good performances, and Speed seems to embody the very Californian culture that makes their characterizations lend an everyday charm to these two people. Reeves plays L.A.P.D. SWAT specialist Jack Traven as a sweet, dedicated young guy who likely spends the weekend smoking bongs with his surfer buddies in between saving the lives of every hostage before an elevator is sent plummeting to certain destruction and using commandeered sports cars on Los Angeles freeways as his springboard to jump onto a bus full of people that may explode at any moment. It's a relative enough behavioral variation on the same spaced-out surfer dude/stoner/metalhead he'd been playing, but it gives Jack Traven a fast-sketch exposition, a very endearing one, resulting not in an invincibly tough Republican like McClane or Callahan or Rambo but a more vulnerable and contemporary polite guy pushing the limits of his mental and physical endurance to prevent anyone from being killed. Same with Bullock, who plays essentially the same brassy, inadvertently heroic everyday gal with a warm soul, so putting her Annie, with the convenient revoked license for speeding, in the driver's seat where she is responsible for making the fifty-foot leaps in unfinished road and avoiding pedestrians and other oncoming traffic, we have a character who is put to the test of her own mental and physical endurance as well, in a shorthand fashion by a script that cannot afford to slow down.<br/><br/>Now, the script does, nevertheless, interrupt itself when it leaves the speeding bus for five minutes or so at a time so that Harry, Jack's mentor/partner/best friend played by Jeff Daniels---yet another familiar actor installing behavioral abbreviation for a character---can compile clues to identify a culprit of whom we're already aware, as well as to elaborate superfluously on a far-fetched potential motive, or when Jack and Annie fall in love amidst a frantic life-or-death endurance trial that lasts under a day. And frankly, Dennis Hopper's ham-fisted mad-bomber extortionist is shown on-screen too often during the speeding bus situation for him to be as formidable as he could've been. Imagine the script were its blade not dulled by extraneous commercial sensibilities, a Speed that was able to give us the necessary result of the redundant on-screen investigation by Harry, a Speed confident and edgy enough to skip B on the way from A to C. But the acting, or more precisely the casting, is efficient enough to develop character in a way that streamlines the action.<br/><br/>Jan de Bont, though by no stretch the most consistent or unique, is yet another overseas filmmaker to have come to Hollywood and pumped it up with new inspiration and energy. All in all, what's more crucial than literal everyday people going about literally everyday routines, suddenly finding themselves in danger of dying by explosion, being pulverized, etc.? What could we care about more? We don't have to care that Martin Riggs misses his wife in Lethal Weapon, that John Rambo doesn't want to kill anymore but does, that Dirty Harry has to work with a female partner. We may like these other movies however much, but these are laughably petty concerns compared to people---cops, crooks, tourists, working stiffs, whatever---who have no choice but to struggle or be blown up. That is why Speed, flaws and all, is in a league of its own above other '80s, '90s actioners."
"vip_ebriega","10","3","5","22 April 2008"," Buckle up for safety! SPEED hits the streets
","My Take: A terrific summer movie. Grab on to your seat and buckle up for one heck of a ride. <br/><br/>If you don't know how it feels to get ""involved"" in a movie's premise, then better rent SPEED and experience it yourself. Living under the shadow of DIE HARD, SPEED elevates the seemingly familiar premise into a virtuoso of action scenes and great pyrotechnics, plentiful enough for three action movies. Not contended with keeping our palms sweaty during a daring rescue in a trapped elevator, the movie turns into a mad dash across the traffic-ridden streets of L.A. during rush hour, and then later, a showdown atop a speeding subway train. If you are not thrilled, at least, by one of these action scenarios, then better go see a doctor just in case your pulse is still running.<br/><br/>Instead of ripping-off John McLane from the DIE HARD pictures, which is what a mediocre action knock-off would have done, we are treated with a great action hero. Keanu Reeves is Jack Traven, an LAPD bomb squad officer who, during the first hour, must try to save a couple of people trapped inside an elevator, while a mad (no, eccentric) maniac (played with real villainy by Dennis Hopper) awaits his demand of cash.<br/><br/>When that's all said and done, he must now drive a bus above 50 mph to avoid the bomb in the bus from blowing up. See, if the bus drops speed below 50, it blows up big time. It would have been easy if he was driving this bus at night, but this is rush hour, cars and traffic are everywhere. He gets a lot of help from a loyal passenger, played by Sandra Bullock, who truly shines in the role, given that she is given much more to do than your typical damsel. Director (and former cinematographer) Jan DeBont has a field day in his directorial debut, giving the film the touch of class that action classics, like the DIE HARD films, possess. If I may just note: DeBont was also the cinematographer of action greats like DIE HARD and TOTAL RECALL.<br/><br/>SPEED is one of those few action thrillers that won't disappoint, as well as those that don't make idiots out of the audience. Sure, some parts of SPEED are questionable to logic, but it moves fast enough (and I mean really fast!) to make you forget them. Another great deal about SPEED is that it doesn't get tired of itself. It knows it can do more, and it delivers. When it's done with one scenario, it proceeds to another, and gives as another new scenario there, and the clichÃ©s are thankfully unused due to the originality of its special effects. But most of all, it has a lot of fun with itself, as the audience has a lot of fun with it.<br/><br/>Forget the bloated, uninspired films that claim to be better, a great rental (or better yet, purchase) of SPEED on DVD is twice the treat. Action fans will have so much fun with it as much as non-action fans will love it. SPEED is a clever, thrill-a-minute juggernaut that, simply put, a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

I never really counted the exact time.<br/><br/>Shortly after the credits roll the film grabbed my attention. `Speed' starts off with an elevator being held hostage. without the person taking the people hostage actually in the elevator.<br/><br/>After the elevator scenario, the real situation begins. The `madman' played by Dennis Hopper in a great performance, takes control of a city bus. without being on the bus. Once the bus hits 50mph, it must stay above 50, or it will explode. It's up to Jack Traven, played by Keanu Reeves, to save the day.<br/><br/>Jack Traven is a police officer. How he gets onto the bus while it is in motion is phenomenal. The whole film is. Not to mention spellbinding.<br/><br/>
Once Jack is on the bus, he has a conflict with one of the passenger's who shoots the bus driver. Therefore, a woman named Annie, played by Sandra Bullock takes the wheel. Since the bus has to stay above 50mph, there's no doubt the action is continuous. And if that isn't enough, there's a third action sequence somewhere else off of the bus. If you haven't seen `Speed' you're probably wondering where. I'm not going to tell you. This is one film that you really should see if you haven't already.<br/><br/>`Speed' is a film that I could probably watch every now and then and probably not get tired of.

I know what you're thinking, it needs more scenes with the bus.  They should have had a decoy bus to lead the bomber off while the real bus could escape.  They should have had at least 50 buses that all had bombs on them that Keanu had to try to disarm.  They also should have had a super fast tow bus that could tow the other bus at 50 MPH forever.  This movie needed much more content with the bus.  But one good part is the shot of the subway breaking out onto the street is actually a BUS!  Maybe it would have been better if the elevator scene was not actually an elevator, rather a bus suspended by a cable in an elevator shaft.  It also would have been better if Keanu drove a bus instead of a Jeep. <br/><br/>Speed is still the best movie ever even though there isn't enough bus content.  Maybe Speed 3 will have more bus..."

","I remember seeing Speed the weekend it opened in the summer of 94'. My friend talked me into seeing the film (I just could not buy Keanu Reeves as an action hero), and so there I was in the theatre thinking that Speed would be an average film at best. From the moment the elevator dropped, I was hooked.  Speed is one of the best action films to have ever been made, and even if you see it or have seen it 10, 20, 50, or 100 times it still grabs you and takes you on the ride of your life.  Maybe there were a couple of things that were far fetched ideas (like the bus jumping the gap in the freeway), but overall this movie will thrill you and entertain you from start to finish.  8 out of 10."

","It has been five years since I saw this movie, so I really don't have much specific to say.  I do remember that the bus was traveling at high speeds and yet to me the film felt like it was standing still. I got kind of excited when I noticed that one of the passengers was almost certainly ""Cameron"" from ""Ferris Bueller's Day off"", that was amusing.  But aside from that surprise cameo and a couple of good Dennis Hopper lines, I was bored silly."

","The plot is absurd and it has its share of silly moments and a mustache twirling bad guy in an over-the-top Dennis Hopper. But all of that is beside the point, because Speed's job is not to present a realistic plot, or give us layered characters. Speed is an action thriller and its purpose is to thrill us. And it does a marvelous job at it. Jan de Bont's film is briskly paced, taut, action packed, edge of your seat thrill ride. This is also the movie that cemented Keanu Reeves as a leading action star and propelled Sandra Bullock into stardom. Speaking of Reeves and Bullock, they had tremendous chemistry together as Jack and Annie. Throw in a killer soundtrack and some strong supporting work by the talented Jeff Daniels and what we have here, is in my humble opinion one of the very best, if not the best action/thriller of the 90's."

","Speed stuck like a lightning (no pun here) and lit the box office fire. Keanu Reeves was suddenly an A list action star, next in line to the aging Stallone's and Shwazznegger's. Denis Hopper was rediscovered and suddenly the action genre was well and alive. This was all due to this bomb on the bus blockbuster and It is simply down to good movie making. The bus is the entire set but the action is kinetic and the audience is involved throughout. From a booby-trapped elevator to a bombed bus to a runaway train, this is one pulse-pounding, nitro-fueled film. The acting is also top-notch, and this film is most definitely one of Keanu Reeves' most superb performances. We also can't forget about Dennis Hopper, who brings to his villainous role a sense of morbid humor.

With likable leads, great stunts, not forced romance and an entertaining and not completely over the top villain, we can see as to why Speed is as high praised as it is.<br/><br/>Watching for the first time this year, this film doesn't feel as outdated as many other great or classic films of the 1990's.

"bjoernidler","9","1","1","14 June 2019"," Archetypical action-movie
","If there is some kind of formula for the perfect action movie, Speed is chemistry of the highest level.<br/><br/>It gives us a short but frantic opening scene, not unlike your typical James-Bond movie. We also get to know the hero and the villain.<br/><br/>Then we are quickly put into an impossible situation (a bus that will explode if it runs slower than 50). Now Speed milks this situation and puts new obstacles in our hero's (and the bus') way.
I know that this is classic Die Hard-Stuff. But rarely does a Die Hard-clone work so perfectly well. Everything here from a camera-, editing- and pacing point of view works extremely well.<br/><br/>As usual, you have to accept that we are in movieland and not in real life. But hey, at least Speed is more realistic than all 'Fast and Furious'-Parts which have done everything possible and impossible with cars except flying in space.<br/><br/>The acting is appropriate for this kind of movies. Keanu Reeves is such a good guy. Dennis Hopper is such a bad guy.<br/><br/>One thing bothers me though: I really can't stand Sandra Bullock in this phase of her career. In Speed, she is playing the role of the natural every-day girl. Okay. But Bullock portrays her as an extremely annoying, squeaking woman who repeats almost everything she says multiple times. Drink a shot every time Bullock repeats the same thing in the same or slightly different fashion. You'll be drunk long before the credits.<br/><br/>If you want to see what an archetypical 90's action movie looks like, see Speed."

While rather bereft of intellectual philosophizing, this action-thriller keeps its cool and avoids the over the top, crazy antics sufficiently to make this movie almost believable (except for perhaps an impossible freeway-bus ride that from the way it was shot truly impossible). This movie comes close to the typical stereotypical characters but in some way the director underplayed such characters slightly...the convict, the tourist, the scared passenger all seem to be one-dimensional, yet were never flaunted for exploitation. This movie remains timeless, gripping, captivating in this tight script points and the special effect explosions spectacular yet aesthetically within real world boundaries. The balance of drama, insight, with dollops of humor are nicely blended together to make a rounded movie that can connect with the average viewer. Even the chase scenes were carefully crafted to be acceptably powerful, though once or twice it became close to artificially set designed. Overall, this action-thriller remains an artful and compelling action-thriller that sets a high standard of its genre."

Remember that this movie was released in 1994 and it might not have the standard of good action movies of today, but it was great for its time.

"hatsunemiku-27340","7","1","1","11 September 2017"," A Ride Worth Taking
","A simple rule for action movies, especially of the Western variety: the more explosions the better. Everyone likes a good explosion and nothing draws the audience's attention from wandering more than a loud, colorful boom. This is most likely why action films have cars or buildings blow up for no obvious reason. A car crunches into another, boom. A car flips, boom. A car is shot, boom. It's a trope that has caused me to scratch my head many a time. But to take the majority of action cinema seriously is to miss the point. Heavily criticizing the cinematography or technical aspects of Commando would be a pointlessly stupid endeavor that would beg the question of why you wasted your time. The production knew they weren't making an Oscar worthy film, they were making entertainment.<br/><br/>Speed is entertainment, pure and simple. It's a film in three acts, all of which involve a means of transportation, with no fluff buffering the main sequences. We go quickly from being trapped on an elevator to the iconic bus scenes to the finale on a subway train. Who Keanu Reeves's character, Jack, is doesn't matter. We don't need to see him at home preparing for work or enjoying dinner with his fellow police officers. We are immediately introduced to the threat, an elevator full of people being held for ransom by a remote bomber, and the heroes, Jack and Harry, sent to save them. Everything we need to know about these two is told through action and organic dialogue. It's not enough to really flesh the characters out, but that's not the point. The point of the sequence is the end goal and the process of achieving said goal. How will Jack and Harry get these folks off the elevator and diffuse the bomb? The introduction of the villain, Howard, is another simplistic approach. He kills a guy and we know he's evil. Through the course of the movie we never exactly understand his full motives for what he's doing (money sure, but some movies would opt to elaborate) nor is he a particularly memorable baddie. He's the catalyst for what makes Speed memorable: the action sequences.<br/><br/>The elevator is a well executed scene but the true meat is in the bus sequence, introducing Sandra Bullock's character of Annie. Again, no real introduction, just organic storytelling. She boards a bus that has a bomb on it. Once the bus hits fifty miles an hour, it has to keep going over fifty or it'll explode. Jack learns of this plot directly from Howard and thus begins one of action cinema's most iconic rescues.<br/><br/>There's not a lot to say about it from a technical perspective. Speed is a well-directed affair and there's nothing awkward or bad to complain about. New obstacles are constantly thrown at the bus, almost to a comedic level. A woman with a baby stroller crosses the street in front of the bus, children cross, and eventually the overpass the bus gets on is incomplete, forcing a James Bond worthy flight over a fifty foot gap. None of this will wow you nor is it truly anything unique, but the rapidity of the obstacles combined with the tight direction and confident performances from Reeves and Bullock lead to an entertaining hour of high speed thrills.<br/><br/>The finale is pretty predictable at first (heck, the whole movie is formulaic to be honest). Bad guy disguises as good guys, takes an unsuspecting Annie hostage, and forces Jack into a final confrontation on a subway. Like the elevator, this is a good sequence but not memorable. We want to see the villain get his come-uppance and we want Jack and Annie to get together. And both happen with enough of the prerequisite destruction of property that you'll be glued.<br/><br/>So the question becomes: as formulaic as Speed is, as basic as the characters are, what makes it so good? The answer: everything stated above. It's a pure adrenaline rush film that's well-made and executed despite the shallowness. It's not a piece of art by any means and doesn't try to be. There are constant explosions, moments of excitement, and edge of your seat situations.It's a film that begs of you to sit back, shut off your brain, and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>And that ride is well worth taking."
"mvpeter24","9","1","1","13 July 2017"," Speed is light and totally lovable
","Speed is the definition of a film that knows what it is. It finds its tone and it excels.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jack Traven, an LA SWAT officer. After the film immediately catches the audience's attention with a high-pressure hostage situation in a downtown LA elevator (an exploit that provides smart indirect characterization of our leads), the film deals mostly with a city bus on the highway. A bomb expert has rigged the bus, and if its speed drops below 50 MPH, the explosive will detonate, The narrative takes twists and turns, and as our protagonists decipher clues left behind by the villain, the viewer is always highly engaged. The always-evolving plot is very smartly designed. While the series of difficulties our characters face is numerous, it is never confusing. Plot arcs appear and resolve themselves in such a way that the audience is never lost, in fact the clues are simple enough for the audience to play detective along with the characters.<br/><br/>The characters in Speed are all very simple but very strong. We learn about who the characters are by seeing them react in high-pressure situations. This is ideal in making people who seem real and it is executed effectively. By the time the movie ends, it's hard not to feel pride and relief for the characters after seeing the hell that they go through and their courage. This is an action movie, but it constructs its characters with more nuance than most acclaimed dramas.<br/><br/>Speed isn't afraid to be what it is, and that is perhaps its biggest triumph. All of the film's action is totally over-the-top. The bus infamously makes a totally unrealistic jump across a giant stretch of uncompleted highway, and the viewer is left laughing at its sheer stupidity. But, the film wears the insanity on its sleeve and isn't embarrassed by the craziness. If you wanted a serious police drama, Speed wasn't the right choice.<br/><br/>If you want to crack open a beer and just enjoy a smart, funny, and just plain fun action movie, Speed is the right choice."

He could fix just about anything, probably. And maybe having Dennis Hopper helped, too. He's like the perfect villain, so having him here being all creepy and devious pays off.

","I roll my eyes so many times watching this, I see more of the ceiling than the movie screen. There are so many flaws in this movie's story, I don't know where to begin...<br/><br/>First in someone's car he tries to tell the bus there is a bomb on board on the bus, right there, why couldn't the police have contacted the bus through the contact radio? So he has to do a chaotic scene to get onto the bus? That scene is laughable right there.<br/><br/>Then the most famous scene in Speed, is the biggest joke; when they jump the unfinished part in the road, wouldn't they just drop down through the hole? Or bang into the other side of the road? Also, why does the bus even have to jump the gap in the road when there were numerous exits before it? (like the exit the bomb squad took). And when the bus is circling the airport runway (with tires taken out by the entrance's spike strip), they can hardly keep the little cart Keanu Reeves is riding under the bus stable, yet, the bus turns round and round, with his cart following flawlessly, plus this somehow has to lead to him poking a hole in the bus gas tank.<br/><br/>I also love the last action scene in Speed. This movie was so over dramatized, that all the drama with the bus wasn't even enough, they had to put the characters together on a failed subway car as well. First of all, the subway car wouldn't be running on a track that is still under construction. The scene where they are just crawling on a fast subway car is just a joke, and second, with the failed brake, why couldn't they just shut the engine off and let the car roll to a stop? (instead of having to jump the track) They can speed it up, why can't they just slow it down?<br/><br/>Speed is all about ridiculous, over dramatized action, and definitely not logic. For crying out loud, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies are more believable than Speed!"

I think that Keanu Reeves more successful outings in Chain Reaction and The Devil's Advocate in a way that enables the viewer to engage with the plot, without seeing what may be coming next. Speed fails to do this, at least with any conviction in any context and although it looks cool, once you get about an hour or so into it, you suddenly realize that it is anything but.

"Boyo-2","3","5","12","5 August 2002"," When action compensates for logic
","A thriller must be logical all the way down the line.  It has to be very well-thought out from a writers standpoint.  <br/><br/>If the early scenes are referenced later in the movie, they must be treated logically.  <br/><br/>If peoples' lives are on the line, as an audience member you realize that their main purpose in the movie is to move that plot along, that they are devices for the writer, not actually PEOPLE in the best possible sense.  In this way, the movie got it fairly right.  No one on that bus is anything more than a stereotyped stock character, taken from many an Irwin Allen disasterous background. <br/><br/>The villian should be colorful, have a variety of snide remarks with which to arm himself against the hero, and have a bone to pick with humanity as a whole.  <br/><br/>The hero should have at least one expression other than anger, and the leading lady, if there is room for one in the budget, should be asking the illogical questions most of the audience wants an answer to. <br/><br/>
It should all add up at the end, it should be accountable to itself. <br/><br/>
This is not that movie although it got some things right.  Bullock was not yet a star so had little to lose by just being herself.  Keanu is so one-note that he looks constipated.  Casting Dennis Hopper as a villian is as original as casting Meg Ryan as a bagette-carrying New Yorker with a laptop and a mop-top haircut, who has a lot to give the right guy. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, Jeff Daniels, Glenn Plummer and Joe Morton, previously thought to respect their craft, are along for the ride, too.<br/><br/>
One question - how did the bus still run after the gas tank was punctured? Just curious.   I have two dozen similar questions, but need an answer to that one first.  If that has a decent answer, then maybe its just me alone that expects it all to make some sense.  3/10."

","After the first 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls with little or no dialog-- about the time the super-charged bus made a death-defyimg leap across a freeway chasm-- I figured there had to be a pause coming up. You know the old-fashioned type movie-making when the audience gets a chance to catch its breath and anticipate the action to come. Maybe even a few minutes of human interest. But that pause never came. Then after the second 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls-- about the time the bus blows up the airplane real good-- I figured the pause had to come. But no, it never did. Instead, there was another 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, and about the time the subway began to get a mind of its own, something really strange happened. I realized I had gotten bored. Now you wouldn't think that with all that non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, a viewer could actually get bored. But I was. Something, I think, about too much of one thing becoming first familiar, then old, and finally tedious. Then when the non-stop action and hair-raising close calls finally did come to a stop, as all things must, I had my final revelation. What I had just sat through only looked like a real life movie. But it wasn't. Not really. Instead it was only a cartoon version of non-stop action and hair-raising close-calls with human versions of those familiar characters the Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote. Unfortunately, the money I spent was not cartoon money."

","No, this isn't an address, it's the wattage of the average cop in this movie.<br/><br/>Spoilers <br/><br/>Were the wattage 100, Officer Traven would have shown his badge BEFORE the bus reached 50 mph and there would have been no movie. Okay, mistake number 1 (though not for box office). Then there are the cops, with guns out, going into the bomber's house. Now, I kinda had the feeling then and there that the weapon of choice for a bomber is a bomb, but the cops went in and mistake number 2: Boom! A few Darwin awards there. Then Annie Porter, for no good reason, goes to the last scene, revealing herself, and now the bomber knows that they somehow made it off the bus. Mistake number 3, mayhem ensues. This is all too much, but I guess to take our mind off this, they make the bus fly, ET-style. ""Don't worry"", the producers think, ""the idiots will love this."" 4/10"
"dwpollar","4","3","6","9 September 2009"," Exciting but predictable action gimmick movie...
","1st watched 9/7/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir- Jan De Bont): Exciting but predictable action gimmick movie is OK if you like these kind of movies, I guess. After seeing so many of these no-holds-barred, action-without-cease movies, you start knowing what's going to happen next and then it's over. The premise of this one surrounds around a man who wants money but is challenging the L.A. police department's bomb squad at the same time, for some reason(we find out later why). The enemy is played by Dennis Hopper and he isn't given much to work with in the role(he's a typical scumbag). The good guy(played by Keanu Reeves) is a maverick cop who gets in the way of him making his money after he puts a bomb in an elevator and it backfires. Sandra Bullock becomes the driver of the bus that has to stay going fifty miles an hour or it blows up(the 2nd challenge to the bomb squad). The cop knows what's going on and tries to save everyone as a maverick cop would normally do(especially if played by Keanu Reeves). There are a lot of holes in the silly plot and in my opinion, that' s why the movie doesn't work. Sure it's exciting, but the story behind it doesn't really come across as very believable. Also, technically there are some issues -- like background scenes behind the bus going way too slow for the bus to be going 50 miles per hour. This happens way too often. Sure, it's only a movie, but you'd think the director would think the audience might pick up on this. Something other than the action has to pull us in as well, and it doesn't. The actors aren't given much opportunity to act and the character's are not fleshed out at all. So we go home as an audience not really learning anything except we know we've been on a roller coaster ride for 2 hours(and I for one don't like roller coasters). If you like roller coasters, you might like this one--maybe."
"olds1978","5","3","6","6 July 2006"," Not bad but unrealistic
","I watched this movie 3 times and i can tell that many of the action scenes are a joke. I drive bus and i know what i am talking about.. The jump over the highway is the worst scene of this movie. In several occasions you can see the bus with a lot of damage and some scene later the bus looks like new. I don't know how many buses there spend to do this move, a lot thats for sure. I would like that action movies are more realistic such some European movies. The scene when all passengers are passed to the other bus are almost impossible to do, the speed of both vehicles must be exact during a quite long period. The final scene with the subway crash, please, nobody would survive or may think about sex! The guy trying to take a picture with a close Polaroyd camera is well the final joke. Anyway, this movie is like many others from Hollywood. The camera-work is not bad with all fast changes of scenery,etc. I like the performance from Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper and Keanu Reaves. I give this movie only a 5 and hope there will come more realistic movies in the future."
"MovieAddict2016","9","3","6","3 December 2003"," ""I feel the need. The need for speeeeeeed!"" One of the greatest action films of all time. Who'd'a thought it?
","You're going to say one thing after watching ""Speed,"" and that will be ""Whoa."" This is an action film as exhausting as ""Die Hard"" and as exhilarating as the ""Terminator"" movies. It moves with the pacing of a John McTiernan picture and it has the perfection of a James Cameron action film. Its director, Jan De Bont, has worked on such films as ""Die Hard"" and ""The Hunt for Red October,"" so it's no surprise that he bears a resemblance behind the camera to McTiernan.<br/><br/> The film is blunt, fast-paced and extremely exciting. It stars Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven, a Los Angeles bomb squad member as cool as he is decisive. Jack has been called into duty, along with his partner and friend, Harry (Jeff Daniels), to stop a madman bomber (Dennis Hopper), who has taken control of an elevator and will drop it to the ground unless his demand of three million dollars is met.<br/><br/> Jack takes his chances and ends up saving the day, but not before Harry is taken hostage and survives with a bullet shot. Howard Payne (Hopper) is dead, blown to pieces by his own bomb, and so they all go have a drink and party till the moon goes down and the sun rises up. You get the idea.<br/><br/> But Payne didn't really die, and now he's very mad at a certain somebody who foiled his last plan. He's spent a lifetime being treated as dirt, and he has convinced himself that he deserves the $3 million more than anybody else. Jack begs to differ, but he has no time to argue when Payne reappears and triggers a downtown bus with a bomb. The catch? If the bus accelerates past 50 M.P.H. and then drops below that point as before...kaboom.><br/><br/>Jack manages to board the bus, but not before it reaches 50, and not before the bus driver gets shot by a criminal on the bus and Annie (Sandra Bullock) has to play driver for the rest of the day. The problem is, downtown LA during rush hour is not exactly open to a large bus, so with the help of the LAPD, the bus is driven to a deserted stretch of highway, where they have a limited amount of time to either disarm the bus or pay up the sum of money to Payne.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, Howard Payne is monitoring everything from his position in an apartment in LA, where he has a gadget wired up to the security camera in the bus, so that he can watch everything that's happening. If anyone tries to get off the bus, or if anyone tries to be a hero, he presses a little red button and.kaboom. Only this time, he's determined not to fail.<br/><br/> This is a ludicrously and ridiculously delicious plot. I'm surprised it hasn't been done already. Well, actually, it sorta has. Yes, this film bears an uncanny resemblance to ""Die Hard,"" only on a bus, but you know what? It's just about as good. It's exciting, humorous, and absolutely fun from start to finish. It never stops to go into boring conversations back at the FBI headquarters that so many action films do to try and make them look smarter. It never lets up for a moment once it starts.<br/><br/> All good action films have comedic relief, and ""Speed"" - apart from occasional witty remarks between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves and/or Dennis Hopper - has Alan Ruck and Jeff Daniels. You may remember Ruck as Cameron Frye in John Hughes' ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), and you may remember him from the television show ""Spin City,"" and here he plays a tourist who isn't really able to understand the situation they're in on the bus. ""The airport?"" he says as the bus swerves down a runway. ""I've already been here.""<br/><br/> Daniels is one of cinema's great character actors with dry subtle humor. He can do dramatics (""Gettysburg""), he can do comedy (""Dumb and Dumber""), and he can now do action. It takes an odd sort of acting genius to subtly upstage Jim Carrey, but he did just that in ""Dumb and Dumber"" by making a subtle goofball out of his character, Harry Dunne. Here he does the same with the sort of bleak sarcastic quips he was born to say.<br/><br/> Jan De Bont knows how to film action. Just when you think everything's going to slow down after the bus finally stops, we realize it's just the beginning. Payne kidnaps Annie, takes her to a subway train, and tries to run away with her to lure Jack. It works. And in the climatic gripper, Jack and Payne fight on the top of a speeding subway train. It was done in ""Mission: Impossible"" a small number of years later, but this came first. And the film is better.<br/><br/> Can Keanu Reeves act? Hardly. He does his usual ""Whoa"" routine here, where his lines primarily consist of long pauses and, ""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Whoa,"" ""Wow,"" ""F--k me,"" ""Bogus,"" and so on. But an action film doesn't need a good actor, and Reeves fits the part. It was his breakthrough action role - without it, he never would have appeared in ""The Matrix.""<br/><br/> ""Speed"" is one of the great action films. It bears similarities to ""Die Hard,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""RoboCop,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""The Terminator"" (1 and 2), ""Predator,"" and all those other hard-punching action films with a fast pace and a real kick (it doesn't bear resemblance to all of the films as much as the raw force behind them). You know the kind of hard action flicks I mean - the kind that make you feel beaten up by the time it's all over. The kinds that make you leave the theater bruised and swollen.<br/><br/> You're going to be going 50 miles per hour watching ""Speed,"" and in this case, that's a good - no, great - thing.<br/><br/> 5/5 stars."
"rmax304823","4","3","6","24 January 2002"," Movie Culture
","It's always interesting to look at movies through history as if they were all part of the same overall culture, drawing on similar behavioral conventions and technologies. Like living cultures, movies have a historical context, undergo innovations, evolve over time to reflect changing folkways, and so forth. Speed gives us an ultimate example of innovation and originality, leading through convention, to utter decadence. <br/><br/>There have been speed movies ever since there were movies and they were new and exciting at the beginning. The Keystone Kops were pretty good. Then they became conventional, with Model As careering around urban corners, tommy guns blazing out the windows; Bogart wheeling his speeding coupe up the slopes towards Mount Whitney in accelerated time. The big ones were saved until the movie's end usually. Then the car chase underwent what anthropologists call a revitalization movement. I'm talking about Bullitt. Nothing like this chase had (or has) been put on film. <br/><br/>Then we enter a period of decadence, which we may define as increasingly perfunctory repetition and variation of a once-original idea. (The ancient Egyptians drew very careful open hands in their hieroglyphic script. Over the millenia, with less attention being paid and with a good deal of sloppy borrowing going on, the open palm managed to turn into a simple delta shape, from which we get our letter D. That's decadence. It's a real thing.) Well, if it's good once, let's do it again and make another nickel. <br/><br/>Other outrageous chases followed in The French Connection, the Seven Ups, and so on; nicely choreographed but no longer original. Now the public has seen enough car chases. Let's introduce other vehicles into the chase. We can use a runaway cruise ship. Let's put the chase at the beginning -- why make the audience wait until the end? Beverly Hills Cop STARTS with a chase involving a car and some kind of garbage truck. <br/><br/>Finally we reach a sort of climax with Speed. With the exception of some shenanigans on and in an elevator, the entire movie is one big chase involving diverse vehicles, most prominently a bus. Sandra Bullock is cute as the wisecracking girl drawn into the plot. Keanu Reeves is clean-cut and handsome, no more than that. But none of that matters. The only important thing is that lumbering behemoth banging cars off the freeway, leaping through 50 feet of open space, and smashing everything in sight. It's thrilling. Of course it's thrilling. We could dispense with the characters entirely and it would still be thrilling -- a thrilling hour and a half of a bus zipping along the streets of Los Angeles like a juggernaut and demolishing everything it can.<br/><br/>I'm wondering. Surely they have a video game for children out by now, called ""Speed."" One point for each traffic sign or highway cone. You get five points for squashing a pedestrian. Ten points for a wrecking a car. Fifteen points for a truck. Glancing blows earn you half credits. If you turn too quickly and flop over, or if you hit a locomotive, you lose."

","A cop is having a bad day, having to deal first with an elevator booby-trapped with a bomb, then a bus, and finally a train. Apparently the filmmakers were saving an airplane for the sequel. It starts off stupid and gets stupider as it goes along. The script is mind-numbingly idiotic and doesn't know when to call it a day. The direction is so incompetent that De Bont should have been forced to go back to his day job of cinematographer. Reeves is OK as an action hero but looks lost if he has to flex any acting muscles, such as the scenes where he tries to show anger. Bullock is given little to do except look cute, which she manages quite well. Hopper is a shameless ham."
"The-Sarkologist","2","3","7","6 December 2013"," Actually, I found this movie really boring
","I heard a lot of hype about this movie when it was on the big screen and a lot of people seemed to like it and say good things about it. I never got around to seeing it on the big screen, and was not too keen on seeing it considering Sandra Bullock's quote: let's have a relationship based purely upon sex. That seriously put me off seeing the movie, but I watched it when my sister hired it and my opinion was that it was dull.<br/><br/>Speed is supposed to be an action movie with suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The best part of the movie is when the bus smashes through a pram but after that the rest of the movie is simply too predictable. The events in the movie are not constructed in a way that makes you wonder what is going to happen. We expect everything to be all right, and of course it is. There is one scene where the bus has to jump a gap in the freeway, and it is a very wide gap. We know that the bus is going to make it because there is no other way of solving the situation without killing a majority of the people on board the bus (which would end up defeating the purpose of the film) An ex-bomb squad officer is disillusioned at the measly pension that he received after retiring so he decides that he will use his knowledge of bombs to get himself a lot of money. He plans an elevator bomb but his plan is foiled by the LAPD, and namely one particular officer played by Keanu Reeves. Angered at his failure, he wires more bombs to buses, one which explodes as a warning. The second is wired to a bus that arms when the bus exceeds fifty miles per hours and explodes when it drops below fifty kilometers an hour. He has a network of cameras to keep an eye on everything to make sure his plans are going okay.<br/><br/>There are a lot of faults in the movie. Like how can a crane that is designed to lift heavy weights cannot hold up an elevator full of people. Then the bigger hole is that this man has a measly pension yet he seems to not only have access to very specific explosives, but he also has the money to be able to afford some extremely advanced equipment. Being bomb squad, he has the knowledge to rig bombs, but it seems that he should not have the money.<br/><br/>Speed also raises some interesting issues, but puts them across badly. What we have in this movie is the fact that police officers are putting their lives on the line constantly yet are being paid very little. Whether this is true or not I don't know (I have since discovered that it is not actually true), but if this is an issue the movie brings it out in a very bad way. Basically it is telling us to shut up and put up with the problems in our society because there is no way to solve them. Basically if we try to solve them, usually through violence, then we are bound to fail. In another way this is also an anti-terrorist film, trying to put the message across to all us would be terrorists to warn us away from using violent methods to solve our problems, because even the grandest of schemes is doomed to failure."
"stormhawk2020","10","2","4","8 October 2017"," One of the best 90's action films
","A movie from start to finish, full of unbridled action, explosive and crazy, with a few comic touches, but all with order.<br/><br/>And it is that this film are the ones that you get to see them and if you have to see it again does not matter. The film begins and the action and tension can be felt at first, and one can imagine what awaits him, but as the minutes progress, the film becomes more and more interesting, and it fills up scene after scene of emotion and action, and leaving no room for boredom and laziness.<br/><br/>As usual, many movies of this type, have a fast, hurried and meaningless end, but in the case of this movie, it has nothing to do with it, but rather the opposite and where it leaves one with desire that the film does not end there and follow.<br/><br/>Finally to point out that an action movie, you have to know how to act and know how to put faces, and in this both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do it like nobody else, getting the viewer to the feelings and emotions and involving them in every situation of danger."
"hnt_dnl","9","2","4","17 October 2015"," Winning action film from the 90s!
","While I still think the 80s is the seminal decade for action movies, the 90s weren't too shabby, either! For whatever reason, 80s movies stand out more to me over time (not just action movies, but movies in general). As accusatory as people are about the 80s being ""dated"", I have a hard time not laughing at some of the absurd, odd apparel and grooming choices of society in the 90s. Thankfully, a good film can overcome these obstacles and not appear dated. This one, SPEED (1994) fits the bill!<br/><br/>Starring Keanu Reeves, who in my opinion delivers his greatest film performance, ""Speed"" is an ""adrenaline rush"" of a movie. The movie starts with an intense, suspenseful sequence of a group of people trapped in an elevator rigged with a bomb set to detonated by it's creator psychopath Howard Payne (played solidly by Dennis Hopper). Enter our film's hero Officer Jack Traven (played by Reeves), a member of the LAPD S.W.A.T. team, along with his partner Harry (winningly played by Jeff Daniel). Harry is the typical snarky sidekick of the film's action hero, but Daniels' reliably goofy personality makes it work. This film actually makes me understand why he was good in ""Dumb and Dumber""! LOL Reeves and Daniels buddy chemistry is believable.<br/><br/>After Jack and Harry save the day, Payne is presumed dead in an explosion. A few months pass, and two city buses are rigged to explode. Turns out Payne is very much alive and out to play cat-and- mouse with Jack. Payne detonates the first bus, then tells Jack where the second one is. Jack finds the bus, but the catch is that once it goes over 50mph, it has to stay above that speed or the bomb will detonate, thus the plot of ""Speed""!<br/><br/>In a surprising development, one of the bus passengers Annie (wonderfully played by then relative unknown, but now famous Sandra Bullock), who was on her way to work, must take over the wheel and keep the bus above 50mph. Along for the ride are a group of reliable supporting players: Joe Morton as the S.W.A.T team leader and Alan Ruck, Beth Grant, and Carlos Carrasco as part of the group of frustrated and frenetic bus passengers.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the film starts off with hostages trapped in an LA high-rise office building, a la ""Die Hard"", of which ""Speed"" has been called a ripoff in some circles. But ""Speed"" still works as it's own entity mainly due to Jack Traven feeling like an original character due to Reeves' strong acting and convincing performance as a cop and action hero, the Jack-Annie dynamic, and even the overall vibe of ""Speed"" is more fast-paced than ""Die Hard"". ""Die Hard"" is still the seminal action film, but ""Speed"" is a great addition to the genre. In particular the stunts are very well-staged, convincingly delivered, and don't feel implausible for the most part. <br/><br/>Now, the film definitely has a few minuses. Other than the action, of which there is a lot, much of the non-action scenes are the standard of most action films. While Hopper is very good as the villain of the piece, he's not nearly as memorable as other action movie bad guys, like the ones from the original Lethal Weapon and Die Hard movies. I've also read people say that Bullock steals the film, and I think that's incredibly overstated. Her role isn't as large in this as I initially remembered. While her chemistry with Keanu is palpable, this film is Reeves' movie all the way. While he may be the weaker actor overall of the main cast, in this film, REEVES steals the show! <br/><br/>Although Jan De Bont would go onto to direct the extremely cheesy ""Twister"" and the awful sequel to this film ""Speed 2"", both dubious projects to say the least, he can always hang his hat on ""Speed"" as being one of the most intense, engrossing action movie experiences of the 90s, if not of all time."

"bowmanblue","10","2","4","27 January 2015"," Pop quiz: what's the best action movie of the nineties?
","Answer: Speed. I just watched it again, now twenty-one years after I first saw it in the cinema. There are few movies that can be considered 'timeless' and, although 'Speed' may be an unlikely name to be added to that list, I truly believe it deserves its place among the 'action greats.' Even though it was filmed in the nineties, it looks as good today as it ever did. Okay, so the absence of iphones and Twitter may be noticeable, but it could basically be set today and you wouldn't really notice. The special effects are perfect and blend seamlessly with the action (no dodgy computer generated armies of monsters of far away planets to distract you and pull you out of the moment).<br/><br/>Yes, it's definitely an 'action' movie (okay, there's a beautifully-woven romance element in there, but it's not central to the overall story). And, normally when I watch a blatant all out action film, I assume that the – primary – audience would be the lads. However, Speed is actually a film that's so good it's probably quite watchable even if you're not really into explosions and car chases.<br/><br/>Speed's primary selling point is its simplicity. The story is hardly complicated and yet so original that it's amazing that it's never been done before. A mad bomber places an explosive device on a Los Angeles passenger bus and, if it slows down to less than fifty miles an hour, the bomb detonates. That's pretty much it for the majority of the film – the bus ride. And it's a hell of a ride to say the least.<br/><br/>And then there's the cast. Poor ol' Keanu Reeves sometimes get a little flack for his acting abilities. However, he's on top form here as the no-nonsense cop who's determined to save the passengers and bring down the bomber at the same time. I always remember one of the reasons 'Die Hard' is also regarded as a classic action film – because the relationship between the hero and the villain is at the forefront of the story. Here, we have Dennis Hopper as the bomber who's always one step ahead of the police. Thanks to mobile phones he's in constant contact with Keanu, reminding him how the police are going to fail. Of course it wouldn't be complete without the obligatory 'love interest.' Granted Sandra Bullock was sort of well-known from Demolition Man the year before this, but Speed was definitely her break-through performance.<br/><br/>Like I said, Speed is timeless and one of the most accessible, watchable movies ever made in its genre. It really does have everything you could ever want if you're looking for an all out thrill-ride – it's primarily fast, but also contains moments of genuine heart and sadness (let's just say the path of the righteous doesn't always run smoothly). It's just a shame that lightning obviously wasn't able to strike twice (and by that I'm talking about the – sadly – inferior 'Speed 2')."

The story here concerns a rookie cop who must board a bomb-rigged city bus & do whatever it takes to keep the speed above 50 mph or else the bomb goes off automatically.<br/><br/>The pacing is fierce, the direction is impressive, the screenplay is taut, the editing is tight, and the performances by Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock along with an intense score makes Speed a smooth ride with very few bumps along the road. One of the best chase films of its or any other time with far too many memorable sequences than any typical film of its genre, Speed is an intelligent & highly entertaining cinematic ride that still hasn't aged a day.<br/><br/>A timeless classic that can be enjoyed over n over again without any loss in its potency, Speed effortlessly manages to kick some serious ass than most action films of today even when so many years have passed. Unquestionably recommended."

"Robert_duder","9","2","4","14 January 2012"," Hands down one of the best action films in existence
","I can review Speed very easily. It defines riveting, edge of your seat, pulse pounding, action packed, breathless action. The concept is just brilliant and the first time I saw Speed many years ago I remember barely being able to sit on my seat let alone be on the edge of it. It just takes you away, knocks it out of the park and keeps you riveted for the entire run time. Is it perfect? No. It actually has a ton of flaws when you start to dissect it but the film making is so good, the concept so captivating that you forget and ignore everything that is silly about it. A great action movie should be able to make you suspend reality and believe every word and scene they show you. Speed will make you ignore how ridiculous it is that they jump a full sized city bus across a gaping hole in an overpass and instead you will stand up, cheer and root for that scene. Some of the film is honestly bordering on cheesy and it just doesn't matter one lick because this is the most adrenaline packed, thrill ride you will ever lay your eyes on.<br/><br/>90's Movie star Keanu Reeves was probably the perfect choice for this film. He has the star power and the clout and the chemistry to pull off being the hero of this movie. No one could have done it better. That being said Reeves has a particular style to him that is inherently cheesy. When I watched Speed again and again I found myself laughing more at his performance but it doesn't change the fact that he is the star and carries the movie just fine. Sandra Bullock is fantastic in her role as Annie. Annie is fun and wild and clumsy and just a great female hero. Her and Reeves actually have great chemistry and Bullock fans will absolutely love this performance. Dennis Hopper is deliciously evil as Howard Payne (what a great bad guy name), and like Reeves has a certain B-Movie quality to his character but does it so well and the cat and mouse between him and Reeves is perfect. Jeff Daniels plays Reeves partner and does a good job. The only issue with him is that I wish they had used him more in the story. I wish I could mention all of the supporting cast because they are all really good in their roles especially the other passengers on the bus.<br/><br/>I don't think director Jan de Bont has done anything since this film that even touches how great this genre film was. By nature he is a cinematographer and I think that's interesting because this film is stunning to watch. Every shot, every scene, the pace and style of the movie is just brilliant. I can't express enough that this is THEE quintessential action flick. This is the sort of action flick you could watch again and again and still be thrilled by it every time because it is literally non-stop action from beginning to end. I rarely mention music when it comes to films but the music in Speed stays with you with this thumping beat and a great soundtrack. If you haven't seen Speed...you're missing out...because it defines action and you can find few films even close to being better. 9.5/10"

","Speed is something we all love, I know I sure do, the feel of the car going fifty miles an hour you passing everyone by like they were turtles. People cursing you out and flicking you off as you swerve in and out of traffic like a mad man. But wait! There's a problem, your not driving some supped up sports car. Your driving a LosAngeles city bus that is rigged to blow if it drops below 50 M.P.H. then bus goes kaboom!! And you and everybody else inside are toast(or more like smoked meat, but you get the idea.) This is the problem L.A.P.D. detective Jack Traven has. He has to keep a bus full of people alive while trying not to drop below fifty,talk about a major adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Speed is nicknamed ""Die Hard ob a bus"", and to tell you the truth it is, Speed is an electrifying mix of adrenaline pushing action and heart stopping stunts, it's the kind of movie you walk into and know your just going to love it( how can't you?) this film is not meant to be Die Hard it's meant to be a film that rivals Die Hard, and right now it is still the only film that can rival it.<br/><br/>Speed is not your ordinary action film it's one of the few with smarts, and plenty of it to go around this film throws out the smarts and action in perfect harmony, not many action films do that, and that is what makes this one so unique and original and so much fun to watch, Speed is the best action film when it comes to humor, intelligence's and most importantly Speed. It's a film you can watch over and over again and love every minute of it it truly is the top dog of action."

","The premise of a summer action movie doesn't get much better than this one: A bus in downtown LA is rigged with a bomb that is set to explode if it goes below 50 mph. But as film history will tell us, a good premise does not make a good movie unless the filmmakers do unique and interesting things with it. Does ""Speed"" have what it takes? Absolutely.<br/><br/>When it comes to action/adventure movies that expand on a single premise, there's no one better than Jan de Bont. Considering where his career is right now, that surprising, since the man who gave us masterpieces such as this and ""Twister"" is being passed over for hacks and wannabees such as Simon West and other cheap posers that don't know what they're doing. de Bont never wastes a moment, and that keeps the pace up. ""Speed"" is relentless, especially in this respect. The visuals are first-rate, and except for one minor exception, they surpass today's (if only because they are real, or the CGI isn't so cheap it's obvious).<br/><br/>The acting is great as well. There are few actors as consistently wooden as Keanu Reeves (save for Luke Wilson). But I guess every actor has his day (Reeves has three: this, ""The Devil's Advocate"" and ""The Matrix""). Granted, the role doesn't require much range, but Reeves creates a likable and sympathetic hero (California cool included). Dennis Hopper is a terrific villain, rivalling Alan Rickman in ""Die Hard,"" though Hopper is more psychotic, or in his own words, ""eccentric."" Also noteworthy is the terrifically lovable Sandra Bullock who uses her comic aptitude to great effect, and she also allows herself to be vulnerable, which makes her more three-dimensional.<br/><br/>Like in de Bont's later film, ""Twister,"" composer Mark Macina creates a memorable theme that complements the film to perfection.<br/><br/>Flaws aren't really a problem here (I dare anyone to name an action movie that hasn't given into temptation and gone over the top at least a little). Yes it recycles one of the twists that it used, but it still works, so I can't really fault it.<br/><br/>Finally here's a movie that lives up to its premise and its title."

","Speed is an excellent action movie, populated with sympathetic characters and stunning visuals. A movie so intense, yet fun at the same time, doesn't come around often.<br/><br/>Plot: You already know but what the hey. After an unsuccessful attack on a building, a terrorist plants a bomb on a bus that will detonate if the bus drops below 50mph.<br/><br/>It is simplistic but effective. The minor details of the movie are what make it succeed. stunt work on and off the bus is photographed with daring explicity. Jan De Bont is determined to show us everything. He doesn't cower.<br/><br/>The movie is also acted well. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have instant chemistry which inspires sympathy from the audience, which in turn heightens suspense, thrills, etc.<br/><br/>These details come together to make a terrific action adventure. It's a shame that De Bont went on to make commercialist bilge like tomb raider 2 and the haunting. <br/><br/>I must admit that i am one of the few people who will defend speed 2 cruise control. I found it to be highly enjoyable. Just though I'd say that"
"ghettodogaudio06","4","2","4","12 February 2008"," This film gets one thumb down but is worth a watch!!!
","I remember this film when it came out and re-watching my Blockbuster rent a copy I enjoyed the fine acting skills of Keanu Reeves. This is one of the Few Films he has done that I actually enjoy more then a good laugh from Bill & Ted or the film that made Keanu Reeves, The Matrix. He is really good in this. Sandra Bullock is also awesome. Dennis Hopper always plays the same bad guy voice. Watch him in David Lynch's Blue Velvet and he plays a bad guy that is more evil then the Ex-Angry Cop in Speed. This film gets one thumb down but is worth a watch. In the early 90's when this film came out it did very well at the Box Office and for rentals. Cool film of the time but the sequel sucks. I remember I went to see both the first and second one in the theater. And I remember feeling the same way as I did with Batman Forever or Jurassic Park Three. Slightly ripped off."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","2","4","26 December 2007"," Never really understood its appeal.
","It's not that I hate this movie, it's just an average one at best. It's an action movie with only small action moments at times and a story that is too simple and restrained due to its main setting; a bus.<br/><br/>I do admit that the movie deserves credit for its concept. I mean, this is obviously not the most expensive action movie of the '90's but due to its concept the movie at all times has a good fast pace and knows to provide the movie with action moments, though I never have really been impressed with the action in this movie. I think this has to do with the fact that the action tries to impress too much. You know, it's the sort of action movie that shows an explosion and big jump from 3 different angles and all in slow-motion as well. This is a style that was frequently used in '80's and '90's genre movies. I just never have been a big fan of this, with some exceptions to this here and there.<br/><br/>It was pretty nice to see Hollywood veteran Dennis Hopper as the main villain of the movie. It also was the movie that put him really back on the map for a while. This is also the movie that really launched Keanu Reeves' and Sandra Bullock's careers and as well that of director's Jan de Bont, who made his directorial debut with this movie. I also have the feeling that the former cinematographer is still working in Hollywood as a director due to the success of this movie. Because let's face it, all of his other directed movies were below average, with the exception of ""Twister"", though I seem to be one of the few that actually loved that film.<br/><br/>At some moments you can also really tell that this is de Bont's directorial debut. There are some typical beginner's clumsiness's and mistakes. I mean, just look at the goof section here on IMDb for this movie. It's like a never ending list! Just compare this to any other random movie on here. Some of the goofs are obviously more obvious than others in the movie but the goofs that are obvious are also really silly and clumsy one's, which mainly has to do with continuity.<br/><br/>The movie is for most part set on a bus, which is both it's strongest and weakest point. Strong because it keeps the movie fast paced as I had previously mentioned before and weak because it really restrains the movie in its story. I mean, let's face it, the story isn't exactly the best or most clever one ever written, even though the concept of it is still good and original. Because the movie is mostly set on a bus also the other scene's around it which are not set in the bus, and I'm also including the beginning and ending of the movie, feel quite out of context with the rest of the movie. It makes this also a fairly disjointed movie to watch. Especially the ending doesn't seem fitting. It feels like the sort of ending that was filmed shortly after a failed test-screening with an alternative ending. I feel that the movie would had been better off if it actually did ended on the bus instead of having this whole subway ending.<br/><br/>It's definitely a watchable movie, though by no means the must-see everyone makes this movie out to be.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This ""Speed"" movie about a ""Speed"" bus that should have a lot of ""Speed"" so they don't get blown up. Okay enough of that. This is a very excellent and exciting thriller, and great acting alive with emotion. And may I say a decent cast, wow. A lot of hot stars in this one. An unforgettable role of Keanu Reeves way back before he starred in The Matrix, and great acting too. And not to mention Sandra Bullock of While You Were Sleeping, Ms. Congeniality, A Time To Kill and many others. And not to say the least, the villain Dennis Hopper. His acting is very solid and captivating, and he is very convincing as the bad guy. I especially like the part when he tell them about bombs. ""Bombs must blow, if they don't they're not bombs, they're gold watches."" That was cool. And the way they get the hostages out is amazing and cliffhanging, and full of suspense, find out yourself, you'll find it cool. Recommended to all fans of action, adventure thrillers and to those who love Dennis Hopper."

","One of the last great action movies, fast moving, exciting, action packed, with good acting, Speed is still better than all the Summer blockbusters they try to feed us now. No-one is trying to destroy the world, we just have an old fashioned psycho who wants revenge. Dennis Hopper plays an ex bomb disposal guy who was chucked out of the force, and believes he deserves due payment. When his plan is stopped by Reeves, a reckless cop, and Bridges, his calm partner, Hopper decides to put Reeves through a series of tests. He puts a bomb on a bus, which will be armed if it goes above a certain speed, and then detonated if it goes below 50. Reeves begins a race to find the bus, stop the bomb, save the innocents and find the bad guy. On the bus he meets Sandra Bullock, Annie, who has to take over driving the bus when the driver is shot. They form a partnership and try to find the bad guy.<br/><br/>It is clearly the stunts that are the selling point for the film, and they are superb. The action is directed well, and the good guys never seem to get a break, with every situation scraped through narrowly. Reeves is good, Bullock sparkles in her first big role, and Hopper does the mad thing brilliantly. The rest of the cast all perform well also. many memorable moments, and lots of fun, with a plot full of humour and tension."

","Try to imagine this: a trapped bus that contains a bomb. It mustn't come down to 80 kilometres an hour, otherwise the bomb is exploding. This is about this interesting idea that Jan de Bont designed one of the most successful movies released in 1994. He made a spectacular and suspenseful action movie where he can constantly sustain the interest. Obviously, it contains a few implausibilities: in one sequence, the bus's managing to cross a bridge that is very large. Moreover, the movie also distills a kind humor. At the end, ""Speed"" is an honorable success and Dennis Hopper is an excellent terrorist. As Alfred Hitchcock said: ""the more successful the bad guy is, the more successful the movie will be""."

","Following an enjoyable business luncheon, several high-ranking employees get onto an elevator in a 40-floor building. Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), who has wired the elevator's cables and emergency brakes with C4 explosives, sits in a freight elevator elsewhere in the building. After blowing the cables, Payne informs the police that unless 3 million dollars is paid to him in 60 minutes, he will detonate the brakes as well. Officers Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are ordered to examine the bomb, and end up saving all of the elevator's passengers, thwarting Payne.<br/><br/>Just days later, Payne contacts Traven. Howard has concocted a new game, and this time he wants 3.7 million. A Los Angeles city bus has been wired with a bomb that will arm itself when the bus reaches 50 miles per hour. Once it falls below that speed, the bomb will detonate. If there is any attempt to evacuate, Payne will detonate the explosive remotely.<br/><br/>""Speed"" is without a doubt one of the truly great action films of the 90s. It is grandly suspenseful and sucks the viewer in for one thrilling ride. The aggressive soundtrack is superb, as is Jan De Bont's directing. From the elevator job, to the scene of the rogue bus hurtling through the streets of LA, to the phone dialogue between Payne and Traven, to the awesome climax, ""Speed"" remains true to its hypertension-inducing form.<br/><br/>In a similar manner, the movie presents the effect of the crisis on the innocent hostages. It presents them as normal, everyday people thrust into an extreme situation. Sandra Bullock delivers her usual strong performance as a commuter who ends up driving the rigged bus. She is the only passenger who is not one-dimensional, but even with the others frozen in their simple roles, we feel like we are on the bus with them. This creates an ideal atmosphere to tell the story in.<br/><br/>As the lead, Keanu Reeves performs well in all facets of his role. He comes across as a complex person whose different strengths and personal qualities come into play in the various situations he encounters. His acting talent is often called into question, but his portrayal here is strong and leaves me wondering why so many are hard on him.<br/><br/>As the antagonist, Dennis Hopper comes through with possibly the top performance of his celebrated career. It is hard to imagine anybody else playing his part at the same level. Payne is one of the most potent villains I have ever seen. He is a brilliant and well-prepared man. Howard Payne trails only Elliot Carver for villain of the decade.<br/><br/>All of these ingredients add up to an outstanding film worthy of multiples viewings. From exceptional stunts and pyrotechnics to the intense plot, ""Speed"" appeals to all categories of action fans. ""Speed"" will treat the viewer to a capital thrill. It not as good as they say. It is better."

Well, after careful ""thinking""(if I could think straight at 7) I decided to go and see it. BOY OH BOY!!!!!

When I was extremely sick with the flu for a week, the movie Speed had just recently come out on video. While lying in bed sick and nothing to watch on television, my mom pleasantly surprised me with the movie SPEED to watch since she knew I was absolutely in love with Keanu Reeves and just loved the movie. That really helped me out alot. Tripped out isn't it?! Well hey, whatever helps. This movie has boosted my love for action movies of all kinds.

","Speed, directed by Jan de Bont, produced by Mark Gordon, Allison Lyon & Ian Bryce was a high intensity, but typical action movie. In this rare occasion, the editing by John Wright, and score by Mark Mancina was what carried this movie, and made it more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I'm usually okay with simple action movies, that doesn't have too much of a back story, but this one was just okay at best. With a cast of Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Daniels & Dennis Hopper, I was expecting some good character development, but we got stuck with a dry script, and poorly written characters by Graham Yost. Speed started off okay, but they put themselves in a hole, where there was only so much you can do with the scenes they created. Towards the end of the second set, it started to get pretty stale. My biggest flaw, that effected almost every aspect of the film, was that things were set up too conveniently for the leads; Not to say that there wasn't anything on the line, but it seemed like all the stuff that got thrown into the mix, seemed like they always found an easy way around it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a touch overrated, in my opinion. It was decent fun, while benefiting from being rated R, with notable leads, but it just didn't pack a lot of weight and emotion."

","Since the 1980s it has been rare for action films to offer up something more than just testosterone-laden violence. But this was indeed what the 1994 blockbuster SPEED was: a sleeper hit and a breath of fresh air for the genre. While it may have much of the same violence and profanity of most action films, it also has a fair amount of suspense, tension, and black comedy as well. Above all else, it has characters one can identify with, plus an absolutely requirement for any really good action film: a credible and despicable villain. Coming from what had already become a disreputable genre among critics for the most part, SPEED actually got a huge amount of critical acclaim, not to mention a $350 million box office take on a budget of a mere $30 million-and this at a time when the cost of a typical Hollywood studio action film had already crossed the $75 million threshold.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves stars as an elite L.A.P.D. officer who, along with the help of his erstwhile partner (Jeff Daniels), defuses the bomb of a madman (Dennis Hopper) inside an elevator in a high rise in Downtown Los Angeles. Daniels is wounded in a brief standoff with Hopper; and Hopper escapes, having not collected the $3 million he demanded for those being held hostage in the elevator.<br/><br/>Days later, Hopper plans his revenge against Reeves. This time, Hopper has placed a bomb underneath a commuter bus heading from Santa Monica to Downtown L.A. via the Santa Monica Freeway. The catch is that this bomb is armed the moment the bus hits 50 miles per hour, and that the bomb will detonate if the bus slows below 50. Hopper demands $3.7 million and warns Reeves that, if he tries to take any passengers off the bus, he will detonate the bomb regardless. Reeves is forced into quick action, hopping on the bus in the middle of the freeway and scaring the hell out of all the passengers. One of them, a scared Latino with a gun, accidentally shoots the bus driver, briefly causing the bus to go out of control. A female passenger (Sandra Bullock) is forced to take control of the bus, and is told by Reeves to do whatever it takes to keep going over 50. The bus's path takes it off the Santa Monica Freeway at Western Avenue, then south to the unopened Century Freeway (I-105), then to the runways at LAX. There, Reeves manages to outwit Hopper and evacuate the passengers, with a, how shall we say, a rather explosive result. But Hopper isn't quite vanquished even after all that.<br/><br/>While there are admittedly a few of the plot problems normally associated with action movies, SPEED nevertheless delivers much in the way of suspense and camera work, with the influences of films like DUEL, ROLLERCOASTER, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE, and DIE HARD flowing right through it. Reeves and Bullock make for such an appealing and believable pair that one can't help but be involved in their situation. Hopper makes for a credible enough villain, even as it's a role he could have conceivably done in his sleep. The most amazing thing about the film is the sureness of the direction of Jan DeBont, previously a cinematographer on CUJO, DIE HARD, and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. DeBont clearly studied not only the films of Hitchcock, but also of Steven Spielberg, and even Sam Peckinpah, in the way action, suspense, and a certain amount of violence (none of the latter especially gratuitous) are combined to make a thoroughly memorable brew. There is also a winking nod to Stanley Kubrick as well, at the end.<br/><br/>An Oscar winner for Sound and Sound Effects Editing, SPEED displayed a tremendous amount of energy in its execution and performance. But it also became a prime masterpiece of a genre that had very few masterpieces like it since the 1980s, and would have fewer still from 1994 forward.<br/><br/>To this day, SPEED still warrants a '10' spot."
"freemantle_uk","8","0","0","18 May 2020"," The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down
","Speed was one of great '90s action film that stands with The Rock and Con Air for high concept fun. Speed's high concept was a bus has to keep its speed above 50mph or it would explode. The filmmakers used this idea to its fullest as the people on the bus face numerous challenges that could slow them down e.g. traffic, fuel leaks, and unfinished roads. There was a focus on a small cast of memorable characters and witty dialogue - Joss Whedon did uncredited rewrites and it showed. Speed was Jan de Bont's directorial debut and clearly learned from his time on the Die Hard set how to make a taut actioner."

Because he always creates a tense atmosphere in every scene, especially in the final scene.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by Jan de Bont , this movie have a story line that is orderly, and easy to understand, and not messy ... urban settings, highways, airports, and others really spoil our eyes. There is an exciting scene that Jack Traven did in this movie, which will make you worry about his safety.<br/><br/>The audio of this movie is very neat and neat, I use a home teather in my house and is equipped with Sorround 5.1, so when there is a helicopeter scene or whatever, the sound of the vehicle will surround me and I really enjoy it * chuckles *<br/><br/>I was very entertained with this one film<br/><br/>This movie is highly recommended, really !!! The younger generation must watch it !! 90s films are no less cool.

Keanu Reeves was just great as the action hero here...but he didn't come off as the hero that fixes and knows everything. He was human, and played the role of an LAPD cop so well. He carried the character's cop job throughout the film, in an intense situation. As an audience, you begin to connect with ""Jack Traven"", and the fact that Keanu Reeves played him was a great choice.
Sandra Bullock was great, and positive energy to have throughout the film. Her character's energy really came through, and you can see the acting chemistry between her and Reeves.
Absolutely one of my favorite action films!"

","Speed is full of engaging action. The subject matter is novel, and the action is diverse and fresh enough for the movie to stand out in its genre.
The intense moving thrill is undermined by two factors. First is the quite unnatural reaction and emotion from the passenger. Second is the quite inept aura exuded from the police force. This element has to exist as a plot convenience because the plot fails to make the antagonist's plan intricate enough.
An easy no-brain action, but the values to remember."

","I have not revisited Speed since the late 90's probably when I graduated high school at 18. Back then ultra action movies were in. Con-Air, Executive Decision, Die Hard 3, Daylight, to name a few but Speed was one for the film books. It is a cat and mouse chase about a Los Angeles cop named Jack Traven and a former LAPD cop turned una-bomber named Howard Payne. Then, there's Sandra Bullock in her first big screen role in an action film previous to playing a cop of the future in Demolition Man playing Annie. Howard Payne puts a bomb inside a watch on the bottom of a public bus going northbound into Metro L.A. He scares all the local people going on a bus to work. Jack Traven jumps the bus to inform the passengers that the he's going to disabled the bomb.<br/><br/>Speed is ultimate action movie of the 1990s. Just like Bullitt was in the 60's and the French Connection was in the 70's. It's a high speed octane action thriller filled with smart action sequences, high speed thrills, suspenseful novelty movie cliches. The supporting actors Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels are good. The music by Mark Macina and the direction by Jan De Bont is thrilling, white knuckle roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>If Jurassic Park was the movie of the summer of 1993, than Speed was the special effects picture of 1994. It's a great movie and I never want it to end"

","â€‹'SPEED' 1994<br/><br/>Directed by Jan De Bont{Directorial Debut}<br/><br/>Starring Keanu Reeves{Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure; Point Break}, Sandra Bullock{Demolition Man; Love Potion No 9} and Dennis Hopper{Apocalypse Now; Rebel Without a Cause}<br/><br/>Plot Overview: As revenge for foiling his master plan scheme, a demolitions expert/terrorist plants a bomb on a commercial bus which will detonate, if the bus goes below 50 miles per hour! <br/><br/>'Speed' is a movie that is held very dear to many action fan's hearts for many years. I've been dodging watching it for a while but I've finally cracked and gave into my curiosity. And my opinion of the movie? I liked it. It was a fun action movie with an EXCELLENT premise and cool ideas. As a full package, I can definitely recommend it. <br/><br/>So what can I say are the film's main strengths? The overall tone and atmosphere is probably its' greatest strength. Considering the situation, the tone is pretty light-hearted but all the characters take it seriously. I guess that's what I loved about it. The juxtaposition of the tone of dialogue compared to the tone of the characters. It makes the movie undeniably fun to see Keanu Reeves perform with such sincerity and seriousness when in reality, it's just a dumb action flick. That leads onto another praise I can give: the passengers aboard the bus. I loved pretty much every main side character who was on this bus, with the exception of our two leads.<br/><br/>Another major praise I can give the movie Dennis Hopper's villain. Howard Payne is a good movie villain. He's smart, he's pretty funny, he's conniving and he is remorseless. Alone these qualities may seem random, but when combined they make a truly interesting villain. Top that with Dennis Hopper's excellent performance and you have a pretty darn good antagonist.<br/><br/>I also absolutely love the score for this movie. This falls into the category of minor praise but it really deserves to get a full paragraph for it. Mark Mancina's EXCELLENT score for this movie is ridiculously fun and inventive and entertaining. It is arguably one of the better action movie themes of the 90s. It's just such an adernaline fuelled score that fits perfectly with the overall tone of the movie.<br/><br/>But what issues do I have? Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are two on the most dull actors on this planet. Don't get me wrong: Reeves is an EXCELLENT action star and I truly admire his commitment to the role. But I've seen school plays with more realistic and emotional performances. He's awful in pretty much every movie he is in. And then there is Sandra Bullock. To be fair, Bullock isn't an awful actress. But her performance in this movie is so unconvincing and so dry that I thought that Reeves had infected her with his disease. Combine the mediocre acting with a forced and botched love story and very underdeveloped characters, and you have a pair of leads that are an actual chore to sit through.<br/><br/>My other main issue is the final act. It's just so over the top. And I usually wouldn't mind that but I don't think this drastic change in pace suited the overall movie. It was an action movie but it was a more of a slow burn action movie. This final act was just really dumb and didn't fit in tone with the movie. I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie's conclusion; it was such a mess.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like 'Speed' though. It's certainly a fun and entertaining action movie, but the last act and two lead characters make it a chore to sit through, towards the end. Despite this grievances, I do recommend you watch 'Speed'. The action is mostly alright and the tone is pretty much perfect; it's a very enjoyable movie. I'll rate 'Speed' 7 'CANS' out of 10!"

","An crazy guy *eccentric guy* has rigged a elevator full of people to explode in an attempt to pressure the L.A.P.D into giving him money. But officer Jack and his friend Harry spoils his plan.<br/><br/>So to get revenge and get money he puts a bomb on a bus. If the bus goes under 50 mph it explodes if anyone gets off the bus it explodes. So officer Jack gets on the bus to try and prevent it from exploding as they race through L.A at fast speed keeping it from crashing into the busy L.A traffic.<br/><br/>The characters are about as deep as an splinter. Meanwhile a good movie would have side characters as deep as an knife and main characters as deep as a sword, this movies characters are about as shallow as it gets. The acting is terrible at times and just makes me laugh when i'm supposed to feel empathy for the characters. It's cheesy too but what can you expect from a 90's action movie. Even with all these flaws it's very enjoyable and i would really recommend watching it at least once.<br/><br/>Also i noticed that the picture does not have that much contrast and looks very dull. In fact it's so dull that i turned the contrast up in VLC media player to compensate for it. This is something i have never had to do before with any other movie.<br/><br/>The movie never really slows down it's just action scene after action scene, it actually gets ridiculous after a while and if it ever does slow down then 20 seconds later the bus will be jumping over a ramp or maybe crashing into a unsuspecting car. There's not really any story to it, it's just plot.<br/><br/>I feel as if Michael Bay just took all his inspiration from Speed and just cranked it up.<br/><br/>Enough with the negatives i'll tell you what the best part of the movie is. The fact that they are playing 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Grauman's Chinese Theatre.<br/><br/>I'll give the movie a 6,5/10 enjoyable but nothing more than that."

","Forget the fact that 111 drivers and passengers were killed by the bus on the streets and highways of Los Angeles: They did manage to save 16 of the 17 passengers. Forget the fact that most of the time, they are obviously not driving 50 or above. Forget about the fact that the bus would not have made the jump. Forget the fact that we do not know if any people were on board the aircraft that the bus hit at the end. Maybe there were 200: I don't know, because the great kiss scene at the end admittedly grabbed my attention.<br/><br/>Forget about the fact that Dennis Hopper (as Howard Payne) would have checked the bag of money as soon as he had collected it from the trash barrel, and that the marking dye would have exploded there.., not later, on the subway. forget about the fact that no marking dye would have been put in the bag, because the police would have realized that it would have triggered Payne to destroy the bus. <br/><br/>Despite these maybe-forgivable unlikelihoods, this is a good action movie that kept my interest for the entire time, by use of various twists and turns in the plot, and by engendering concern and empathy for the characters. We honestly like the people on the bus, including Sandra Bullock (Annie), Keaneau Reeves (Jack) and Alan Ruck (Stephens). Jeff Daniels plays a very likable SWAT member, and Dennis Hopper plays the fully-functional madman so well, that alone is scary.<br/><br/>The difficulty of the direction, stunts, and production of this movie must have been one incredible challenge after another. The elevator scene at the beginning of the movie is very exciting and well-done, and sets the tone for the movie.<br/><br/>Inherent in Speed is the metaphor that society is ""running on the red line"" at all times, with an inability to slow itself down, and a fear that if it does, it will self-destruct. It will take a combination of us all pulling together at maximum effort, and a miracle, for us to finally get off the ""hamster wheel"" before the overlords realize what has happened. <br/><br/>In kind of a cheesy way, this movie is a testament to how much good, or bad, one person can do. <br/><br/>I hope the City of Los Angeles promptly compensated everyone for their damage and losses."

","Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today.<br/><br/>This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go.<br/><br/>Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard ""anything but a"" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper.<br/><br/>They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two.<br/><br/>Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator – too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie – is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to ""catch the bus.""<br/><br/>There are rules, of course – this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do.<br/><br/>Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through – even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us.<br/><br/>I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus."

","Of the fine crop of 1990s action thrillers, ""Speed"" is probably the most widely mocked. It is undeniably the silliest and most implausible basic premise - a madman obsessed with revenge against a bomb squad cop has planted a bomb a city bus that will explode if the bus drops below 50 miles per hour.<br/><br/>However, it's really not that more unlikely than the cloned dinosaurs and time-traveling robots or earth-conquering aliens that populated other great blockbusters of the decade. It's just a little bit sillier. The movie seems to revel in its silliness, though, asking us to believe that a bus could make a 50 foot jump across a freeway, among other things.<br/><br/>""Speed"", perhaps more than any of the 90s blockbusters, seems gleeful in its realization that a silly premise and a complete lack of realism are no particular impediments to a crowd-pleasing film. With good pacing, spectacular stunts and like-able leads, the movie will succeed, and Speed is proof of that.<br/><br/>""Speed"" isn't the best of the 1990s thrillers but it's still pretty good, much better than the massive amount of mockery its plot received would suggest."

","Speed 1994 Movie Review<br/><br/>The introductory score of Mark Mancini opens up the film to entice the viewer into a roller-coaster ride that will not let go from the very beginning. The villain here is not your typical terrorist who is out for revenge but simply a cop who does not accept retirement life and simply wants his due, in this case pure simple money. The hero is the cop who will stop at nothing to save innocent civilians because it is the right thing, regardless of what his superiors tell him to do or not do. This film is the template for such classics as the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Mancini's score clearly being an inspiration for Harry Gregson Williams's MGS Saga Theme. 24 also took the rogue agent that plays against the rules to justify the means from Speed in the similarities of Jack Traver to Jack Bauer. Sandra Bullock playing Annie is also very fun to watch as a quirky but lovable character, also very beautiful and it reminds me why I like Sandra Bullock. The explosions, especially the one on the bus that is built up in the first quarter of the film, once it pays off it is one of the most spectacular explosions in film that I have seen in quite a while and it is comparable to the hospital explosion in The Dark Knight! (In terms of quality, not size). To close, this movie is one of the best action movies of all time and is a definitive purchase!"

","In Speed, everything comes together. The concept is simple - revenge-bent nutcase rigs a bus so that it will blow up if the Speed drops below 50mph. A gung-ho cop and ditzy everywoman are tasked with keeping the bus going, and its passengers alive, until the traps and precautions placed by the nutjob can be circumvented. In its own way it's a bit like a Road Runner cartoon in the way that many variations on the theme are introduced, played out, and then moved on from.<br/><br/>This was Sandra Bullock's second breakout film (after Demolition Man), and she and Keanu Reeves handle the tension and action very well. Credit also to Dennis Hopper for another in his collection of nutjobs.

","Speed is frankly one of the best action-thrillers to be released in the 1990s. Everything one expects of the genre is there for viewers to savor. From start to end, it fully embodies the word 'speed'. Director Jan de Bont keeps the film tightly structured through the use of crisp editing, and the inventive screenplay by Graham Yost allows tension to literally accelerate to top speed. The film builds up the suspense right from the office elevator sequence, and then it sucks viewers in like a whirlwind as the situation unfolds nail-bitingly on a speeding bus with a bomb.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock show brilliant chemistry, and are well-cast for their respective roles. In fact, we as viewers, like them so much to the extent that we still fear for their lives on the umpteen viewing. Another reason Speed still stands the test of time is because the adrenaline induced is genuine, unlike the majority of action motion pictures that we get these days. Dennis Hopper is convincing as the terrorist, we hate him as much as we love the protagonists.<br/><br/>De Bont shows mastery of the action-thriller genre with Speed (his first feature film). It's an exemplary example of focused film-making combined with an exhilarating storyline. Speed is a highly impressive motion picture that will always get on your nerves. These sort of films appear rarely (sometimes once in a few years). But when it does, it beats riding on a roller coaster.<br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","Play the drinking game to this movie, for every time you hear the words, ""Hang on!"" You'll end up drunker than Lindsey Lohan.<br/><br/>SPEED - an action movie that delivers a thrill a minute, almost as often as you have to take a drink - arguably put Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves and director Jan de Bont on the blockbuster map.<br/><br/>Though this movie is best known for its extended bus sequence, it is composed of three vignettes - elevator (vertical speed), bus (variable speed) and train (accelerative speed).<br/><br/>Segment One: People trapped in elevator - two elevator repair men arrive in a gratuitous flying police car. They are Jack (Keanu) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). One of them is the Brain, one of them the Overactor. I'll let you decide which. Elevator blown up by mad bomber, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper, doing his Dennis Hopper). Take breath. Onto next segment.<br/><br/>Apparently, driving a bus is so easy a caveman can do it, as a Downtown Los Angeles bus is piloted by Nearderthal-browed Sam (Hawthorne James), transporting a bunch of extras for a Bennetton ad. Bus boarded by gregarious Annie (Sandra Bullock, back when she was just a cute little comer with great legs, not the big-headed icon she would become).<br/><br/>Writer Graham Yost seems to have gotten every ethnicity and job description on that bus, The Construction Worker, The Tourist, The Old Lady, The Asian, The Paka Lady, The Policeman, The Token Blacks, The White Preppy, The 1930s Lady, but I think he forgot the Indian Chief.<br/><br/>Mad Bomber gives ultimatum to Jack: ""There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus reaches 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do?"" Well, considering it's 9:00 a.m. in Los Angeles peak hour traffic, on the 10 freeway near Santa Monica, I'd start placing bets that the bus couldn't possibly get up to 50 miles an hour in the first place. Then I'd have breakfast.<br/><br/>Instead, Keanu clambers onboard the moving bus to try to smoosh up against Sandy's legs as much as possible. Luckily, one of the stereotypes has brought a gun - to shoot the caveman bus driver - precipitating Sandy's Legs having to take the wheel and drive herself into the hearts of America.<br/><br/>Joe Morton is the bomb squad chief whose stage directions from de Bont were, ""Okay, see these lines of script? Now shout them into a walkie-talkie."" Jack assesses the bomb with technical jargon: ""There's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world!"" Is that a lot? We could complain about the unreality of taking hard right turns at 50 mph, or the physics impossibility of a laden bus jumping a freeway chasm without an approach ramp, or the fact that Keanu couldn't possibly consider his performance ""acting"" - but everyone's just having way too much fun.<br/><br/>By the time we are onto Segment Three - the runaway train - our adrenalin is kinda tapped out and it seems superfluous. But Keanu gets to smoosh up against Sandy again, with an added bonus - she's handcuffed to a vertical bar in the carriage.<br/><br/>By the time the 752nd ""Hang on!"" comes, we're ready for rehab."
"loccomotive2000","9","0","0","16 May 2010"," The Timeless Adrenaline Filled Action Classic
","The nineties was a great time for action blockbusters, where instead of relying heavily on CGI, the action sequences in those movies were actually filmed as they were, and rather than spending so much time for in depth story and character development, they choose to engage us in a more direct, emotional manner. ""Speed"" is quite easily the greatest example.<br/><br/>In the film, LAPD Bomb Squad cop Jack Traven must race against time to rescue passengers onboard a bus with a bomb that'll go off if it goes below 50mph. Keanu Reeves reinvents the action hero by, instead of being the big tough guy with a ton of one-liners, he is earnest, emotional and perhaps most importantly, vulnerable. At his side is the wonderful Sandra Bullock as Jack's lovable sidekick/love interest Annie, whose bubbly and sarcastic personality beautifully compliments with Jack's gungho, intense character. And on the other side is Dennis Hopper as the disgruntled bad guy who is as crazy as he is intelligent, setting up the foil for the centerpiece with taunts and impossible tests for our hero.<br/><br/>The real draw here, however, remains the now iconic high octane action sequences. In a simple yet brilliant fashion, three major crisises make up the three acts. And be it the elevator, the bus or the subway, once the action starts, prepare to hold on to dear life until it ends. Because not only does it never stop, it barely slows down. And it's not just the vehicles that go for a ride; out heroes too endure a roller coaster ride of emotions. Hopelessness, anxiety, fear and exhilaration; we uncontrollably become inclined to feel not just for them, but with them.<br/><br/>And I reserve this paragraph for praising the very underrated score by Mark Mancina. The memorable main theme sets you in the mood for pulsating action, while the heroic theme not only works brilliantly on the romance between Jack and Annie, it does wonders to amplify the heroic and noble nature of saving lives.<br/><br/>Even today, at 16 years later, and having seen the movie multiple times, Speed still gives me the emotions I had when seeing it for the first time, putting me at the edge of my seat. With it's ability to engage a viewer so strongly, Speed was destined to become a timeless classic. And it is."

The studio, 20th Century Fox, gave the green light shortly there after for the Speed sequel to be the second in an ongoing serial of the Speed franchise and the producers had to find a new leading man. Due in part to the failure on a previous sequel to a Keanu Reeves film, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the stories hero would not be returning and would need a new hero to save the franchises story teller played by Sandra Bullock.

The better one is between the opening & the main part as the awards ceremony for Jack & Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) gives this chop more coherence.<br/><br/>If there were a way to do this kind of action in live theater, this film is structured like a 3 act play.

","'Speed' is a highly entertaining thriller made with loads of energy and style. It has a great cast, taut direction, and enjoyably outrageous stunts.<br/><br/>LA cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a busy guy. Not long after foiling a hostage situation involving former Atlanta cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) and an elevator full of victims, Jack is pulled into Payne's new scheme, the now-famous 'bomb-on-a-bus' situation. After the driver is accidentally shot by one of the passengers, a woman named Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes over and must work with Jack to figure a way out.<br/><br/>I have never thought Keanu Reeves is a bad actor; he's just a limited one. The problem with Reeves is that he is frequently miscast in romances when he's more at home in action flicks like this or 'The Matrix' or comedies like 'Bill and Ted'. Reeves is terrific here, focused and tough, although his delivery does occasionally mangle some good lines. I liked Reeves' and Bullock's chemistry, although the screenplay's attempts to make them fall in love are VERY forced. Hopper plays another one of his patented psychos spectacularly, while Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton play Jack's fellow cops. I also liked Alan Ruck (Cameron from 'Ferris Buller') as a nervous bus passenger who gets a great moment early on.<br/><br/>The direction by Jan de Bont is relentless, only briefly stopping to let the audience catch their breath. The script is good too; as soon as one problem is solved, another surfaces, and you can't help but grin when Jack actually lowers himself under the bus to try and defuse the bomb.<br/><br/>'Speed' may not be a classic, but it's still loads of fun."

","Speed is a film that owes a debt to the classic disaster tales of the 1970s. People who found themselves at the mercy of situations beyond their control. The central conceit to Speed is quite simple. A mad bomber (hammily played by Dennis Hopper) rigs a bus to explode if it should drop below 50mph. It's quite an easy concept to digest which is what makes the film so easy to enjoy.<br/><br/>LAPD cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) has the unenviable task of saving the passengers on their runaway bus. And it's an uphill struggle to say the least. Caught in the rush hour, the bus has to dodge cars, traffic jams, freeway gaps and petrol leaks all while it's in continual motion.<br/><br/>Speed may be a bit thin on the ground plot-wise. At it's most basic level, it's just a series of escalating obstacles and pile-ups just to keep the film going. But it is genuinely exhilarating, and the pace never flags.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is typically wooden but he's in his element. Speed was the film that catapulted Sandra Bullock to stardom. Something she deserved, because she runs rings around everyone else. Bullock makes her character, Annie into an admirably feisty heroine, who has to drive the bus around LA's highways, while at the same time shooting off wisecracks every two minutes. The low-key attraction between Jack and Annie is effective without ever dragging the film down.<br/><br/>Bullock almost singlehanded keeps the film afloat during Speed's more fragile moments. Some of the obstacles the bus encounters are very contrived, like the gap in the road. When the bus has to clear it, it's an exhilarating piece of stunt work, but there's no way it could ever happen in real life. Sometimes in films like this, you have to turn a blind eye to logic.<br/><br/>Speed is remarkably assured throughout most of the running time, considering the scant material to work with. But a tight script makes the film more fun then it has a right to be. There are still some glaring plot holes though. Like why Jack never noticed the camera on the bus earlier.<br/><br/>But then, once the bus blows up, the film dies on it's feet. Switching the action to a subway train, the film steps very wrong, and becomes laughable to the point of stupidity. And it even contrives another obstacle in the same vein as the freeway gap. The track isn't finished. Give me a break! Watch Collateral and see how the ending could (and should) have been.<br/><br/>Shame that Speed goes right off the tracks at the end, because it ruins what was a very suspenseful, exciting adventure. Oh well, fun while it lasted, and at least it's better than the dreadful Speed 2. Not even Sandra Bullock could save that one!"

The bomb will be armed when the bus goes over 50 MPH and it will blow up if the bus's speed drops below 50.<br/><br/>The only hope for the unfortunate passengers is devil-may-care police officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), who previously wrecked a plan from the same terrorist.<br/><br/>To make such a ride and to throw away cheap introductions and conclusions, ""Speed"" has been scripted in order to put minor rides between the principal one. While the bus is the hamburger's meat, the two bread slices are an hijacked elevator and a runaway metro train. And the three parts of the story work well in their own way.<br/><br/>Jan de Bont gets his first directorial effort here, after working as a cinematographer for movies like ""Die Hard"". Cinematography is one of the key elements of ""Speed"" and especially aboard the bus. The numerous camera angles and positions make the vehicle a pleasure to watch and almost becomes an entity.<br/><br/>Also outstanding are the performances of the three main actors. Keanu Reeves is at his coolest as he plays Jack. Sandra Bullock, in her breakthrough role, is the most three-dimensional person of the lot and she is really fine as the bus' 'substitute driver'. However, Dennis Hopper is the finest character of all. His role as the former cop who wants money for ""revenge"" is menacing and maniacal. So, Hopper's performance is the best of his career, after Frank Booth in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"".<br/><br/>""Speed"" is dubbed as an action thriller, but it's more of a thriller than an action film. Or, if it's action, it could nearly be called 'unconventional'. Because there are no gunfights, a very short battle sequence (which ends very creepily) and while the vehicles run to full speed, there are absolutely no chases.<br/><br/>What could be called action in this movie are Jack's attempts to enter inside the bus and his battle with Hopper on the top of the subway train.<br/><br/>The movie mostly succeeds on its 'thriller' segments. We could count among them: the initial elevator rescue, Jack's attempts to stop the bus before it goes over 50 MPH (even if we know that he failed) and the numerous elements that happen during the bus trip, which include a rescue attempt, a big jump and a failed attempt to dismantle the bomb.<br/><br/>It's perhaps the only modern movie where an odometer is the key element of the story...<br/><br/>You wouldn't want to miss a single second from this astonishing tour de force by Jan de Bont, from the imaginative elevator title sequence to the final notes of Billy Idol's ""Speed"" (the title song) at the end of the credits."

","Speed is one of the 68 greatest movies of the decade of the 90s.

In the last second, Jack and Harry manage to get the captives to safety. In a typical movie, a moment's relaxation would follow.

","I enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now. In the meantime, 12 years have passed by, leaving the mark on the movie business, on the world, on the actors, and on us. The movie business evolved in somehow a different place, the world is, sadly, a much unsafer place, two of the leading actors got together to make a new movie, and share the same on-screen chemistry, and we are here, older and hopefully wiser, to enjoy all of their movies...<br/><br/>""Speed"" can be now considered a classic, but its value is not only in being the ""standard"" action-movie. It has a humor of his own. the short lines, or one-lines. the typical situations for the early '90s. the genuine white American girl of the west coast. the not-so-bright cop ( who, by the way, turns out to be rather underrated by his colleagues, as it's he who has the ""hunches"" ""gut-feelings"" and unconventional ideas, not his partner or chief ), the ex-cop gone mad... ans speaking of which, am I the only one who thinks Dennis Hopper's acting was a little (more) cartoonish ? and that Jack is not the standard hero character ( as opposed to Die Hard or various movies of the kind )? K. Reeves' acting might be considered mediocre by some, but in my opinion he was right for this movie. one of his major qualities is that he's never overacting. there's something calm and detached about this actor, that surfaces in any of his roles... And the best part of this movie is that it's never taking itself completely seriously. It has various layers of humor, and most of it it's actually self-mockery, somehow... yes, the action-pace is fast, the explosions are great, most part of the dialogue is rather witty, but you kind of expect Keanu to turn around and wink at you, like ""it's only a movie"". It's an easy, entertaining movie. there's a certain ""naivete"" about it. which makes one - me, at least - watch it over and over again. oh, and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful..."

","If viewing this film for the first time, you should get a powerful visceral experience which is all too rare today. In fact, I'd venture to say that this is one of the last movies to offer full-fledged excitement before current computer FX overwhelmed Hollywood so that all action films now have a veil of superficiality covering everything (yes, ""Speed"" also had computer FX, but they were surreptitious back then). I'd say, around the mid-nineties, after ""Seven"" or so, all the action films became closer to computer games rather than actual action-adventure FILMS. ""Speed"" was, in many ways, a last gasp of film action in the pure sense - you feel that pulse of the old-style slam-bang dazzle right from the opening credits, moving down an elevator shaft which could be a computer simulation, but immediately it gives way to classic jeopardy involving flesh-and-blood villains (Hopper), sweaty victims-in-peril, and sweatier tough cops-as-heroes (Reeves, Daniels) coping with horrendous dilemmas. OK, some of the modern bland action thrills already pervaded this thriller, but it's still much too real compared to all the silly moving pictures pervading our theaters in the 21st century.<br/><br/>This is also that rare film which really never has a slow moment. Some might label that aspect as unrealistic, but this is what it was meant to be - it's de Bont's finest hour; he was a director of photography before this and produced only adequate pictures after this. Somehow, he captured a perfect formula for this, his inaugural stewardship. It's great for a first viewing, but I was caught up in watching this several times in the nineties, to try and duplicate those visceral shocks a 2nd & 3rd time. I also found it was one of those movies I could watch with a couple of other people in the room and get caught up in the excitement as a group experience - there was never time to speak of other matters during some slow spots, as in during most other films. We, meaning the audience, are on that bus with the passengers after the first half-hour and for the next hour of a super-ride that everyone needs to experience at least once in their lifetime. And you'll probably want to give it a try at least one more time afterward.<br/><br/>Reeves' performance as the hero is an aberration for his film career. All the reasons to be mystified by his success in movies or his penchant for slow-witted, laughable characters are missing. He'd had a chance to play a straight action hero before, in ""Point Break,"" but he was an older boy there; here he's a young man, a coiled spring built in the mold of serious action heroism. When he threatens the deranged villain, there's no chance to mock his style, to be amused at his efforts at intensity - he's a lethal, dangerous figure here. I almost believe now that some substitute for Reeves was placed in most of his scenes here, since he never returned to such effective presence. Then, of course, we have Bullock. This was where her impish quality, with some moxie thrown in, got its greatest workout - no surprise at all that she became a big star after this. To say that she manages the perfect note in all her scenes is...well, let's just leave it at that. Plummer in a brief role as the jaguar driver - priceless! (He returned in the weak sequel, against all odds). Hopper and Daniels, as well as Morton, lend great support, as do all the supporting players on the bus (Ruck and the big guy playing Ortiz stand out). And speaking of the bus... I state now and for the record, no movie has ever utilized a bus to better effect - ever!"

","Okay maybe every action film shouldn't follow the same plot but the spacing between action, yes. With a great cast Speed promises much and delivers a lot more. <br/><br/>After an intense starting with the rescue of hostages from an elevator set to explode by terrorist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), Officer Jack Travern (Keaunu Reeves) and his partner Det. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are out to stop the same terrorist who has now planted several bombs aboard a city bus. Jack is able to board the bus with some difficulty and must take command of the situation immediately while Harry relays information to him from the office. <br/><br/>As Jack tries to find a way to get the people of the bus, he is confronted with another problem. If the bus goes under 50 mph, the bus will explode. Taking the drivers seat after the bus driver is accidentally shot is Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) in the role that started her career. Now, along with Harry and the bus occupants, Jack must figure out a way to outsmart the terrorist and save the people aboard int his deadly cat-and-mouse game.<br/><br/>Reeves is perfect for the role of Jack. He is smart, strong, and ever clever in his attempts to save people. Daniels creates the smart and ever reliable relief with a few words of caution and advice here and there. Even with Reeves and Daniels, Hoopers takes the cake as the best character, both in acting and in character. He's cunning, he's ingenious, and he is always ready with a smart remark. <br/><br/>Unlike the Stephen Seagal films with every minute being filled with punches, shotgun blasts, and hand to hand combat, Speed is able to filter the action to when it is needed. The film is an action film but plays a lot on that of a thriller with buses speed always getting just close enough not to blow. The film works well and is one of the best action films out. With Reeves, Daniels, Hopper, and Bullock how could you go wrong?<br/><br/>Speed. Starring: Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and Sandra Bullock. <br/><br/>4 out of 5 Stars."

","I liked this movie for the most part, fast, good music, and I like Keanu Reeves, Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper. It has a pretty good plot and the action is excellent. My only complaint is that there is way to much Sandra Bullock in the movie and not enough Jeff Daniels. Hopper and Reeves are in it perfectly. This is only an issue for me though cause if you like Bullock you will not mind her as much, as for me I do not care for her and I definitely was not going to see Speed 2 with her being the lead character. Here we have a guy trying to secure some funds by holding an elevator full of people hostage. His plans are foiled by to plucky members of the police force and he is seemingly killed. However, this turns out not to be the case as our mad bomber is still at large and he rigs a bus to explode if the bus goes under 55 mph hence the title of the movie. Granted, it is a stupid way to try and hold people ransom because if Reeves' character does not get to the bus on time it would have simply exploded, but hey it is just a movie. Lots of action ensues and a bit to much whiny Bullock for my tastes, but I roll with it. Great finishing fight on top of a train, however the scene with the runaway train seems just to much at this point and really is not necessary, we have already by this time put the characters through to much."

Episodic in structure, the movie pits Hopper's vengeful psychopath against SWAT member Keanu Reeves (whose career went into overdrive from this point onward), and barely pauses for breath along the way. Debut director (and erstwhile cinematographer) Jan de Bont transforms Graham Yost's modest screenplay into a super-charged thrill-machine, photographed (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) and edited (by John Wright) to perfection, and augmented by some of the best stuntwork and visual effects money can buy. The cast is a ragbag of new faces, old-timers and dependable character actors: Reeves and Hopper dominate the show, while leading lady Sandra Bullock 'makes cute' in a career-making performance, and there's strong support from Jeff Daniels (DUMB & DUMBER) and Joe Morton (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) in crucial secondary roles. Followed by SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL (1997).<br/><br/>NB. A 'sleeper' hit by Hollywood blockbuster standards, the film owes a narrative debt to Junya Sato's Japanese thriller THE BULLET TRAIN (1975), in which a terrorist bomb is primed to explode on board a packed commuter train if it falls below a certain speed. It's possible SPEED was written and produced in complete ignorance of the earlier film, but no one connected with de Bont's version seems willing to address the similarities."

Most of them always look exactly the same, only on a different location. You get a lot of shooting and explosions, some Karate or Kung-Fu moves..., we all know the recipe. However, sometimes you'll find a more original one and ""Speed"" certainly is one of them.<br/><br/>Howard Payne tries to extort money from the city of LA by threatening to kill some people, who are being trapped in an elevator, with explosives. When Jack Traven and Harry Temple save all those people, they are being celebrated as heroes. But Payne will not rest until he gets his money and he sets a new challenge for Traven: a bomb on a city bus which will arm itself when the bus reaches 50 mph and which will explode if the bus drops below that speed or if any of the passengers try to escape. Traven tries to stop the buss in time, but it is already too late, now all he can do is to keep it going...<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is more than average. I liked Sandra Bullock as the passenger / bus driver and thought that Dennis Hopper did a very good job playing the bad guy. I even enjoyed Keanu Reeves' performance. But as I already said in my title, as long as that bus was driving I was sitting on the edge of my seat. The only problem is that there was a part before and after that sequence and those parts didn't really do it for me.

"Old Joe","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," On this bus ride, sit down, shut up and get ready for rush hour!'
","I know many action movie fans would say that Speed' is one of the best action films around, and I am not going to argue that its not. However, I feel that this movie is so much more. It has an intriguing and thrilling story, great stunts and special effects, characters which are genuinely concerned for each other and a first time-director who gets everything just right'. After watching Speed,' its audience can also be assured of two things. One, is making sure that their next bus ride is not booby-trapped, and two, that they are in for the movie ride of their lives'.<br/><br/>Jack Traven and Harry Temple are a part of the L.A.P.D. SWAT team who help to rescue a group of executives trapped in a sabotaged elevator. The saboteur is not pleased with what Jack and his cop associates have done. So in retaliation, he sends Jack on a wild goose chase, to help diffuse a bomb which he has planted on a down-town L.A. bus. But until he does, Jack and passenger Annie Porter must keep the bus speeding through the streets of Los Angeles at more than 50 miles per hour or the bomb will explode.<br/><br/>I know that this is hard to believe, but Keanu Reeves is really really good in this movie. As Jack, Reeves gives a performance, whereby you feel for him in almost every aspect of his character's plight, whether it is because of his job, his friends or the many people that he is trying to save on the runaway bus. The onscreen chemistry that he shares with co-star Sandra Bullock is another impressive side to Speed'. Annie (Bullock) is a passenger who is forced to drive the bus, after the driver is accidentally shot by another passenger. Bullock is so entertaining in her role, that I feel she steals the limelight from Reeves in the many shots the pair share on the bus. I also believe it would be more difficult for anyone to drive a bus like Annie has to, but that is all part of the fun.<br/><br/>
The menacing character of Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is another delight of this movie. Hopper plays a mean and nasty bad guy, hell-bent on getting what he wants. In speed, he is a former cop with a grudge and will go to any lengths to get what he feel he deserves. The cat and mouse game that Hopper's character has is of great satisfaction for me. I also like how Payne says to Jack, `nothing tricky now. You know I'm on top of you! DO NOT attempt to grow a brain!' He is always holding the right cards. Hopper is hard to top as bad guy in any Hollywood picture.<br/><br/>However Speed' is great for other reasons besides the great cast. This film was the first-time directing experience for cinematographer, Jan De Bont. From where I see it Jan got it right on the money. Speed has great action, stunts and a feel that you would believe a director would have needed many years of experience to get right. Yet Jan got Speed' at the right pace for the entire film. At no stage were the viewers of this film given a chance to settle down, as we are always presented with situations that were not only dangerous, but seemingly out of control. This is due mainly to the good work of De Bont. He has worked as a cinematographer on movies such as Total Recall', Die Hard' and Basic Instinct', showing us how good those skills really are. <br/><br/>I like Graham Yost's screenplay for Speed'.  He added many elements, which help keep the viewer's attention all the way through. The main story is on the bus and the many difficulties that it has to go through. I also enjoyed the start and ending to the film as this keeps the pace of the story even, and very much in the balance as to whether the good guys or bad guys will win. Then you have the many action scenes that are incorporated into Speed' by stunt coordinator, Gary Hymes. All of the bus scenes are well executed, with the jump scene exceptional. I also like the subway chase and the elevator drop, as they all look and felt believable. <br/><br/>Having a movie with a name such as Speed', it would be fair to assume that it will have a fast pace and action stunts that will blow you away', which indeed it does. Yet with big names such as Hopper, Reeves and Bullock, Speed' was never going to fail. However, I feel most of the credit for its success must sit with Jan De Bont, whose choice as director was a big gamble that paid off. Finally, I want to mention what a big flop that Speed 2: Cruise Control' was. If there was ever a sequel that should never have been made, it has to be Speed 2. So if you are looking for an exhilarating cinematic joyride, then you can not go past watching Speed'.<br/><br/>CMRS gives Speed': 5 (Brilliant Film)"

","The action in this movie was indeed very intense. The general plot that if the bus goes below 50 mph it will blow up was not only original but gave the story lots of room for plot turns. However Sandra Bullock ruined the action scenes whenever she was anywhere near them....one second we see the most amazing action and then the next second we hear her whining and making some other cheesy comment. The last few minutes where she was ""trapped"" in the speeding train were terribly acted....she did a terrible job of saying ""jump, jump while you can""...no wonder why he didn't jump. Keanu Reeves however acted very well...and his ""partner"" in the movie (who is killed) did some pretty good acting (especially in his last scene...the look on his face was very well done).<br/><br/>A few things about the movie didn't make sense: (1) How come the ""access"" panels for the elevator happen to be on every floor, right in front of the door....shouldn't that be where the real door is not ""access"" panels. (2) I didn't know there were access panels on the bottom of every bus (3) If Jack (Keanu Reeves) can speed up the train, why couldn't he have simply deaccelerated it?<br/><br/>Overall a good action movie...Sandra Bullock wasn't very good at acting but Keanu Reeves was.

","This is one hell of an exciting movie.  It starts off with a scene that sets up the suspense level of the movie, with the elevator accident.  It is an incredible sequence, staged so magnificently (my kudos to the editing team.  They did an brilliant job throughout the entire film).  It was a hard act to follow, but director Jan de Bont does it admirably.<br/><br/>  The basic plot: a really bad guy (it's Dennis Hopper, everyone's favourite in a performance that's of no stretch) has a score to settle after his simple demands of 3 million dollars aren't met (in the elevator fiasco).  So he puts a bomb on the bus, and wires it to go off if the bus goes below 50 miles.  Some people thought that 50 miles wasn't that fast, but there's absolutely no point in getting hung up on that.  The bus sequence is an intense piece of filmmaking by all involved.  The tautness of the situation is continually raised, and Jan De Bont and writer Graham Yost manage to crank up the suspense factor.  Yes, the bus jumping the fifty foot overpass is ludicrous, but it is gloriously so.<br/><br/>  Keanu Reeves actually gives a good performance.  He is attacked for trying to expand is repetoire (Much Ado About Nothing, Dracula), so Speed is a refreshingly simple film for him.  He is a great action hero (which was again proven with The Matrix).  Sandra Bullock has great charisma, and she and Reeves have palatable chemistry.<br/><br/>  An action film that cranks up the suspense factor like no other.  Sure, its incongruous sometimes, but why carp?"

","Alrighty! Forget for a moment that practically every action movie made is going to have plot holes, paper-thin character development, corny points, and somewhat dry acting. Think back to the Lethal Weapon series, Die Hard, and other legendary flicks. You're not going to hear Shakesphearean dialogue or majestic cinematography as you did in The English Patient or Schindler's List. The drama genre is supposed to exhibit those aspects of filmmaking, not action.<br/><br/>     Speed is the definitive action flick. The plot itself is innovative, just like the claustrophobic Die Hard and The Towering Inferno. Hostages On A Speeding Bus is a far from common idea. Jan De Bont carries out every facet of the movie with a deft touch. Although none of this is supposed to be believeable (numerous technical goofs, ridiculous premise for Howard Payne to hijack the bus notwithstanding), but as long as you can watch Speed for what it is worth, you will realize that it embodies everything a great action movie should.<br/><br/>    I saw Speed for the first time the summer of 1994 and many dozens of times since. Keanu plays his role well, if a bit stiffly, but it works for the film. Dennis Hopper is the quintessential Bad Guy, the bad guy of all bad guys. And Sandra Bullock is the ultimate robo-babe. She was perfect for this breakthrough role.<br/><br/>    There are a couple of things that I would have liked to have seen in more detail. Annie mentioned her enrollment in the University of Arizona, but it used only as a means for Howard Payne to call her a ""wildcat"". His elevator job scheme at the beginning seemed a bit hokey. The runaway train situation appeared hastily devised, and could have been done without.<br/><br/>    Jan De Bont made a winner out of Speed."

","This movie was awesome! It has a very suspenseful plot, good characters, and excellent special effects. To sum up, Annie (Sandra) is your average working gal, who happens to take the bus on the most inopportune day-the day a bomb is planted on it. This bomb was planted by a terrorist who was attempting to get back at an LAPD cop named Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) because Jack had screwed up his scheme to blow up about 8 people trapped on an elevator. The terrorist tells Jack which bus has the bomb and he gets aboard the bus, when a Hispanic guy freaks out and shoots the driver in the shoulder, causing Annie to become the driver. This is how Jack and Annie meet. They travel all over L.A., as the bus has to stay over 50 mph or it will explode. Jack pulls some pretty daring stunts in an attempt to save the passengers of the bus. Again, this movie has a terrific plot and I honestly think that you would really enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Awesome action movie with a little bit of everything, not to mention two of my favorite people--Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves.

In some action movies, they try to show off a sexy lead by a sex scene like in True Lies or The Specialist. That draws your mind away from the action. I don't like that.

","The things about ""Speed"" that are most interesting to me are its theme of urban motion and the extraordinary way that the film's mise-en-scene reinforces that theme.  All of the conveyances that modern city dwellers use to propel themselves through their environment are presented here (elevators, buses, cars, subway trains) and all are constantly moving faster and faster.  Indeed, the essence of city life is captured in the single word that makes up the film's title.<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>     Actually, ""Speed"" is sort of a visual orgy of transportation in general:  in one sequence alone, we see the procession of the doomed bus and its entourage of police motorcycles and cars hurtling down the interstate, while helicopters fly overhead.  The bus runs loops around planes at the airport and careens crazily through crowded downtown intersections.<br/><br/>     It is all too appropriate that the film takes place in Los Angeles, which, with its traffic-choked freeways and metropolitan sprawl, is an urban planner's ultimate nightmare (to be fair, the same problems exist in most American cities; but since Los Angeles is the most American of American cities, the situation there is exacerbated).

","""I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to SPEED around the city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, the bus would explode! I think it was called THE BUS THAT COULDN'T SLOW DOWN."" - Homer Simpson<br/><br/>Classic 1990s thrill-ride about LAPD officer Reeves intentionally boarding a bus that is armed with a bomb that will take effect if its SPEED exceeds 50 MPH and will detonate if its SPEED drops below 50 MPH or if any passengers get cute and try to disembark the bus. Dennis Hopper is excellent (as always) as the bitter nine-fingered bad guy who is bent on getting compensation for his service as an officer that left him jobless and thumbless, and only rewarded with ""a cheap gold watch"". Sandra Bullock delivers the perfect amount of wittiness before it crosses the overkill line; and Morton (who also shows up uncredited in the sequel) and Daniels are great in their supporting roles. Surprisingly intense despite the straightforward mindless action and lack of any kind of twists. Perhaps making the SPEED something like 35 MPH instead of 50 would've allowed just the right touch of realism to make this one a true gem, but more is apparently merrier to some. An all-in-all fun film that never slows down (it can't!) and is easy to follow—though no one will seek it out for its depth; even the supporting cast recognizes that Reeves' character lacks any sort of wisdom, with the villain even threatening: ""Do not attempt to grow a brain"". Followed by a sequel with Bullock as the hero oh geez<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

","A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Young brash cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his steady partner Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. The driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) has to take over. <br/><br/>The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog from Joss Whedon. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller."

","A great, thriller movie for 13+ older. Contains tons of suspense and thrills. What else can I say about this awesome movie? Oh yeah. It made me have a faster heart beat than usual. I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion. I give this movie a 10/10 for its thrills and suspense."
"primona","8","1","2","10 February 2013"," Speed...still an adrenaline rush after all these years
","I just saw this gem of a movie again after seeing it several years ago. A few things struck me seeing this film again: <br/><br/>First, this movie still delivers suspense after all these years. The aptly titled ""Speed"" is as much about keeping you on an adrenaline rush as it is about passengers on a bomb rigged bus that will explode if the bus goes below 50 mph. The film begins with psychopath Dennis Hopper (Howard Payne) rigging an elevator full of passengers in an attempt to extort millions of dollars from the city. His plans go awry after meeting Jack Traven (Keeanu Reeves). This incident sparks a spectacular revenge plot that involves each man trying to outwit the other.<br/><br/>Second, there are very few movies that create the chemistry between characters that this movie does. I'm not just talking about the obvious sizzle between Annie (Sandra Bullock) and Jack which manages to be created without any nudity or steamy sex scenes – go figure. You also have strong chemistry with the friendship between Jack and his detective partner Harry (played by Jeff Daniels) and even the respect and concern shown between Jack and his boss, the under-rated Joe Morton as Capt Mcmahon.<br/><br/>Third, the writing and acting is formidable. This movie has equal parts action/drama and witty humor. You'll want to reference many witty lines after watching this film from Annie's confession that her license has been revoked for speeding to the back and forth dialogue between the exasperated bus passengers (Gargantuan, I'm thinking of you!). I think most of us agree that Keeanu is never going to be on a list for greatest actors but he is credible as the bad ass cop with good looks and great biceps! Sandra plays a spunky Annie quite well. Dennis is perfectly cast as the bitter maniac bomb genius and all the other characters including those with minimal lines seem to make a lasting impression.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth watching or re-watching!"
"HelenMary","8","1","2","5 December 2012"," this film defines the ""action"" genre - it just doesn't let up!!!
","I saw this film SO many times at the cinema as many of my friends wanted to see it and I loved seeing the reactions of people to all the ""shockers."" Of course I bought it, and watch it quite a lot, and it bears up to repeat viewing even when you know what is going to happen next. If you haven't seen it yet, where have you been? Reeves, Bullock, Hopper and Daniels are the key players in this and are superb. Reeves - Jack Traven - the hot hotshot SWAT guy (oh the uniform!) who's a bit gung-ho daredevil ""deeply nuts"" next to the brilliant Daniels - Harry Temple - calm and measured, very sensible partner, apparently the brains of the duo, Hopper - Howard Payne - is the bad guy - and that's not a spoiler, you find that out in the first ten seconds of film and he plays ""crazy not stupid"" wannabe 'eccentric'"" very well, and Bullock - Annie apparently has the surname Porter but I'm sure it's not mentioned in the film - the useful pretty suspended-license-passenger who drives the city bus and keeps it above 50! Great chemistry between Bullock and Reeves, and whilst you can see she's acting in places, she's a fabulous gentle foil for hard macho character and almost makes him see that people are frail as he's so used to throwing himself around. Amazing and poignant scene where Jack gives up for a short while, and she calms him... goosebumps. And more goosebumps later in the scene where he ""didn't have anywhere to be just then"" and doesn't leave her ...<br/><br/>The action doesn't let up. Cinema-goers squealed, jumped and hid their faces through this one, and everything about it is simply great. This and Point Break made Keanu Reeves an acceptable household name for men as well as women, as no man could feel embarrassed liking a film in which a guy hangs under the chassis of a moving bus! This is definitely a boy film but lots of girls seem to like it too, can't think for the life of me why!! Jan De Bont's Direction was excellent. I'd call him visionary for having the ability to keep the action so fast paced and every little thing just frays your nerves. It's tight. I almost regret seeing the extras on the DVD - once you've see how they do a stunt it's not quite the same. Special mention has to go to the composer of the soundtrack too, that da da da da da daaa pumped the action forward and added to the frazzle-ness of feelings as you watched as it heightened your expectation.<br/><br/>Despite all the action, there's unusually a really good script with some laugh out loud humour, great one-liners - who can forget Reeves' epic first line in this? ""The Basement!"" when he's still just the cocky-boy in the team, or the dialogue between Traven and Temple, ""Was it good for you?""... But the best line of the film has to go to Reeves' friend Rob Mailhouse (drummer in Dogstar), ""Bob, what button did you push?"" as most quoted! Great seeing Alan Ruck (Cameron - Ferris Bueller's Day Off) in this with some funny lines too."
"Tweekums","9","1","2","15 November 2012"," Fast moving thriller
","As the film opens thirteen people board a lift in a Los Angeles skyscraper; moments later a bomb cuts the cable and it drops; the emergency brakes hold it in position but the people are trapped thirty storeys up. A disaster hasn't been averted; that was just to get everybody's attention; the bomber wants three million dollars or he will set off a second bomb removing the breaks! Some films might spend the next hour and a half working out how to save them but here this is just a taster of the bomber's behaviour. Cops Jack Traven and Harry Temple manage to free the hostages and after a confrontation in the basement it looks as if the bomber has blown himself to bits that is until he strikes again some time later. He blows up a bus and says he will blow up a second one. The second bus has been wired so that as soon as it hits 50MPH the bomb is activated and when it decelerates below 50MPH it will explode. He clearly wants to play with Jack as he tells him where the bus is and what number it is. Jack manages to get on board and the situation soon gets worse; an accidental shooting leaves the driver severely injured so passenger, Annie Porter must take the wheel. If they are to survive she will have to keep the bus above 50MPH even when the road is full of traffic or at one point non-existent necessitating a jump! As they drive along trying to find a solution Harry manages to identify the bomber; it may be a bit late for that information to be useful though.<br/><br/>This is a solid action movie where the tension is kept high almost from start to finish and as the bus keeps on going no matter what obstacles it meets there isn't time to look for plot holes or worry that it would be very unlikely that they could maintain that speed while doing the things it does. Keanu Reaves does a pretty good job as Jack Traven and Sandra Bullock is likable as always. Dennis Hopper puts in his trademark insane performance as bomber Howard Payne; over the top maybe but fun to watch. There isn't a huge amount of violent action but what there is is fairly intense; in the opening scene somebody is stabbed in the head, later one somebody is shot with a submachinegun and Payne is ultimately decapitated! Any fan of the action genre is likely to enjoy this and it doesn't lose any of the excitement on repeat viewings."

","Nearly two decades after its release, Speed still stands out as a classic action movie. It's pure fun and excitement, through and through. The minor plot holes are easily forgiven and forgotten among the fascinating premise, frantic pace, and superb acting.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' character is the brave, fiercely dedicated, instantly lovable, and absolutely adorable (if reckless to a fault) LAPD officer Jack Traven. Keanu does a great job, portraying all the intensity of a hot shot who works hard, loves to win, hates to lose, and refuses to let innocents die.<br/><br/>Keanu is joined by Jeff Daniels, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper, all of whom are admirable in their roles of mentor/best friend, innocent caught up in the action, and crazy (but not stupid) terrorist with an affinity for huge explosions.<br/><br/>The plot: After LAPD officer Jack Traven foils a terrorist attempt to hold hostages for ransom in an elevator, the terrorist forms a personal grudge against Jack...and sets up an impossible scenario, knowing Jack will try to save the day, but planning that he will fail and die along with the rest of the hostages. A bomb is rigged under a city passenger bus...once the bus reaches 50mph the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, the bomb detonates. And time is running out."

","Speed is another great action film that came out in the 1980's and 1990's. I think this film had the best villain though. Dennis Hopper's character was creepy and sadistic. This film has everything an action fan can hope for. It has great action, cool stunts, and some lovely romance.<br/><br/>This film is about an LAPD cop who must try to save the day when a bus in armed with a bomb and if it goes slower than fifty miles per hour, it will explode.<br/><br/>This is one of Keanu Reeve's better performances. He does better here than he did in the Matrix movies. Sandra Bullock does a good job in her role. But I really enjoyed Dennis Hopper as the villain with many tricks up his sleeves.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one fun action film. It gave me enough adrenaline to keep me focused for the whole film. There are many cool stunts, sets, and special effects. I rate this film 9/10."
"MovieGuy109","9","1","2","9 June 2012"," An excellent action thriller
","Speed is what every non-stop action film should be like: a fast-moving and intense ride (in this case, quite literally). The film's pacing is spot on, never losing a minute of our attention as it continually accelerates faster and faster. Getting Dennis Hopper to play the madman was also spot-on, Hopper plays the role with obnoxious precision and Reeves fairs rather well against him too. The premise is genius and allows the audience to be on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Of course none of this could happen in real life, but do we care? Not really. We are just propelled onward by the intensity of both the direction and the actors paired with some incredible stunt/ action scenes."

","If you think about it, this may be the best action film of the 90's! When a maniac tells Jack (Keanu Reeves) that a bus will explode if it passes 50 mph, this movie instantly becomes suspenseful. However, there are three things that annoy me: 1. The civilian characters are boring. 2. The guy in the beginning who thinks Jack will arrest him - what happens doesn't make sense! 3. The dumb cliché love interest happens, (like we haven't seen that before). On the brighter side, the way they figure out how to escape the bus is brilliant! The end is also incredible! (Not the love, of course) I highly recommend this astonishing film, but it cannot compare to DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON. But if you like action films at all, then watch it! {Rated R}"
"Kratos666","8","1","2","2 January 2012"," One of the better action films of the 90's
","""Pop quiz, hotshot. There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do? What do you do!?"" <br/><br/>The action movie of the 80's is without a doubt 'Die Hard'. The movie that defines action in the first decade of the millennium change is in my opinion 'The Matrix' (I know it's made in '99 but you do understand I have to get 'Speed' here in my introduction and besides I first saw 'The Matrix' in 2000...). So what comes to mind when thinking of action films that defines and changes the genre for better in the 90's? 'Speed'. F**k it, I just came to think about 'T2 - Judgment Day'...<br/><br/>So anyhow, 'Speed' didn't define action for the 90's. 'The Matrix' and 'T2' did a better job. But if 'Speed' would've been done wrong, the end result would've been terrible ('Speed 2, anyone?). Done well, action films can be a lot of fun (and thus forgiving some serious goofs and illogical happenings).<br/><br/>Jan de Bont directed 'Speed' as his first feature film. He had worked on several action films prior to 'Speed' as a cinematographer (Die Hard', 'Hunt for the Red October'...). What I've read from various film magazines and interweb sites, 'Speed' had some issues when going to production. <br/><br/>First of all, I have to mention Joss Whedon's ('Firefly' and 'Serenity') name as he contributed on the script making it work better. He was left uncredited, though. But what worried me the most was that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock weren't among the first choices for starring roles. Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin, Arnold Schwarzenegger... ""Get to da choppa!"" just sounds better than ""Stop da buzz!"".<br/><br/>Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Anjelica Huston, Emma Thompson, Diane Lane? Great actresses without a doubt but was their first intention to make the film about a group of middle aged tourists on a 20 mph bus touring Beverly Hills? OK, that sounded very stupid and I apologize for my lame effort to be ""funny"".<br/><br/>Films like 'Speed' are intended to charm the younger audience. I can't think of a better on-screen couple than Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Both good looking and terrible actors (yeah, like she deserved the Oscar!). The acting is so terrible at times that you have to be set for the right mood for it to work. You can't see 'Speed' and wait for some groundbreaking method acting. This is supposed to be cheesy and fun. It's not like Jeff Daniels or Dennis Hopper would be doing a better job but I just can't think of any other for their roles. Hopper is perfect for his role as the villain (just like in 'Super Mario Bros'... yeah right.) and in my opinion he is the scene stealer.<br/><br/>So what's the film really about then? Small pensions and cheap gold watches make retired cops go berserk and make bombs on elevators and buses while forgetting everything about police tactics and getting their faces turn purple of paint. That is pretty much the whole idea. So what do you do? What do you do!? Just go see it for the fun and the hidden charm."

","This aged just a bit better than I'd remembered, although admittedly I didn't have the fondest recollections of it. In essence it's a nonstop barrage of action clichés that doesn't try to step out of its own way, choosing instead to embrace the stereotypes and come up with a few new ones along the way. Keanu Reeves appears at his most wooden while Sandra Bullock is still finding her sea legs as an actress, but the two still manage some level of incalculable chemistry that makes you pull for them through thick and thin. In many ways, their relationship is a great analogy for the film as a whole - generic and ham-fisted, you've seen it a thousand times before but for some inexplicable reason you're still perched on the edge of your seat for the duration. Dennis Hopper is noteworthy as the preposterously over-the-top mad bomber; he serves up several great lines that sent me backwards through decades' worth of pop culture nostalgia."

Keanu Reeves saves the day by stopping an elevator bombing scare. This pisses Dennis Hopper off so much that he devises a new plan of putting a bomb on a bus. If the bus goes below 50, the bomb will go off. Can Keanu save the day?<br/><br/>And will we ever see a movie like this again? There is something about this film that makes it special. The action blockbuster that ignited the careers of both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The film does not require a strong leading man, just someone who is able to pull off these stunts. Reeves is able to make it look legit and even though people complain about his acting, he is in no way irritating. Bullock spends most of the film behind the wheel of the bus, so of course she falls in love with the guy. Wait, what? Ah, who cares, right? This kind of stuff always happened in the 90's. Girl falls in love with the good looking guy who saves the day. But those relationships never last (evidence in the lame sequel)<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper is one bad ass guy. He plays crazy so well, his role here is not Blue Velvet Frank Booth crazy, but cray nonetheless. The film is even more enjoyable due to the supporting cast of characters that are on the bus with the two stars. Jeff Daniels plays the buddy cop part, but due to the events in the opening of the film, has to stay at home for the exciting parts on the bus. <br/><br/>With the exception of the bus jumping the gap in the highway scene, which makes me roll my eyes every single time, the film is entertaining and will keep your interest. For a film to take place on a bus for 80% of the film, they did a really good job of not letting that annoy the audience. The film is the perfect formula for action junkies. It has a lot of those adrenaline rush scenes. For me it kind of looses it's steam when the film goes to the subway, but that doesn't ruin the overall excitement and feel of the film.<br/><br/>Speed is one of the best action films of the 90's. There, I said it. I can probably sit down and watch it and never really feel bored. Kudos for making the film watchable many times and still have that rush.

","Keanu Reeves has the uncanny ability to pop up in a legitimately good movie just often enough to keep people convinced that he may not be a completely worthless actor after all.

It was meant to be a disposable genre film and instead became a blockbuster.<br/><br/>It's the ultimate high-concept movie: a bus will blow up if it's not kept moving above a certain speed. You can imagine the results. Reeves is fine, as is Dennis Hopper, hamming it up as the villain, but the reason for the film's success is mostly due to Sandra Bullock (this may have been her debut?) as the plucky bus driver.

","Speed is a suspenseful thriller that features Officer Jack Traven, an L.A.P.D specialist (Keanu Reeves) and Detective Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) who both battle against a rather bitter villain ex cop, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) <br/><br/>Payne (Hopper) produces a revenge attack by planting a bomb on a bus that has the potential to kill thousands of innocent people. It's up to Officer Jack Traven (Reeves) to prevent the bus from exploding. He does this amazingly by boarding the bus and keeping the speed above 50mph. He also has to deal with terrified passengers which he finds isn't an easy job at all. Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is a passenger on board of the bus and she takes control as the driver. She controls the bus with an obvious wisdom of horror but also with a strong sentiment of authority. Reeves character puts his trust into Annie immediately and they are both able to support each other in many life or death situations that occur. Jack Traven (Reeves) and Annie (Bullock) form a comforting bond which really helps them both whilst they are in the middle of a crisis. Payne(Hopper) is simply greedy for money and wants Traven (Reeves) to provide the money for him - before he starts taking away people's lives, and he will do so with no hesitation. There is not a second of wasted screen time which just makes it a spectacular film to watch. The film is very enjoyable and includes intense situations that are simply breathtaking. ""Speed"" has been correlated to ""Die Hard"" because it features vulnerable hostages that are surviving from a heroic figure. What I enjoyed about this film is that it had a mixture of suspense and humour featuring fast moving shots and a killer sense of hilarity with various unexpected plot twists!<br/><br/>However, there were parts of the film appeared to be a little unrealistic and it seemed that more research ought to have taken into position before shooting, or shouldn't have been included in the final edit at all.. I found myself questioning the logic during certain scenes considering it is classified as a realist film. The acting isn't exactly perfection at times either; with a lot of lines being delivered gave me a cringe worth reaction.<br/><br/>Payne (Hopper) portrays a very realist villain and I was impressed with his performance. His malevolency antics are quite simply worrying as he appears to be invincible, even though he's just sitting at his residence relaxing with his feet up. Harry Temple (Daniels) attempts to go after Payne (Hopper). Its a challenge to find out Payne's identity but he manages to do so, which is risky business and and finds out how dangerous Payne (Hopper) really is.<br/><br/>Jan de Bont directed ""Speed"" as his debut whilst previously switching from cinematography on other films, including ""Die Hard"". I was very impressed with his efforts taking into consideration that it was the first time in full charge. The film was written by Graham Yost, who could also be considered as a fresher, as ""Speed"" was the first film he wrote, prior to writing TV shows. <br/><br/>To finish up, I did enjoy this film and I imagine many others will too. Don't have any doubt about watching this. Its not a must see film, but its enjoyable to say the least. So, if you ever have 111 minutes to spare in your life then the best thing to do is resort to ""Speed"". The film, not the drug."

","Jack is an adrenaline fuelled LAPD cop who stops terrorist, Howard Payne from getting 3 million dollars. Now Howard Payne has set up a 'game' for Jack.<br/><br/>There's a bomb on a bus, when the bus goes 50mph its armed, if it drops below 50mph, it blows up.<br/><br/>This is an all out adrenaline rush from start to finish; Keanu Reeves sounds at certain times odd, his acting comes under scrutiny but he keeps the audience locked by committing daredevil stunts, jumping onto a moving bus, sling underneath it to disarm a bomb.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is funny and sweet as the woman behind the wheel and there is chemistry between the two which works. The action is mostly on the bus, the obstacles the vehicle must overcome; the 'gap' scene is a little ...... mainly because you see the bus leap across the gap likes it alive....But still a great action movie."
"ray-280","10","1","2","25 April 2008"," The best picture of 1994
","The film has not a single flaw, and a minimum of physics-defying stunts necessary to make the action film work. The bus is diverted to a place where it can (temporarily) survive, and the few leaps of faith (and more yards than a human can leap) are minimalistic plot devices, nothing more. This film is about the people caught in a suspenseful, yet survivable, crisis. This firlm is a THRILLER that demolishes its peers from its own era and rivals that of any era, and even that quaint little British serial about some over-the-top secret agent spty guy.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves (Jack ""I put the SWAT in SWAT"" Traven, LAPD SWAT) and Sandra Bullock (Annie Porter) could Just as easily have been Gable and Hepburn. Reeves is more cartoonish, but carries his ""supporting"" role well. The clear star of the film is Sandra Bullock, the grouchy, half-awake commuter grunt thrust behind the wheel of a bus that is rigged to explode if it slows down below 50 mph. Hitchcock would have been proud of the suspense, and special effects worthy of evolving his cro-duster scene from that era.<br/><br/>While a complete film in the true sense of the word, the story never strays from its title premise. The desperation attempts to survive could fail at any time, and the passengers not only know this, but half of them seem to expect it, though they try as they can to survive. This film brought us an insider's video of those scenes we usually only read about or watch on the news, and gave us an oddball supporting cast of stereotypical LA and tourist types that made us feel like we were on the bus right with them, wishing the crisis was over so we could get to wherever we were going, and do what we were doing, without being bothered by high-level criminals using us as a pawn, and could they please get us off this damn bus? What every action film tries to be, and rarely is. Die Hard on a bus."

","If you're not averse to formula film making, a little bit of overkill, and if you're able to indulge a small amount of un-believability, then you're sure to enjoy ""Speed"".<br/><br/>There's thrills and spills aplenty in this action flick about a disturbed bomb freak who plants one of his lethal devices on an LA public bus which is loaded with passengers and roaring down the freeway. Enter police officer Jack Traven, a bomb squad hot shot who has once before thwarted this homicidal madman. Now Jack (Keanu Reeves) must find a way of boarding the moving vehicle in order to warn the civilians and save the day.<br/><br/>Reeves stars in a role rumoured to be originally turned down by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and thank goodness for that. Keanu provides a fresh face and a degree of believability as the human hero (ala ""Die Hard"") that Schwarzenegger would have ruined. Supporting him are plenty of other enjoyable fresh faces including Sandra Bullock, partner Jeff Daniels and veteran actor Dennis Hopper who is most satisfying as the explosives nut case.<br/><br/>Of course the main attraction is the fabulous action, death defying stunts and the thrilling suspense of the whole ordeal. While we know perfectly well that our hero will be triumphant in the end, trying to figure out how he'll squeeze through each tight spot is great fun. Cinematographer come debut director Jan De Bont adds his visual expertise to the production, and it certainly shows with some fantastic camera work ( Director of Photography Andrzej Bartkowiak). It's all rounded off with a suitable soundtrack.<br/><br/>""Speed"" is never a new journey in the cinema experience, but it doesn't pretend to be.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","2","16 October 2006"," Action at a high pace; in fact, almost overwhelmingly high
","Ah, the ""die hard"" scenario. Since the movie of the same title came out in '88, many directors have tried to recreate the tension and energy of the classic action film. The great idea of an location packed with innocent people that's been taken over by a villain(or a group of them), and a single good guy in the same place... the only chance of bringing the explosive situation to a reasonably good end. This film was an attempt at re-capturing that, and at making Keanu Reeves an action-star in the process. I'd say they succeeded more at the second... The Matrix Trilogy speaks in favor of that, I'd say. The plot is fair. The basic idea is actually pretty good. The pacing is intense... the movie hardly ever lets you take a breather. In fact, it almost reaches extreme amounts... becoming overwhelming, leaving the viewer exhausted rather than entertained. The acting is decent enough. The characters aren't terribly developed or fleshed out. The action is pretty cool, and well-filmed and edited. The clichés are sadly present; the cackling(!) villain, the damsel in distress who screeches more than the bus tires and the heroic (male) lead. The dialog has its moments, but much of it sounds too much like trying to be macho and cool. The one-liners vary, but it's hard to deny that the whole ""pop quiz"" bit is cool. All in all, a pretty cool(if overwhelming) action film that just doesn't really break any new ground. I recommend this to any fan of action, the actors involved and anyone interested in the basic idea. Just know that you may find yourself more exhausted than entertained by the end of it. 6/10"

","When it hit theatres in 1994, Speed was a rocket powered entertainment vehicle that was guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time, barely letting up the entire way as Keanu and/or the bus performed one death-defying stunt after another. 12 years later, Speed has lost none of its quality, and still succeeds in giving solid chills and thrills for a good hour and fifty minutes.<br/><br/>The film opens with Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels attempting to rescue a group of hostages who are trapped in an elevator that could go off at any second, due to a crazed man who is holding them in the elevator for ransom (Dennis Hopper in a brilliant turn as Howard Payne). Needless to say, Reeves (Jack) and Daniels (Harry) succeed and (apparently) dispatch the bad guy to oblivion. Months later, though, Jack must combat his old nemesis when a bus is wired to explode if it goes below 50 miles per hour.<br/><br/>Forget logic. Forget reason. Speed is that rare, liberating experience that actually succeeds in making you not care whether something makes sense. Reeves can ram a subway into a wall and not die, go climbing around in the undercarriage of a bus, and come out virtually completely unscathed. Speed succeeds in virtually everything in sets out to do, which, thankfully, is not much.<br/><br/>The filmmakers never have any illusions that they are making this a character driven drama that will have you weeping if one of the characters dies. Thought some characterization is added, it is definitely secondary to the action. All its purpose is to do is to that you care at least a little bit for the main character and what happens to him and his romantic opposite: Annie, played by Sandra Bullock. Though normally, lack of characterization might be classified as bad, Speed is the rare exception to the rule: the rare movie that comes along at just the right time, and blends just enough action and characterization to make you say, ""Forget those people! Let's get to the good stuff!"" And believe me, the ""stuff"" is good. Mind-blowingly so. With movies out now like The Matrix, Equilibrium, the new Star Wars, and other action-packed films, you would think Speed would lose some of its impact. Not true. Years later, it still has that special something that sets it apart from all other action films. The action is creative, never-the same, constant, tense, taut, and thrilling. A good musical score en-chances the action as well. Dennis Hopper's acting is just the tiniest bit cheesy, but that works for the film. Reeves is his usual dumbed-down action hero, and it fits the part of Jack perfectly. Daniels shows a refreshing bit of his dramatic side, and Bullock captures just enough chemistry with Reeves to make it believable.<br/><br/>Speed will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time, with unbelievably tense and amazing action. It never once takes itself too seriously. It is conscious of its own cheese, and fully embraces it, finding the perfect balance of cheese and gravitas. Explosions, a blazing fast bus, and a speeding subway train. What more could one ask for?"
"kevindias947","10","1","2","21 April 2006"," Need for 'Speed'
","1994 seemed to be a great year for action movies with the release of the ever-so-famous 'Speed'. You'd think winning 2 Oscars and 13 awards in total would give a movie enough respect but not for this one. Combined with great plot twists, an amazing cast and crew, and packed full of action 'Speed' is one movie everyone has got to see. <br/><br/>As the movie progresses the action just keeps coming and it's got you screaming at the television. From the elevator hostages to the bomb on bus until the train ride from hell would pretty much sum up the movie in the simplest terms. Still challenges are faced throughout this ride through the fifty feet highway gap, the unexpected deaths, the leaking gas and the train wreck making any viewer have the movie's attention.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock bring such chemistry on-screen that it would make you want to replay their screens over and over again. Though the actors perform excellent together they do equally well on their own. Dennis Hopper is right on par as the physcopath Howard Payne, who is on a mission of revenge. He delivers his lines perfectly and is convincing as a villain. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that you can watch repeatingly and never get bored of it. I still have decades before I ever lose interest in one of my favourite movies 'Speed'."

","Speed is a great, nail-biting, top- notch thriller literally from beginning to end, with a stellar cast.From elevators, convertibles, buses,subways,and more this movie in my opinion is the greatest thriller ever made. Dennis Hopper plays Howard Payne an crippled and crazy terrorist bomb expert.Keanu Reeves (perfectly) plays Jack Travens a young LAPD hot-shot/SWAT ace and Jeff Daniels plays Harry, Jack's responsible partner. In the beginning of the movie, Payne hijacks an elevator by attaching bombs to it. Harry and Jack ruin his plans and save all the people. Moments later they find out that the terrorist is near and in the building.They finally meet with him and before Jack can kill him he commits suicide with bomb strapped to his chest. He appears to be dead (obviously) and the next day he receives a call from Payne saying that he is hijacking a bus with bombs but with a twist. The bus has to stay above 50 mph. The movie takes on from there, with twists and turns,hidden secrets,a love affair and an awesome ending. Speed is a movie you do not want to miss."
"Mr_PCM","9","1","2","9 May 2005"," High-paced, highly charged action
","For sheer adrenaline, there's not a lot of films out there to top Speed. If released now this film might possibly be considered politically incorrect and sensitive (but then again, what isn't?) but its just a simple terrorism movie (although the 'terrorist' wants money, so probably not technically a terrorist).<br/><br/>The main portion of the plot revolves around a bus which is armed with a bomb that will blow if the bus drops below 50 mph. Keanu Reeves is the cop on the bus, with Sandra Bullock driving the bus through the streets of LA at breakneck speed. Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with a mix of wise-ass and psycho, to create a very effective villain, and Jeff Daniels is Keanu's partner on the ground (as it were).<br/><br/>It sounds simple enough, but the simple idea is surprisingly effective, making for some genuine breath-holding, edge-of-your-seat moments. As with all Hollywood movies, you just know that a romance plot line is going to creep in somewhere, and Speed is no exception. But even though the romance is telegraphed from the moment Reeves gets on the bus, it doesn't detract too much from the story.<br/><br/>It's not a particularly clever film, but it really doesn't need to be. Just sit back (if you can, if not just sit on the edge of your seat) and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film is, as successful as it was, it was always going to spawn a sequel, and spawn is definitely the right word. Speed 2: Cruise Control is an abomination which sullies this one. So do yourself a favour, watch this, but instead of watching the sequel, just watch this one again."

Aside from some fantastic set pieces with top draw effects and pyrotechnics, not to mention insane stunts, the movies pace is superb, it barely stops for breath and this helps to really stretch out the basic premise, similar to the way Die Hard stretched out a simplistic idea. The cast are good, Reeves makes a great action man and performs a lot of his own stunts, which add to the quality, while he does the stoic action role well leaving the acting to the endearing Sandra Bullock and the scene chewing Dennis Hopper, with good support from Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton.

"Angry_Arguer","Null","1","2","18 August 2003"," Not as smart as you'd think...
","While Speed could have been a great thriller (it certainly is better than James Cameron's overdose of budget with True Lies), but it falls into the category where entertaining the audience supersedes credibility.  It's worth seeing once though I can't bring myself to recommend movies with Keanu Reeves in them.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper is his usual mad self, it would be interesting to see him as a second-grade teacher in a movie.  I can say that the passengers on the bus are not smart on the writer's part.  Given that this is by Graham Yost, the same guy who wrote Broken Arrow, I'm not surprised.  I was happy with Alan Ruck's performance.  He has changed a lot since being Cameron Frye. <br/><br/>
Jan de Bont isn't a strong director.  What works for him is the usual facade of MTV-style images.  I will admit he is a little beyond that level, but not by much.  Considering he worked with such directors as Paul Verhoeven, Richard Donner, John McTiernan, and Ridley Scott, this is a disappointment. Speed 2 and Lara Croft 2 have reinforced my view of him.<br/><br/>Overall, there are better action movies out there, but there are a lot worse ones too.  2 out of 5 stars."
"PrivateBryant","9","1","2","29 June 2003"," Amazing action film.
","I will start off by saying that I watch movies both for entertainment and from a critical,thoughtful point of view. This is definitely an entertaining movie, but it stands up critically aswell. I watch virtually any genre of film, but action is one of my favourites. And this is my favourite action movie. Despite my high regard for Die Hard, I think this is better. It succeeds in so many ways. Firstly, the plot: Well, its pretty damn simple, but in this case thats a good thing. A guy has rigged a bus so that if it goes above 50 MPH a bomb is armed and if it drops below that speed again, it blows. I have heard much criticism of this being unrealistic, but I don't see why. Think about the amount of destruction modern technology can cause today, and it seems plausible. Another guy, a cop, is trying to stop the worst from happening by boarding the bus. The Actors/ Characters: Keanu Reeves is excellent and likeable as LAPD officer Jack Traven, the type that fears nothing and will do anything ,no matter how dangerous. Dennis Hopper is the ex - cop that has rigged the bus. This is an incredible performance. In my opinion,in terms of action films, the best bad guy ever and one of the finest pieces of completely addictive acting in any type of film ever. Sandra Bullock is Annie, a normal woman that ends up driving a bus haphazardly through busy city steets at 55 MPH - and she was originally worried about being late for work!! I don't know if she is like this in real life, but if she is, she must get annoying. I don't like this character very much because she screams stupid things and repeats herself all the way through the film. Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels are solid as Jack's superior Mac and his partner Harry. As for the action sequences- they are thrilling, like many people have said, because they are real. They don't rely on special effects at all. And that means they are much more exciting. You are kept on the edge of your seat throughout and that feeling doesn't falter - I have seen this movie LOADS of times and it still excites me in a big way. It really does grip you. This is partly thanks to the fantastic score by Mark Mancina. This makes sure that even if the action starts to bore you, which is unlikely, you are still captivated. The scores' only flaw is that a certain bit of music gets a bit repetitive after a while. In conclusion, this film is a cracking, thrilling, exhilirating rollercoaster ride of an action movie, that has yet to be equalled. As a piece of entertainment, its brilliant. From a critical perspective, it has only a few minor flaws - i.e Sandra Bullocks infuriating screaming and a few quotes that are very tin - eared and unnatural, which is a shame because what makes this film so great is that the action IS natural, as oppose to obviously CGI. The film fanatic in me loves this film, The critic applauds it. 9 and a 1/2 out of 10."
"Captain Ed","6","1","2","25 February 2003"," Some brain-dead spots, but exciting **SPOILERS**
","""Speed"" features some exciting action and good acting, but it also features some scenery-chewing and script idiocy.  However, it's a good enough popcorn movie to entertain, as long as you know it's not terribly smart.<br/><br/>First, the good: Sandra Bullock had a breakthrough role in this film and it's easy to see why.  Despite the testosterone overload of films in this genre, she comes across as both strong and vulnerable.  In fact, she's the one person in this movie besides Jeff Daniels that feels genuine and so the audience (male & female) can easily identify with her.  She does brave things but always because she has to do them, not because she's an idiot who wants to prove something.  Kudos to the writers and to Bullock, who glows onscreen here.<br/><br/>Speaking of idiots proving something, Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper fall into that category.  Reeves lets it lay back, though, and that works more than Hopper's typical Snidely Whiplash-style villain, who at one point starts spewing a bunch of pseudo-philosophical nonsense about how the PD won't let the bomb ""become"".  Smack the writers and Hopper, and give Keanu credit for trying to overcome the material.<br/><br/>The plot is laid out pretty well most of the way through, except for two glaring ""you've gotta be kidding me"" moments.  First, at one point the PD direct the bus -- which has to stay above 50 MPH -- onto the 105 freeway, which at the time had not opened yet, and then they're surprised when there's a section that hasn't been built.  Second, anyone familiar with the 105 freeway knows that even complete, it's a lousy choice for what they want; why not take the 405, which connects to the 5 on either end, giving you the option (going north) to get the hell out of LA?  Why not take the 10 and do the same thing? The 105 is only 25 or so miles long.  Third, and most egregious, there is NO WAY IN HELL a bus can leap the gap shown in the freeway, and even if it could (if, say, a ramp had been placed there, which it hadn't), it would never be able to maintain a wheel speed registering 50 MPH or above.  It's a simple law of physics.<br/><br/>The second instance is the ending.  Having handcuffed Bullock onto a support rail in a subway car, and Reeves not having the handcuff keys, and the controls being shot to hell and the brakes not working (a very contrived situation), Reeves decides to save the day by speeding up so he'll disrail and smash into most of subterranean LA.  Huh???  Wouldn't slowing down to a minimum speed work very nicely?  I mean, all you need to do at that point is come to a stop without getting killed so someone can bring in a hacksaw, right?  The resultant crash is all very fun, but ultimately stupid.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, it's a pretty good popcorn movie, and it's loads better than its sequel.

","Honestly this is one of my favorite movies, and by far my favorite action movie. I love the whole premise of the story and I love the way it was played out. From the camera work to the acting. Keanu Reeves is not only hot in this movie, but his acting has come a long way from "" Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."" Sandra Bullock is amazingly funny, witty and heartbreaking as Annie. I love this movie so much. It has an equal number of suspense scenes mixed with humor. Brillant."

","""Speed"" is a must-see action film with a few comedy parts. Jack Travern is played by Keanu Reeves, who plays his part magnificatly and keeps you shivering from the suspense. The plot is one of the best i've seen since Ferris Bueller's Day Off. See this film and never look at a bus the same way again- just kidding! This movie is great, and can be viewed over and over again. YOu've never seen action like this!"

","Speed is one of the best action packed movies in the 1990's. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are excellence as Jack the cop and Annie the bus passenger with Dennis Hopper as the madman. The excitement in Speed keep on rolling to the end. This movie almost reminds me like a roller coaster, that you will not want to get off after the ride is over. It could be an idea for an amusement park ride."

","Where can I start with? What makes me think that this movie is one of the best movies ever? So many things really acting, directing, script, tension, music and tons of action. But as James Bond would say: `First things first', Jan De Bont made his directorial debut in this film, what would be expected from a person with no experience in this matter was a lousy film, with story potential. But happened the opposite, the action scenes are so perfect that sometimes makes us think about nothing else and keep us in the edge of our seat every time we see it. Never leaving the extremely inventive plot behind, it is a movie that actually makes the actors show what they can really do, more than ever before. Sound and special effects were actually over the top and weren't showing us, that they were all that this movie had to give as many movies around show. Finally, I just want to call your attention to the fabulous score composed by Mark Mancina that is one of the best ever on movie industry and is one of the main factors that helps us feel so interested and affected by the movie's action scenes.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone, no exaggeration, I give it a 9/10."
"bronco815-2","Null","1","2","17 August 2000"," A Very Thrilling and Intense Action/Thriller
","RATING: ***1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>
If you were to ask me what was the most exciting, intense action film of the decade, I'd definitely say Speed. Excellent action, very intense, and very entertaining equals a very good film.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in a building where Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) put a bomb on a elevator with some passengers and so he's holding them for ransom and if he doesn't get the money, the elevator explodes. So Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) go out to rescue the passengers. They do and then they confront Howard and he grabs Harry and holds him hostage. So Jack shoots Harry in the leg to make Howard let go of him. And then Howard goes into another room and presumably kills himself.<br/><br/>But Jack quickly finds out that Howard is not dead when he blows up a bus. So Howard ends up explaining the situation to Jack by a phone. There's a bomb on a bus, once the bus goes 50 MPH, the bomb is armed, if the bus drops below 50 MPH, it blows up and he wants the money by 11:00. So now Jack has to race against time to keep the bus from dropping below 50 MPH.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie is very intense especially when Jack is trying to keep the bus going 50 MPH. There's a lot of action in the movie; of course; and a lot of thrills. The performances are good especially Hopper, who plays the perfect villain and Reeves who plays the perfect cop. Along for the ride is Annie (Sandra Bullock) who drives most of the time and; of course; they end up falling in love.<br/><br/>I can only find one problem: that very dumb sequel! But that won't go against the score the film gets. So if you're looking for an intense ride with lots of action, and you haven't seen this movie yet, then go rent Speed, better yet, buy it! You definitely won't be disappointed, highly recommended."

"bob the moo","Null","2","7","14 April 2002"," Has weak moments but when they're on the bus it never falters for a second
","Cops Jack and Harry successfully defuse a hostage situation leaving only the bomber himself dead.  Later they are awarded but find the bomber is not so dead.  In fact he has wired a city bus to explode and wants $3 million in 3 hours.  He tips off Jack where the bomb is however once the bus goes over 50 mph the bomb arms, if it falls below 50 it then goes off.  Jack finds himself on the bus with a civilian driver and a load of passengers desperately avoiding obstacle to keep the bus moving while Harry tries to find the bomber.<br/><br/>The big summer sleeper of it's year, the simple premise of this film meant it was easily the most talked about film  the cheapest marketing available! The film opens with a set piece around a lift-full of hostages.  This introduces us to the characters and sets up the motive for the next bit on the bus.  The bus is the majority of the film and when it gets going it is very good.  When the story has to explain things or develop character the camera goes static and you can feel the dullness set in (e.g. in the bar-room after the award ceremony).  However the action around the bus means that you never have time to draw breath  no matter how implausible it is.<br/><br/>Director Jan De Bont cut his teeth on Die Hard and knows how to do a tight action movie  however his desire for more and more bangs lead to a 20 minute conclusion which is not only forced but feels like it was tacked onto the end of the bus movie.  It is stretched and just copies the action on the bus in an attempt to get the same effect  it doesn't succeed.  Instead the ending leaves a bit of a sour taste after such a great movie  the last 2 times I watched this on TV I just turned it off after the bus bit ended, the ending really is that much of a let down.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves makes the most of his role after Willis, Cruise, Tom Hanks, Depp and Stephen Baldwin all turned it down.  He does the tough guy thing really well and still manages to come across as a semi-real person. Likewise Sandra Bullock gets herself star status and number one slot on every `100 sexist' lists for months to come by getting the role of Annie after Halle (this moment is so much bigger than me) Berry turned the role down.  Bullock manages to be sexy and realistic  it's only at the end where she turns into your average women needing saving.  Daniels is good in support, as is Spin City's Alan Ruck and the always reliable Joe Morton. Dennis Hopper is a very good bad guy  it's not quite Blue Velvet quality but he's very believable.<br/><br/>Overall the majority of this film is a real roller coaster that keeps the pressure up.  However with the 20 minute ending De Bont shows he doesn't know when to stop and ruins things by going too far with the train climax. Sadly this lack of restraint also caused him to make the terrible Speed 2."

","Wow, what an action, thriller and entertainment filled was this for a film! An incredibly gripping film which keeps you on your toes for the entire duration of the film.<br/><br/>There is maybe a thought of it having been stretched a bit with that kind of an ending (as it could have been ended with the bus scene and then catching the villain), but to be honest, by the time we arrived there I was already so struck by the film that I was never going to criticise any aspect of the film; no way.<br/><br/>I can't put it in words how much I enjoyed the film right from the moment the hero receives that phone call. He runs after the bus, chases it, they ignore him, speed up, get it over 50 KpH, and then the fun starts! There were so many heart-in-the-mouth scenes in it that it is hard to pick any as the best, but I think that little cunning trick with the camera was a mind-blowing one. I commend the film-makers for having come up with such an intelligent idea that literally sealed the deal, because throughout there was this question running in the mind as to how on earth will they be able to get out of it before it explodes.<br/><br/>All in all, a complete entertainer, this film. I am sure I will watch this one again some day."

","Speed is an excellent action movie! It's in my top 3 favorite action movies of all time, it has everything a great action movie needs: a good script, good acting, great exciting action sequences, and a good atmosphere. Speed has such a unique and cool plot to begin with, it's very creative and edge of your seat thrilling. Keanu Reeves was great in the lead! He took control and was very high energy throughout the whole thing, but then he also had the range to change from that to a nice warm hearted sweet guy, which I loved. Sandra Bullock was amazing here! This is one of her best performances In my personal opinion. And then there is Dennis hopper, no other guy could've pulled off the powerful performance that Dennis gave. He was so menacing and purely evil, which he needed to be. The dialogue was impactful and fitting, script was very well written. The action sequences were very edge of your seat and thrilling! That certainly kept you guessing the whole way through, and the visuals here are well constructed and cool to see. The ending is also very exciting and pleasing, it doesn't disappoint. The final line of the film is so great, it's happy and comedic/romantic, which was very fitting. 10/10!"
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","3","26 January 2016"," The cinematic shot of adrenalin that resurrected an agonizing action movie gimmick...
","The 70's had ""Jaws"", the 80's had ""Die Hard"" and the 90's had ""Speed"". What do all these movies have in common? An irresistible and unmistakable high concept: a uniqueness in the plot allowing other movies to be summarized by simple combinations, like ""Alien"" is ""Jaws"" in space, and ""Under Siege "" is ""Die Hard"" in a boat. It's by the way an odd coincidence that the director of ""Speed"", the unknown Jan de Bont was the cinematographer of ""Die Hard"", he sure learned in the best school.<br/><br/>So, ""Speed"" relies on a simple concept: a bus can't slow down under 50 mph, otherwise, it explodes. Let me take a few lines because the wannabe screenwriter I am can't resist to the temptation of exalting such a high high-concept. I think, it's the kind of ideas that are worth at least half the work, I mean, imagine a producer being submitted such a project, how many spectacular premises does that hold? How about a traffic jam? What if a road comes to a dead end? How can the passengers leave the bus? How can they disarm the bomb? How can the villain make sure they can't take the passengers out? How will they be able to fool the villain anyway? etc. etc.<br/><br/>Movies based on ""what if"" situations are generally the best in the way they make you wonder what can happen next while you're already enjoying the present action, the enjoyment is doubled, and through a bus that can't go down 50 pm, everything is meant to happen fast, to put you on a constant edge. It was a no-fail guarantee and all ""Speed"" had to deliver were the requirements of the action genre, and get us a memorable movie villain, Dennis Hopper is perfect as the young and maniac bomb expert Howard Payne, a cool hero, Keanu Reeves, a then relatively new face of action movies and a young Sandra Bullock who has this mixture of inner heroism and genuine fear, something our female-power driven era would deem as sexist (God I miss the 90's!).<br/><br/>There is also Jeff Daniels as the more experienced cop, a script full of funny archetypal one- liners, and more than anything, a terrific plot structure. ""Speed"" actually, could have only consisted on a bus chase and it would have worked, but it spices up the material and pushes the envelope of the action genre by introducing two other spectacular sequences, one introducing the villain, who installs a bomb within the cables of an elevator and threatens to make a dozen of innocent people fall to their death, and the climax that can simply be summed up as ""Speed"" in a subway. I used to think that this was unnecessary, but when you think about it, ""Speed"" doesn't just overplay the action card, it also bases itself on a simple third-act structure: introduce the villain, then the meat of the story, the heart-pounding bus ride and then the ultimate confrontation.<br/><br/>""Speed"" is like a great shot of adrenaline revisiting what was an agonizing action movie gimmick: the obligatory car chase. It would also inspire a less successful sequel with ""Speed 2: Under Control"", and I think it's a bit unfair to dismiss the whole movie, it didn't work because it didn't have ambition but because the original had too much of it, so it inevitably paled by comparison. 1994 was a terrific year for movies and it's all the more fitting to have a groundbreaking movie in the action genre.<br/><br/>That was a quick review, but if there's one thing I learned from ""Speed"" is that sometimes, the faster, the better."

","Speed (1994): Dir: Jan De Bont / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Daniels, Joe Morton: Exhilarating and exciting action film suggesting mental stability or adrenalin. Plot involves a bomb on a bus that will activate once it goes beyond fifty miles per hour and explode if it goes under it. Keanu Reeves plays a cop who embarks upon a high speed chase to warn the driver. Tight plot with one thrilling action scenes following another with explosive tension straight to the end. There is implausible scenes such as the bus leaping a fifty foot gully but director Jan De Bont stays ahead of viewers supplying endless plot turns. Reeves is in top form as a cop who is not afraid to take risks. After being awarded for saving an elevator full of passengers he is suddenly thrust into a high speed chase to save bus passengers. Dennis Hopper is solid as the bomber bent on avenging his injustice by dictating another. Sandra Bullock brings humour and charm as a passenger forced to drive the bus once the driver is injured. She starts out as your average passenger but ends up being Reeves's key victim once she has a bomb strapped to her. Jeff Daniels plays Reeves's partner who must think fast before fatality sets in. Joe Morton plays the Lieutenant who struggles to assist Reeves in any form possible so to ensure the safety of the passengers. Pure entertainment concluding with a nail-biting subway sequence.

","One of the biggest hits of 1994 was the action thriller Speed, a thrill- a-minute film that provides edge-of-your-seat excitement from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Jan De Bont, who also directed Twister proves to have a gift for mounting a contemporary action drama filled with very human and believable characters, not to mention some bold casting choices, one of the boldest was the casting of Keanu Reeves as a police detective who gets in the middle of a bizarre hostage situation when he learns that a psychopath from his past (Dennis Hopper) has planted a bomb on a bus that will explode if the bus slows to below 50 MPH.<br/><br/>De Bont and screenwriter Graham Yost have mounted an intricate story that starts in one direction with our hero helping a group of people trapped in an elevator and all of a sudden heads into a completely different direction with a flawed protagonist whose guilt about his past with our villain puts him in full hero mode.<br/><br/>Reeves, an actor of questionable talent prior to this film, makes more than a viable action hero here and Hopper is properly menacing as our bad guy. Sandra Bullock gives a star-making performance in one of her earliest performances as a bus passenger who, through bizarre circumstances, ends up driving the bus and keeping it at 50 MPH.<br/><br/>This film provides riveting action and suspense from the beginning to the end, barely allowing the viewer to breathe as De Bont somehow tells this story on a pretty large canvas, yet gives us the claustrophobic feeling of being inside that bus at the same time. The film won four Oscars for its technical expertise and was followed by a forgettable sequel."

Its up to Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) to not only save the passengers on the Bus, but to also catch that culprit responsible for it.<br/><br/>Speed was no doubt a true action movie. What makes the movie unique compared to any other action movie is that the plot takes place right from the morning. Nearly all the other action movies, especially during the nineties take place late afternoon and evening, so it's good to see a different action movie for a change.<br/><br/>Its a good and interesting movie with a lot of action for everyone to enjoy, and I would recommend it for anyone that hasn't seen it already.<br/><br/>The movie also has other well known popular casts like Sandra Bullock, who played the character Annie Corter, a fellow passenger, and Jeff Daniels from 101 Dalmatians, who played the character Harry Temple, a fellow swat team member and partner of Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves)."

","Speed is one of the greatest action movie's I've ever seen. And based on the premise it really shouldn't be, a bus, something that isn't very good in a chase, must stay above 50 miles per hour. Yet the way it's shot, the music, and making the characters likable enough to care about leads this to be one of the most heartpounding films I've ever seen. Every time I watch this film it gets me excited, and my heart begins pounding faster than usual. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock give very good performances, the effects are fantastic, and the villain is one of the funniest I've seen in any movie.<br/><br/>It may be cheesy, but the only thing I really don't care about in the movie is the ending. And maybe this is just me, but I think the movie actually gives you too much, by the end, it becomes just exhausting. When the train is about to derail, I'm just like ""can the movie just end."" Other than that, Speed is one of the best action films ever made as far as I'm conscerened."

","They don't make'em like this today. 'Speed' is perhaps the last ultimate action movie that is pure action and tension. While nowadays movies mostly rely on CGI for cool action sequences, what one sees in 'Speed' is rather realistic because the said scenes were shot live action. The props, the stunts, the chases and the jumps were all fantastically done in live action and they keep the viewer riveted.<br/><br/>'Speed' is essentially an action thriller. There are plenty of explosions, chases, shootings and adrenaline to keep the viewer entertained. Then there's the tension that is excellently created as the film focuses on the bus and its passengers. The writing is good. The dialogues are witty and funny. The characters are well written and the story is engaging.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific. I don't think much of Keanu Reeves as an actor but here he suits the part very well. With her undeniable comic flair and a strong screen presence and charisma Sandra Bullock is a scene stealer and she has some of the best lines. Dennis Hopper is superb as badass Payne. Perhaps Payne is one of the most memorable bad guys of the 90s. Of the actors who play the passengers, Alan Ruck stands out as he adds more comic relief. Beth Grant typically plays the lady who gets everyone in trouble (the kind of role she's well known for). Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels are effective too.<br/><br/>'Speed' is one of the last pure action adrenaline movies. It's filled with energy, suspense, humour and sarcasm that make it throughly entertaining. Jan de Bont has done an incredible job here. Ah, what a pity they don't make them like this anymore!"

It does start a little slow with the opening credits and an elevator shaft, but the music is what keeps me interested. It then moves to the scene where the great villain, Howard Payne (a great Dennis Hopper) has planted a bomb on an elevator and held people inside ransom for $3.7m, and the heroes, Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Det. Harold 'Harry' Temple (Jeff Daniels, in a serious role, cool) manage to save the hostages, while Payne escapes. But it is not over for Traven, not long later he sees a bus explode, and is told on a near public phone that there is a bus with a bomb on it. If it goes over 50mph it is set, but if it goes below 50mph, it blows, and if anyone besides him gets off, he blows it. It is now a race against time, before 11pm, to figure some way to stop the bomb, or save the passengers, including revoked driver Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock), who returned in the sequel. Oh, and when they do stop it, it concludes with a speeding train chase. There are some fantastic twists in this adrenalin filled high action thriller. Also starring Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Capt.

","I was riding a bus fitted out with a video screen when I saw Speed. The bus was the overnighter from Sarajevo to Zagreb, and I was rocking along in the upper deck as Keanu and the passengers rocked along in LA. I was in a nice new bus going through a bomb-shattered landscape, and Keanu was in a crummy old bus, with a bomb, going through, well, a more or less bomb-shattered landscape. I was trapped. He was trapped. I was tough. He was tough. I needed a bathroom break. He didn't seem to need one, but you couldn't really tell.<br/><br/>With Keanu, you never can really tell. He's the young Kevin Costner, an actor so wooden he resembles a newel post with eyes painted on. So here he is, trapped on the bus which (in case you've been off-planet for a while) has been rigged to explode if it goes under 50 mph (that's about 80 kph, if you live in a normal country).<br/><br/>The insufferably spunky Sandra Bullock was the passenger pressed into service as the driver. Why there's a cult of Sandra fans I'll never understand; the only theory I can generate is that she starred in a movie called 'The Net,' one of those things where Hollywood demonstrates its inabilily to grasp the real meaning of technology, and a bunch of geeks who showed up to make fun of it were swept off their feet. Thus are usenet newsgroups formed.<br/><br/>Anyway, before long I was wishing her bus would just crash. Failing that, I would have gladly settled for having my bus crash. Except I wanted to live, actually, if only to see Dennis Hopper in some other movie where his talents wouldn't be so ignobly wasted."
"NeXTCube","Null","1","3","22 August 2002"," You can tell it was directed by a director of photography...
","Jan De Bont, director of Speed, had previously been a director of photography on films like ""The Hunt for Red October"".  And you know what? He's great at that.  Almost all of ""Speed"", like ""Red October"" looks great; lots of movement in the camera shots; gorgeous imagery.  The photography adds to the pacing and tension of the film, and you rarely find yourself losing track of the action.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's about all the good I have to say about this film. It was actually kind of enjoyable the first time I saw it, but it was on TV the other night, and I noticed a few problems...<br/><br/>First: Why is it that Annie is told by the bus driver to put out her cigarette (which doesn't even look lit) before she can get on the bus, but then never - NEVER - through the entire film says, ""Gee, I wish I had a smoke to go with this fantastically stressful situation"".  Now, you non-smokers might not appreciate this, but as an ex-smoker, this is A Big Deal.  She would have been *dying* for a Menthol Light for three straight hours.<br/><br/>Second: boy, that bus has a great takeoff angle when it jumps the gap in the freeway.  You'd think it had just gone up a really steep ramp or something.<br/><br/>Third: the kart under the bus so he can defuse the bomb.  Wow, they were able to keep the speed of the bus and the speed of the truck towing the kart really well synchronized, weren't they?  And while we're on the topic, even the runways at LAX are only 2 1/2 minutes long when you're going 50+ MPH...yet he spends more like four minutes under there.  We'll ignore the fact that there's clearly *not* enough ground clearance under the bus as he's shown being backed up to it.  And when that 1/4"" cable snapped, it would have taken his head off.  But that's okay.<br/><br/>Fourth: funny that the throttle lever on the subway can speed the train up but not slow it down.  Hmmm...<br/><br/>Fifth: Isn't it strangely convenient that the one person on the bus who can actually drive it after the driver is shot is an attractive white woman, not, say, a black woman, or a latino guy, or maybe that tourist dude from out of town?<br/><br/>Sixth: Why were there tire rippers in the ground pointed toward the *entrance* to the freight terminal at the airport?<br/><br/>I'm sure someone could top me in making a list of the movie's faults, but that's not my point here.  My point is that the movie doesn't give me enough in other areas to make me want to switch off my brain.  No snappy, creative, dialogue for anyone other than Dennis Hopper - and even that's not that great.  No interesting characters.  No exploration of motivations.  And by the time it was over, I was really hoping that Hopper would blow himself, Reeves, Bullock and the subway to shreds with the over-used ""bad guy takes love interest hostage"" schtick.<br/><br/>A good thrill ride the first time, but loses its luster quickly during a repeat viewing."

","*** 1/2<br/><br/><br/><br/>It takes a lot to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire movie.  Speed uses the perfect formula to do that.  The opening starts with an explosion in an elevator shaft trapping 12 or so people alive.  If the mad bomber doesn't get 3 million dollars he blows the elevator.  Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels foil the mad bomber's (Dennis Hopper) plan but don't get away with him.  The next day, the bomber put a bomb on a bus that if it reaches 50 mph, the bomb is activated, and if it goes under 50 mph, it explodes.  The acting is generally perfect for all their characters, especially those on the bus.  Many people spit out very funny lines even when the event is bad. (Examples: ""Bob, what button did you push?)  That was funny.  The movie is also very smart showing what the good guy knows and the bad guy doesn't, vice verca.  The demise of the bomber is so smart and so funny, I just started to laugh.

I didn't remember the bus jump or the part where the bus nearly tipped over when it was making a sharp turn or the part where several people were about to die in an elevator in the beginning of the movie. Even still, I enjoyed Speed even more than when I saw it the first time. It has so much action in it. I was never bored. This movie was thrilling, action packed, and suspenseful. It was fun to look back and see how Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were back then. As I was seeing this movie for the first time in so long, I noticed something about Sandra Bullock. She seemed a bit annoying in this film. Don't get me wrong, Sandra is definately my favorite actress, but looking back on this film, I thought she could have made her character seem more real. She has improved so much as an actress since then though and evidence of that is her performances in A Time To Kill, Hope Floats, 28 Days, Miss Congeniality, and much more. Keanu Reeves usually doesn't impress me much with his acting, but I thought he gave a pretty good performance in this film. The cast of this movie was pretty good and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It is simply flawless, definately Keanu's best film next to The Gift and The Matrix. I give Speed a 10 out of 10."

And if you ever drive a bus, you'll know that making any sort of a turn, even with an extremely wide pivot, is hard at 30 mph, 50 is quite literally impossible, because the bus would roll over. We use the movie during training, to show new drivers what someone that knows nothing about buses could come up with.

","Speed is an excellent, fast moving action blockbuster from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is excellent as the heroic SWAT officer Jack Traven, Dennis Hopper is never better as the mad bomber Howard Payne, and Sandra Bullock establishes herself as a great actress here. Other cast members including Jeff Daniels (in an unusual casting) as Jack's partner Harry Temple and Joe Morton (Miles Dyson from Terminator 2) is SWAT Lieutenant ""Mac"" McMahon.<br/><br/>For those that have been living under a rock for the past 20 years, Speed is about a Los Angeles bus that is rigged to explode if it drops below 50 miles per hour (that's 80 km per hour). The movie starts with Howard Payne's attempt to trap an elevator full of people in an office building with the intention to hold them to ransom. Howard's efforts are successfully thwarted by LAPD SWAT officers Jack Traven and Harry Temple, in which Howard is seemingly blown up. A while later, one morning a bus explodes which is later revealed to be Howard Payne, who is still alive. He phones Jack Traven to tell him that a second bus has been rigged with a bomb. Once the bus hits 50 mph, the bus is armed. If it drops below 50 mph, the bus will explode along with all the passengers on board the bus. Howard also warns Jack that if any attempt to rescue the passengers is made, the bus will also be manually detonated. Jack manages to locate the bus and successfully boards it mid transit. While the bus continues to maintain its speed through the streets of Los Angeles, Jack must also race against time to successfully disarm the bomb, save the passengers on the bus, and outwit the psychotic Howard Payne, who is also revealed to be a ex-cop from the Atlanta Police Bomb Squad.<br/><br/>The entire movie is very neat. Jan DeBont, who was previously a cinematographer for Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October, and Lethal Weapon 3, makes his directorial debut with Speed. Though he goes onto direct the 1996 blockbuster Twister, he doesn't hit the same heights with his next movies all box office flops. Believe it or not, following the success of Speed, everybody thought it was a great idea to follow up with Speed 2. As it turns out, Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) which Keanu Reeves wisely passed on, turned out to be a bomb which sank at the box office and killed Jan DeBont's career as a director.<br/><br/>Though you might found yourself questioning as to whether a bus can fly in a famous scene, among other things, forget about it and settle back and enjoy the fun.

Than, the time passes, another viewing comes.

","Pop quiz: you're a cinematographer given the chance to direct a high-concept action flick. What do you do? What do you do?<br/><br/>Well, if you're Jan De Bont, you make a movie that is so action-packed that most people seem to be extremely forgiving about the film's sheer preposterousness. Your star is wooden and your bad guy is hammy, but there are more than enough explosions and stunts to keep the popcorn munchers happy, and the movie is a massive success.<br/><br/>I was never much of a popcorn fan, and I never really understood why this film wasn't lambasted like its sequel. After an admittedly well-handled opening scene set in an elevator armed with a bomb, the film completely dispenses with logic (and the laws of physics), the silly script taking way too many liberties for my liking. Having had his elevator bomb plot foiled by young police officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and bomb disposal expert Harry (Jeff Daniels), crazy ex-cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) tries to hold the city to ransom once again by placing an explosive device on a bus which will detonate should the speed go below fifty miles per hour (despite the bus looking like it's going about thirty in most scenes). Boarding the bus, Jack tries to find a way to save the passengers' lives while pretty commuter Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel (the driver having been shot).<br/><br/>Payne's plan is poorly thought out: had the driver dipped below fifty before Jack had been able to board the bus, the bomb would have gone off, leaving the extortionist with no chance of collecting his cash. Luckily for him, this doesn't happen, but this isn't the film's only dodgy plot point: there's the ridiculous gravity-defying leap across a fifty foot gap in an unfinished stretch of freeway; getting the driver off the bus is a perilous affair, but Jack casually hops off later without a hitch; bomb expert Harry and his highly trained team enter Payne's home without even considering that it might be booby-trapped; and in a very silly finale, Jack speeds up a subway train when he could have simply slowed it down.<br/><br/>I've yet to see the sequel but surely it can't be any more inane than this one."

After assuming Payne to be dead (after detonating a bomb strapped to him) Jack and Harry celebrate their success. However, it turns out that this was merely a ploy by Payne and his next play involves strapping a bomb to a bus which will detonate if the bus drops below 50mph once it has accelerated to this speed.<br/><br/>As you can imagine with what is basically 'Die Hard on a bus' Speed is not short on entertainment and as a result of this it is never boring, but it does suffer slightly in the same vein that some other action films do...<br/><br/>The problem with Speed is that it is a one-note and one concept idea; aside from the 'filler' at the start it is basically a bus travelling at over 50mph for well over an hour. As I've mentioned it is entertaining to an extent, but there's only so much you do with this type of concept before it runs out of steam (or fuel as is the case here). It doesn't really help that they are on a bus which can smash through roadblocks, cars and so on and they're also all on a bus that defies the laws of physics by cornering better than an F1 car. To be fair, I can roll with these sort of things when done in the name of entertainment, but I still need a reason to care about what I'm seeing and I have to be honest I wasn't fully invested in what was on show here.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper is the villain of the piece who is hacked off with the police and feels that they owe him a vast sum of money for an injury he sustained whilst working as part of their bomb disposal team. In this film he uses his expertise against his former colleagues which does present an interesting cat and mouse scenario, but with flimsy character development there's only so much that Hopper can do here (I give him full marks as he does an excellent job with what he had to work with). Keanu Reeves is actually pretty good as the heroic LAPD officer; there's a certain warmth to his character that makes him likeable and easy to root for. Sandra Bullock brings her usual affable dizzy charm and does OK even if she doesn't have much of a character to play here.<br/><br/>The ending is over-the-top and silly and in some ways this forms part of the problem; the film is so ridiculous that at times it feels like a cartoon; check out the infamous scene with the 'bus jump' if you want to see what I'm talking about. In fact sometimes the only thing that reminded me that it wasn't a cartoon was that nobody dropped an anvil on Keanu Reeves head and that Porky Pig didn't show up at the end saying 'TTTTTThhhhattt's all folks!!!'<br/><br/>Joking aside, this is a pretty entertaining film and at the very least it is fun unpretentious and never boring, but the cartoonish nature of the film meant that I found it to be distracting fun rather than a pulse-pounding thrill ride which is the main reason that I haven't given Speed a higher score."

","Speed is a fast paced, action packed movie that focuses all its attention on action and little to a logical story and dialogue sequence. There was little time for me to take a break from the high-tension action scenes because there could be (and was) another explosion or crash around every corner. Jack even made driving interesting as he launched his Crown Victoria into the air right at the beginning of the movie.
Even though this was an original twist on an action film, the next scene was always predictable. Will the passengers survive? Will they make the jump? Will they blow up? These were easy questions to answer. The only unanswered questions I had were ""Why don't they just..."" questions such as ""Why don't they just give him the damn money?""
The dialogue was also a major downside to this film. From the first time every character talked, you could tell how they were going to act for the rest of the movie. Jack was going to be the heroic and smart lead, the bus driver was going to be too kind for his own good, Howard was going to be the evil psychopath, Annie was going to be the strong and assertive woman, and so on. Speed was also full of cheesy one-liners and flirting between the two main protagonists and didn't require much thought. However, that could be why this movie was so successful and can always be found while scrolling through channels. If you are coming home from a hard day's work and want to unwind, this may be the movie for you.
Despite all the criticism, the high budget lead to some very realistic and believable special effects, good sets, and good camera work, even for today's standards. And it didn't have much of the textbook corny acting as seen in other action films around that time. Overall, if you haven't seen this it can be an interesting watch, but don't expect much from this 90's action film."

","""Speed"" is an American English-language film from 1994, so two more years only until this one has its 25th anniversary. It was directed by Jan de Bont (actually the first directorial effort of this prolific cinematographer) and written by Graham Yost and for both of them this (almost) 2-hour movie is among their most famous. One reason is that this film won 2 of its 3 Oscar nominations (lost Editing to Forrest Gump) and another is that this film is still considered one of the defining action films from the 1990s. It features the relatively young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock and (the not so young) Dennis Hopper. This is obviously not a film about individual performances, but it needs to be said that Reeves was working the part nicely and Hopper was also good, but admittedly had very little to work with in terms of both screen time and material. Bullock on the other hand I don't even think the performance was a problem at all, but eventually her portrayal was the weakest from the entire film and it is ridiculous she even got awards attention for her turn. It is the epitome of a badly-written female character in an action movie. Early on she gets hit on by a guy who is somewhat of a mini antagonist, but of course she is too good for him and then there are these banter moments with Reeves' character and we knew exactly where this was heading. She is a tough intelligent woman, but needs constant saving and nice words from the big hero. I cannot deny I would have preferred her character to be left completely out of the picture, but I guess they did not want to go for a sausage fest. Oh well.<br/><br/>Back to the positive: This film has a fairly massive runtime, but it never drags and has no lengths at all I would say. They weren't scared of sacrificing several of the good characters to show how evil the bad guy was and this is a brave approach that we do not always get. I also found it interesting how the movie, fitting the title, moves from slow to fast methods of transportation. It all starts in an elevator, then a bus (the core of the film), and eventually a metro train. Talking about the metro train, fans of the television show ""The West Wing"" will see (and hopefully enjoy) a familiar face in there. Back to this one here, this is not a film you want to go for if you are in need of realism. There were probably a hundred aspects that would not happen like that in reality or we can also include unrealistic plot developments here. There is a hole in the road and the rails aren't finished either? Nah. Also admittedly the screenplay is not particularly creative as all the ideas are fairly simple really, like the traffic jam or the lack of fuel etc. But I will admit they still worked. As did the entire film. It has its weaknesses and I would not call it a classic, but it was a genuinely entertaining two hours. I give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out."

There are lots of action, suspense and great explosions that will bow you away. Speed does live up to its title, even if you see it multiple times; the suspense is still there. Speed has a great cast including Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels and Sandra Bullock. The plot is as strong as a rock: After seeing his painstakingly crafted bomb plot fail at the hands of two L.A. Cops (Reeves and Daniels), the bomber (Hopper) sets about exacting his revenge by setting a bus to explode if its speed drops below 50mph. The tension is expertly crafted, the film adjusts its pace at the all right times and the character development and attention to detail make the film rounded enough to avoid the trap of it becoming a formulaic action or disaster movie. A smart script full of nice touches and clever one-liners keeps you listening as well as watching. The result exceeds your expectations time and again throughout the length of the film.<br/><br/>Hopper makes the film, and although this shot Reeves' star right into the stratosphere, he still clearly is just a pretty face, as he cannot act for toffee. Bullock gives the best performance of her career (what a shame she consistently picked turkeys after leading in this epic) as the gutsy damsel at the wheel, and Reeves (let's be kind) grunts and flexes his way through the film except on the few occasions when his acting ability is uncomfortably stretched. Jeff Daniels meanwhile appears like a different human from the actor who goofed around so hilariously in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Overall, this movie is excellently made with big wonderful explosions, great casts, non-stop actions, a fast movie and it's like a roller coaster.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

"MaesterFilm","8","0","1","27 January 2017"," One of the best action films of all time
","Action is not one of my favorite genres of film but I really enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>The action was amazing, it was actual action, thrilling high-stakes action, not a fight scene. I'm not a fan of two robots fighting and destroying an entire city, or fist fights between people on top of a train or any of that stuff that's been overdone to death. Those scenes have one inevitable result and you're just waiting for it to happen.<br/><br/>In this film the driver has to keep the bus going, but there are numerous challenges as the roads are not empty. It subverts the hostage situation in films, where the captor is actually there, often surrounded by police, and negotiates with a negotiator for his safe passage and ransom.<br/><br/>Here the hostages are on a bus, the negotiator is on the bus, but the captor isn't. We don't know where he is, so the police cannot send a SWAT team to fix this. They actually have to use their brains for this puzzle. Even the location of this thing is not stationary, so the cops can't cordon off the block, they have to clear the roads as much as they could.<br/><br/>Hostage films are usually about police that follow protocol, usually with a rogue negotiator who thinks outside the box to do it his own way and save the day. This film is about a situation for which there is no protocol and they have to think on their feet.<br/><br/>That's why it's interesting and worth the watch.<br/><br/>I give it 8/10.

","This high-octane thriller is a pretty good example of 'does what it says on the tin' film-making. There's a bus that'll explode if it slows down. End of story. The concept in itself is workable, but the film, directed by Jan De Bont's sure hand, is excellent, a real action classic with super-fast pacing and a storyline that never lets up. Things kick off with a tense rescue-trapped-passengers-in-an-elevator bid and are enlivened by an exploding bus shock scene.<br/><br/>We're then into the heart of the story, on board of a primed-to-explode bus, and all the genre clichés are in place, albeit in a slick and well-oiled form. Keanu Reeves plays the young hero (not as good as in THE MATRIX but pretty good) and Dennis Hopper is his overacting nemesis, chewing the scenery with relish. There's a heady combination of stunt work, sudden death, explosions, and tense shoot-outs and the film truly lives up to its ""Die Hard on a bus"" tagline. The only weak links are a hang-dog Jeff Daniels, miscast in a non-comedic role, and Sandra Bullock, whose ditzy, screamy heroine quickly becomes grating. An intelligent script is the real highlight of this slightly workmanlike, but nonetheless excellent, thriller."

","'Speed' has got an incredible hook, but you just know that at some point credibility will be stretched to the snapping point and logic abandoned. And it is. No matter, because the aptly named Speed zips along at a breakneck pace, never allowing you to dwell on any of that. Reeves and Bullock have great chemistry, and it's easy to see why the former remains a star and the latter became (and remains) one. But the real star here may be Dennis Hopper (R.I.P.), who steals the show as the scene munching villain.<br/><br/>I was really taken with how skillfully made this movie is. Like John McTiernan ('Predator', 'Die Hard'), Jan de Bont came out of the gate poised to be the next big thing, but after his next film, 'Twister', it was a swift fall from grace and a ""Whatever happened to..."". Still, not many directors with resumes twice the size of de Bont's can claim to have made a film this entertaining and enduring."

","Yet, that's when I saw Jan de Bont's Speed, cuddled up in our new house in the wee hours of Christmas morning, 1994, I think. I couldn't turn it off.<br/><br/>And the reasons for this were:<br/><br/>Speed is a wonderfully energetic piece of film-making. It mixes the formulaic with the fresh, the mad criminal (Dennis Hopper) with the hero (Keanu Reeves), but this time, with a strong and gutty blue-collar woman (Sandra Bullock). The hook--the bus that can't slow down or the bomb will go off--is both simple and effective. And, de Bont never lets the action subside. He knows he has a winner here, and he'll be damned if he'll let anyone be a slacker!<br/><br/>Is Speed great cinema? Yes, but it's because it's a technically superior piece of entertainment. Nobody's going to remember it for the acting.<br/><br/>What we will remember, past the thrills, is meeting Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>Bullock is such a big star now that her breakout performance may get forgotten for younger audiences. De Bont must have seen that she would power this picture with her humanity, quirky good looks, and chutzpah.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to Christmas morning, 3 a.m. or so. Across the room sat the TV and VCR. I held the remote, and when my wife would stir, I would pause the tape and wait. It took some time to get through the movie because, although she slept well that morning, my wife was and is a light sleeper. <br/><br/>The only reason I mention this Christmas stuff is that watching Speed felt like that Christmas present your folks let you open on Christmas Eve. It was a delight, and considering how good Sandra Bullock is as an actress--and I forgive her for The Proposal--and how deeply lovely she is, Speed is a present that I still appreciate 20 odd years later.<br/><br/>Now, Keanu Reeves in the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, that's where my forgiveness and Christmas spirit dry up."

I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his ""Metal Gear Solid"" game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's.

The part I find especially ridiculous is when the bus gets off the first freeway. The bus hits all kinds of obstacles (cars etc) along the way, almost all of which would have slowed the bus down below 50mph. The jump across the 50 ft gap in the freeway would take little over 1 second for a bus doing 50mph. But the gap shown in the movie looks enormous and even more crazy is the bus taking off like it's a kangaroo! Then there's Reeves and Bullock sliding on a panel thing with wheels...they would have fallen off that easily. Another cliché is some poor soul who cannot escape from danger...the woman in the lift who won't move...she would be out like a shot! And the tourist guy taking ages to cross from one bus to the other...he'd be over like a shot! Human instinct is to survive.

","Any good film, book, essay or song has a grabber that catches your attention and hooks you through the rest of that work. ""Speed"" is a two-hour grabber. It is the consummate thrill-a- minute movie, the kind where all sins of bad acting and preposterous events are forgiven because the action and suspense are like a wild concoction of sugar and crack. This action movie will bring out the adrenaline junkie in just about anybody.<br/><br/>Far from perfect or even basically intelligent, ""Speed"" is about exciting as movies get. After an ""eccentric"" old man (Dennis Hopper) rigs a crowded elevator with explosives to collect a ransom, two LAPD cops, Jack and Harry (Reeves and Daniels), stop him, but he gets away. Days later, he rigs a public bus with a bomb. Once the bus travels 50 mph the bomb will arm. If it drops below that mark, it will explode. To make things more thrilling, he drags Jack into the crisis.<br/><br/>Writer Graham Yost toys with us like a cat with a ball of yarn. Everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Yost hurls all kinds of unforeseeable problems at Jack and the rest of the characters. He must've sat down and made a list entitled ""things that can go wrong when you're on a bus that can't slow down."" It sounds sort of elementary, but it's actually clever. He strings them together effortlessly as if they were dominoes as opposed to separate plot points. Either way, it's better than the alternative of ""how many times they can narrowly escape the inescapable,"" but there's some of that too.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, if there were a Razzie for Worst Performance by an Ensemble, ""Speed"" would be up for the award. It doesn't say much for Keanu Reeves when his best quality as an actor is being stoic. If he cried at a real family member's funeral I'd probably think he was faking it. It works for ""Speed"" however because he's the on guy not freaking out and in control -- well, except for one notable three-year-old temper tantrum. Co-star Sandra Bullock in one of her earlier roles is annoying, setting a precedent for much of her career. Even Dennis Hopper takes a bit to become a convincing nutjob. Then again, it's all easily overlooked in a film as breakneck as ""Speed.""<br/><br/>Eternally engaging, suspenseful and cleverly constructed, ""Speed"" is a bar-setting action film. No other movie will be able to go near the stay-moving singular vehicle hostage action movie without bringing ""Speed"" to mind.

The plot is very intelligent and the action has an amazing rhythm.Plus, I observed a strategic substrate which I really appreciated - although is quite common when hostage takeover - , because it thickened the atmosphere.It wasn't all about catching the bad guy and saving the innocents, the situation wasn't simple to deal with, there were moments when you actually think the bad guy is gonna escape, because lets face it the bad guy was brilliant, sick but brilliant.The surprise element is always welcome in action titles, and we had plenty of surprises with Speed.<br/><br/>As for acting, Keanu Revees is among best actors when it comes to sweat, bullets and danger.He does a really good job in this film.Sandra Bullock was good too, she genuinely succeeded in transmitting the spontaneity of her character, a woman who literally speaks her mind.Dennis Hopper illustrated with greatness the madness of Howard Payne, so we can't say the acting was poor.<br/><br/>Besides the great script, because it was a great one, the sound was absolutely awesome.

","Take a bus, put a bomb on it, set it to explode if the bus drives at less than 50 mph, and then put every obstacle imaginable in front of it, except maybe a family of ducks, and you've got Speed, one of the best action films ever.<br/><br/>You know, it is interesting that sequels are usually criticized for being all action, no story. Ironically, however, one of my many complaints on Speed 2 was that it was too boring in the beginning. The characters were on the boat for half an hour before the action even started. Speed, however, starts off right away with an action scene involving a smart but crazy bomb expert known as Howard Payne trapping a group of people in an elevator, and threatening to send them falling down to their doom unless he's paid 3 million. However, two LAPD officers, Jack Traven and Harry Temple are able to save the people just in time before going after Howard Payne, which causes Harry to get shot in the leg and Howard Payne to set off a bomb that presumably kills him.<br/><br/>This action scene would make a great climax in a lot of films, yet for Speed it is only the opening scene. After that this film enters what has to be a record for it 10 minutes of no action, where Jack and Harry are awarded medals of honor, and stay up late partying. The next day, however, Jack witnesses a bus driven by one of his friends exploding, and then receives a phone call from Howard Payne who is revealed to have survived the bomb explosion the day before, telling him that the bus exploding was just a demonstration, and he has another bomb rigged to a bus full of passengers that will go on if the bus reaches 50 mph, and will then explode after that if the bus drives under 50 mph, or if one of the passengers tries to get off the bus, and demands a ransom of 3.7 mil to be delivered to him at 11 a.m. After getting the number of the bus, and phoning Harry, Jack heads off to find it, yet arrives too late, as the bus has already reached 50 mph. Despite this, Jack manages to jump on, yet upon seeing an LAPD cop enter the bus, one of the passengers freaks out, and during all the commotion shots the bus driver, forcing another passenger, Annie Porter, to drive the bus instead. Now it is up to Annie with the help of Jack to keep the bus moving at more than 50 mph, while Jack tries to dismantle the bomb and Harry tries to find out where Payne is.<br/><br/>Like I said, the film puts every kind of obstacle in front of the bus. You're barely given a moment to catch your breath after the bus passes through one obstacle before another one appears. It is the kind of film that will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through it.<br/><br/>And yet despite all of these action scenes, the film doesn't ignore it's characters. Its skill comes in developing its characters while they react to all the action scenes around them. You feel their relief after they get past a very difficult obstacle, and their depression when their situation seems most hopeless. Like Jack, you barely know the passengers when he first enters the bus, yet as time passes they start to become more and more familiar to you, and their personalities began to show.<br/><br/>The actors play an important part in the film. You've got to hand it to Keanu Reeves, from the goof ball Ted to the super cool Neo, he certainly plays a wide range of roles. This time he plays a James Bond type of character with Jack Traven, daring, sarcastic, yet he also makes him more uncertain, and more of a guy who follows his guts than his wits, which helps make the film feel even more tense, especially when you have an awesome villain like Payne, played by Dennis Hopper, who seems to have thought of everything and has it all under control, to the point where you wonder how can Jack outwit him. And Sandra Bullock positively shines as the tough but vulnerable Annie Porter.<br/><br/>1994 was a great year for action films, and Speed was arguably the best of them all. Granted, it doesn't feel out of place if you would put it in a James Bond movie, yet it is done so well that you wish a lot of the James Bond movies could be as good as it, or if its sequel could be as good for that matter."

","Mad bomber Howard Payne is furious when one of his ransom plans is thwarted by officers Traven and Temple. So much so they become heavily involved in his next devilish plan. There is a bomb on a bus, the bomb becomes active once it reaches 50mph, the kicker being that should that bus go under 50mph, it detonates. Also a problem is that Payne is watching, so should any passengers attempt to leave the bus, he will detonate the bomb himself.<br/><br/>Speed is implausible, daft, mindless and borderline cretinous. It's also gripping, inflammable and delightful in premise, which in the process turned it into one of the finest action movies in the modern era. Taking up directing duties for the first time is Jan de Bont, better known at the time as cinematographer for luminaries like McTiernan, Schumacher, Verhoeeven and R Scott, de Bont literally throws everything at it in case nobody lets him direct again. Cars, helicopters, buses, bikes and lifts, all are either hurtling around or exploding with visual and aural excitement. It's nonsense alright, but it's thrilling high octane nonsense, action/adventure escapism in its purest form.<br/><br/>Depending on what sources you trust or believe, Speed was apparently born out of an unproduced idea from one Akira Kurosawa {eventually made as Runaway Train in 1985}. Screenwriter Graham Yost, who having just watched Runaway Train, felt that a ""bomb"" was badly missing from the premise, thus Speed as we now know it was born. 20th Century Fox green-lit the project {with major reservations about premise and cast} and the rest as they say, is history. The public lapped it up, stars Keanu Reeves {Traven} and Sandra Bullock {wonderful chemistry} became household names, and the 90s finally had an action movie to rival the 80s genre high that was Die Hard. Reeves, due in part to not being asked to do much outside of flex muscle and deliver cocky exuberance, firmly established a marker as an action hero. He of course would go on to deliver the magnificent Matrix and it's less than popular sequels. Bullock comes out with much credit, women in action films back then rarely did much more than scream and go doe eyed at the male lead. Here her Annie Porter holds her own under duress and the interplay with Reeves positively crackles {they may just be the prettiest on screen couple of the decade}.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's the pace of the movie that keeps it thrilling, de Bont {sadly unable to move on to better from here} after a tight and tense lift dangle, mad Dennis Hopper {Payne} opening reel, keeps it as one seamless action set piece-and that's exactly what is required. We don't need to think or worry about any extraneous filler, we don't have time, for we are too busy having fun and checking our respective pulse rates in the process. Made for $30,000,000, the film went on to make $283,200,000 worldwide, those are the sort of figures to make cinema snobs cry in their art laden handkerchiefs.<br/><br/>Go Speed ! 9/10"

","One of the more original efforts to the 90's action canon, Speed is mindless adrenaline fuelled entertainment but one which would have benefited from being shorter. The primary centre of the narrative is the bus, so when you have most of the film dedicated to this tense scenario the characters are enveloped in, it feels like a bit of a cope-out when they rush the belated rescue from this situation by focusing instead on a pretty ridiculous ending on a subway train. Concentrate on the bus for crying out loud! Anyway, the action is great, if unfathomable and Hopper makes a great villain again. But although, in this case, the premise was good on paper, as usual with the 90's action flick the script in worn, cliché (apart from some occasional good one-liners), contains your stereotypical characters and has big enough plot holes to drive a 50mph bus through.<br/><br/>6/10"

As the bus speeds around the city it faces many obstacles in order to get through unscathed and when unbelievable circumstances arise it's up to Traven and the passengers to tackle.<br/><br/>the use of the bus is wonderful, with a very claustrophobic feel to it adds to the pressure and situation. Situations involving bombs are also significant to add to the pressure There are also some great catch phrases to be heard.<br/><br/>When certain scenes have featured you may question the realism of the event and I myself have a few views about that, but the bottom line is that this is a high paced energetic thriller with stunning effects, plot, scenarios, and acting and is not to be missed."

","Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are called in when a terrorist bomber, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) threatens to kill 13 passengers in an express elevator. Jack volunteers himself and Harry to examine the bomb which leads to them eventually saving the passengers and finding the bomber. After a confrontation, Jack and Harry think the bomber exploded and are awarded medals. However this ride has only just begun.<br/><br/>After the explosion elevator opening sequence - which lasts upwards 10 minutes - Jack is sent into another game of Howard's as he's rigged a city bus with a bomb. But this one has a different catch than just explosion upon a button press. This one is armed when the bus exceeds 50mph and explodes when it drops below 50mph thereafter.<br/><br/>Jack quickly finds a way to get on the bus after having to jump from a civilians's car to the bus. The bus driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) must take over. But not aware of the bomb, she tries to slow down before Jack gives the reveal of the whole situation in front of all the passengers.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves gives probably the best performance of his career. Jeff Daniels supports really well, and Dennis Hopper is the classic bad guy. When it comes to the action, it is really amazing. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time because you don't know how in the hell they will keep the bus above 50.<br/><br/>The score is wonderfully crafted and goes together very well. Joe Morton also supported really well and added depth to the plot when his big scene came up. He delivered all his lines with great emotion as well as mainly all the rest of the cast. Alan Ruck is a passenger providing comedic relief.<br/><br/>The directing and a the script is all top notch and definitely dramatic when the action gets slow paced. No matter what, the tension is high and you can feel it throughout every character - except Annie.<br/><br/>Three paragraphs and I still haven't discussed Sandra Bullock - I bet you wonder why. It should be fairly obvious that I despise her. Her acting is less than par level and her voice is dreadfully annoying. She is barely decent looking so it's hard to care for her at all. Her lines have no emotion as far as I can tell, which makes the Annie character pointless. The only reason why the driver was shot was to bring in this character. She quickly becomes romantically linked with Keanu's character. I just think the film would have done a lot better without her character. The only satisfaction I got from Sandra in this movie was her line: ""What you thought you needed another challenge or something?"" <br/><br/>Sandra is the reason I refuse to give this a perfect 10. It is unfortunate that Forrest Gump, Interview With the Vampire, and Pulp Fiction came out the same year because Speed could have gotten more awards.<br/><br/>Overall, the a-list actors, the incredibly intense ride the movie gives, the few laughs you have, the superb acting, the amazing plot, the dazzling special effects and props and the Oscar-Winning sound are all wonderful reasons to watch Speed at least once."

","Speed is a good action movie that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do very well in. The story is about a cop thats arch enemy is plotting to kill him and one of his steps is warning him to get on a bus that has a bomb on it. Keanu Reeves is the best I have seen him in this movie and Sandra Bullock is pretty good as well and they make the movie better then it would be without them. This movie is good to sit down for 100 minutes or so and just enjoy and not think too hard about. Overall this movie is very entertaining and deserves the high rating it has.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","1","8 July 2006"," The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down (spoilers throughout)
","Speed is another one of those films where the idea is better than the execution. A bus that can't go below 50mph without blowing up? Cool! Just imagine the mayhem that will ensue. But unfortunately this excitement overlooks the fact that only the dregs of society ride the bus.<br/><br/>The main aim of a film like this, besides creating exciting action, must be to create likable characters; people we don't want to see blown to smithereens. But really, would you feel any worse if any of the passengers in Speed died? I wouldn't. In fact, I actually like the scene where one of them gets blown up  a jittery old lady gets itchy feet and then eats highway sandwich as the dastardly Dennis Hopper sends her on a one-way trip to Splatsville. But unfortunately this is just a one off. All the rest survivedamn it.<br/><br/>But the killing of the nervous old lady is rendered even more amusing than it already is through the attempts to inject emotion. Reeves and Bullock desperately try and make us give a damn. But with the screen filled with such a dearth of acting talent, one can only grin. And besides, Hopper's reaction is much more in line with my own. ""Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future."" I'm on his side.<br/><br/>However, the old lady is far from the film's most annoying character. That dubious honour would go to Ortiz. He's obviously meant to be the lovable, salt of the Earth type, a working class hero adrift in a sea of cowardly women and retarded men (stand up Alan Ruck). But Carlos Carrasco's line delivery is even worse than Reeves'. Example: when he hears that the bus has to make a 50-foot jump, he's meant to communicate surprise. But rather than adopt a look of disbelief or mutter some expletives, he opens his eyes as wide as they can possibly go (so wide they look like they're about to pop out Loony Tunes-style) and mutters an exaggerated, ""Geez"". It's quite possibly the worst line delivery in cinema.<br/><br/>And then you have Bullock. She's a poor enough actress, but she plays the sort of person who tells people to stand behind the yellow linewhen she's not a real bus driverand when there's a bomb on board. I wouldn't have been surprised if she'd asked to see everyone's tickets. But although I could defend her hard-line bus protocol stance (even in crisis situations, people need rules; otherwise chaos ensues), I can't defend her reaction to running a pram over. She takes her hands off the wheel and starts screaming. Bloody women. You're there driving a bus that needs to maintain an acceptable velocity and you endanger everyone's lives because a fat, little baby might have got squashed. Sorry, you're just going to have to pull your knickers up and live with it.<br/><br/>And of course, Keanu brings things down even further. Every time he opens his mouth you're waiting for the next mangled line delivery. And sure enough he chokes on his lines with great regularity. Plus it's almost impossible to buy him as a cop. It's not because he comes across as mentally defective  there are plenty of dumb cops  it's more that at any moment I expect him to suddenly run off and go surfing.<br/><br/>But actually, thinking about it, Reeves' worst acting is non-verbal. In the opening scenes with the lift, he has to spend a lot of time communicating thought. But the only way he knows how to do it is to chew gum and make lots of jerky bird-like head movements. That's Acting! <br/><br/>But one of the things I like about the film  and to be fair, I enjoy the film quite a bit, in the way that one enjoys dumb movies  is the way that Hopper's character is always mocking Reeves' intelligence. He's forever telling him he's dumb (""Do not attempt to grow a brain,"" he says at one point). But in Reeves' defence, even Hopper could be labelled stupid. I mean, why does he only install a camera in the bus and not a microphone, too? Of course, the explanation is banal  if he could hear what was going on, it would be impossible for Reeve's to fool him and get everyone off the vehicle, and therefore you wouldn't have a movie  but still, Reeves probably wasn't the only one who rode to school on the short bus.<br/><br/>But Hopper, more than the bomb on the bus, is what makes the film. He's just fun to watch. Sure he doesn't stretch himself and sure he repeats past performances (Blue Velvet and Apocalypse Now being the main two), but at least he grasps the absurdity of the film and doesn't take it too seriously. For example, on the train at the end, when his money gets marked, he shouts, ""I'm going to get you, Jack"" and then runs off screaming ""Aaaaaaahhhh!"" It's stupid and devoid of wit, but it never fails to bring a smile to my face. And I also love the bit when Hopper is watching television and he repeats the newscaster's line: ""The whim of a madman!"" Very amusing.<br/><br/>Almost as funny is a bit near the end. And it's actually, to my surprise, a Reeves moment (and the laugh is actually intentional). I'm talking about his one liner after Hopper gets decapitated. ""Where's Payne?"" ""He lost his head."" Aside from Reeves and Jeff Daniels sitting side by side in an orgasmic stupor after the elevator drop at the beginning, it's one of the few forays into 80s action (which I applaud it for). But unfortunately, after this, you have a horribly mushy ending. And then to accompany the cold water that's been poured in your pants you have to listen to Billy Idol sing all the words he could think of that rhyme with 'speed'. The horror. The horror."
"lee_eisenberg","7","0","2","24 April 2006"," sped up to actually having a plot
","If you look at ""Speed""'s plot, it sounds like any old ridiculous Hollywood movie: madman plants bomb on bus, cop has to stop bus from blowing up. Usually, I wouldn't even consider watching such a movie. However, Dennis Hopper as the terrorist carries the movie. His character Howard Payne is sort of a cross between his characters from ""Easy Rider"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", albeit totally evil. Keanu Reeves's character is one whom anyone could have played and it wouldn't be much different, although who else would say ""whoa"" like Reeves? And Sandra Bullock's character isn't bad.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an above average action flick. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but better than the usual Stallone or Schwarzenegger movie. Also starring Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels, Alan Ruck and Beth Grant.<br/><br/>And one more thing: avoid the sequel like you would the Ebola virus!"
"DaRick89","10","0","1","22 January 2006"," An action movie which never goes below 50 miles an hour
","Speed is an action movie which, like the bus affected, never lets up, always going at above 50 miles an hour. It is so fast-paced that mere minutes after receiving a medal, our hero Jack Traven is back in action, hopping on a bus with a bomb on it. This bus cannot go below 50 miles an hour otherwise it explodes, leading to one incredibly entertaining film. What this film does so well is grab your attention immediately, by having our villain stab a guy in the first minute or so of the film. In fact, I would go so far as to say that is one of the best action films I've seen in a long time and this is saying something considering that I only saw it last night and that I watch action films quite regularly. <br/><br/>The plot is simple without being stupid, as some action film's plots are. It revolves around LAPD man Jack Traven, an extortionist who wants revenge on Jack and other innocents after Jack foiled his 'elevator job' and Annie, a passenger-turned-bus driver on a bus who had her license revoked for, whatd'ya know, speeding. This movie, like the back of the DVD cover suggests, also has some unexpected, surprising twists, making it all the more entertaining, because we do not really know what will happen up to the final, intense showdown, which fluctuates between victory and defeat for Jack. This keeps us empty-handed and guessing. One twist occurs when, just when we least expect it, a bus explodes behind Jack.<br/><br/>The acting here is, on the whole, pretty good. Keanu Reeves has not always acted well, but he is pretty good as the intense, hardened cop Jack Traven. Sandra Bullock is not bad as Annie the panicky passenger, either. Dennis Hopper, however, is a revelation, playing the bad guy with a deranged maliciousness which makes us, as the audience, love to hate him. He always seems to act as the bad guy in movies and you can see why here.<br/><br/>The special effects and explosions, like in most good action movies, are awesome. The initial bus explosion is shocking, but the best one would be the airliner one, which ends up as a fireball into the sky.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great action movie which never goes below 50 miles an hour for a second. Not only that, it keeps us guessing as to what is going to happen at the end, making it a credible thriller as well. If you are into action films like me and haven't seen this, see it now. You'll be in 'for a wild, crazy ride'.<br/><br/>5/5 stars"
"PWNYCNY","7","0","1","10 October 2005"," Can a city bus actually go 50 mph without falling apart?
","Okay, the story is exciting, the acting is excellent, and it's definitely one of the better action movies, but ... BUT ... asking the audience to believe that a city bus can sustain a speed of 50 mph nonstop for one and half hours in the middle of a city without breaking down stretches the bounds of credulity. Maybe a Mazda, maybe a Porsche, maybe even a Greyhound or Short Line bus, or maybe even your standard commuter bus could have functioned intact, but an inner city bus? NO WAY!! It's enough that these buses work at all, much less that they could go 50 mph without breaking down within five minutes (okay let's make it ten minutes). It would have been more realistic if the bus was required to maintain a constant speed of, let's say, 20 mph. Now that would been far more believable and realistic. But when that bus does its flying act, like the General Lee flying through the air in the ""Dukes of Hazard"" or Burt Reynolds and Sally Fields doing the same in ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" that's when I knew that this movie had moved into the realm of science fiction. It would have been more believable to have had the bus launched into orbit around the earth, or to the moon."
"666Night999","10","0","2","2 October 2005"," Best Action Movie from the 90s, besides Terminator 2
","The plot is pretty easy to comprehend. A bus is carrying a bomb that will detonate if the bus reduces its speed to less than 50mph after it triggers the device by first reaching 50mph. A cop, Reeves, and a passenger, played by Sandra Bullock, in a breakout role, must thwart the criminal's scheme by trying to save the lives on board the bus, and somehow catch the villain in the process. The action never lets up, as we are quickly thrust into a terrorist threat right at the beginning of the movie, which is a preamble of things to come. Dennis Hopper plays a very intelligent and conniving bad guy. This is a true action movie. All cylinders are in full gear on this one. Great action, great villain, great characters, great plot. <br/><br/>I only wish De Bont, the director, would make something as good as this movie again. Sadly, he has faltered ever since. Not all of his movies after this 1994 masterpiece are terrible or bad, but he is just missing something, maybe plausibility. All in all, even if you aren't a big Keanu Reeves fan, this is a breathtaking, adrenaline racing, awesome action movie. It really packs a punch and it is plausible. You may think that sounds silly to say, but everything that happens could actually happen. And I'm not a big Reeves fan myself, though I certainly respected his choice to make this movie. As for Bullock, this movie allowed her to breakout into bigger movies, mostly romantic comedies, and some darker material. Most recently she starred in CRASH, and she'll soon reteam with Reeves in an American version of a foreign movie, IL MARE, now titled THE LAKE HOUSE."

"Barky44","10","0","1","30 July 2005"," A Lesson in Making Excellent Action Movies
","Speed is an excellent action movie. This is how action movies should be made. All producers of schlock ranging from Armageddon to National Treasure need to take a good, hard look at this film and learn something from it.<br/><br/>The storyline from Speed is incredibly simple: madman threatens to blow things up if ransom isn't paid; law enforcement hero & co-workers try to stop him; innocent people in the mix throw in a wild card. The storyline is very simple and very linear and has virtually no complexity. And that is exactly what films like this require. They are action films, don't try to get all fancy with complicated plot lines. The audience wants to see stuff blow up, just get to it.<br/><br/>The plot line is also believable. Sure, some of Speed's setups are pretty complicated (the elevator trick seems like an awful lot of work for a simple ransom gig). But overall it's written with great plausibility. The story has to be simple, but it also has to be believable, otherwise the audience is too busy laughing at the ludicrousness of it all to really get into the excitement of the film.<br/><br/>The writing has to be crisp and to the point. There's not a lot of chatter in this film. This is an action movie, so dialogue is supposed to be short and sweet. No long discussions in a command center about what to do next, just think on your feet, bark orders out, make those snap decisions, and save all the small talk until later. Nothing ruins the pacing of an action film like laborious strategy discussions.<br/><br/>The stunts have to be believable. Fans don't mind spectacular stunts, heck that's why we go to these movies! But the stunts can't be completely outrageous. Yes, the bus jump in Speed is outrageous, but the rest of the stuff is entirely plausible, and you can forgive one off-the-wall stunt. But most of Arnold's or Steven Segal's crap is so full of impossible stunts and crashes, they play like multi-million dollar episodes of CHiPS, where every highway crash involves cars doing cartwheels in the air...<br/><br/>The actors have to be genuine. The best part of Keanu & Sandra's performances in Speed is they really play it with a high degree of believability. Keanu looks and acts like a hard-driven cop, too serious for his own good. Contrast that with his completely unbelievable performance as an undercover FBI agent in Point Break (a truly horrible movie). And Sandra plays it straight as a wise-ass woman who lost her license. She's not just a screaming bimbo but she also has a heart (as seen in the baby carriage scene). And the best part of these two stars? This film is not created as a star vehicle just for them, something you can't say of Nicholas Cage or Van Damme flicks.<br/><br/>The action carries through the whole film. Some films (Bond films like to do this) have action then dialogue then action then love scenes then action then something else. If you're going to make an action flick then devise a way to have action through the whole thing. This film does just that, and without making it boring, either. Just when you think it can't get any worse for Our Heroes it does indeed, and that's good film-making.<br/><br/>Other elements in this film are top-notch as well. The music is the perfect accompaniment to the story. The cinematography is not at all claustrophobic even though most of the action takes place on a bus. The special effects are seamless with the live action. The supporting cast is quite good as well (with the exception of Alan Ruck as the neurotic tourist, but that's really a bad part, not Alan's fault).<br/><br/>All in all Speed is an example of how to make a contemporary action film.<br/><br/>10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Barky"

At that time I have seen lot of action movies that fascinated me, excited me but this movie stands alone from them for its unique transversal versatility.<br/><br/>Speed (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>After the box-office disaster of Arnold's ""Last Action Hero"" major studios were thinking Hollywood Action Movie Era has ended, making Paramount pictures to switch off from the 'Bomb Squad Action Thriller'.

He got tight script, good studio, great crew and fine actors for his cinematic experience.

In his second chance Howard tantalize Traven by telling the next attack was targeted on a bus, and the bomb will set when it speeds greater than 50 mph. What will he do next, will he track down the mad bomber or does he save the civilians? <br/><br/>Written by Graham Yost, enhanced by Joss Whedon, tells the exciting paced venture thriller. The screenplay was well written, strong and fixed, the director just gave the perfect visualization for story.<br/><br/>All credits goes to the production team, from the principal photography team under Andrzej Bartkowiak to the editing works of John Wright, everything was perfect for this movie experience. Plus the soul of the movie, the music created by Mark Mancina and John Van Tongeren was masterful for this chapter. Without Mancina's theme I don't think the movie could have been that successful, it was so punching, pulse pounding. And the actors, Keanu Reeves-the real life 'Neo', he showed his first matured manly portrayal in this movie, and Sandra Bullock relay smooths this intense film with her presence. And also Joe Morton, how can I miss him, it was one of his greatest roles after T2: Judgment day's 'Miles Dyson'. The major miss was from Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, one was misused and other was wasted respectively.<br/><br/>All in all it's a wonderful extreme movie that an action loving male like me must not miss.<br/><br/>Speed = The Deep."

Dennis Hopper gives a above average portrayal of the terrorist while Keanu Reeves falls flat on his face trying to act.Sandra Bullock gives a fine performance, there didn't seem yo be a lot of personality to her character though.<br/><br/>The story is very unique and original which is nice to see in this time of sequels and remakes. The characters on the bus aren't very well thought out and leave much to be desired. The special effects are very intriguing and so are the many action scenes. Overall this film isn't going to be known later but it's worth to watch."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","15 December 2004"," The movie that put Reeves and Bullock on viewers' radar.
","When ""Speed"" hit the theaters in 1994, Keanu Reeves was 30 and already had around 20 movies to his credit, but those of us who knew him at all, probably knew him for his two ""Bill and Ted"" roles. Hardly a resume' that would lead to the roles that followed, especially the landmark role of 'Neo' in the Matrix movies. Similarly, Sandra Bullock was also 30, had about 12 to 15 movies to her credit, but 'Love Potion No. 9' from 1992 was arguably her best. As we now know, she has gone on to a very successful acting career, and came to her senses a few years ago, moving to the Austin, Texas area. One of her most fun to watch movies, 'Hope Floats' with Harry Connick, Jr., was shot in little Smithville, a town I know well, and where my friend 'Will' lives. 'Speed' was a very successful movie for Reeves and Bullock, mainly because nothing like it came before, and it has a story line which holds your interest. Not a great movie, but always a fun one to watch again.<br/><br/>Some SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading, OK. Reeves is one of the good guys here, playing Officer Jack Traven, and his nemesis turns out to be Dennis Hopper in a great role as Howard Payne. Payne booby traps a bus, such that once it gets going, explosives will go off, killing all aboard, if the speed drops below 55 miles per hour. Sandra Bullock plays Annie Porter, one of the passengers. To save everyone, Traven must jump aboard the bus, take control of the bus, helped by Porter, and get everyone off before the bus explodes. This creates many exciting 'chase scenes' on the freeways and through the streets. Traven prevails, Porter and he become romantically linked. Cute movie."

"barnabyrudge","Null","0","2","5 January 2004"," On the whole, a terrific actioner, but slightly let down by the final fifteen minutes.
","Speed is one of the only action movies I can think of in which the phrase ""all-action"" is completely accurate. There is only one scene in this entire film which isn't an action scene, and that comes near the start when Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels are seen at a party celebrating the receipt of a bravery award. Other than that, every moment is taken up by some kind of outrageous stunt, electrifying exchange, or hair-raising chase.<br/><br/> The story is very simple, but very exciting. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an L.A. bomb disposal maverick, thwarts an attempt by a mad bomber to get his hands on a multi-million dollar ransom by threatening to kill an elevator full of people. The bomber (Dennis Hopper) is quite annoyed to have his scheme quashed, so he sets up a new threat, He plants a bomb on an L.A. bus. When the bus reaches 50 m.p.h the bomb becomes active, but the moment its speed falls below 50 m.p.h from then on the bomb will detonate. Jack boards the bus and tries to keep it going at the necessary speed, aided by gutsy lady passenger Annie (Sandra bullock), but it's some challenge amid the chaotic morning traffic of downtown L.A.<br/><br/> The film uses its simple premise to wonderful effect. There's nothing complicated or confusing about this.... if the bus slows down too much, the ride is over. The very concept of keeping the vehicle going so fast for so long in such a clogged traffic environment gives plenty of moments of excitement. Reeves actually gives one of the first really good performances of his career, and is ably backed up by the wacky Hopper, the appealing Bullock and the likable Daniels. The film isn't perfect. The final fifteen or twenty minutes takes place off the bus and seems a rather superfluous sequence. I feel the film would have been far better if it had ended on the bus, but there's a somewhat absurd episode aboard an underground train which feels like it was originally conceived for another movie but somehow made it into this one. Still, I'm willing to forgive the film this one minor mis-step, because until that point it was right up there with the greatest films in its genre of all-time."

","This may not be a Frank Capra biggie, and perhaps the plot was silly, as some comments suggested * BUT *: Hopper's villain, oops, I mean ""antagonist"", satisfies two critical requirements  for this movie: 1) His character is arrogant and appears unstoppable and 2) His tantrum when the jig is up or when he's been outsmarted is in direct proportion to how nasty he was - (the 'my kingdom for a horse' factor).<br/><br/>I don't care if a movie has a title like ""Son of Porkie's VIII meets bride of Beach Blanket Bimbos III"", if the movie has some great lines.

","""Speed"" represents Hollywood at its most commercially desperate and cheap: take a ""Die Hard""-like set up of a story taking place in primarily one location; put some heartthrob (though I'll be damned if Keanu ever acts like a man) as the star cop; throw in some over-the-top supporting characters; bring in some cartoonish action scenes; and end it with a kiss. And even a story this lame and simple is not done without a ridiculous amount of goofs--for example, about ten times that bus would've blown. By the ""Basic Instinct"" part of the summary, I am referring to the obviously deliberate, brief shot of the second woman to be pulled out of the elevator, in which her skirt is lifted up, revealing her bare buttocks clad in thong underwear. It is flagrantly obvious that in this shot Keanu and Jeff were told to lift this rather pretty woman's skirt up, which the upward camera angle (used only in this shot) proves. This was done either to appeal to male viewers or for Jan de Bont, who was fresh off of directing ""Basic Instinct"", to fulfill some of his own fantasies. Either way, it's immature, and I'm surprised no one else seems to have noticed this."

","It moves along faster than a speeding bullet, rarely slowing to take a breath, or for that matter, to develop its characters. How nice to see a pumped-up Keanu Reeves in a contemporary part once again. We've patiently endured his attempts at Shakespeare, his now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't British accent in Victorian-set Dracula, and his quirky surfer-esque Ted Theodore Logan from Bill and Ted fame. <br/><br/>In Speed, he has only to speak the simplest of lines while jumping from speeding cars to speeding buses, evacuating bomb-rigged elevators and climbing atop a whizzing subway train. Mr. Reeves does all of the above with surprising style, in what unbeknownst to him, would be his audition for a little film titled The Matrix. <br/><br/>Our unexpected action hero plays Jack Traven, a member of the LAPD SWAT squad. Jack has his hands full with Howard Payne, a disgruntled former-cop-turned-mad-bomber. As the demented blast-happy Payne, they cast Dennis Hopper. Now that's a stretch. Villainous Hopper does everything but twirl a mustache and tie the heroine to the tracks as he plants explosives from Santa Monica to LAX for revenge and reward. <br/><br/>Most of the movie takes place on a city bus that has been rigged to explode if it slows to less than 50 mph Now, really! When was the last time you were able to travel at 50 mph-plus for any length of time in Los Angeles traffic? On public transportation? Needless to say, Speed has some gaping lapses in logic plenty big enough to drive a bus through, but it does deliver on the mechanical, visceral thrills and on the quotient of daredevil stunts per minute. Sandra Bullock, Keanu's love interest, gets off some snappy one-liners, though the scriptwriters have not bothered to provide her with a character. She spends most of the movie driving that huge bomb of a bus around in circles, through traffic jams and over chasms in the freeway. We do learn that her driver's license has been suspended for speeding, but otherwise no mention is made of her life, though one would guess that she spends a lot of time at the gym."

","Like most people, I thought this was a great action movie when it was first released; but 6 or 7 years on, seeing it for a second time on TV, I am not so sure. I found myself questioning all the flaws and absurdities in the plot - not because there were more of these than in any other action film, but because at times, despite the surface activity, there was little to grip my attention.    <br/><br/>To me, one of the major mistakes in the film was to keep Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) driving the bus for so long. Not only was this ridiculous in terms of the plot as it stands - surely hero Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) or another man should have taken over the wheel at least for a spell - but it also prevented Bullock from doing any real acting or providing much love interest.<br/><br/>I think the underlying problem is a common one - the director, Jan de Bont, relied on action and plot to carry his movie, and forgot almost entirely about character. We learn next to nothing about Traven's or Porter's personal histories, and almost everyone else is a cardboard cut-out; except of course for the one character we get to know (and perhaps even care) about most - the villain, Howard Payne, played in typical OTT manner by Dennis Hopper. <br/><br/>All in all, I would have preferred to trade in a little speed for a some depth."

","An excellent (though simplistic) set of opening credits kick start this fast-paced action flick directed by ex-cinematographer Jan DeBont.<br/><br/>	Speed is possibly the best action movie of the decade, at least of 1994, followed by a disappointing sequel. The film opens with LAPD cops Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) attempting to save several hostages trapped in an elevator ringed with explosives. A money obsessed madman (Dennis Hopper) set it up, and demands $3.5 million dollars or he will blow the elevator and kill the hostages, so it's up to Jack and Harry to stop him. Of course they kill the madman (or at least they think they do), and the film is over on a happy note.<br/><br/>	Well, that would be rather disappointing, wouldn't it. The next day an empty bus blows up right in front of unsuspecting Jack, and the pay phone next to him starts ringing. It's the madman, telling Jack that he has planted a bomb on a bus, that is set when the bus goes over fifty. From there on it's a rush of thrills and suspense as the bus weaves around Los Angeles, no one able to get off.<br/><br/>	That little summary probably makes the film sound terrible, but don't let that discourage you from seeing it if you haven't already. Mark Mancini's music score helps create the perfect mood, and the film has a strange sense of openness (for lack of a better word). Almost every shot shows blue sky in the background, a quality rarely seen in any movie.<br/><br/>	The movie is funny, never taking itself too seriously, not the least bit claustrophobic, and a lot more fun to watch than almost any other movie in a long, long time.<br/><br/>	For the most part the acting is good. The cast is littered with distinguished actors, most notably Alan Ruck, Jeff Daniels, and Joe Morton (The Astronaut's Wife). Bullock is given a star making role, and Hopper is given a chance to recusitate his sinking career (if you don't believe me about that, just watch the tepid 'Nails'). There is a lot of controversy regarding Keanu Reeve's acting skills, and, though there's no doubt he's not very talented, he's perfectly cast here and does his best to further the movie into a memorable classic."

Actually, this one is no exception. However, I, in my opinion, like its beauty of simplicity very much. It just gives the viewers more room for experiencing the exciting mood without being busy in understanding all the complicated things or details which may , in certain extent, help the story to be appeared more logical and smooth.<br/><br/>I hadn't expected that this film was so tense that there was no one climax, which is usually supposed to be shown at the end of the film,  but it put you in all time excitement right from the  start. The trapping in the elevator,  the sequences of challenges faced in the bus (such as the murderer in the bus, the wound of the bus driver, the appearance of the baby cart in the road, the cliff that they've to across, the danger in running out petrol in bus..etc), and finally the fighting in the train are all qualified as a high tidal wave in the film in my point of view.<br/><br/>Besides all these, the music is really surprisingly outstanding.

","Speed is a great film, right from the start.  The action never lets up, at all.  The explosion with the bus and the freight plane is fantastic. Dennis Hopper makes for a great villain.  Keanu Reeves is great, and so is Sandra Bullock.  She actually adds something to the movie, unlike in Speed 2.  Jeff Daniels adds a good supporting role, too.  Pick this movie up, it will leave you satisfied."
"zdx","10","0","1","17 March 1999"," A really special action movie.One for the history books!
","This is one of the most special movies ever made. What makes it so special, is that there is nothing telling us that something is about to happen, it just does. People talk calmly with each other, and then BOOM! And you sit there about as surprised as the characters in the movie. You get the feeling ""This could happen to me!"" It's so close to reality."

","speed is awesome! very good movie. never lets up. but it doesn't really go over the limit to be a nonstop entertainment movie. i mean it stops at a 3 star rating for me.i give it *** out of ****"
"Steve-331","Null","0","1","22 February 1999"," A non stop ride of action
","This movie was really awesome and it had lots of action. Some of the stunts were far fetched. Like when the bus made that big jump. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock work great together. It's too bad that that they would not reunite in the 2nd Speed"
"si-11","Null","0","1","19 February 1999"," Keanu at his best
","I've watched this film 26 times and I never get tired of it! It's an action movie like I never saw before. You seem to be inside that bus all the time, just getting nervous as the passengers and what can I say about Keanu Reeves...Of course he was perfectly chosen for this role and he plays it very well.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must see it because it's a real ""action action"" movie."
"Agent10","7","0","5","2 May 2002"," A film for all people from Tucson to see!
","Bad one-liners, stupid characters, a crackpot bad-guy, Keanu Reeves, a paper thin plot, a ridiculous bridge jump scene.........WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! Sometimes, the ridiculousness of film outweighs the brilliance, and Speed proves such a theory. The entire movie was hillarious. How the heck could one take this film seriously! Granted, the action was great and everything, but it just felt like some bad, live-action japanimation cartoon on crack. Read the memorable quotes section on this page, and you'll instantly understand the profound idiocy placed into this film. Also, for any person from Tucson, this is a must see. (there's a bunch of University of Arizona references, mostly hillarious)"
"Special-K88","Null","0","1","25 April 2002"," leaves you breathless! one of the best action films of the decade
","Swift, intelligent, pulse-pounding action movie about a Los Angeles SWAT team officer (Reeves) given the task of a lifetime when he inadvertently finds himself at the whim of a madman (Hopper) who decides to play a deadly cat-and-mouse game by planting explosives on a transit city bus and rigging them to explode if the bus drops below fifty miles per hour. The result is an energetic, unforgettable rush of adrenaline across the city of L.A., with pumped-up action scenes, breathtaking visual effects and stunts, sly humor, and a gripping test of will and determination as the stakes change on a regular basis. A good, solid action experience, and a model for years to come. ***½"
"jamyskis","8","0","1","22 March 2002"," Who needs complex plots?
","As an action film, Speed is practically faultless.  Down to the precarious ""Oh, @$£!"" style cliffhangers to the suspenseful climax, Speed keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through.  The very nature (and at the time, quite original too) of the plot means that there is never a dull moment.  That bus is always moving at 50MPH and you're constantly left guessing as to what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>Reeves, as usual, plays his role with something of a lack of distinction, but unlike some of his roles (e.g. Dracula) he plays it with the gung-ho style that suits him.  Hopper in the role of Payne makes a superb baddie, both with his edgy laugh and playful but sinister moods, both portrayed beautifully.<br/><br/>Overall, Speed is a film which will keep you going again and again, and, like Reeves' other hit, the Matrix, will keep you coming back again and again for the stunts alone."
"emm","9","0","1","24 January 1999"," Sit down and enjoy the cinematic bus ride, or take the taxi!
","There are three ways to describe this virtually nonstop action experience: it's a ""brake""-through, a break-""through"", and yes, a ""BREAKTHROUGH"". Never before my bleeding eyes has there been a movie so exciting, and yet, so suspenseful and pulse-pounding that it blows all the other ""me-too"" action movies out of the water as fast as you can say ""Roadkill!""! The opening is incredible enough to feel that you can't take any more high intensity, and that's only warming up. Among the breakthroughs is Sandra Bullock, for whom this movie confirms her now-classic signature role as ""Annie"", taking over the driver's seat and SPEEDing along. If it sounds like just another runaway bus, then you're missing everything else! The high-powered plot is hands down, the most well-conceived idea that it can be derived from past ""disaster"" films of the 70s. A simple bomb threat creates a widespread panic for all of us sitting around eating popcorn and drinking Coke. Only one thing could be wrong: the action usually stays in the same place while plenty of it is moving in all sorts of frenzy directions. Action lovers need not to look any further, because SPEED is one of the best films in the genre, and approved by my highest possible recommendation."
"Will-58","9","0","1","31 December 1998"," Action at its best
","The best action movie I have ever seen. It was good from beginning to end. Not much of a story, but the story is not the major feature of an action movie. And what makes this movie even better is Jan De Bont's direction. This is one of the few gifted directors who understand the art of making a great action movie (others include: John Woo, Tony Scott, John Mctiernan and Wolfagng Petersen)."
