"tfrizzell","Null","132","158","3 July 2002"," The Denzel Washington Show.
","A stunning performance by Denzel Washington (Oscar-nominated) carries this film literally into cinematic excellence. He stars as the titled character, the controversial Black Nationalist Leader who is easily one of the most interesting people who lived during the 20th Century. Spike Lee's uncompromising direction focuses on X's life. From his very early childhood to his violent death, the audience is given lots and lots information on the character as the film runs about 195 minutes. A good supporting cast helps, but this is Washington's show from the very start. His performance is very dominant and this is easily one of the best jobs that was never honored with an Academy Award. Brilliant biopic. 5 stars out of 5."
"awhyte2323","10","87","112","19 April 2005"," Excellent and interesting
","I was only familiar with the history and influence of Malcolm X before I saw the film so I can't really judge it's faithfulness or accuracy. But as a film, I thought it was great. I really like Spike Lee; he keeps things fast-paced and interesting with his camera angles and colours/lighting. For awhile after Malcolm first begins his activism with the nation of Islam, you find yourself conflicted, both respecting the man and often disagreeing with him. Lee handles it well without condemning or supporting really, just showing Malcolm's gradual transition in his beliefs. The inserted documentary footage, especially at the end, shows how Malcolm's words still relate today. Someone commented that they only watched an hour of the movie and Lee doesn't know how to tell a story but maybe if they would be slightly more open-minded, realize it's not a literal adaptation of the autobiography, and actually finish the film, they could understand that Lee does not just want to tell the story of one man but rather wants it to reflect the struggle of a race. I really enjoyed the film; it was long but never slow and definitely worth watching."
"Hermit C-2","10","103","137","19 June 1999"," Epic film does justice to its subject.
","Spike Lee struggled mightily to get 'Malcolm X' made, financially and artistically. But when all was said and done, he produced an epic blockbuster and a definite treatment of the man's life.<br/><br/>There's great differences between the two as well, but to me Lee has many things in common with Oliver Stone. Both of them seem to have been born to make films. Both of them are uncompromising in bringing their artistic (and moral) vision to the screen, and neither will try to seduce the public by catering to their tastes. Both present their own interpretation of facts without apology. (For example, from what I've read it's not certain that Malcolm's father was actually killed by Klansmen. But Lee isn't in the same league as Stone when it comes to playing fast and loose with the ""truth."") Stone even ends his movie 'Nixon' in a similar way to 'Malcolm X,' with footage of real-life figures blended in, though I'm not accusing Stone of imitation.<br/><br/>This movie has an epic sweep and scope and as a director Lee is up to the challenge. He is served well by being able to direct in several styles, one of which is almost cartoonish: witness the scene where Malcolm (Denzel Washington) and Shorty (played by Lee himself) go stepping out at the Roseland Ballroom, resplendent in their zoot suits. Some comic relief is welcome at times because otherwise the serious, heavy message of the picture might be overwhelming. For instance, the movie opens with a full-screen shot of an American flag while we hear a voice-over of one of Malcolm's most rousing, or inflammatory speeches, depending on how you look at it (""I accuse the white man of being the greatest murderer on the planet!"") The flag begins to burn and eventually forms a flaming 'X' as the fiery rhetoric continues. But if you haven't been scared away, the next scene shows the young man Malcolm Little in a funny situation, having his hair straightened by a concoction that threatens to burn off his scalp.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington has won beaucoups of rightly-deserved accolades for his amazing performance in the title role. If you've ever heard or seen Malcolm X's speaking, you will be astounded at the similarities in tone and cadence. The illusion is so real one may not recognize that real archival footage of Malcolm is used late in the film. But this is not a case of style over substance here. Between Washington's talent and Lee's directing and screenwriting, an unforgettable character emerges. The film boasts other fine performances by Al Freeman, Jr. (especially good as Elijah Muhammad, a controversial figure in society, and eventually to Malcolm himself), Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Kate Vernon, Ernest Thomas and many others in its large cast.<br/><br/>It's clear that Lee doesn't care for the Motion Picture Academy and they don't particularly care for him. But the snubbing he and his picture got at Oscar time would be comparable to Richard Attenborough and 'Ghandi' not being nominated the year that film was made. Ordinarily, one would think this film is the kind of production Hollywood loves to honor. But Academy Award nominations or not, the film 'Malcolm X' is like the man himself: impossible to ignore."

","This was a stirring tribute of a film that to this day still stands the test of time even after its release more than a decade ago. This was in fact a autobiography and educational film which some of the most electrifying performance ever displayed on film,and it is the reason to see why. This was Denzel Washington's finest piece of work and most notably the best of his career in which he should have been nominated for Best Actor Oscar category,instead of his work which he won the Best Actor statue for 2001's ""Training Day"". Anyway,""Malcolm X"",was a brilliant tribute to the controversial black activist,a leader in the struggle for black liberation as well as black pride and one of the most outspoken individuals who had a different side of the civil rights movement where a time when America was at war with itself.<br/><br/>Based on the best-selling autobiography by Malcolm X and Alex Haley,and with spellbinding direction by Spike Lee,it traces the story of Malcolm himself,from his days as a hustler and drug runner and hitting rock bottom during his imprisonment in the 1950's,he became a Black Muslim and then a leader in the Nation Of Islam under the guidance of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. His assassination in 1965 left a legacy of black nationalism,self-determination and racial pride that continues to the day and within a new generation whom for the first time has witnessed a masterpiece of cimematic work. This is marked by strong performances throughout with powerful direction by Spike Lee,cimematopgrapher Ernest Dickerson,and riveting breathtaking performances by Denzel Washington,Angela Bassett,and most notably from Al Freeman,Jr. as Elijah Muhammad. The real centerpiece of the film is from Denzel Washington himself,whose convincing performance in the title role brings this film alive. When this film came out,it only receive one Oscar nomination but however,the film garnered a lot of  awards including the NAACP Image Film Award,The New York Film Critics Award for Best Actor,The Los Angeles Times Film Award for Best Director and Best Actor,and MTV Movie Awards for both Denzel Washington and Al Freeman,Jr.--all of this happened in 1992,when the film came out.<br/><br/>As far as the cameos go,this film had a lot of them in one picture including Black Panther Bobby Seale,Reverend Al Sharpton,The Honorable Nelson Mandela,Reverend Jesse Jackson,along with Hollywood walk-ons: Christopher Plummer,Karen Allen,Peter Boyle and Danny Glover,and Whoopi Goldberg.<br/><br/>Brilliant!-Five Stars"

","This film was absolutely brilliant. Spike Lee is a genius. We're studying him in my film class and a lot of his works are controversial, but I think they're necessary. Malcolm X was beautifully acted by Denzel. He took Malcolm's mannerisms and passion into himself and carved this wonderful character. The film traced him from a young kid to his Nat'list days to his death. His beliefs were different, but he never compromised himself. Considering where he came from and the time he grew up in, no one can really yell and scream about why he was the way he was. So many want to glorify King as the only leader of the time, but X was a leader in his own right. His ideas weren't that different from King's. His approach was honest and a response to the times. Denzel shows every emotion in his face that seemed to formulate in his mind. I seriously thought of him as Malcolm. He really had to earn people's respect from the background he came from and I liked that. Nothing was glossed over and no stone left unturned. Malcolm X is a great film and worth the watch!"
"bbraat","8","57","86","21 February 2006"," Great but needed a better editor
","A great movie if overlong and slightly unfocused.<br/><br/>Washington carried the film with a great performance worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win which might have been guaranteed had the director managed to focus.<br/><br/>Spike Lee did a good job as director which is saying a lot, given the historical scope, danger of offense, and controversy of the project. His one weak area in this film was editing. There is no reason this movie couldn't have been half an hour shorter. Right off the bat, there were unnecessarily lingering camera shots and scenes that could have omitted. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking of Spike himself sliding under a woman's skirt and mugging the camera. That scene not only failed to further the story but instead made the audience stand up and say, ""Hey, that's Spike looking at us!"" Lee's biggest editing mistake was based on his desire to tell the story of Malcolm X AND tell the story of the African-American experience. That's more than enough for several movies so why cram it all under one title? After a clear scene illustrating X's life, Lee would move to a large dance hall to illustrate the richness of the African-American experience. A quick shot of the dance hall would have been sufficient. Instead the far away shots were maintained for too long and when the focus moved back to specific characters it moved to the character played by Lee himself. Why? I don't know. It certainly didn't help us to understand X any better. The ending with children saying ""I am Malcolm X"" also went on too long and should have been part of a separate feature. The cameos were distracting. The movie could have been tighter, shorter, and better except that Spike Lee wanted to put everything, including the kitchen sink, into it.<br/><br/>That being said, it is a great movie and I'm glad I invested the three and a half hours to watch it."
"safwanrulez","9","49","79","3 August 2005"," The Truth seeker
","I think the major success of Alex Haley with this movie is that he tells the story of a dynamic person known as 'Malcolm X' with such a skill that no man from any part of any society get his feelings hurt. I think it is a commendable effort from Alex Haley, Spike Lee and Danzel Washington that they made a hero out of Malcolm X. I think he deserved it because he was the man who was not after money or popularity......he changed his statements, his way of life , even his faith as he knew that those were true. The theme of the movie is very clear that Malcolm X was not a hardliner rather he was always open for truth. Secondly, it also emphasized though in the end that negotiations and reforms is a better way than the violence. But yet it also gave the message that the ruling races reap the violence which they breed themselves; sometimes in the hegemony of their power or sometimes due the wrong interpretation of their religious verdicts. I think it was right to hit at the ' Black organization known as nation of Islam' and Elijah Muhammad. Muslim community is itself greatly indebted to this movie because Elijah Muhammad's teaching were very far from Islam. The real Islam practiced worldwide does not believe in the continuance of prophet-hood after Muhammad (P.B.U.H)and the Black supremacy by Elijah Muhammad was a ridiculous idea as Islam does not believe in Nationalism. Any Muslim anywhere in the world whether black or white are equal in Islam's teachings. It was great to see the scenes of pilgrimage to Makkah ....... these were not unnecessary ......because they helped us to understand the sudden change in the teachings of Malcolm X. Denzel's acting is really superb and also that of Al Freeman Jr. I think this movie is an invaluable resource for the people who want to take an insight into the Malcolm X's life."
"lee_eisenberg","10","47","78","26 October 2005"," Spike Lee's best movie ever
","Reaching his apex of greatness, Spike Lee created a perfect biography of the Black Nationalist leader. In the title role, Denzel Washington literally becomes the character. From the opening, when he accurately accuses the white man of all the injustices that the white man has perpetrated, to his conversion to Islam (and rejection of his slave surname), to his eventual assassination, the movie is top-notch in every respect.<br/><br/>Having read Malcolm X's autobiography, I can affirm that the movie followed it very closely. Reading his autobiography will actually help you understand him even further. As will his indication that African-Americans bled for the white man in Korea, Japan, Italy, etc., so why shouldn't they bleed for their freedom at home? Anyway, ""Malcolm X"" is a perfect movie in every way."
"itamarscomix","8","32","56","12 October 2005"," An important film
","Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career. This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.<br/><br/>So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before  it does, after all, span 200 minutes  and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic, and for that matter, in any docu-drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.<br/><br/>Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself  but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's protégé gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut-wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.<br/><br/>Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it. More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie  and it is - Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch."

","Malcolm X is one of the most influential, positive, and empowering movies I've ever watched. I knew little of Malcolm X before watching this film. Now, I've seen it a total of 10 times. I've also downloaded and read many of Malcolm's greatest speeches, "" Ballot or the Bullet"" is an example of one. As is visible, this movie has touched me in many ways. Denzel Washington's performance of the ex-Muslim leader is amazing. The only thing more amazing is the fact that he lost out in the Oscar race to Pacino, who portrayed a less important figure, by far. Angela Bassett, a beautiful black actress, plays his wife, Betty Shabazz, in a magnificent role. Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Al Freeman Jr., Theresa Randle, and Spike Lee himself all play great roles in the movie. Spike Lee was right. I found this movie to be more informative than two six hour days of any school, grade school, middle school, high school, and/or above."

"lanea-2","2","47","98","14 July 2006"," Myths
","I have been working on a book for some time now titled ""The Deification of the American Niggah: Whole Lotta Lies Don' Make No Truth"". The thesis is of the book is that the severe bigotry and injustice experienced by Negroes in America has been replaced by an equally inaccurate and unjust expectation of perfection. There is an attempt to correct the errors of slavery, prejudice and brutal discrimination by recreating reality in an equally tragically inaccurate set of expectations. Blacks have been miraculously transformed from ignorant, vile, sub-humans to noble, perfect, superior beings that have been unjustly suppressed for reasons of racist ambitions, greed, envy, etc. Neither of these depictions is accurate and both misconceptions degrade the social and economic ascendance that is the answer to the issues of black society.<br/><br/>This film and its writers, producers, directors, critics, etc. are an example of the extremes to which myth has attempted to transplant error. The protagonist is depicted as a humble, gifted, noble and superior hero who conquered white oppression through ""self-enlightenment"". In reality, Malcolm Little was a felon, a convict and a miscreant who sought advancement through narcotics, prostitution and illegal gambling. His ""enlightenment"" through the spiritual experience of the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims) was depicted in his statement about President Kennedy's assassination ""the chickens would come home to roost."" Malcolm's association with the Black Muslims ended in his own brutal assassination by other peaceful, enlightened members of the Nation of Islam.<br/><br/>But Spike Lee directed this movie as a tribute to a hero who transcended racism though enlightenment and moral superiority. This is a terrible film not only because of its betrayal of reality but because it perpetuates the myths that are as evil as the bigotry and persecution that it assaults. There are no mythical heroes just as there are no sub-humans among the black races. Miraculous transformation of history does no more to elevate society than prejudice does. Greater lies cannot correct other lies.<br/><br/>Richard Pryor made the best statement on reality I have ever heard. Its majesty lies in its simplicity and accuracy. On a trip to Africa he attended a large community celebration of ethnic music, dancing, revelry, etc. As he sat among the hundreds of revelers he thought to himself, ""Now look around you. Do you see any Niggahs here?"" He answered to himself, ""No, there aren't any. There never were any. Just people. That's all there ever were."" In the same way, if the filmmakers as well as the multitudes of activists who advocate societal betterment would just see that all they have to deal with are people, the issues could begin to be resolved. Fantasies like this movie only prolong the hatred and incomprehension."
"Karl Self","4","32","66","21 December 2008"," Malcolm Big
","There's two ways to look at this movie: as an entertaining evening filler, a roller-coaster of a movie, it's very successful -- strange, and no mean feat, for a biopic about a radical black leader from yesteryear. As a biography however, which is supposed to tell you the truth about a person, I think it's simply a piece of blatant propaganda. I see it as a lost chance to do the man Malcolm X Little justice, and also to show up the critical aspects of his persona.<br/><br/>The acting is great, I particularly enjoyed Angela Bassett as Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz, as well as director Spike Lee playing Malcolm's zoot era friend, the wily Shorty. Overall this movie is well made, as can be expected of a great director such as Spike Lee.<br/><br/>OK, let's focus on content, then. Malcolm X wasn't Martin Luther King, but this movie portrays him like he had been King's ghetto version. In his autobiography, Malcolm X describes himself as having started as a street thug, although one who was driven to this life by racism, who was transformed in prison to a black minister and leader. An alternative but possibly more enlightened way to describe his career would be that he took up the same profession as his father, that of a black separatist minister (his father had followed Marcus Garvey, Malcolm followed Elijah Muhammad instead).<br/><br/>Another fact that the movie didn't bring out is that the Nation Of Islam are no Muslims. They were an idiosyncratic black American sect which borrowed some formal aspects from Islam, and sold Elijah Muhammad instead of adhering to his prophet namesake. One interesting question to ask yourself about Malcolm X is, when did he figure out that the NOI were about as halal as ham hock? If he really only became wise to the game after Muhammad had kicked him out, that would have made him seem a bit dim in the intellectual department (and I don't think that he was anything but sharp). But if he found out before then why didn't he leave the sect by himself? Does anyone really buy his magic transformation into a proper Muslim and non-racist on the hadj he went on after he had been forced to leave NOI? In the movie, Malcolm starts to doubt Elijah Muhammad pretty abruptly when he finds out that he has fathered children with his -- very much younger -- secretaries. This is shown melodramatically where the mothers are dressed up in their full freaky NOI costume, have their darling children playing around their feet and profess that they are only worried about their toddlers' wellbeing, i. e. present the picture of purity. I didn't buy that either, neither in the film nor in Malcolm X's life.<br/><br/>There are simply some aspects this movie should have addressed, some questions it should have raised. Instead it ""cultivates"" and adulates Malcom X. Apart from being a fierce speaker and writer, what actual plans did Malcolm X have? Did he implement them, did they work out, did they fail? How serious was he about separating the races, or was that just rhetorics? Did he actually further or hinder the Civil Rights movement? Didn't he, especially in the light of Obama, fail quite badly by his own standards? One scene I didn't buy at all was when Malcolm liberates a black man from racist police imprisonment. He threatens the officer in charge by telling him to look out of the window, through which we see a thin row of NOI goons standing before the police precinct. Somehow the captain freaks at the sight of 20 dudes in suits and ties and immediately gives in. In the following scene, Malcolm gives them a sign and they turn around like robots and march off. Wow, that's how the NOI fought? Too bad Martin Luther King hadn't thought of that. Although I'd advise anyone not to don suit and tie and descend on the local police outpost yet. Spike Lee feeds us off with simple cinematic razzle-dazzle.<br/><br/>Spike Lee also tells us quite unambiguously that Malcolm's father was murdered by the KKK, where this is at best highly speculative.<br/><br/>Another point: were the NOI with their guru, their uniforms, their sex separation and their bodyguards not perhaps a pretty scary outfit? Scary not only in ""the KKK had finally met their match""-sense but more as in ""made the KKK seem like a regular bunch of guys with a hood fixation, and the John Birch Society like a bunch of hippies""? Just a thought.<br/><br/>Then in the final scene Spike Lee serves up a ""I'm Malcom X"" scene which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Stalinist propaganda film.<br/><br/>Malcolm X once said that all his achievements should be blamed on Allah, and only his failings on himself. Spike Lee should have taken his word. If you want to learn more about Malcolm X, then even his autobiography is a better choice."
"ccthemovieman-1","4","29","64","26 June 2006"," Slick But Spiked With Too Much Bias
","Here we go with more Spike Lee bias. I'm not talking blacks vs. whites. We've come to expect that with Lee's films. What I'm referring to in this picture is another thing Lee does in many of his films - take cheap shots at Christians. What better stage than this one about a man who leaves his Christian roots and converts to Islam? <br/><br/>Here, Lee goes out of his way to have the KKK mentioned several times and how they are ""good Christians."" An accomplice to many of Lee's bigoted films, unfortunately, is the fine actor Denzel Washington. Check how often Washington and Lee collaborate on films and how many of them play the ""race card."" Too bad because Denzel is a likable guy and a great actor. Lee is neither.<br/><br/>At 201 minutes this a long film but an interesting one nonetheless. I can't say I was ever bored watching this. It's also beautifully photographed with some slick visuals. You can tell a lot of love went into this movie. Too bad Lee can't put this much effort into a biography of, let's say, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa or Billy Graham."
"bob the moo","Null","19","40","13 April 2004"," Sadly one of Lee's flattest film but still a story worth hearing and features a good performance from Washington
","Malcolm Little was a young man when his father was murdered by the KKK and he and his siblings were taken from their mother and separated.  As a young man he became a hustler and eventually a full robber with his friends, before eventually getting 8-12 years in prison for his crimes.  While inside he learns the ways of Elijah Muhammad and coverts to Islam.  Once released he rises in the ranks of the Nation of Islam to be an uncompromising leader of the black movement , tackling white oppression head on.<br/><br/>Lee does not want any question about the tone of this film.  Opening with footage of the Rodney King beating projected onto an American flag that chars before bursting into flames while Malcolm's `American nightmare' speech is played over the top, Lee leaves us in no doubt that this film will not step back from being provocative and incendiary.  Unlike many reviews on this site, I will not review the politics of Malcolm X but I will try and view this as a film.  I do not need to agree with the stance of X to be interesting in this film - I did not watch this film to fight with it or get annoyed by it, I watched it to listen to Lee tell the story of Malcolm X.<br/><br/>Substance wise, the film is too long - Lee did not allow the editors to be as ruthless as he should have been.  I can understand why though, this was a labour of love and he must have felt that he needed that long to do the job. As a flow it works reasonably well, although it is too baggy quite often, but it is an interesting story nonetheless.  Many critics have lambasted the film for it's bias.  In that regard the only thing that surprised me was that they genuinely seemed surprised by this fact - what did they expect from Spike Lee?  However, I don't believe that this is a fair accusation to make at Lee.  He tells the story in a fair light - he doesn't hide the double standards of the Nation of Islam nor does he spin the anti-white teachings to paint Malcolm in a better light.  Of course Lee is going to bring his own pro-black politics to the film, but that is his right and he doesn't rewrite history to serve himself.<br/><br/>In fact I admired some of Lee's touches as they actually produced a more balanced view.  For example, where Malcolm is talking to Betty about his thoughts on women, Lee cuts to Malcolm being told the same opinion (word for word) by Muhammad - a brave move that implied the spoon feeding of his views that I didn't expect from Lee.  Of course the other way to look at it would be Lee excusing Malcolm's stance on women by pinning it on Muhammad and in fairness to that view, Lee does tend to gloss over the NOI's view on woman's place.  The film is a little kind to Malcolm but not to the point where the absurd claims about bias and spin would really stick - well, for the majority anyway.  I did feel that, although it wasn't spin, that the final 5 minutes of the film really went too far with the little kids all standing up saying `I am Malcolm X', parallels with Jesus and then Mandella being wheeled out...now THAT bit I found to be unnecessary as it was not from Malcolm - it was heavy politicing from Lee himself in further evidence that he was knocked off his usual style by the weight of the material.<br/><br/>In fact, this stands out to me as being one of Lee's least stylish and slick films - only the early, freer scenes of Malcolm's crime, drink and dancing seem to be directed by a Spike Lee using the camera and the space.  For the most part, Lee sits back and watches - apparently in total reverence of this subject and afraid to take away from the supposed importance of what the film is trying to do.  It is a shame because the overly long running time means that it desperately needed a spark at times and I did expect Lee at least to bring the film alive with visual flourishes.  Sadly, like I say, Lee's respect for his subject causes him to do nothing and, worse still, he includes some bits that just don't work - Muhammad's appearance in the cell is worst but Malcolm's trip to Mecca doesn't work as it is overlong and forced (again, as Lee stresses that Malcolm dropped the anti-white stance). In regards this, critics have unfairly accused Lee of trying to lessen Malcolm's stance and make it more acceptable (ie change history) but those of us who are a bit older know that we will learn things over our life and will not hold the same opinions as we did when we were 18, or 25, or 30. In the same way Malcolm lost his harsh teachings with age - this is the case, it is not Lee trying to trick us.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, the film is greatly in debt to Denzel Washington. If it weren't for his engaging and powerful performance then this film would be very bland for the majority.  Happily then, Washington rises to the role and deals with it's changes and development really well. He makes a charismatic leading man and it is difficult to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with this role - or that the film would have worked without him.  The names of those involved is impressive, but not all their performances are.  Bassett varies between being a shy little woman and having raging fights with her husband, in neither mode does she convince. Freeman is also pretty comic - but part of the blame for that lies with Lee's portrayal of him (floating in a cell is not a good look!).  Hall, Lindo, Randle, McDaniel and Lee himself all do reasonably well in minor roles but the film belongs to Washington and it is just as well for the film's sake that he is up to the task.<br/><br/>Overall this is an interesting film that is worth seeing as an INTRODUCTION to Malcolm X - however if you take your opinion from this film alone then you are doing yourself a disservice.  As a Spike Lee film it is surprisingly flat and lacking in the usual visual style that he brings, it is a real shame but this labour of love is not one of his better films (although it is not among his worst) - it is rather pedestrian, overlong and, were it not for a charismatic performance from Washington, would be a lot duller than the subject deserved."

However, ""Malcolm X"", produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington in the title role, is a bona fide masterpiece--a 20th century film equivalent to a masterwork of the Renaissance. Certainly, it may be unfair to evaluate the two films against each other, but since one received much more acclaim than the other during the year of its release, it begs comparison. However, it's like comparing a Caravaggio with Michaelangelo's frescoes atop the Sistine Chapel. The first is certainly exceptional but the latter is a magnum opus. ""Malcolm X"" is Spike Lee's Sistine Chapel. Like Selznik's ""Gone with the Wind"" or Welles' ""Citizen Kane"", ""Malcolm X"" may be hard to top.<br/><br/>The only thing equally as superb as Washington's acting is the directing and the script, which is at once honest and compelling. Except for a coda at the end that seems at odds with the rest of the film, the script is near perfect, relying heavily on true accounts of Malcolm X's life instead of altering the story to fit prescribed entertainment values, a bad habit of Hollywood filmmakers. Instead, Lee and Washington rely on Malcolm X and his history as the guiding force behind the film. Many of the incidences portrayed in ""Malcolm X"" actually happened, from his father being assassinated on railroad tracks, to the young Malcolm being involved with drug dealing to his rise as a star among the Nation of Islam, or so-called Black Muslims. In one scene that is history and not fiction, Malcolm X orders his entourage of male associates to stand outside a hospital when a fellow Muslim, Brother Johnson, requires medical attention.<br/><br/>Malcolm Little was an African-American, the son of an assassinated preacher whose family had sustained vicious threats from the KKK. As a young man, he relocated to Harlem and became a streetwise hoodlum involved in crime gangs. Racketeering, gambling, prostitution, and drug dealing were his first religion. Then after an incident with white girls that landed himself and his associate Shorty (Spike Lee, perfectly cast) in jail, he meets a member of a new religious organization claiming kinship with Muslims in the Middle East and re-claiming their African roots.<br/><br/>Headed by the honorable Elijah Muhammad who had converted to Islam and brought the religion (or at least his version of it) to the United States as the Nation of Islam, the so-called Black Muslims (although they do not refer to themselves as such) lures Malcolm into a new world of honesty, compassion, and purpose. To the their credit, the religious organization gives Malcolm Little, now renamed Malcolm X, a sense of purpose, an identity, a loving community, and rehabilitation from the vices that were destroying himself in Harlem.<br/><br/>After his conversion, he becomes a prominent voice among the sect, a spokesperson for the honorable Elijah Muhammad and his message of religious determinism. Simultaneously, they also preach dangerous messages including that all white folks are devils, and that the honorable Elijah Muhammad is to be obeyed without question. As the spokesman of their cause against whites, Malcolm X in some ways becomes the darker side of Martin Luther King, Jr who propagated that proclaiming African-American superiority was as sinful as proclaiming white superiority. The press dubbed Malcolm X the ""angriest man in America"".<br/><br/>Washington does more than just portray Malcolm X, he becomes him. Washington, I imagine, must have studied footage of his speeches and spoken with people who knew him. Speeches of the real Malcolm X as compared to speeches in the film as enacted by Washington are almost indistinguishable. His performance ranks as one of the top two or three performances by an actor in the history of the performing arts and cinema, up there with Ben Kingsly as Gandhi, Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane, Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, and Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara.<br/><br/>The turn in the film occurs when, in the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm makes some ill-conceived remarks to the press. Malcolm X further learns that Elijah Muhammad is not practicing all that he preaches. The star of the so-called ""Black Muslims"" begins questioning not only his role but the integrity of the entire movement. He then makes a pilgrimage to Mecca, required at least once in the lifetime of a Muslim. His pilgrimage changes many of his views.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe this film without using many superlatives, but if there was ever a film that deserved it, it's ""Malcolm X"". Washington and Lee do a tremendous job of neither vilifying nor idealizing Malcolm X, the man. In retrospect on the man, I think Malcolm X began to realize he could serve a higher purpose to help unify rather than divide the races. In the end, Malcolm X began to encourage that dream, but, like Martin Luther King Jr, his mission was cut short. As for the film, it is an honest tribute to one of the most memorable figures of American history. And like the man himself, the work may only be appreciated by later generations. Malcolm X is the embodiment of the American story."

","Malcolm X is a powerful, three-hour tribute to which the man movie names itself. This epic of a film guides its viewers through the evolution of Malcolm X's philosophy in each phase of his life.<br/><br/>Spike Lee could not have selected a better cast for this film. Denzel Washington delivers a performance full of heart and passion. Truly both Spike & Washington at the prime of their careers. There were times I was convinced I was watching the real Malcolm X many times in the film.<br/><br/>For a biopic, the plot will be straightforward. Yet, I found the dedication to each tiny detail in each era of Malcolm X's life was both painstaking and rewarding. The set designs, costumes, and music were all loyal to the sign of the times. The film also follows each stage of Malcolm X's philosophies without saying which is right or wrong. The film is well-rounded and makes its audience understand each decision made.<br/><br/>This movie is loyal to its source material and viewers can tell that Spike Lee did his research. It pushed boundaries as far as can be reasonably told in a three-hour movie. I also enjoyed the final montage as it showed Malcolm X's far-reaching impact. I was even surprised to see Nelson Mandela make a cameo in the film. You don't see that every day.<br/><br/>4.5/5. A loyal and timeless classic from Spike Lee. Stellar performances by Denzel Washington and the crew. Doubt any other biopic about Malcolm X could top this."
"Sargebri","Null","9","18","5 March 2003"," The Biggest Snub in Oscar History
","This is one of the greatest epics on one of the most complex individuals of the twentieth century.  However, this was also a victim of one of the greatest snubs in Oscar history.  Despite the greatness of this film it was only nominated for two Academy Awards.  Denzel Washington, deservedly, was nominated for his performance.  However, he was beaten out by Al Pacino for his portrayal of a blind former army officer in Scent of a Woman.  But perhaps the biggest snub was suffered by Spike Lee.  Lee made the film come to life as he told Malcolm's story, but he wasn't even nominated for his work.  Perhaps it was because of his controversial statements regarding blacks in Hollywood that caused him to be snubbed.  No matter what, this film should have received at least six or seven nominations, especially for Angela Bassett and Al Freeman."
"gunnshy357","10","11","24","24 January 2006"," Denzel Was Robbed !!!
","One of the reasons I love this movie is because of Spike Lee's faithful interpretation of the autobiography. This is easily my favorite Denzel Washington performance !! Angela Bassett is one of the most beautiful women on the planet !!! BLAST YOU COURTNEY VANCE !!! YOU STOLE MY WOMAN !!!<br/><br/>Lee tells the story of Malcolm Little from the beginning when his Garveyite father gets lynched and his family separated. We see the ""Detroit Red"" days as well as what I call Malcolm's initial ""brainwashing"" into the Nation Of Islam. <br/><br/>Spike Lee also makes history as one of the only filmmakers to ever be able to document the Muslim ""Hajj"" or Holy Pilgrimage to Mecca and pulls it off beautifully. It's no wonder that some Orthodox Muslims are among the most spiritually beautiful people In the world. I've witnessed this first hand.<br/><br/>""Malcolm X"" would make a great companion to the book written by Alex Haley."
"andreyev66","2","16","39","7 April 2000"," A great story reduced to a series of cinematic snapshots
","The film charts Malcolm X's metamorphosis from Harlem hustler to one of the two most important African- American leaders of his time, but , in emotional terms, it doesn't dig very deep. One understands how Malcolm X changes but not why he changes.  The scenes--some of which are extraordinary --are self-contained, they don't  link up emotionally with one another. The result is a cinematic slide show (""first this happened, then this... then this"").  And the coda (much like those in Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan) is unnecessary and embarrassing."
"dee.reid","10","10","22","15 October 2001"," Don't Listen To Yevgeny Bazarov
","For he/she is nothing but a hate monger himself/herself and doesn't realize that Malcolm X is probably one of the most misunderstood, but influential black leaders in history.  Throughout the course of the movie, we see Malcolm go through a transformation from street hustler, to convict, to positive black leader.  Malcolm X was only violent and hateful towards white people until he made his pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam. When he got there he never saw so many people of many different races worshiping Allah.  It was then that he decided to change his views of race. After that, it was then that he realized the mistakes that he had made and decided to break off his relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the rest of the Muslims, who in fact were the real hate mongers and that's why they later killed him, because he didn't feed on hate anymore.<br/><br/>Another thing about director Spike Lee.  Spike Lee is in fact, probably one of the most under-appreciated African-American directors in Hollywood.  His movies have many underlying messages about race in America.  It's a shame that his movies are so under-appreciated.  Sure his movies are ""critically acclaimed"", but that doesn't mean that people are actually getting the messages he is trying to send.  The same goes for John Singleton and The Hughes Brothers."
"John Bethea","3","19","50","3 December 2000"," a travesty
","By focusing on, and even celebrating, the rise of Malcolm X and his legacy of heightened militancy in the Black Muslim movement of Elijah Muhammed, Spike Lee has totally butchered the point of X's autobiography, which ends with him embracing all of mankind and coming to grips with the anger(totally justified!)and resentment that he held for the whites he dealt with in his life. This should have been a story of inclusiveness, concluding with a certain joy instead of this childish ""I am Malcolm X"" black hero c***. Malcolm is a hero for everyone, and should be praised by everyone for his angelic ability to accept and forgive the world that so often wronged him. Why do you think Elijah Muhammed had him killed? Because he didn't feed on hate anymore, and wanted others to feel the same way. That would have destroyed the Black Muslim message, the most blameful of heresies. This is irresponsible, manipulative, self-indulgent film-making on a scale equal to ""Birth of a Nation"" as it rewrites history in an all too convincing manner. Shameful."
"Newsense","10","7","15","17 January 2009"," Malcom Xcellent
","Malcolm X is a great movie But there are a few inaccuracies in the movie plus the movie left out certain elements in his life that I felt were important(like his speech to the Africans in Africa that the blacks in America had the same struggle that they had) but don't mistake my tone because I still recommend it flaws and all.<br/><br/>Malcolm X details the life of the controversial yet charismatic figure that sought to deal with the injustices that African people suffered in America. It details how he came up from being a petty street hustler to the Nation Of Islam most outspoken character. It also deals with the events that lead to his assassination.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's best performance was here and what does he win an award for? Training Day. Now do you see why they say these awards mean nothing? Denzel role as Malcolm X is just as flawless as Will Smith's role of Muhammed Ali. I still get goosebumps when I hear him speak and I've seen a lot of Malcolm X's actual speeches. Angela Bassett did a great job as his wife and the supporting actors and actresses were great too. My gripe is the certain inaccuracies in the movie and the idea that the Nation Of Islam has something to do with his death is debatable. As far as I'm concerned those guys were flunkies for those people in high places. If not by signature then by nature. At any rate I would still recommend this movie, flaws and all, to anybody that is interested but first read up on his life before you watch this movie. Kudos to Spike Lee for doing his best with the information he was given.<br/><br/>Rest in Peace Malcolm X."
"Quinoa1984","10","7","15","30 July 2008"," superior craftsmanship, Washington's performance, and a sobering mixture of history and drama
","Malcolm X is many things to many people, but one can never say he didn't make a significant mark on his time and for 'his' people, as he and the Nation of Islam defined it. But 'his' was contingent on his religion, his experience growing up and being an 'Afro-American' in the United States, and as it turned out it was not set in stone. What Spike Lee's film does so compellingly is shine light on the history of the man and his place in a country with one of the most disturbing, racist histories in the world, and not make it too dogmatic or beyond reproach. On the contrary, this is one of Lee's most commercial works, made in epic form and imbued with his style at the top of his game. Only Do the Right Thing, in terms of his non-documentary features, tops this for sheer directorial virtuosity and intelligence with the subject matter.<br/><br/>How much it sticks true to the autobiography of Malcolm X (as told to Alex Haley) I can't say yet, having not read the book. But for what it's worth, on its own terms, Lee crafts his story with the grandiosity appropriate to the character and the circumstances. Malcolm (Washington) is born to a religious man, but one who's killed by white people. He's denied his dream of being a lawyer and forced into labor. He becomes a criminal and is sentenced to 10 years for multiple counts of theft. And then in prison is changed around by Baines (Albert Hall), who converts him to the Nation of Islam and its teachings. It's mind-opening because, for the first time for him, his perception comes clearer than ever regarding the black experience- and what are really their rights, which have been few since the abolishment of slavery- and he becomes the big cultural figure he's remembered as.<br/><br/>Even if one doesn't agree with all of the philosophy and speeches from Malcolm- and it's not hard to see why Malcolm had so many enemies, even from his own fold- it absorbs one not terribly familiar with what he was about in thought and practice and deed, and it gets the audience thinking one way or another about the nature of racism and race and separation in America. And past all that, it's directed with nerve and pizazz, while not going too far off into avant-garde. For all of Lee's success here as a storyteller, it wouldn't be quite the same without the star; oddly enough once he's off the screen- for the final ten minutes which becomes a long eulogy that drags on longer than necessary in nearing pomposity- it doesn't work as well. Every moment he's on camera, whether in the early years in Boston and Harlem as a thug or as X himself in full public figure mode on stage and behind closed doors, it's a reminder why he's the star he is. It's simply one of his very best performances, full of subtlety and wit and bigger-than-life bravura moments that usually (though not this time get Oscars.<br/><br/>It's a period piece, it's a history lesson, it's a biography, and a testament to the possibility for a person to change. But above all else, Malcolm X works as a movie, and it's watchable in that big-movie-event kind of way without the usual drawbacks."
"Willet73","9","7","15","22 May 2006"," Forget the Malcolm You were Taught in School. This is a True Biopic in Every Sense of the Word!
","This movie changed my mind about who Malcolm was. I thought he was simply a demagogue and a hate monger. However, what I saw from this film, with its excellent acting--the chemistry between Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz as played by Denzel and Angela Bassett was amazing and palpable; and Al Freeman Jr.'s (Elijah Muhammad) accent was wonderful--was an evolving person, seeking truth about himself, God and his people.<br/><br/>Some of the most intense and profound scenes include (spoiler ahead): Malcolm X getting an innocent man out of prison and the trip to Mecca, where he received a revelation that all whites are not ""devils."" The cinematography is especially amazing in this scene but the entire film steeps the viewer in the time and place of Malcolm.<br/><br/>Malcolm was an individual of his time and I think the time needed him as much as MLK. With them, you saw the two different sides of black manhood--the pacifist and the firebrand--on their own terms and not of those created or caricatured by whites.<br/><br/>Potent and relevant, Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" is a must see by every American intent on learning about an oft-misunderstood individual. You may not agree with all he says, but you have to hear it.<br/><br/>If you like this film, also see ""Cry Freedom,"" in which Denzel Washington plays the role of Steven Biko, the South African Malcolm X."
"eric262003","6","9","21","8 March 2015"," There Are Issues Here That I Don't Buy
","Directed by Spike Lee, this over-budgeted very lengthy biopic, ""Malcolm X"" tells most of every facet of his life as he begins as a gangster to becoming a Muslim convert, to becoming an outspoken African- American who wanted to believe that his fellow people should never be afraid to stand up to themselves and to be happy with the skin they have. <br/><br/>In the early scenes we see Malcolm X (Denzel Washington) starting out as a criminal under his accomplice named West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He starts by robbing houses along with his assistant Shorty (Spike Lee) and joining his for the ride is a hot young blond named Sophia (Kate Vernon) with whom he chooses as a love interest over a much well-behaved African-American girl named Laura (Theresa Randle). <br/><br/>Later on, Malcolm ends up incarcerated and opposing the Biblical teachings from Chaplain Gill (Christopher Plummer) and seems more on the side of African-American Muslim convert Baines (Albert Hall). Once he's discharged, he become the top followers of the Nation of Islam under the influence of Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) <br/><br/>Malcolm X becomes a charismatic celebrity, which the white press so arbitrarily decided to lash out controversy towards this young radical. As his bravado increased proportionately, the Nation of Islam became very envious about it while the Nation of Islam becomes a part of a scandal involving Elijah's illegitimate children.<br/><br/>Malcolm eventually married Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) and raise three wonderful daughters. He then makes a religious journey to Mecca and declares that not all Caucasians are not entirely evil. When he returns to America, he breaks ties with the Nation of Islam and establishes a rival church that fits the modern spirit at the time. The Nation of Islam did not take this very well and at the Audubon Hotel in Manhattan on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was beginning a speech when a disturbance takes shape, Malcolm tries to calm everybody down and was gunned down (one of the shooters was his former friend Baines). <br/><br/>The movie itself was very high in terms of budget in spite of the very gargantuan production costs. Denzel was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor in a leading role, but sadly was ousted by Al Pacino for his role in ""Scent of a Woman."" Washington had to wait several years before winning the Leading Actor Oscar in the film ""Training Day."" <br/><br/>The film itself was quite accurate in the time period clothes making it very authentic and the lingo spoken by the characters was very appropriate during the time period. The costume design was also in Oscar contention as well. The other high point was that many scenes were very well filmed, especially the uproar during Malcolm X's assassination.<br/><br/>Sure it was praised by many including myself, there are still quite a few issues that didn't sit very well with me. Some of these were small nit-pickings while others were much more bigger that truly hindered the film from being anything but perfect. <br/><br/>Where to start was the singing performance by Miki Howard, who was supposed to play the part of Billie Holiday, but her voice doesn't even come close to even sounding like her. Anybody who listens to jazz and Big Band music know Holiday's familiar voice. It wouldn't have hurt if she just lip-synched from a Holiday soundtrack and it would have been more convincing. Lee really should have known better. <br/><br/>The more obvious falsifications come from the character Sophia. She's hanging out at an all black girls nightclub and just freely throws herself in Malcolm's arms with no indication as to he is. I'm sorry but that is very illogical. It's just a scene designed to get male viewers' attention. It would never happen to you even if you have Washington's looks.<br/><br/>It seems strange that the Nation of Islam has a hostile attitude to Washington who at the time looked decent, well-caring family man who loved his wife and kids. Did he munch on pork rinds at the time? Who knows?<br/><br/>Another unanswered question stems from the scene where he stands up the cops after they unmercifully beat the tar out of a black man. Malcolm brings in a group of identically dressed black men to await for his command. Where did he find them and how did they fall into his lead? And what's the purpose of them acting like soldiers? To me they're there to look cool behind the camera if nothing else. <br/><br/>And finally I must wonder what does Malcolm X himself truly stand for? He transforms from a thief in his early years, to a radical Islamic radical and finally reconsiders his thoughts long enough and before you know it he's murdered. Sure his mission was to for equality, but his execution was more radical rather than peaceful. He was separated from most of his life and wanted his fellow people not to anticipate with anything the white majority did and joined a church who eventually turned against him by having him killed. <br/><br/>These quibbles are what brought this movie down. I think some editing should have been greatly desired as this movie went on too long and many scenes needed further explanation. But other than that, the performances were excellent an Washington acted his heart here as the the other performers. But the illogical scenarios brought this film down from being an absolute masterpiece."

","No disrespect to Malcolm X, I admire him so I watched this movie and I didn't like it. After watching this I decided that I don't like Spike Lee's movies, he's a bad director. I haven't liked one of his movies yet. <br/><br/>What's with the long dancing scenes at the beginning of the movie? The end is so melodramatic, I'm pretty sure it's Spike Lee's voice saying why you should respect Malcolm X... nobody cares what your vision of life is, rather tell me a story and then you can catch my attention , but the voice over spoils it. It's also ridiculously long and it's unnecessary. <br/><br/>Sorry Spike, you had to stay more centered to tell a good story, you couldn't shape your admiration for this man into a fine movie."

And the ending goes Schindler's List on us and stops being a movie. Apparently Michael Jordan wearing an ""X"" hat is something we all must see to understand Malcolm.

","Malcolm X is a biographical film about the African-American figure Malcolm X,who is also known as Malcolm Little,was co-written, co- produced, and directed by Spike Lee. It stars Denzel Washington in the title role together with Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman, Jr., and Delroy Lindo. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and future South Africa president Nelson Mandela have cameo appearances.Malcolm X's screenplay, co-credited to Lee and Arnold Perl, is based largely on Alex Haley's 1965 book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death.<br/><br/>The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination on February 21, 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks.<br/><br/>Spike Lee called Malcolm X ""the picture I was born to make,"" and star Denzel Washington referred to the titular civil-rights leader as ""the role of a lifetime."" They're both right.Visually and dramatically, Lee pulls out all the stops, but it's Washington's performance that really energizes the film, and he's an exhilarating presence throughout.Added to that,a viewer would realize that it is an ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization.Overall,anchored by a powerful performance from Denzel Washington, Spike Lee's biopic of the legendary civil rights leader brings his autobiography to life with an epic sweep and a nuanced message.One of the best biopics ever released on screen."
"jgronwold","Null","4","8","8 December 2014"," I suggest reading the book. The movie is still fantastic
","Spike Lee's Malcolm X is an outstanding example of a movie that stays to its source. However, I feel it is necessary to tell people that the novel written by Alex Haley with the help of Malcolm X is even more important than Lee's spectacular movie. In Lee's film, Malcolm never reaches the level of honesty that he does in the novel. Instead, Lee uses everything else in his arsenal to tell this compelling story. He tells most of Malcolm young life through flashbacks that just don't seem authentic and they feel rushed, but at the same time his use of color, lighting, and sound is phenomenal. The first third or so of the movie it runs through Malcolm's life as a hustler and during this time Lee uses very bright lighting and colors to give this part of the film a feeling of joy and it almost feels like it is to good to be true. However, in the novel there is a completely different feeling when reading it. You feel sorry for everything Malcolm had to go through as a child and reading about him making bad choices never really feels happy at all. Along with the color, Lee does an amazing job in large crowds. There is a scene when Malcolm arrives in New York and there is a huge gathering in the street and the camera zooms out but you never lose sight of Malcolm because he is the only one wearing somewhat bright clothes. Lee take on Malcolm being this beacon of light perhaps? If you are thinking about watching this movie I highly recommend it and it shouldn't be missed, but you shouldn't miss out on the novel as well. Each are very important stories told in different, but honest, ways."
"ElMaruecan82","10","5","11","24 August 2011"," Intelligence as Self-Awareness, Self-Awareness as Self-Defense, Self-Defense as Violence ...
","""Do The Right Thing"" ended with two quotations from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. According to King, no circumstances could justify the use of violence but Malcolm X qualified violence as 'intelligence' when in case of self-defense. Three years later, Spike Lee's biopic confirmed the bias he had toward the Muslim leader's opinion and through a masterstroke of writing, provided an insightful explanation on the 'violence/intelligence' controversial equation.<br/><br/>Like Malcolm X, Spike Lee immediately inspires negative reactions, in his depiction of racial realities, but only truth hurts, and any form of thinking is subversive or is not. Rarely inclined to neutrality, Lee points his finger on the pervert aspect of American Society that tends to judge the hate before judging the hate that produces the hate. In other words, Lee provocatively invites you to think why the opening image of a burning American Flag, shocked you most than the sight of a KKK cross burning in front of a Black family house.<br/><br/>Malcolm's family was destroyed by racism, from the roots. Malcolm's mother inherited a light skin from a white man who raped her mother and as a rejection to her 'shameful' genes; she married a Minister with darker complexion. Malcolm's father was killed by the KKK and then killed again, symbolically, when his widow couldn't benefit from his two life insurance policies because the death was considered a suicide. She ended in a mental hospital. These painful wounds in Malcolm's heart forged his determination and encouraged him less to hate than to challenge white men with their very weapons, except for education. Malcolm proved to have a brilliant inclination for studies, but was advised to look for a more manual work. Malcolm abandoned his dreams of accomplishment  through a regular job.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an unexpected gangster feel where Malcolm, a youthful looking Denzel Washington, is a small time hoodlum in an elegant zoot suit, with his inseparable friend and occasional hairdresser, Shorty, played by Spike Lee, together, they drink, they dance and seduce white women. Shorty regularly applies a softening lotion on Malcolm's hair with an immediate burning effect. This running gag reinforces Malcolm's rejection of his condition as a black man and eagerness to imitate the enemy to outperform his. His reddish hair establishes some natural dispositions whose pinnacle is reached with the ultimate middle finger gesture to the system: the blonde. In a memorable scene, Malcolm asks his girl to kiss his feet. The macho power he exudes is so powerful she just can't say no, this is not a man degrading a woman, but a man raising himself to his personal vision of self-accomplishment.<br/><br/>Malcolm still has the charisma of Spike Lee's street-wise characters; something needs to get him to the stature we know. The key is education. When Malcolm is arrested and spends seven years in jail, he's initiated by one of the 'Nation of Islam' followers. Malcolm embraces Islam and develop a passion for reading and knowledge, his glasses and shorter hair transfigures his rebirth as an intellectual figure. Beyond the tremendous performance of Denzel Washington, Lee's thought-provoking script portrays the vitality of education for the Black movement, an indirect way to point out that the segregation was maintained because white men kept black poor and ignorant. Violence was intelligence as self-defense because violence was awareness. ""We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us"" The Black were not American because they didn't choose their destiny, their condition is the consequences of undesired actions, therefore, Black must take the lead of their destiny again. The price of this self-awareness was indeed a true hate against the White.<br/><br/>In a short but significant scene, a young white woman asked Malcolm if she could do anything to his cause. Malcolm dryly replies 'no', leaving her totally embarrassed, as she felt, she was one of the White devils. As a follower of 'the honorable' Elijah Muhammad, remarkably played by Al Freeman Jr., Malcolm X's aura is stuck in the narrow walls of an orthodox sect-like organization. He studies more than anyone; he marries Betty, Angela Bassett in a powerful supporting role, founds a family, and dedicates his life to his cause. He starts to outshine the Master, and his own allegiance deteriorates when he learns about Elijah's accusation of fornication with his secretaries. Elijah justifying the actions as a God's prophet blasphemes the most sacred Islamic principle and reveals the alienation governing the Nation of Islam. After many ideological disagreements, Malcolm X quits and founds his own association. He signed his own death warrant by acting alone, but this is the great men's existential mark, the ability to act in total integrity.<br/><br/>Through a pivotal pilgrimage to Mecca, he discovered that many cultures, colors of skins, and civilizations embraced Islam, and the Black vs. White antagonism became meaningless. At this point, maybe, Malcolm X understood that the fight, as necessary as it was, was only meant to restore pride and dignity to the African American. But Malcolm X was so blinded by a skin based antagonism that he didn't want to admit the possibility that he could be respected more by a white than a black man, or that a black man could kill him. History judged Malcolm X more harshly than Martin Luther King who was more a sort of Gandhi-like figure, but even King's peaceful nature didn't spare his life.<br/><br/>King was a humanist, X was lucid, as carrying the light. His assassination didn't make him a martyr, but a legend whose pride speaks to all the black conscience in the world. ""I am Malcolm X"" shouts school-kids at the end of the film while the tribute from Ossie Davis is heard, every African American carries the heritage of a man who didn't reject a country but injected a dignity, intelligence, a pride that transcended any form of religious beliefs."

","As I watched MALCOLM X, I was surprised how much I liked the film and how interesting it was. So interesting, in fact, that I soon was inspired to read ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" that was compiled and written by Alex Haley. Then, I read a rather interesting (warts and all) account of Malcolm X's mentor, Elijah Mohammad.<br/><br/>From what I have since learned from these and other sources, I was quite impressed at the movie--it seemed to try very hard to get the story right. Malcolm X's life was neither over-glorified nor was he portrayed the opposite--the story seemed to be quite balanced and without a serious ax to grind. It would have been easy to make the movie just an attack on the Nation of Islam or an attempt to make the title character some sort of saint.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was super. The script, excellent. The direction, first-rate. An excellent film that everyone should see--it is fascinating from start to finish."

The Arabs were busy in trading on the Eastern Africa coast, the Whites arrived later on the Western coast. This is just trading posts before colonisation, one thing the powerful AFRICAN nations could trade was slaves. Look to your ""brothers"" before accusing every white of slavery. None of my ancestors ever owned a maid / servant let alone a slave, yet we're all held responsible.

","First of all, I gotta say Denzel was awesome as Malcolm X. Before seeing this movie, I knew very little about Malcolm X. After watching it, it gave me a sense of how stupid smart people can actually be. While I think Malcolm X's intentions were for the best part good, there was too much hate in his soul to do any real good. And to me, this film portrays a prime example of how religion can fuel hate. That is surely what religion is NOT supposed to be about, but sadly, since the dawn of time, that has often been the outcome.<br/><br/>I think Malcolm X was an intelligent man, but easily led by his emotions and too quick to adapt to whatever religious quota fit his mood at the time. In a way, he was like a child; easily led, influenced. Looking for that religious ""fix"" to ease his tortured soul. And he never did find inner peace. <br/><br/>And Muslims, for being so pious, are the cause for most the murder and terrorism we have had through the ages in the name of Allah, and today it continues. That's screwed up. Always has been. <br/><br/>Martin Luther King, Jr. had it right, not X.<br/><br/>You can't achieve peace with hate in your heart. Just doesn't work, people. And that is what he did, or tried to do. In the end, he only damaged the cause for peace and desegregation. That point is proved in the end, when his own former advocates gunned him down. <br/><br/>Malcolm X's biggest legacy is Louis Farakan. A hate monger, pure and simple...not a holy man.<br/><br/>Well filmed, directed, but with the Spike Lee spin we've all grown to expect. In many ways, Spike adopts the same mindset as Malcolm X. <br/><br/>The best way to be free is to be free of hate, not the ""White Devil""."

"artzau","7","7","18","18 February 2001"," Spike Lee and Malcolm X: Some disagreements
","I heard Malcolm X speak at Berkeley in 1963, the year of Kennedy's assassination, albeit before that terrible event.  I remember that tall, intense, lean man striding to the microphone and beginning with, ""Brothers, friends...enemies.""  This film is a fine but flawed work which creates a confusing and often confused picture of a very complex man.  The Black Moslem movement is a significant political event in our nation's history. Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X, however, is much more Lee than Malcolm X. This film is long, repetitious and often tedious.  The coda is distracting, unnecessary and borders on the maudlin. However, Lee presents but misunderstands the turning point in the life of the late Malcolm X, i.e., the change from a political icon, mouthing the half-baked, jingoistic half-truths of Elijah Mohammud into a man who underwent a profound religious experience.  Many Black Moslems are an anathema to mainstream Moslems; this distinctive African-American movement is willing to lay all the ills of the African-American's treatment at the door of the ""whites.""  This is not religion; it is politics and has little to do with the religious tenets of Islam.  The accusation of Elijah Mohammud that Christianity is a ""white man's religion"" and Judaism is practiced by Jews who ""exploit Black people,"" is pure nonsense.  The origins of Christianity, Islam and Judaism have common roots among the Semitic peoples, Arabs and Jews, and it should be remembered that it was Islamic Arabs who ran the Slave trade that sold many of the West African ancestors of African-Americans into bondage in the Americas.  In fact, the international slave trade feeding slaves into the productive leg of the old Trade Triangle was created by the Portuguese colonization of Africa.  But, facts rarely enter into consideration where idealogy is concerned. Islam is a religion where the ""law (sunni)"" is part and parcel of everyday living, as it is in Judaism, (i.e., no division of 'church' and 'state') bespeaks of its desert origins based on a system of tribal ownership of wells.  My point is, the Black Moslem movement was a political movement (and largely, still is) where the religious component has been greatly misrepresented.  The misconception and misrepresentation of Islam as a Jihadic or militant religion persists today in the anti-Arab attitude reflected daily in our public news media.  Unfortunately, Malcom X's diatribes during that his political period did precious little to remedy the situation.  Sadly, only after Malcolm X had made his hajj, did he come to realize that people are people and the real monster is the hatred people create for other people. Spike Lee is a fine film maker.  In spite of its flaws, this is a fine presentation of the life of one of the most interesting men of our past century."

","MALCOLM X (4+ outta 5 stars) Spike Lee's most ambitious project... and it is *almost* the film classic that he had hoped to make (I believe he wanted the Malcolm X bio to be an African-American ""Lawrence of Arabia""). Unfortunately, Lee's ego gets in the way a couple of times... not enough to ruin the movie... but he does get the eyeballs to roll a couple of times. First off (let me get the bad stuff outta the way first), when is he gonna outgrow that infantile ""A Spike Lee Joint"" crap? It was cute for some of his wacky indie comedies... but not a ""real"" movie... come on now! Second, why does the movie have to start with Spike walking down the street pretending to be cool in his zoot suit? Is this ""The Spike Lee Story""? Nope, it's ""Malcolm X""... so cut out those first 2 minutes please and start the movie out in the barber shop! Third, that dance number at the start is kinda cool (even if it is totally unnecessary) but, for the love of Lean, does it have to end with Spike sliding down the floor towards the camera, beaming out at the audience like this is some cheesy music video? Okay... time to let it go... all the bad stuff is over with in the first twenty minutes... everything that follows is pretty dang cool (which just makes those three lapses in judgment all the more annoying). Denzel gives a great performance as Malcolm... definitely the only actor who could have done the role justice. The script is great... telling the whole story... from Malcolm's less auspicious beginnings... to the revelations he discovers in prison... to his eventual role as one of the most eloquent and powerful speakers that the world has ever known. You don't even have to agree with everything the man says to realize that the man had a gift... and a voice that the world will know forever. The movie is a nearly-great epic and, after ""Do The Right Thing"", is undoubtedly Lee's best work."

","Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" is a highly worthy biographical drama that rightfully stands alongside ""Gandhi"" as a timeless classic. This movie goes deeply into the life of Malcolm X, and analyses the decisions he made in life that led him to be one of the most important figures in the American Civil Rights Movement. This movie does not shy away from discussing such important events as Malcolm's ""Chickens Coming Home to Roost"" speech regarding JFK's assassination, which resulted in him being silenced by Black Muslim leader Elijah Mohammed. Malcolm's pilgrimage to Mecca, his conversion to mainstream Islam, and his gradual realization that not all white men are evil, and that even Christianity need not be rejected as a spiritual guide for black people, was shown so subtly and gradually that the audience can accept such a transformation as credible. The audience sees Malcolm X's evolution as a human being and they are convinced that, while he was a genuine and powerful leader within the Black Muslim religion and a heartfelt spokesman for their cause, he was also a consistently evolving person, filled with self-doubt and prone to making mistakes. Spike Lee has done in excellent job in presenting the full story of the life of Malcolm X, while also humanizing him and even going so far as to counter the criticisms that Malcolm was a spokesman for ""violence"" and racial hatred, as opposed to Martin Luther King, Jr's message or racial equality and peaceful civil disobedience. The movie shows that Malcolm's sermons and viewpoints were much more complex than simply advocating racial separation. Spike Lee analyses Malcolm's views with such details that the viewer will at least empathize with Malcolm and understand his speeches and why he felt the way he felt.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie for people interested in American history, or those who are simply fans of biopics. This was a movie that was worth all the hype it received back in 1992."
"nja89","1","6","16","18 December 2018"," Horribly racist movie. It actually caused mild nausea.
","This movie was disgraceful. The idea that black people hold Malcolm X up as an idol, is reprehensible. Malcolm X was the very thing he hated in whites - angry & racist.
People that idolize Malcolm X should really research history. If black rights were left in the hands of Malcolm X (and those like him), black people would probably still have no rights to this day. If you think what they did to the Japanese during ww2 was bad, had X got his way & started a race war, african-Americans would have suffered immensely more & probably floridly emigrated to other countries. He vehemently tried to start a race war that he had zero chance of winning because they had zero political power. It pains me to think of what good African Americans would have went through had people like Malcolm X been the only leader for coloureds. Black people should thank god for men like MLK, who knew how to actually effect real change in the hearts and minds of society. Hostility would have created severe tribalism along races & been met with an extreme amount of violence & political pressure.<br/><br/>The fact that this move holds up X as some kind of hero is nauseating. He was an extreme anti-white racist. He was a ignorant man & the exact black version of a neo-nazi skinhead. This movie sickens me. He was not a hero & I hope people realize that. Ignorance breeds ignorance. I don't understand how it can have a 7.7 rating. The Nation of Islam is a known CULT. Malcolm X was a hardcore racist bigot. He did nothing except anger & scare people. He almost made civil rights not happen & had a war in its place. This movie is trash. Garbage."

","Denzel Washington is a swell, pure gold actor, he can save and grace any movie he is in, and yes, he is great here, but this endless, unimaginable 3 hour and a half mammoth kills all his endeavors and assets burying them under a lead stone sheet of pretentiousness, boredom, and what is the worst offender, a very heavyweight preachy tone which becomes more and more acidic sour and then simply makes you cringe and run for some lightweight family comedy. What is also wrong? Bad pacing, very badly conceived flashback scenes and a very very tedious plot. Generally, such films are often a victim of their own weight - they sink like a marble brick, and they are too wordy. Like here, it is the same endless amount of smart speeches and oratories, but after two hours you feel a strong desire to switch to Mr. Bean or Benny Hill. Malcolm X was not a good man and he fell a victim of his own faith, we know that, and what he preached was wrong. So, no matter how much Spike Lee and Denzel tried, they failed to make us like this cold, ruthless, icy man of no sorrow. I felt no sorrow either for him or for his work, and the documentary footage of great late Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr only proved how much better this Baptist minister was than that loud and brash preacher.

"janbultez","8","3","7","2 July 2017"," The mental and cultural migration from America to Africa
","Meaningful. I want to discuss and debate so much the movie designed by Spike Lee, and discover what he is able to teach us, the character of this movie's title. Malcolm X. This time Denzel Washington was not a policeman, he portrayed a sinner in the abrahamic religions sense of the term, who has become almost a saint, demonstrating that the Afro-American community has his own destiny to draw, and can get out of the fate that the WASPs have created for them into the United States society. His belief, the religion revealed to him, made him born again and at last a martyr for all the causes he has defended for his conception of justice, as Islam and Afro-American community civil and political rights. This man have inspired so many men and women, in the twentieth century it has begun with Garvey and Earl Little, his father, and it continues with King, Park, Mandela, the Black Panthers, the Afro-Americans, the Africans of all tribes till now, and another cultures. Faithful combat, spiritually and ideologically ; black nationalism, panafricanism. I loved when he talked about mental and cultural colonization of Afro-Americans and Africans, and the mental and cultural migration from America to Africa. I was also impressed by how he was depicted in the second part of the movie, rightful in all means, the type of man who was not perfect but seemed perfect, a true leader, someone who would have been necessary for a time like our. A man who have transformed many lives for their own reconstructions as individuals.<br/><br/>But there is a contradiction when he said that, while he talked about, after his pilgrimage, to have all races, one humanity connected to one god. Nation of Islam and Sunnism were wrong, because the true religion of Africans, are ethnics religions, all expressed with different languages in each geographical place. Not an universalism like Islam, and the language who had served itself to colonize the non-Arabs, and non-Muslims, because the said holy language was the Arabic. And before the slavery of black people processed by Europeans, Turks, Arabs and Persians have made exactly the same, and they were all Muslims. The true language of Malcolm X must have been one of the thousand from the thousand ethnies and lands of West Africa. And because his ancestors were natives of certain lands of Africa, he was a native of the nature which makes these lands, any dualist-transcendental-metaphysical-idealistic thing.<br/><br/>Moreover, some like Black Panthers have understood that capitalism was also a colonization and that is for that reason that the situation cannot change in Africa : Private interests conduced by business and occidental states are stealing their lands, all their resources. They pay African people for nothing, but sell it for much. The militaries or politicians are receiving by them all power and money in exchange of the control of their people, within national borders made by these occidental states long before the said independence of Africa. The brains are going to occidental universities, are abandoning their own languages for English or french language, and became alienated by the market and western values, while the poorest try to survive in his own country with hungry, sickness, death, wars, or to pass the sea to European Union abandoning his own culture in the depth of the sea or in an occidental city ghetto.<br/><br/>What do you think it's teaching us? The mental and cultural colonization of Afro-Americans and Africans, and the mental and cultural migration from America to Africa."

Looking back on it, I don't know that there is any one scene you could take out and it would still be the same, but three and a half hours is just way to long to be watching a movie that slow.<br/><br/>On the other hand though, the message in those ten minutes was so important, but I feel is over looked by most of the people who watch this movie. The ideas and values that Malcolm X had and how he changed through the movie culminated in his acceptance of white people and people of other religions. He saw that freedom, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are not characteristics of Muslims alone, rather that all man (almost all man) wants exactly what he wanted.

"hankhanks12345","9","4","11","9 March 2006"," Spike Lee's Great Epic
","Spike Lee is an uneven filmmaker: some of his films are great, some are, well, not. This is one of the great ones, probably the greatest.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are tremendous, led by Denzel Washington. What makes his achievement particularly impressive is that he essentially has to play two completely different characters. First, Malcolm Little, the fast-talking petty thief and hustler who travels back and forth from Boston to New York. And second, Malcolm X, the serious (but human) preacher and public face for the Nation of Islam. Both are utterly believable and essential for the success of the film. Secondary parts are also uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>The story of the film is very detailed. The movie follows the Alex Haley book pretty faithfully. Sure, there are a few things added to move things along. For instance, Malcolm's conversion in prison wasn't quite as dramatic as portrayed in the film (he had originally heard about Islam in letters from his family in Michigan, for instance). But by and large it was pretty close to the book. Perhaps even too faithful, considering that the movie clocks in at over 3 hours long. I think there may have been some things he could have taken out.<br/><br/>Malcolm X was a complex man. For good or ill, Malcolm X was not someone to do things with a partial effort. When he was a criminal, he was a determined, almost crazy criminal. When he converted to Elijah Muhammed's Nation of Islam, he believed in his heart and soul in that, and preached the NOI party line even though he himself was obviously a natural leader. When Elijah Muhammed betrayed him, he became a more orthodox Muslim and preached that with equal vigor. Hate him or love him (and over the years, he said many things which deservedly were met with scorn by blacks and whites alike), he was a force to be reckoned with, and this film does an admirable job of bringing that out."

The film depicts Malcolm X, who was taught ( brainwashed) into the thinking that he had to use everything that was ever taught by white men, and use those words against them. The film had a glimmer of hope, but was lost in translation at the direction Spike Lee chose to take it. It's sad. Truth be told, I really do like Spike Lee, I think he was born to be a filmmaker. Do The Right Thing was a very inspirational and very influential film for me in the late 80's, I got a lot of insight from prejudicial and racial tensions from watching that movie, and remains my favorite ( and only) Spike Lee film to date. Malcolm X just wants all blacks to hate whites for everything that we've supposedly done, which was all done wrong. It's our fault they are here. It's our fault they've been treated so badly. Malcolm X is a powerful, and very stressful film of its decade. But it takes about 17 to 20 minutes of material, and stretches it into an unbelievably unnecessary length of over three hours. Facts, facilities, and mindless quotes are stuffed down our throats. Black men cheer. White men hang their heads in shame. The fact is, all white men are not all bad, just like all black men are not all bad. The entire movie is just a parade of propaganda, boasting high levels of energy that can be felt and ripple down the spines of the affected. Spike Lee knows how to do his job. He's just using it for the wrong reasons. And I can't respect that. I won't ever show appreciation for it. We cannot hate the hater, we cannot hate, in general, we can only love and find inner peace, or thereby, we become unhappy, angry little piglets running around on the farm. Do we rise to power? Being a motivational speaker has great rewards, but with that comes responsibility. Teaching that its okay to hate the white men for wrong doings to all the black men, women, and children is a stereotype, we shouldn't be held responsible for captivity that happened before any of us were put on the map. It just isn't fair. Malcolm X is not a film for everyone, it's a film that depicts Malcolm X as a character, through the directors eyes. I want to know about the REAL Malcolm X. Was he really this wrathful? This hateful? The Nation of Islam is known to be associated with violence and terrorism acts. How can this Nation teach us anything but to hate? With that said, what I've seen, what I've gotten out of it, this is three and a half hour movie that teaches black people its okay to hate white people. Period. It's simple as that. And how can I have any love, respect, appreciation, like, or even any emotional attachment to such film? How can I relate? How can I cope? I can't! That's why I'm giving this 1 star!"

Based on his autobiography with slight parts edited in, updated or filled Spike Lee dares not to venture far from the source material giving this key figure in black activism an extremely accurate, albeit lengthy movie portrayal. Not backing down on a critique of the small-minded ""Nation of Islam"" Spike Lee also unabashedly takes on Malcolm X's point of view in the key breakaway from the movement by its biggest spokesperson.<br/><br/>A huge figure for black America is gifted a great cinematographic autobiography, which only flaw is being too short while running over 3 hours. Certain key aspects of Malcolm X's life are glossed over (like his prison term or the fate of his mother), as is a glaring under-focusing on post-Hajj era of Malcolm's career, the one which in all essence has the most profound and lasting impact, also is most cited and revered. The road from rags to moral riches is a passionate and convincing one, especially in the gifted hands of Denzel Washington, the only person worthy of an Oscar in 1993 for Best Actor. Starting of from a low-life cat with sticky fingers and a jail-bird through a period of religious fanaticism, until finally discovering his own voice is a spectacular journey through his career, one that could well last 2-3 more hours and still not bore. Flashes into childhood are overwhelmingly brilliant in building context, focus and vividly present the remarkable life of a true American hero."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","8","15 May 2012"," Does a good job with handling its subject.
","Actually I can be very short about this movie; it's one that serves its purpose and serves it well. It's a biopic that does nothing else but telling you all of the right required information you need to know about Malcolm X.<br/><br/>So it's a biopic and nothing more and nothing less really. You could say that this is enough, since it simply serves its purpose but I prefer a biopic with a clear story to it, that features a beginning, middle and end that are all connect and not a movie that chronicles the life of a person, through fragments. Or maybe at least something that makes the movie 'spectacular' and memorable to watch. Nothing about this movie stands out really. It remains on the safe side of things and I never felt really involved with the movie or any of its characters. It was like I was watching a moving history book. And again, there is nothing wrong with this but not the type of approach for a biopic that I prefer seeing.<br/><br/>But really, the movie does a good job at telling you the life story of Malcolm X. When you are too lazy or incapable of reading a book and documentaries perhaps aren't your thing but you would still like to learn about Malcolm X; this is a good way to do it! Personally I knew very little about him, which I realized all the more after finishing watching the movie. I'm glad I watched it and feel more enriched now. And even while that the movie is almost 4 hours long I'm sure that the movie left a lot of things out, deliberately or not, I feel like it did a more than great job at covering all of the fundamental things you need to know about its subject.<br/><br/>The one foremost thing I now especially respect Malcolm X for was that he made black people proud of their color and race, which also taught them to stand up for themselves and show them that they are worthy of all things that are great.<br/><br/>It's definitely a well told movie. After all, it's over 3 hours long, yet it never starts to feel overlong or tiresome. It probably is because the movie is always moving. It doesn't linger too long on just one particular period of Malcom X's life and is being set at lots of different locations. It never becomes a movie that drags or slows down too much in any way, which is a real accomplishment for a movie this long. Spike Lee deserves lots of credits for that!<br/><br/>The movie gets almost entirely carried by Denzel Washington, who earned a well deserved Oscar nomination for his leading role as Malcolm X. Even though he doesn't look very much like the real Malcolm X, he still convincingly becomes him through his acting and the love and passion he puts into his role. No doubt that a lot of the people involved shared a love and passion for its subject, which shows in the movie. You might question its objectivity because of that at times but it still makes this a good and more than maintaining movie to watch.<br/><br/>The movie also does a great job at capturing all of its different time periods, which the movie is taking place in. The movie also still manages to maintain one style throughout, which lets the movie feel like one big whole.<br/><br/>Well, I thought that I could be short about this movie but it seems like I failed at that. I could summarize it by saying that it's simply a really good biopic!<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"gelman@attglobal.net","8","3","8","13 September 2009"," Denzel Washington is Extremely Convincing
","Whatever one thinks of the Nation of Islam or of Malcolm X, this is an outstanding film with superb acting by Denzel Washington as Malcolm and by Angela Bassett as Dr. Betty Shabazz, his wife. Malcolm X was a complicated personality -- an ex-con who became an effective religious proselytizer for the Nation of Islam, who eventually turned against its leader, Elijah Muhummad, and who dropped the anti-white rhetoric toward the end of his life, just prior to his murder, presumably by agents of the Nation of Islam. Washington captures Malcolm X's complexities and makes his transitional moments -- from jailbird to religious convert to eloquent spokesman to rebel to spokesman for a different vision of Islam -- seem very real indeed. Angela Bassett is a shining presence as Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz. The tense period leading up to Malcolm's assassination is rendered with great skill. The movie might have been considered too controversial for the Motion Picture Academy. Otherwise, it would surely have won Denzel Washington an Oscar."
"mOVIemAN56","8","3","8","18 April 2007"," A film of power that gives an amazing look into the man's life
","I had the privilege to finally have the chance to view Spike Lee's film on the controversial black Nationalist Leader Malcolm X. The film is near a 3 1/2 hour biopic of the man named Malcom X who in 1960 opposed Martin Luther King Jr as one of the most important civil rights leader. With the controversial director Spike Lee behind the camera and Denzel Washington giving it his all on the screen, Malcolm X has stood the test of time since its release in 1992 and was a privilege to watch for me.<br/><br/>As stated above, the film is a biopic of Malcolm X. The story starts with his early 20's. He is a junkie, a thief, and a criminal in all aspects of life. The film has many flashbacks to give us an idea of his childhood and what he has endured thus far and why he is where he is. Soon he is sent to jail where he maintains his hostility towards life and all other people. But a transformation is on its way, one that will put him into the public spotlight and become one of the most influential members of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.<br/><br/>Now I usually don't watch many Spike Lee films. I respect his work and I have seen some of his work but I tend to not watch his films. Don't know why. Malcolm X to me is the best of his work I have seen. He tells a story, he doesn't lie to the viewers or tone anything down, he tells the story exactly how it was. This has drawn heavy criticism from the white community which views this film as a tad bit demeaning to their race and along with some racial overtones. <br/><br/>I myself am I white male and I did not find the movie to be racist. Yes there are the use of the word n*gger and several other racist names but these are not intended to single out an audience, it is part of the story. Spike Lee is a controversial director because he does not use stereotypes. He portrays people exactly how they are/were in life. He shows that not all white people in life are good, he shows not all black people in life are good. There is no controversy in my mind in this film.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is... how can I put it into words... MAGNIFICENT. His portrayal of Malcolm X is exactly how I picture the man to have been and that is human. A man who had the will to never give up and the ability to overcome any obstacle thrown at him in order to achieve his goal in life, to obtain equal rights for African Americans. Denzel shows all of this on screen through brilliant acting and character typing, something very hard to achieve.<br/><br/>At first I found the film to be a bit choppy. One second you're in one place, the next you're some place else. Characters coming in left and right, all within the first 20 minutes. It is quite confusing in the first 20 minutes. I do realize that Malcolm X's early days were confusing and he was probably trying to obtain that with the audience in order to relate to him but I still found the start to be a little much. But after the first 20 minutes, the film is spectacular. <br/><br/>The emotion behind Denzel's words and the support of the rest of the cast makes the acting in this some of the best I've seen. The cinematography and sets are top notch in their own respective areas. The film does go slow at a few parts near the middle and the end. It does grab your attention though when it needs you with a powerful montage of scenes to close out the film.<br/><br/>4/5 stars"

","If this film were made 40 years ago, it would have been relevant. A blockbuster? Definitely not. Most southern theaters would not have shown it. And the ones that did would have certainly faced, at the least, protests, vandalism and most likely financial ruin.<br/><br/>Fast forward twenty five years and those same southern theaters could show Malcolm X. Sure, there would be protests, but the theater owners would not have put their livelihoods on the line.<br/><br/>Today, this movie would be a cog in the cycle of the movie year.<br/><br/>How times have changed.<br/><br/>Watching Malcolm X today (5/20/06) for the umpteenth time, I was struck by how timeless it is. Made in 1992, it still plays as a current film. It is an outstanding movie; one that is studied and will continue to be studied for ages.<br/><br/>Regardless of your politics, the life and times of Malcolm Little as portrayed in Malcolm X is a true American story. In a capsule--suppression, poverty, education then success. His life was the triumph of an individual above all odds. The film celebrates the cognitive revelation of a truly exceptional person that changed not only the United States, but also the world for the better.<br/><br/>Purists will surely take umbrage with the liberal telling of his life story, but that is sour grapes. Malcolm X captures the essence of Malcolm Little as a man with a pure message. Glossing over the finer points and ignoring the message would be a travesty.<br/><br/>Any film connoisseur's library has this movie in stock."
"oyason","Null","3","8","3 April 2006"," larger than life but so Malcolm was
","It was almost inevitable that any work that attempted to tell the story of a personality as large as that of Malcolm X would fall into larger-than-life schematics and all too many Steven Spielburg skies. So it is particularly fitting that the first major film work done on the life of Malcolm, Spike Lee's MALCOLM X, was generated by one of U.S. film making's most controversial talents. MALCOLM X was released at a time when all too many Black Americans were hungry for work about African American icons that stepped outside of the Budweiser Corporation type representation of Black experience seen on tavern walls, so it shouldn't surprise that the first Black film maker to take on so ambitious a project sometimes fell into spectaclist technique. People need legends and heroes, and Malcolm is certainly a heroic figure.<br/><br/>Malcolm's story has become increasingly familiar to people outside the Black community. A man with a strong sense of self-identification from his youth, he moved through several identity changes, from shoeshine hustler to railroad porter to borderline gangster to convict to minister and organizer of the Nation of Islam, to the dynamic articulator of African American struggle that he was in his final push for the Organization of African American Unity. His life was the flip side of what is called the American Dream, and when he was murdered at the age of 39 in 1965, he was well on his way to becoming the leader of a revolutionary democratic insurgence in the United States. In short, his life was the stuff of legend.<br/><br/>So along comes Spike Lee, and assembles this remarkable cast in telling the story of his life: Denzel Washington as Malcolm, Angela Basset as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Mohammed, Delroy Lindo as Malcolm's street ""mentor"" West Indian Archie, Albert Hall as his prison associate, Brother Baines, and Giancarlo Esposito as one of Malcolm's assassins, Thomas Hayer. There are numerous cameos from Hollywood glitterati, and even unlikely personalities such as the late and notorious radical attorney William Kuntsler appears in this film as the judge who sentences Malcolm to his prison term. There are also a number of clever black and white footages that, when shot, bore so close a resemblance to the newsreels some of us grew up with, they become difficult to tell from the originals. Denzel comes that close to the real man's carriage and timbre.<br/><br/>I do regret that Spike Lee did not feel the need to acknowledge the contributions made to his screenplay posthumously by James Baldwin. It seems to me several portions of this film are loosely lifted from Baldwin's stillborn film biography of Malcolm, ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOST. But I suppose that's an issue for the legatees of Baldwin's estate to work out with Lee.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this was a timely film (1992), Disney-like crescendos and all. The movie was released in the wake of the Los Angeles Riots that followed the verdict on the LAPD beating of Rodney King. The work gave younger and older Black people an event to talk about and do some mutually respectful sharing of ideas about cultural integrity and critique, and if that's all Spike Lee accomplished with MALCOLM X, that's good enough for me."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","3","8","24 March 2006"," A very in depth and big swallow of a movie
","Malcolm X, I wrote a paper on him for my political science class and this man, even though I didn't agree with most of his views, he was a very fascinating man. So, I was excited to see Malcolm X and learn a little bit more of his life or Spike Lee's eyes of the man. This is an incredible movie, I mean 3 1/2 hours! Wow, I couldn't believe that I made it.<br/><br/>The acting and sets are just over the top but very impressive. The story seemed very accurate, but over all it made me very angry on how people treat each other. It always did hurt me that people could be so vicious to each other. But I think that's why I could understand Malcolm was a very angry man, but I remember reading that he was having a change of his views before his murder. So I give him a lot of credit because life is too short to hold on to so much anger. Malcolm X is a great movie and I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"suhan","9","3","8","28 August 2005"," The reality is out there
","This movie is about reality. The reality which we see and live in everyday although we don't do, say or think anything about it.<br/><br/>Racism was and still is a problem of human-beings. People still judge others by their colors or by their looks. People still judge others by the religion they practice (Or even if its only written on their id cards). People like Malcolm X are still needed on this earth. Power still has the same effect on humans. People who have the power to change doesn't mainly create change. The power changes them. They get obsessed with power. They don't use the power, the power starts using them.<br/><br/>Now lets get to the movie. The director is Spike Lee and therefore naturally, the movie has an aggressive touch to it. There is also an aggressivity to the screenplay as well. However, regarding the days that Malcolm X has lived through, this can be understood.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is one my favorite actors today and the reason is he is incredibly capable of wearing the pants of the character he is to play. He has done a great job in this movie and in others as well. It is a great pleasure to watch him featuring as Malcolm X himself.<br/><br/>In fact there is not much needed to be said. It is a great movie, but the story being told in the movie is much more important. The person who is picturized in the movie is just a symbol of that era, but what he said and tried to explain is still valid today and unfortunately will be valid for every minority society in the world."
"wellsortof","9","3","8","9 July 2005"," more fulfilling once you've read the book
","This is the second time I've watched this movie. I watched it about 8 years ago without much knowledge of the person, and still enjoyed it. The second time, I read the autobiography first, then re-watched the movie, and really enjoyed it. The recently released special edition 2-DVD set has a really good making of featurette, plus a 90-minute documentary made in 1972 on Malcolm's life. All were quite good. But, back to the movie.<br/><br/>This is, by most accounts, a sprawling epic. Spike Lee wanted to make a movie on the scale of Laurence of Arabia (itself nearly 4 hours long), and felt that Malcolm X had enough subject matter to do so. After reading the autobiography, that makes sense. Some have issues with the first hour, since it details Malcolm's life before he enters jail and gets static. In this case, Spike follows the book quite well, because the book is very detailed BEFORE Malcolm enters jail. I had no real problems with it, although I was surprised that it was an hour before the change started. But Spike gave a great picture of what Malcolm's life was like before he converted to Islam, which was important to see the transformation. And, if nothing else, Malcolm's life was transforming fast.<br/><br/>The politics of the film (that the Nation of Islam doesn't receive the blunt of the attack) deserve a comment. Reading the book made me understand that Malcolm would not completely shun the entire Black Muslim movement because those tenets brought him out of misery and gave him a new life. With that type of history, a person as self-educated as Malcolm would understand that he can't just dismiss those who helped him out. Hindsight is 20/20, which some critics didn't totally realize.<br/><br/>The Oscar question...this movie suffered two major snubs. Spike Lee should have at least been nominated for best director. Knowing the story of making the film should have appealed to the emotions of the academy, along with the scope of the story. And Denzel Washington was robbed, which is common knowledge at this point. I watched the 1972 Malcolm X documentary, and there are times where you think Malcolm X was doing a Denzel impression...that's how good Denzel is in this movie. Right up there with the transformations of Jamie Foxx in Ray and Val Kilmer in The Doors. Essentially, Denzel didn't win because the academy had somehow managed not to give Al Pacino an Oscar for works such as, oh, I don't know, THE GODFATHER 1/2, SERPICO, DOG DAY AFTERNOON etc. So Denzel wins best actor later for Training Day, even though Russell Crowe probably deserved it more in Beautiful Mind. But then, Crowe won for Gladiator the year before even though Tom Hanks (Cast Away) or Ed Harris (Pollock) was more deserving. The Oscars can be a nasty cycle.<br/><br/>I've said enough. I look forward to your comments."

","I can't say that I'm particularly knowledgeable about Malcolm X - the controversial black nationalist leader assassinated in the '60's. Having said that, I really felt that this movie provided an insight into the life and growth of a truly fascinating man, who was brought to life superbly by Denzel Washington. I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington's work, and think he's one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This is perhaps the best performance I've seen from him in a lengthy list of great performances. It seemed to me as I watched that Washington was having an almost out of (his own) body experience, truly becoming Malcolm X, as Malcolm's life was traced from his childhood, as the son of a black preacher who was killed by the KKK, to life as a young man as a hoodlum, to time in prison where he converted to Islam, through to his ultra-black nationalist stage and finally to a more moderate point, in which he was willing to work with others (even whites) - which earned him the hatred of the radical Nation of Islam, and eventually led to his death.<br/><br/>The supporting performances here were fine, but you won't really remember them. This is Denzel Washington's movie. There are a few scenes that perhaps go on a little bit too long, but there's not really very much to criticize here. 8/10"
"rajdoctor","8","3","9","24 March 2008"," Malcolm X
","I being from India had heard of a revolutionary person called Malcolm X from US, who was shot dead at a young age, but did not know much about it. So when Malcolm X was referred to by African staying in UK as one of the most influential thinker, I thought let me see this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" co-written by Alex Haley and published in 1966 one year after Malcolm X's murder. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X.<br/><br/>The movie narrates the story of a kid Malcolm, as a bright student who is not allowed to study further due to people's prejudice towards black. As a youth Malcolm leads a smoke, drug, alcohol, sex and burglary life that lands him in prison. In prison, he is influenced by a man named Bimbi, and the teachings of Islam through a prophet Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm studies and graduates from prison and joins Nation of Islam organisation of Elijah Muhammad. Here he takes the causes of African people, preachers and gives speeches against the atrocities of white people. He demands the right of African people who are here in American by default and not their own will. His daring outspokenness makes him popular among Africans and controvesial figure, but this also isolates him from everyone. He is thrown out of Nation of Islam and after a pilgrimage to Mecca his outlook changes a little bit and he starts his own organisation Muslim Mosque Inc. Within a few months he is shot dead.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie to understand who was Malcolm X? If someone does not want to read his life story and get incite in 3 hours. Hats off and kudos to Spike Lee, who undertook this daring project of great scale and magnitude, when he was only 35 years of age. No doubt that Spike Lee is considered one the best directors of Hollywood. Denzel Washington is so authentic in the role of Malcolm X, that it is hard to believe anyone else in that role. He lives the role to its cells. There is also an uncanny resemblance of Denzel with Malcolm X. Brilliant! It is so sad that Denzel did not win an Oscar that year  may be a reality check on his being black!!? One gets a very good idea of Malcolm X through this movie. He was a confused person, and one gets an impression that as lots of lost minds, he too got a hook in to cling on. Like Christianity, Judiasm, Hinduism, Nationalism etc. Malcolm also found his hook called Islam. Many things he spoke were so true and he dared to speak it out loud and clear. The only problem was he became mis-represented because he was wearing a garb of Black Muslim in American society.<br/><br/>The build up to the movie is slow and it takes nearly 1 hour for the movie to actually take hold of one's attention. The editing could have had been more tight. The most diluting part of the movie was its ending where Spike tried to normalize his life to a caricature black leader. Spike showed a street named Malcolm X, he made Nelson Mandela speak for Malcolm X, he made small children rant  ""I am Malcolm X"" and it was so sorry and laughable to see that at the end of such a wonderful and dramatic life story.<br/><br/>I think there was no need to explain or justify Malcolm X, the presentation of his life's story was in itself enough. That's all  nothing more. Like any other leader we see  Malcolm X was also a great confused leader.<br/><br/>(Stars 7.5 out of 10)"
"Howlin Wolf","7","3","9","2 August 2006"," The under-appreciated power of 'balance'.
","Disappointingly I felt, the majority of this film is devoted to the time of his life when Malcolm X was self-admittedly in error. In later years he was an inspirational man, but I spent most of the film hating him and the aggressive ideals he adopted for so long before his eventual renunciation. Unfortunately it seemed Lee was more interested in his dubious activities, instead of giving equal weight to BOTH sides of such a complex character.<br/><br/>I understand that 'length' would have been a concern in evaluating this, but here is where I think Lee and his editor could have been more judicious in selecting crucial points of emphasis. They were certainly different men in a lot of ways, but in ""Ali"" I think Michael Mann did a much better job of capturing the overall essence of a person by zeroing in on pivotal moments and excising as much of what could be thought 'supplementary material' as possible. I still gave grudging respect to the composition even at times when I was dissatisfied with the path taken, though, because undeniably the scenes are exceptionally well-realised and blended together, throughout.<br/><br/>If Spike had tried to balance it out and given more of the running time to Malcolm's conciliatory efforts then I would most likely be saying it was a masterpiece and calling it an honest and just portrait. When such a large amount of coverage is devoted to an 'unsavoury' element, it makes it seem almost as if 'extremism' is what we should most remember the man for. It isn't. I bitterly regret that what we were handed does not represent the 'even spread' that it should have."
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","3","9","23 July 2006"," Spike Lee's best by a country mile.
","It's a good thing Spike Lee was finally able to scrape together the necessary funds to finish this film and make it his way. Lee had never made anything even close to this good before it, and will likely never make anything this good in the future. His low-budget films are usually watchable, but ultimately too self-indulgent to really hit the mark completely. Malcolm X however is nothing short of great film-making. Denzel Washington couldn't have done it any better as allows the slain civil rights activist to in essence rise from the dead and acquaint himself with a whole new generation.<br/><br/>The film clocks in at an amazing 202 minutes. That's three hours and twenty-two minutes for those who might not be used to seeing films longer than an hour and a half. Despite the film's length, it is so well made that none of it really causes the viewer to daydream. Maybe we didn't need to see so much of Malcolm's life prior to his conversion to Islam, but I did not regret seeing so much of it. We see almost everything illegal from his past: drugs, robbery, racketeering, you name it. Malcolm was into some serious stuff in his youth. The film hits it's stride once he's sent to prison and meets up with one of the higher-ups from the Nation of Islam. We see Malcolm take to his new religion like a fish to water, and once he gets out of jail, he's preaching the gospel of the honorable Elijah Muhammad to anyone who'll listen.<br/><br/>Over time, we see Malcolm rise to great prominence within the Nation, until he eventually runs afoul of the leadership and has to start his own ministry. Once this happens, Malcolm is a marked man, and his violent demise is just a matter of time. Malcolm only lived to age 39, and Spike Lee shows us just about everything of note within his lifespan.<br/><br/>The film has numerous strengths. It is incredibly well directed, acted, written, and photographed. The supporting cast all hit the right notes with their roles. Delroy Lindo plays Malcolm's old number running boss. Albert Hall is cold and stoic as the man who introduces Malcolm to Islam, then later turns against him. Angela Basset is typically outstanding as Malcolm's wife Betty. Has this woman ever given a bad performance in anything? Al Freman Jr. is also quite memorable as Elijah Muhammad. When all is said and done, he is the character we the audience wish to know more about. Spike Lee is also there as you might expect in the early scenes as Malcolm's hustler friend Shorty.<br/><br/>This film belongs to Washington, though. Many who remembered the real Malcolm X claim his performance is right on in physical and spoken terms. Washington was nominated, but lost out to Al Pacino (Scent of a Woman) for the Best Actor nod. Was this justified? Hard to say. Al can be tough to beat.<br/><br/>The film was a decent enough success at the box office to the point where you would have thought Lee would try bigger films like this more often. He hasn't produced anything nearly as good since, but he's his own man and he's presumably making the kinds of films he wants to.<br/><br/>By all means necessary, Malcolm X is worth 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"sol-","Null","2","5","21 February 2016"," Becoming a revered public figure
","Right from the opening credits in which an American flag slowly burns to form a letter 'X', this biography of the title human rights activist from Spike Lee is riveting viewing throughout. The film's strongest asset is Denzel Washington's lead performance; he undergoes several character progressions throughout as the film documents his whole transformation from convicted criminal to angry protester to revered public figure. The film benefits from some magnificent editing too with well-melded, dreamlike childhood flashbacks, a clever cutaway in which Washington imagines throw a cake in a condescending young man's face and some very deliberate cutting in a scene in which he looks up the definitions of 'black' and 'white' in the dictionary (probably the most potent part of the entire movie). The Oscar nominated costumes (zoot suits in particular) are great too. What does not quite work so well though is Lee's choice to unabashedly celebrate the title character. The sentimental epilogue seems ill-judged. Also, given how callous Malcolm is shown at times (coldly telling a sympathetic young white woman that she cannot do anything to help his cause) and how close-minded he is on certain issues, he always seems like more a deeply flawed man with his heart in the right place than a leader worthy of Lee's celebratory treatment. Never to mind, the film is engaging the whole way through, regardless of how one views the title character, with nary a boring moment to be had - which is a quite remarkable achievement for a that film clocks in at over three hours in length."

That may make it powerful and artistic, but it is hard to compete with ""Malcolm X"", which tells true history and explains much about the black man's plight in America. And with Denzel Washington, one of the greatest actors, in the lead, it is hard to deny its wide appeal.<br/><br/>Lee is a great director for pushing ""black cinema"" (if such a thing exists).

Probably the movie would have been more exciting and would have kept my attention more if I had watched the movie first.<br/><br/>While the book is a life changing one (nominated by The Times as one of the 10 most important books of the 20th century) the movie has more and less successful parts in portraying Malcolm's life.<br/><br/>While it catches your attention and does a great job showing the youth of Malcolm, in my opinion it fails to present the many long years he spent in prison and developed a widespread knowledge that allowed him to become a great debater from close to no education before and only showed flashes from his 12 years spent in the Nation of Islam. Still, the movie's 3,5 hour long - little too long for me.<br/><br/>After reading the book I felt he was a great teacher and fighter for human and minority rights while after watching the movie I had the feeling that he indeed preached hate - as many of his critics claimed."

","During the war years in Boston, Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) and his friend Shorty (Spike Lee) are zoot suit wearing, hair-straightening negroes about town. His father was a preacher in Nebraska urging a return to Africa and killed by the KKK. His mother was born to a black woman raped by a white man. He is taken by Sophia (Kate Vernon) and gangster West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He leaves his innocent black girlfriend and goes into a life of crime. Malcolm and Shorty are imprisoned for 10 years of hard times. In prison, he is befriended by Baines who introduces him to Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. He falls in love with Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett).<br/><br/>Director Spike Lee dives into a fascinating historical figure with the great Denzel Washington. His charisma is perfectly translated and transformed on the screen. That's not to say there are no problems in this movie. The pacing is a little slow at times. I don't want Spike Lee to act in this movie. It's too much of a distraction. Spike does lay out his life very well and leaves it up to audience to some extent on what his life truly means. The movie probably needs somebody with less reverence to be more merciless in the editing room."
"p-leipold1","8","2","5","9 December 2014"," Malcolm X Review
","Malcolm X serves as great companion to the original text. The autobiography provides an extremely detailed overview of Malcolm's life but lacks any feeling. The film corrects this by injecting emotion into the story. Spike Lee creates a narrative that is easier for the viewer to follow and relate with Malcolm. However, the film had to sacrifice a lot of information provided in the autobiography. Many parts that I thought were important, such as Malcolm's family, were left out in the interest of time. Even then the film is around 3 hours long and feels more like two films in one. This might have been done by Lee to emphasize the change in Malcolm's life before and after prison. In the first part of the film, Lee applies a soft focus to the camera. The soft focus clouds the screen and might have been a representation of Malcolm's unclear thoughts about life before he went to prison. Another example of Lee's cinematography is when Malcolm submits to Islam while in prison. Malcolm is completely covered by shadows with a light piercing through the cell bars. This could represent the moment Malcolm ridded himself of his sinful identity (shadows) and embraced Allah (light). The acting in the film was phenomenal, especially Denzel Washington's performance as Malcolm X. Washington not only looked the part but seemed to fully portray the essence of Malcolm. When I read the novel, Washington was exactly how I imagined Malcolm X to look and act. My only other issue with the movie was the final scene with the schoolchildren and Nelson Mandela. While it was interesting, it felt disjointed from the rest of movie and was distracting. In all the film was great and can definitely stand on its own but I feel the best experience is to pair reading the novel and watching the film."

","Spike Lee's adaptation of the Autobiography of Malcolm X is a masterpiece that brings the world's understanding and connection to Malcolm one step closer. Spike Lee's use of filter changes and diegetic sound through the course of the film portrays Malcolm's change in consciousness and the direction of his life. In the first part of the movie we see Malcolm's life as a young man and later a hustler. Colors are seen as bright and vivid which adds to a cartoonish sense of his actions in this part of his life. The conking and zoots suits all seem surreal as to portray Malcolm's reflection of his past. Behind these scenes, jazz music is constantly playing as if the backdrop of a cartoon. In the novel, Malcolm explains that he now knows how such things were all apart of the white man's power over blacks and sees his past as childish. Spike lee later illustrates the dramatic change of Malcolm's life when he is sent to prison, by changing the filter and making shots longer and a darker contrast. Spike Lee shows this darkness at a peak when Malcolm is locked in solitary confinement. The pitch black scene is frighting and the blinding that follows when the door is opened seems divine. Soon after he is brought out of the darkness, he finds Islam with the help of a fellow inmate. Spike Lee, with this use of dark and light contrast, as well as the removal of the diegetic jazz music, shows Malcolm X's change in his life and his path to Islam being his escape from the white man's oppression. I really appreciated this use of contrast to the previous scenes of his life as a hustler. Spike Lee through this contrast was able to present Malcolm's transformation more personally to the viewer than they would have if they had only read the autobiography. As the film progresses from then on, it is a more biographical, informative, representation of Malcolm's life but keeps the personal connection Spike Lee created in the first half intact with many close up shots of Malcolm X. When you reach the final death scene in the film, you truly feel the loss of an important man. The connection that Spike Lee creates with his film can not be overlooked and is only a part of what makes this film an amazing piece of art."
"jstannard2943","8","2","5","8 December 2014"," Well Done Indeed Mr. Lee
","Spike Lee does a good job with this film. He uses different techniques to show different moods in the film such as the use of different colors. In the opening scene when Spike Lee is walking down the street and into the barber show the viewer can see a variety of bright, vibrant colors by making the sky bright, his clothing vivid and gives a soft focus to the lens. He does this to show the good times and the happy feelings that are going on in Boston without actually saying it. Also during the movie he uses different camera filters to film the same action by using black and white, like a TV would show. He does this to give whats going on a more real feel to the event in the movie to make it seem like it is more an actual event rather than just a film. However, my only concerns are that he hardly gives an exposition of his earlier life. Yes, he does touch on Malcolm's childhood but he doesn't really explain how his dad died or what he did during his teen years as a hustler. I understand that this movie is very long as it is however that period in his life had a large impact on his life going forward and what he believed in when he was an adult. This film mostly focuses on his life as an adult and an active member of the Nation of Islam. Other than skipping the first part of the book for the most part, he does a fine job at getting most of the details in the latter half of his life."
"thornton-clin","9","2","5","8 December 2014"," Great film.
","The film Malcolm X is extremely well done and a must see movie for any American citizen. Spike Lee does a spectacular job directing this film; he uses amazing lighting techniques throughout the film, Lee first uses a high-key glow behind the white woman that Malcolm notices when he is on a date with his black girlfriend. This high-key glow behind Sophia makes her look angelic and almost like a trophy, Lee uses this type of lighting on Sophia to make the viewer feel just as intrigued by Sophia as Malcolm does. Lee then uses a foggy filter with extremely dim lighting during most of Malcolm's life as a hustler. Lee uses this powerful technique to emphasize how cloudy Malcolm's judgment was at that point in his life. When Malcolm is sentenced to prison the lighting changes almost drastically, Lee shows Malcolm sitting in a cell with absolutely no light this technique allows the viewer to feel just as lost as Malcolm. Lee then uses high-key lighting to shine on Malcolm when the door is opened. The high-key lighting in this scene is used as a turning point in Malcolm's life and a symbol of Elijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad was first introduced to Malcolm in the shower where sound played in unison with the lighting. Lee uses diegetic sound in this scene, you hear the sound of the shower water slamming against the ground, and the ground is acting as a resistance to the flow of the water just as Malcolm is acting as a resistance to the nation of Islam. Once again Lee did an amazing job on this film and every American should take a few hours out of their life to watch it, because it gives us a better grasp and realization on the truth of our nation's history."
"cashemcg","7","2","5","8 December 2014"," A Must See for Everyone
","Spike Lee's Malcolm X is one of the most influential and underrated films in our history, now I don't want to say that it is the best movie I've ever seen nor Spike Lee's best film but it is one that deserves appreciation and recognition. Spike Lee allows the viewers a chance to look into the actual life of Malcolm X. There are many misconceptions swirling around the life of Malcolm X but this movie gives a clearer view of his actual life before his activism for the black community. Although Lee eliminates a majority of his childhood from the film he compensates by expanding his adult life.<br/><br/>Lee's soundtrack is one that moves the movie in many different directions and every song has meaning and emotion behind it. Malcolm's hustler days are accompanied by upbeat jazz music, while his time is jail has no music at all, in the time close to his death Sam Cook's iconic ""A Change is Gonna Come"", is played shorty before. These and many other choices in music are used to convey a whirlwind of emotions and send the viewer on a journey with Malcolm as apposed to the disconnect some receive with the novel, where readers feel like they are being preached to.<br/><br/>There is also a great use of long shots in the film, especially when there are large groups of people. In these long shots Malcolm is always seen, and easily identified. Lee allows the viewers to get a sense of how large the movement was along with the chance to see how important Malcolm was to the movement as a whole. Lee focuses on the Nation of Islam and the experience in Mecca was one that made Malcolm X seem as regular as you and I and not this iconic figure.<br/><br/>Overall the film does what it's supposed to do, given the time restraints. Lee and the actors, Denzel Washington especially, do a great job of allowing the legacy of Malcolm X to live on. This is why the last 5-10 minutes are so beneficial as they capture flashes of life before and after his death. It personally stirs a immense amount of emotion within me and is a timeless film that I'd never forget."
"manolamarco","8","2","5","8 December 2014"," Very Influential movie
","Spike Lee's Malcolm X is one of the most influential movies made to this day. It covers one of the most controversial figures in U.S history and tells his story bravely. Although it does it very differently from the book, I would say it does a better job. The book is honest and helps you get to know Malcolm and understand his point of view, and why he is who he is. While the movie captures the emotion and shows what an inspirational figure Malcolm X really is. Spike Lee does a great job of staying true to the story, but at the same time you like Malcolm more in the movie. Lee uses a lot of Lowkey lighting in the first half of the movie and filters to give this Hollywood-Esq feel to the movie. Personally I did not find this effective and thought the movie lacked a lot of content at the beginning. The way his childhood flashbacks were showed was not effective as well. Quick transitions into them and very fast pacing during them. Its not until Malcolm goes to jail when the movie becomes alive. The intense natural lighting with the darks, reflects Malcolm's mood as he is lost in life and wonders what is next in life for him. Spike Lee's most noticeable technique is his very long movement shots. The shot were brother Bane is talking to the inmates in Jail outside was one of the best shots in the whole movie in my opinion. Its a long tracking shot going left to right, as he speaks to them. Its a medium shot that views only their face and some of their body language. It is very effective as you view how Bane's words affect these inmates. Although the first half was questionable, the second half of the movie does a spectacular job of recovering and I think you can easily look past it."
"owsoto29","8","2","5","8 December 2014"," Fantastic Movie
","Malcolm X captured the true feeling of what it was like during his era. Using lighting techniques such as soft focus and low light creates this mysterious feel. Personally, I had no idea about Malcolm's hustling past. The film does focus on his hustling past for most of the movie and explains how he wound up becoming a Muslim. The film emphasizes the feel of Malcolm's hustling life very well. Dull/darker colors, up- tempo jazz music in the background are just to name a few. While you follow Malcolm through his hustling life, Spike Lee does a great job of trying to intrigue you and bring you into the movie physically and emotionally. <br/><br/>In one scene, Malcolm sits in with West Indian Archie. Spike Lee does a great job of showing both Malcolm's progression and the progression through the times. Brighter suits began to stand out more and darker, neutral suits began to be the standard. Malcolm sports his bright red suit and Archie's henchman begin to mock him for it. <br/><br/>Malcolm's transformation into a Muslim is very intriguing through the movie. Lee integrates Malcolm X's real speeches into Denzel Washington's speeches and they just turn out beautiful. Denzel really sells his part and just pulls you into his emotions and thoughts. Because Lee focuses on Malcolm's hustling past a little more than Malcolm's Muslim life, you begin to feel very connected with Malcolm. It just leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. You want to know what happens next. <br/><br/>Overall, Malcolm was a great movie. The only downfall of the movie was that it could've been made a little bit shorter. But if you're willing to sit through and watch all of it, it'll be worth it. Lee's use of lighting, color, and camera positions immerse you in the film. Denzel does a great job at becoming Malcolm X and I don't see anyone else portraying Malcolm better than him. I highly recommend this movie to anyone trying to learn about the great Malcolm X."
"zeller-liam","9","2","5","7 December 2014"," not just a thumbs up
","Spike Lee's adaptation of Malcolm X showcases the major events in Malcolm X's life while still portraying specific events without unnecessarily prolonging the film. Lee divides the film into two major chapters: Malcolm's life as a hustler and his life after discovering Islam. During Malcolm's years as a hustler, Lee uses a constant and upbeat soundtrack to give a glamorous feel to life as a hustler. The soundtrack romanticizes Malcolm's life as a hustler in an attempt to portray the double standard in Hollywood. This double standard is that when whites are participating in illegal activities in films, it is often romanticized, however when blacks are seen participating in illegal activities, it is seen as negative. Lee's romanticism of Malcolm's hustling draws parallels to Malcolm's work to advance black society. <br/><br/>In the scene when Malcolm talks to Elijah Muhammad after discovering the accusations against Elijah Muhammad, Lee uses lighting to portray Elijah Muhammad's guilt. Lee uses light from outside a window to cast shadows of the blinds over Elijah Muhammad's face. The shadows are black lines across Elijah Muhammad's face, causing the viewer to think of prison bars. These implied prison bars show both Elijah Muhammad's guilt and Malcolm's loss of faith in Elijah Muhammad. <br/><br/>While someone who read Malcolm X's autobiography may be disappointed that some scenes were eliminated from the film, it cannot be reasonably expected for every story from the book be portrayed in the film. With that said, Lee does an excellent job in including the most important scenes and also developing an atmosphere around those scenes. This atmosphere makes it obvious to see from a few frames of the film if it is during Malcolm's days as a hustler or his years as a preacher of Islam and black unity."
"vanlinden-noel","9","2","5","7 December 2014"," Spike Lee creates great emotion!
","Malcolm X was a fantastic movie that should have won an Oscar, if not for best movie than for Denzel Washington's performance as Malcolm X. Spikes Lee's style pairs beautifully with the complex topic surrounding Malcolm X. Spike Lee portrays the beginning of Malcolm's life through a rose colored lens. Lee shoots Malcolm's young days as a hustler in a softer, foggier lens than the rest of the movie. The way it is filmed sets an almost light hearted and ignorant tone for the start of the film. After Malcolm gets placed in jail, the way the movie is filmed changes. Spike Lee now displays the film through sharp images. This gives the movie a more serious feel and present Malcolm's new perspective of life in a very direct way. In the scene with the dictionary, Spike Lee uses camera movement to highlight the significant words in the definitions on the page. The camera jumps from word to word on the pages of the dictionary, focusing on important words such as ""black"" and ""evil"". It helps us understand Malcolm's agitation as he discovers that white people have been defining black as a bad and devilish thing for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>The Autobiography of Malcolm X which was written by Alex Haley was a very unemotional book. It seemed to tell the story of Malcolm's life in a list format. The movie on the other hand was very emotional. There were many scenes that didn't even need the sound placed in it, to convey the emotion in it. One scene is when Malcolm and his wife Betty are preparing for their wedding. Spike places them very close to each other and sets the camera close to them to give the scene an intimate feel. He films it from a side profile view allowing the actors to interact face to face without the camera feeling like it is intervening. This emotion is what makes this movie outstanding instead of just a good movie. I highly recommend it for anyone who is trying to understand who Malcolm was and why he and his followers acted as they did. It can really change someone's perspective on life and displays some of the problems in society that have yet to be solved."
"chloe-boensch","8","2","5","7 December 2014"," No History is Complete Without it.
","Spike Lee was right to say Malcolm X was ""the picture he was born to make."" Lee directed a film in 1992, which in 2014 and as long as humans exist, will be prevalent in time. It allows the audience to witness the connectedness of the black community while also displaying the disunity. After a fantastical long opening shot with Malcolm parading through the streets of Harlem in his new and vibrant zoot suit the viewer is placed into a magnificent room with what seems to be at least a hundred black men and women dancing, carefree. The camera continually focuses on Malcolm, or another couple dancing, and then zooms out to see most or all of the room, as a whole. The energy and vast shot gives an enormous sense of unity. Similarly, in the beginning scenes of Malcolm coming to be apart of Elijah Muhammad's teachings in prison, the links between the black men with him become apparent. As Bibi's voice tells of the horrors the white men have committed and the reasons they must break away from them, the camera pans across countless black men's sorrowful faces laid over mournful music. The close ups powerfully demonstrate the true feelings, for the words being said, and the enlightenment they have received. <br/><br/>In contrast the unity between the black community, the scene and moment in Malcolm's life which tells him he cannot be ""anything he wants to be"" is very effective. Malcolm's White teacher stands in the front of the row of desks Malcolm sits in. However, Malcolm is in the very last seat. The distance between the two seems to grow as the teacher scoffs at the idea of Malcolm becoming a lawyer and the cuts between the two reveal the many desks and space separating them.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Lee portrays Malcolm as he truly was. He was not an advocate of violence, as many believe. This is presented best when he leads Muslims to the police station after one of their brothers was hurt and arrested. They march in twos and are militant, but reserved. The long shot confirms there is no violence about them, only the angry observers who joined and followed. When they received entry to see him and called an ambulance they then marched once again, peacefully. <br/><br/>Although the film can seem long at times, the momentum never fails to pick up with quick cuts and gripping acting from Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast. No one's ""Black History,"" let alone American History is complete without the visual, sound, and knowledge that comes with this film."
"vroomvroommercedes","9","2","5","7 December 2014"," The Story that Can't Be Told Enough
","**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Spike Lee has beautifully captured the aesthetic essence of Malcolm X's journey throughout his life with his technical cinematic choices. Spike Lee has a gift of knowing how to draw audiences into the scene that he has beautifully crafted for them. In the beginning of the movie, he makes sure to give Malcolm's boisterous life as a hustler a dream-like luster by using many soft focus shots as well as soft lighting to really accentuate vibrant colors in the background and in the wardrobe of the characters. To highlight Malcolm's hustling lifestyle even further, many of the shots used contain constant movement, and upbeat music. Whether it be the camera moving or the subjects in the shot moving, there is always movement to make the audience feel like they're living this fast-paced life alongside Malcolm Little accompanied by a soundtrack to set the mood. However, Spike Lee throws the audience into a wall after Malcolm is arrested. Each shot becomes longer, the focus becomes sharper, and high-key lighting is used to painfully chisel out every expression on each character's face. This dramatic shift in aesthetic lets the audience know that this is where Malcolm Little begins his ascension to becoming Malcolm X. Up until Malcolm starts to run into some real adversity with the Nation of Islam, each shot moves with Malcolm in its focus to help portray his new focused and centered state of mind, his maturity. Once he reaches the point where he has become a target of the general public as well as the Nation of Islam, Lee uses low key lighting to produce shadows on the characters and their surroundings, making each scene more suspenseful leading up to Malcolm X's death. After Malcolm X is killed, Spike Lee chooses to bring the message of Malcolm X into a more contemporary scene, using children repeating the words ""I am Malcolm X"" straight into the camera, as well as a cameo of Nelson Mandela reciting some words of wisdom at the very end. Many may think that the ending of the movie is excessive, however I believe that Spike Lee does this on purpose to make sure that the legacy of Malcolm X resonates among his audiences by using the same methodology we are taught in school, ""If you say it/write it enough times, you'll remember it."" Though I have read the book before watching the movie, I give it a 9 out of 10 based on Spike Lee's ability to take so much information about a great man's life, artistically compile it into a movie that is a little over three hours, and still convey an important message about Malcolm X's life. Well done."
"moira97","8","2","5","7 December 2014"," Transcends the Written Autobiography
","Spike Lee brings several of the very important themes and ideas that appear in The Autobiography of Malcolm X into focus and to a new level in his epic biography Malcolm X. In the autobiography, as told to Alex Haley, readers typically only experience events through Malcolm's eyes as he goes through his every day life, seeing what Malcolm sees and hearing his thoughts. The film, on the other hand, transcends Malcolm's mind and not only gives viewers his take on the world but also provides perspectives and emotions from multiple points of view, which pushes viewers to a deeper understanding of Malcolm X's positions and more direct confrontation of the tensions of race conflicts in the USA. <br/><br/>In the film, Lee spends the first portion of the movie glorifying Malcolm's hustler life through exaggerated composition to highlight the contrast between reality, shown in flashbacks, and the pretend world of the hustle. The characters' movements, the almost constant upbeat and jazzy non-diegetic music, the soft focus background, and the surrounding calm and happy colors with an almost orange filter almost make the scenes look unrealistic. Lee's creative use of this exaggerated composition helps to set up the delusion of the white world ""hustler Malcolm"" lives in. For instance in one scene, Washington (Malcolm) and Lee himself (Shorty) are running through the park enclosed by soft and happy colors and non-diegetic jazzy music with their conked hair and zoot suits, adopting white mainstream cultural influences with pretending to be "" Cops and Robbers"" and taking on the roles of white actors of the time. Lee's composition in these scenes purposefully contrasts with the reality of Malcolm's real, early-life experiences. The only time the viewers get a hint of the reality of Malcolm's actual past is when Lee cuts to choppy, fast, and somewhat confusing scenes flashback scenes. In these flashbacks the viewers get thrown into a direct contrast to the previous shots of the hustler life Malcolm was living and his future life as a Muslim minister. There is more low-key lighting and a darker, vintage filter, helping viewers understand that these shots are serious and realistic and they present what Lee wants the audience to understand that Malcolm is running away from. Moreover, the only time the non-diegetic sound (upbeat soundtrack) stops in the flashbacks and viewers are left with the somber feeling created by the uncomfortable diegetic sound. Spike Lee also does an amazing job of juxtaposing Malcolm's false hustler reality with the flashback of his father's death, an actual event. Viewers get a clip of a long angle and medium shot of Malcolm's father's battered and bloody face surrounded by low-key lighting except for the line of light coming from the train. The viewers see the fear and pain in his face as the whistle of the speeding train rushes toward him causing his demise. The use of these contrasting techniques serves to exaggerate the idea that Malcolm is living in a false world as a hustler. <br/><br/>Likewise, later depictions in the film of Malcolm's life after jail, the shots, filters, and sound continue to contrast with Lee's use of them in the ""hustler days"" part of the film. Lee's use of these contrasting techniques is not simply to speed along the story for the purposes of fitting it into a movie. Instead, Lee masterfully uses the techniques to symbolically demonstrate that by attempting to live in a white man's world and being forced to respond to the systemic racism in society, Malcolm had to pretend to be something and someone he was not until he came to understand that he needed to fight that pressure. Overall, Lee's Malcolm X is extraordinarily effective in bringing The Autobiography of Malcolm X to life for viewers. Lee's techniques throughout the film evoke a strong emotional response and resonance for viewers that the written autobiography cannot."

","Spike Lee's adaptation of Malcolm X is a historical motion picture that draws viewers into the life of Malcolm X. The events that take place throughout the film depict Malcolm's journey to becoming one of the most famous leaders in history. The film begins by glamorizing Malcolm's life as a hustler on the streets of Boston. Spike Lee's use of color and music in the night club scenes help embody the essence of the time period. The use of tracking shots, and long shots capture the energy of the city during this time. As the film progresses, viewers watch as Malcolm's life as a hustler is disrupted when he is sentenced to prison. When Malcolm refuses to state his identification number, he is thrown into solitary confinement by the prison guards. For the first time throughout the film there is no light in the scene where Malcolm is alone in solitary confinement. The loss of light helps enhance Malcolm's isolation from the world. After being released from solitude, Malcolm interacts with another prisoner by the name of, Baines. Baines introduces Malcolm to the Nation of Islam; however Malcolm is resistant at first. As Baines and Malcolm continue to converse about the Nation of Islam, and the nation's leader, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm slowly begins to embrace the Islamic faith. Baines shares his knowledge of Elijah Muhammad's wisdom, and informs Malcolm that Elijah Muhammad can lead Malcolm to the light. Once Malcolm is released from prison, he becomes a minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Malcolm captures the attention of many people after joining the nation, and later decides to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. It is in Mecca, where Malcolm experiences racial unity for the first time in his life. Many long shots are filmed in Mecca to visually showcase the unity, and acceptance of others that Malcom witnesses. Spike Lee ensures that every minute of this movie counts by specifically deciding the colors, music, events, camera angles, and editing that are used to create an inspirational documentary that tells the life of an inspirational and dedicated man by the name of Malcolm X."

","SPOILER ALERT!!!<br/><br/>The movie, as you have probably gathered by the time you are reading this, is about Malcolm X, so there is some content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. Malcolm X is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is amazing not only because of the performances that the actors gave, but because Spike Lee uses some techniques and makes some choices that turn this movie from a good one to an amazing one. The movie starts off when Malcolm is enjoying the life of a hustler, and Lee uses a soft focus and jazz soundtrack that is present in every scene to glorify Malcolm's exploits at this time in his life. The soft focus and constant jazz also make the movie feel just like some classic Hollywood ones such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and other movies from that time period. However, things take a turn for the worse and Malcolm ends up in prison. All of a sudden the shots become sharp and have a high contrast between light and dark and the jazz grinds to a halt leaving you to only hear diegetic sound. This sudden and turn towards the grittier side of movies really emphasises the importance of what is about to happen to Malcolm. The rest of the movie continues to be gritty and dark, but you never feel depressed or uncomfortable because of it. Lee does an amazing job at making Malcolm X's story something that not only everyone would enjoy, but something that everyone should see. So you are probably thinking why only 9/10 not 10? I will tell you why. The beginning of the movie was effective at making the rest of the movie seem more important, and making the viewer feel as though they have been hit in the face with reality at the same point that Malcolm did but the soft focus and constant jazz make it hard to watch and I did not like it at all. And that is the only reason that i think this movie is not perfect."

","Malcolm X was a very well thought out film. Everything that was put into the film had a purpose. If the film is looked into deeper than just what is seen, then you will also see that film was technically significant. A lot of technical aspects were put into the film to make it visually appealing, and spike lee did a great job in that aspect. In the scene where Malcolm and shorty are playing in the park, the scene begins with the camera floating directly above Malcolm and Shorty. and moving all the away above while lowering eye level to Malcolm's face. It was a long shot added just so the viewer sees the effort made in to putting together this film. Another reoccurring aspect of the film is when the color would change to black and white. The color would change when switching from on shot to another. When the white man comes to Malcolm's house, thy threw Molotov cocktails through the windows and the house caught fire. the camera crew came there and that's when the color changed to black and white. any time the color changes, that's when the camera crew would be following Malcolm at that time, not he camera crew from the Filmer's of the movie but the camera crew with the paparazzi and all that. spike lee did this because he wanted to put the viewer back in Malcolm's time where they did not have color television or anything like that.

"harrison-engoren","9","2","5","7 December 2014"," A nice complement to an important book
","While the unrelenting candor of The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley is powerful and unmatched, Spike Lee's film Malcolm X establishes an emotional connection that was neglected in the book due to the poor quality of writing. Lee begins his film in Malcolm's teenage years and intersperses short, quick sequences illustrating memories from Malcolm's childhood with the now colorful, extravagant life he has gone on to lead as a hustler in Boston and Harlem. Lee's fast-paced recollection of Malcolm's childhood combined with the hazy filter Lee uses to film Malcolm's memories ultimately fails to encapsulate the authenticity of the horrors that occurred to Malcolm and his family as a child. Without a proper representation of Malcolm's past, Lee struggles to engender the feeling that everything in Malcolm's life was a result of prior events and that Malcolm's future was inevitable given the limitations imposed on him as a boy. On the other hand, Lee does a remarkable job of mirroring the transition in Malcolm's life when Malcolm is locked in his prison cell for a week. After using an assortment of colors throughout Malcolm's life as a hustler, Lee makes the entire screen black for this shot, forcing the viewer to only feel Malcolm's agony as he howls in pain. Then, Lee shines a sliver of light from above onto Malcolm, which parallels Malcolm's soon-to-be religious discovery of the honorable Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. Lee's composition and colors from this point on match Malcolm's new somber and serious attitude. Lee's transition in the middle of film is effective and powerful. This success enhances the viewer's connection with Malcolm on an emotional level. Lee then takes on a more narrative tone until Malcolm is cast out of the Nation of Islam and makes his pilgrimage to Mecca. Lee illustrates the variety of races in Mecca, but uses extreme long shots throughout Malcolm's hajj to demonstrate the unity of Islam and to put things in perspective for Malcolm. Finally, the movie culminates with Lee's famous double dolly shot as Malcolm unknowingly walks to his death. While Malcolm himself is stationary, his surroundings are still moving, almost as if his head is floating in the air. This technique finally sends the message that Malcolm's future is subject to the events going on around him. Lee's juxtaposition of Malcolm's newfound empathy and the unfortunate timing of his death really allows the viewer to sympathize with Malcolm. Although Lee's film does not employ the same unrelenting honesty as Malcolm's autobiography, Lee's usage of several film techniques still successfully portrays Malcolm X and his quest for understanding."

","In this cinematic masterpiece Spike Lee captures the minds of millions with Denzel Washington playing his version of Malcom X. The film is based off the autobiography of Malcom Xs life which has had a huge impact on people all over the world. Lee is known for having a very unique style of filming and his style is very well known. Denzel does a fantastic job of playing Malcom X and should have won an award for his performance. The film did a great job of matching up the book but I wish they would have talked more about his childhood because it seemed that was very important part of Malcoms life and that could shown you how he became the man he ended up being. I liked how when Malcom and Shorty who is played by Lee are walking out with their fancy suits it shows them as sticking out with their color while everything else is plain in the backdrop. Lee does a great job of showing Malcoms life from his days as a hustler in Harlem to his days as a minister for the Nation of Islam and to the final days and his brutal and tragic death. The film could have been a little bit shorter but it had to be long to show you how his life was. i would recommend this film to everyone and i would say that people of all ages should see it because it is a piece of American history"

","As a discrete piece of work, I thought the film didn't do a very good job at being biographical. If you didn't read the book or know too much about Malcolm X and how he accomplished the things he did and what he stood for, you would be pretty lost. BUT the film does an excellent job at reiterating the emotional impact of Malcolm's accomplishments and opinions in a powerful way. <br/><br/>Spike Lee brings the viewer through Malcolm's journey starting with his life as a hustler. Lee does not dive to deeply into the fine details of this part of Malcolm's life but gives a good overview of the delusional world Malcolm lived. Lee's use of vibrant color, constant jazz, and the recurring theme of death throughout this portion of the film followed by his pivotal time in jail provides the viewer with a better understanding of how important his time in jail was. <br/><br/>A few key scenes resonated with me:<br/><br/>The dramatically low-key lighting in the solitary confinement scene portrays Malcolm at his lowest point; his disillusionment. <br/><br/>The pan shot over the black inmates faces as they are being told of the atrocities committed by the white man in the prison courtyard. <br/><br/>The final scene: Malcolm's assassination. The combination of the sound of Betty Shabazz's wailing, the omniscient editing, and the compilation of clips of Malcolm (not Denzel), Nelson Mendela, and students shouting ""I am Malcolm X!"" following was an amazing moment in the film. The emotion of that scene overcame you whether you welcomed it or not. <br/><br/>Overall- great film. Watch it if you know a bit about Malcolm X. If you don't know anything about Malcolm X, get off your ignorant derriÃ¨re and learn something!"
"grabullock","8","2","5","7 December 2014"," very underrated, had some long parts
","This movie had a lot of information to address; the book was so filled with detail, so the choice Spike Lee made to leave out what he did (most of Malcolm's childhood, some of the hustler details, the excessive drug use, and other interactions of his early life) really made sense and helped move the movie along. In contrast, the movie could have been much shorter, not by cutting out details or facts, but by cutting some of the shots. The editing at some points slowed down the energy of the film and sometimes was almost boring. Does watching young people (and Spike Lee) dance around for 15 minutes get a point across? Do we really have to stare at Denzel Washington's face as he looks off into space and thinks for as long as we do? Not really. And the ending is very very drawn out. Once you think it is over, there is more clips from the civil rights movement (which is very important and was perfect to have in the film where it was, but could have been so much shorter and much more concise), and when that is done you think ""oh wow what an awes- there's more?!?!?!"" and there is a clip with a bunch of kids saying ""I am Malcolm X!"" really loudly, and when that goes on for what feels like 2 more hours, then Nelson Mandela is there. What? But eventually it ends and you have almost forgot what you were going to say about how much you loved it. Having said that, Lee used lighting to separate the different phases of Malcolm's life in a truly genius way. He shoots the whole first part of the film in a soft, fuzzy, Old Hollywood light, which makes it all feel very dream like and, we realize later, shows how surreal and blinded Malcolm's early life was. It is colorful and fun, like an old gangster movie, but better because it proves a point. Following that, when Malcolm is in jail, the lights and colors are exactly the opposite. It is close to black and white at that point, and everything is hard, sharp, defined, and dramatic. Later still, when Malcolm is in the Nation of Islam and growing is status, we finally see the world in a clear, unaltered way, like how Malcolm is no longer blinded by the white man. It feels like we just put on glasses after not even realizing we couldn't see and everything comes into focus. The rest of the film is shot in this manner until the very end. Overall, this movie is a work of art that need to be played for every human being who thinks they know anything about the world. It is very important and is masterfully crafted. Good Stuff. I promise."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","2","5","17 June 2014"," One of Spike Lee's best movies, featuring one of Denzel's best performances
","Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" is an ambitious biographical movie about the life of the titular human rights activist, a controversial figure whose influence has been considerable. Regardless of your opinion of the man, his life makes for a fascinating subject as we trace his early years as a criminal, his time with the Nation of Islam and his acrimonious break from that group, culminating in his violent death.<br/><br/>First of all, Denzel Washington was made for the title role. He not only looked the part; he effortlessly captured the essence of what made Malcolm X a powerful presence. His Oscar-nominated performance was undoubtedly awards-worthy. There were also standout performances in supporting roles from the likes of Angela Bassett, Delroy Lindo & Albert Hall, among others.<br/><br/>In the director's chair, Spike Lee successfully brought his vision of an epic biography to the screen. The varied cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and the evocative score by Terence Blanchard (both frequent collaborators of Lee's) were important contributions in this vein. Frankly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher that a film with such impeccable production values only garnered one Oscar nomination in the technical categories (in this case, for costume design). Even Spike Lee was unaccountably snubbed.<br/><br/>With a runtime of over three hours, the script provides us with a story that's engrossing enough to captivate our attention from beginning to end. Some of the political viewpoints espoused are questionable to say the least but, ultimately, a compelling case is made for Malcolm X as a positive influence on civil rights. If anything, the openness to showing multiple sides of the man makes the film all the more intriguing.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that ""Malcolm X"" is a fascinating epic character study in the tradition of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Awards recognition may have been minimal at the time of release but I think that the movie has definitely stood the test of time, as its 2010 induction into the National Film Registry attests."

","Spike Lee's Malcom X is entertaining, well-written, well-acted and well-directed, engaging cinema, but it's no masterpiece. Say what you want, but the last ten or so minutes (the eulogy, the kids in the classroom saying ""I AM MALCOLM X!"", and Nelson Mandela's speech) were not really necessary. In fact, I would have given the film a full ten stars if not for that last ten minutes. But, that is not the case. Still, the rest of the film is masterful and Denzel Washington does a fantastic job in the title role (you forget that that is Denzel Washington on screen, you believe that he's Malcom X).<br/><br/>A masterfully crafted film, but no masterpiece.<br/><br/>3.5/4"
"higherall7","8","2","5","6 February 2014"," Climate of Malcolm X Times
","The life of Malcolm X revolves around two of the most highly charged subjects in American consciousness. Those subjects being Sex and Race. Here in America, the strain of hypocrisy that runs throughout these issues is astonishing and makes objective analysis a formidable and daunting task.<br/><br/>People tend to forget that all this started when a journeyman writer working for Playboy magazine landed an interview with this firebrand only then beginning to come into renown. That writer was Alex Haley who, in my opinion, later went on to be for African American History what Homer has become for Greek History. Haley explained to his audiences and me, a cocky and arrogant high school playwright at the time whom he wanted to take down a peg, how hard it was to get Malcolm to open up and speak freely about his life. At the outset, Malcolm presented himself as the proselytizer of the honorable Elijah Muhammud and prefaced many of his statements to Haley with the Spiritual Leader's name. During one of these interviews, Malcolm reminisced about his times as a Lindy Hopper in the dance halls of Harlem and apparently the memory was so vivid he got up out of his seat and started to cut a rug with a few steps. Haley recounted this incident as a breakthrough in the course of the interviews and after that, it was much easier to get Malcolm to talk about his earlier life.<br/><br/>This series of interviews became, to a large extent, the basis for THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X, later published by Grove Press. You'll notice in the beginning of Spike Lee's MALCOLM X prominent footage is given to Malcolm X's days as a Lindy Hopper and that this is where the narrative seems to take off. The thing that is interesting to me is how Alex Haley, a paid representative of an organ spearheading the Sexual Revolution, ends up encountering a representative of the Black Cultural Revolution and the phenomena this eventually produces.<br/><br/>There is more to the equation than this. Before Spike Lee, writers like myself loved to juxtapose the careers of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King for insights and enlightenment and fascinating parallels can be drawn between these two iconic leaders. In fact, I was surprised that the photograph of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King meeting each other that was so prominently displayed at the end of DO THE RIGHT THING didn't find its way underneath the flaming flag at the beginning of MALCOLM X. What is of interest here is how these two extraordinary individuals appeared poles apart on the issue of how to defend self determination or achieve greater human freedom and yet end up as martyrs for the cause. The theme of nation building which Elijah Muhammud was espousing on a rudimentary basis is to be found within the nexus of their relationship.<br/><br/>Spike Lee tells the story of MALCOLM X with a sweep and a verve and a heartfelt vitality and wit. You can sense how much he loves his subject when, as playing Shorty, he asks Malcolm played by Denzel Washington, whether or not he really put a loaded pistol to his head playing Russian roulette or palmed the bullets beforehand. It is like a question he always really wanted to ask this figure and now finally gets a chance to do so in his film. This scene reeks of hero worship and yet is oddly endearing.<br/><br/>I also would have liked to have seen an ending something like that of Hype Williams' film BELLY grafted onto the end of MALCOLM X suggesting that the time was well nigh for black men to stopping killing black men under any pretext. This, and a moment of silence, as the film faded to black with Nina Simone singing 'TO BE YOUNG, GIFTED AND BLACK' to better discharge the process of catharsis. I would have preferred this to Lee's homage to SPARTACUS with school kids chanting ""I AM MALCOLM X!"".<br/><br/>That being said, the process of how MALCOLM X came to be made is almost as adventuresome as the life of Malcolm X himself. It is amazing how many talented people came together within the artistic community to make this particular phenomenon happen. The ensemble achieves true synergy more often than not and the chemistry between characters on all levels is real and palpable. MALCOLM X comes across as a great show despite the fact that Lee succumbs to the temptation to make white folks the Indians and black folks the Cowboys and a beautiful white woman ends up kissing a black man's dirty foot."

","Malcolm X is a really good, albeit long portrayal on the controversial civil rights leader, Malcom X. This film proves that Spike Lee is a very good director who has a big passion on civil rights and race equality. As a person who studies American history, I was very interested in Malcolm X and how his personality is the exact opposite of another famed civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr.<br/><br/>Spike Lee's film is obviously about the life of Malcolm X. This movie goes through the major changes of his life. This goes through his days as a guy on drugs and deals with gangs and ends up in jail to a guy who found his calling by joining a Muslim group led by Elijah Muhammad to a guy who found his true spiritual nature on his pilgrimage to Mecca.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is definitely the right man for the role. I don't think anyone else could have done this role. In fact, Denzel and Malcolm X look very similar to each other.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a powerful, emotion-filled film with a strong message to it. The montage at the end of this film is worth the price of admission alone. This film is a little too long and a scene or two in the beginning dragged on for a bit. But other than that, this is nearly flawless. I rate this film 9/10."
"StevePulaski","10","2","5","19 February 2012"," We started this fire
","The Civil Rights movement was such a broad area in history, and with the countless number of events that took place, such as the Montgomery bus boycott, the Freedom Rides, and the sit ins, it's a wonder why we haven't been bombarded with films focusing on those events. I have no doubt that one movie could possibly focus on everything that happened in the Civil Rights era, but I doubt it could do a very good job. Spike Lee has chosen one of the most unsung leaders of the movement, and has constructed, from the ground up, a film over three hours in length on him showing his humble beginnings, his rise to power, his self-assessment, and his tragic death.<br/><br/>The leader is Malcolm X. But before he was an historical figure, he was Malcolm Little, a small-time thief who would concoct schemes to steal money with his best friend, Shorty. He was a smart boy, with a preacher for a father and a white woman for a mother. Despite being very smart, he was ostracized by white teachers who said that his dreams of becoming a lawyer wouldn't happen and that he should stick to ""working with his hands."" Little's adolescence consisted of running around with white girls and devising burglaries with them and Shorty. This streak didn't last long, with Little and Shorty being arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Without a doubt, prison benefited Little in unlikely ways. He was taught the ways of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and got help for his addiction to cocaine by a fellow inmate.<br/><br/>Muhammad's teachings eventually inspired Malcolm to become a motivational speaker, before becoming one of the many voices in the Civil Rights movement. He adopts the name ""Malcolm X,"" he claims, because ""X"" in mathematics represents ""the unknown."" For a while, X preached the direct opposite from Martin Luther King Jr. King believed in integration, that would hopefully result from a nonviolent practice. X thought integrating with ""the enemy"" was not intelligent, and questioned why would we want to integrate with a group that has subtracted our rights, raped our women, and has dehumanized us? For a while, the only thing X said he liked integrated was ""his coffee."" I tried to put myself in the shoes of a middle aged African American, living in the south, in the 1960's, and contemplated who I, myself, would've sided with. King would probably have been the initial person I would've sided with, but after many months that proved little to no success, I would've likely started to follow X and his teachings of self defense and segregation.<br/><br/>The entire film is marvelous in every sense of the word. Spike Lee has proved himself to be one of America's greatest directors with one stellar drama after another, focusing mainly on racial tensions. Here, he brilliantly documents an underrated leader whose philosophy may have been sketchy, but wrote speeches that were undeniably powerful.<br/><br/>X is portrayed by Denzel Washington, who utters every line with sophistication and always occupies a convincing state. The whole tone of the film can be summed up in one scene that comes rather late in the film. It shows Malcolm X walking up the stairs to Columbia University, where he is stopped by a white woman asking what she could do to further his movement. He coldly replies ""nothing"" before marching on his way. The camera is left focusing on the frozen, heartbroken woman. The great thing about a scene like this is that it wasn't motivated by a comic relief. Lee adds hints of comedy throughout the film, but not many seeing as this is a touchy subject. He feels he should attack it with brutal honesty rather than turn the whole movement into a laugh riot. Other performances, like Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, provide the film with some of its strongest material as well.<br/><br/>I believe the reason the character of Malcolm X was so interesting is because he is capable of delivering self assessment and self criticism. Not many leaders are still developing their beliefs, but are rather wholly confident in what they preach. X finally realized he had flaws as a human, and went through a change of heart upon traveling to Mecca, an event that is captured beautifully in the film, and came back a whole different person. Instead of attacking Civil Rights leaders, mainly Martin Luther King Jr., and making them feel inferior, he agrees to work with them to pursue the dream of equality in the world.<br/><br/>Malcolm X is one of the most surreal and extensive biopics I have yet to see. Its script is extremely powerful, and refuses to become dry and noneventful. Lee's direction is pitch perfect, and the tone either feels coldly realistic or unsettling even in when it reaches its brightest instances. Just like the man himself, Lee's film has proved to go under the radar, not boasting a great deal on the surface. But when put into an intricate focus and dissected delicately, it is one of the best films that deals with racial tensions, next to De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and one of the smartest films of the nineties decade.<br/><br/>Starring: Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by: Spike Lee."

","I know it's 18 years too late but I want to review this. I was watching a documentary on Muhammad Ali on TV two days ago so one thing led to another therefore I was watching this. Spike Lee is a very weird director. I've seen a couple of his films like Inside Man, He Got Game and Clockers. All these films were watchable but they were made with such weird techniques.<br/><br/>So initially you get that Spike Lee smear when you watch the first hour of this film which chronicled Malcolm's teenage years in Boston and Harlem. However when you think about it was filmed that way just to indicate how buck wild the young Malcolm was.<br/><br/>Once the movie enters the stage of Malcolm's incarceration and transformation that's when you see less of Spike's running gags and more substance from the man Denzel himself.<br/><br/>Great film, I learned what I needed to know about the most complicated figure in the Civil Rights Movement."

","This seems a well-crafted movie by Spike Lee. At the beginning of the movie, before Malcolm becomes politically aware, we see Malcolm and his friends, seemingly happy, emulating the larger societies dress and mannerisms. Is this a statement about the times? Personally, I noticed a parallel between these fawning citizens of the past, and contemporary, going along, happy whites of today -er of 1992.<br/><br/>Was this Lees point?<br/><br/>Malcolm himself becomes politically aware, and thinks back about his relationships with whites. Realizing, at best, he's simply been used by them. He decides to join the black Muslims. The movie follows him on his rise to prominence, ""That's too much power for one man to have"".<br/><br/>I remember when this movie came out.

One of keeping resistance alive? Certainly people of all kinds seem angrier now than ever. Do the powers-that-be simply think we work harder when we're angry? Or is this resistance needed now more than ever?<br/><br/>Is Malcolm X's religious vision the most true worship of God, and is this his legacy?<br/><br/>Did Malcolm X create his own legacy. . . ? <br/><br/>In the movie, Lee focuses intensely on the scene where Malcolm and his friend (Shorty?), and their girlfriends, play a game of Russian Roulette that Malcolm forces on them. Malcolm is a bad-character at this time, but he becomes aware of the effect this gun and his attitude have on his surrounding friends. . . <br/><br/>Is this his legacy?<br/><br/>The problem is. . . <br/><br/>People don't condone violence forever. . .

"smpulickottil","Null","3","10","1 March 2005"," The man and the movie
","Making a Biopic is hard. The movie always is judged by the opinion critics have about the central character in study, not the movie itself. Most of the past reviews have tried to assess this movie from what Malcolm X should've been and not what kind of person he was. It seems that many people (""the good, compassionate"" white folks) were depressed that Malcolm was shown as a racist. They also wanted more harsher criticism of NOI. They all wanted to see Malcolm X discovering the 'truth' that white men can be his brothers. Sadly, if they want this movie to be true, they wouldn't get a chance to see all that.<br/><br/>I've heard from Malcolm's own words - speeches, interviews that his trip to Mecca and his experience with 'blond haired, blue eyed men who called (him) brother' NEVER changed his opinion about the race relations in America. He still believed that the only way blacks could gain their human rights was to lead their struggle themselves. He held this view till the day he died. In his own words after the pilgrimage,""No religion will ever make me forget the sufferings of my people"". I have to say, to the chagrin of many readers here, that Malcolm X did not become another Martin Luther King before he died. A month before he was killed in a meeting he asked the whites sympathizers what he had asked always - to stay out of the black revolution - and if possible, convince the black man that he has to fight this revolution himself.<br/><br/>This movie made Malcolm X a cult figure. Many learned about him after watching it. He went from a forgotten black separatist activist to an icon appearing on posters and in rap lyrics. The imperialists now adopted Malcolm, made him their own - one who they could institutionalize, merchandize and at last use to counter struggles of living men today.<br/><br/>Malcolm as a person sure deserves admiration for his conviction, clear goals and for his struggles against adversity in life. But the ideas he espoused are much greater. It's certainly not the movie's fault, but these ideas were lost somewhere in the hype."

","(SOME SPOILERS) 1992's ""Malcolm X"" is the greatest film of all time. I may ruffle some feathers by saying that, but I don't care. What movie teams up the greatest director (Spike Lee) with the greatest actor (Denzel Washington) in a story about controversial black activist Malcolm X? And it doesn't stop there, it is backed up by a superb supporting cast (Angela Bassett, Al Freeman Jr. need I say more?) This whole film was adapted from the novel The Autobiography of Malcolm X written by Alex Haley. ""Malcolm X"" shows us how Malcolm Little became Malcolm X and his departure from the Nation of Islam and how they played a role in his assassination. The score by Terence Blanchard is incredible. The eulogy by Ossie Davis, classic. ""Malcolm X"" is a masterpiece. Spike Lee's hard work was never recognized by the Academy, and he was not nominated for a Best Director award. ""Malcolm X"" won for best costume design and Best Actor nominee Denzel Washington was snubbed. This is the definitive film of the 20th Century. But it is sad that it is not recognized the way it should be.<br/><br/>Malcolm X- rated PG-13 ***** (the only five star rating I will give out)"

","This film is probably the most successful attempt at penetrating the biography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley. Previous generations have attempted to dent the literary text by adapting it for the screen, as well as numerous stage shows (of which Denzel appeared in one), but this offering is the only work of art that paints Malcolm X with careful brush strokes. Is this down to Spike Lee's direction? or is it a result of what Denzel brings to a period drama? This film is Spike's only period drama. He tends to make social commentaries on contemporary society, but this installment was an exception. Denzel Washington has a natural home in period dramas ('A Soldier's Story', 'Cry Freedom', 'Glory'), and it was this project that enabled him to shine as a historical figure. If anyone else had played the role, then I don't think they would have captured Malcolm X in the same way. Therefore, I would say that this is a Denzel Washington film as opposed to a Spike Lee film because Denzel excels in period dramas whereas Spike is a social commentator on contemporary urban society."
"funang","9","3","10","16 November 2003"," Malcolm X: Still relevant to young people today?
","I must say, I've had very high expectations of this film because it was one of the most ambitious projects ever to represent Malcolm X on film. I dare say no other film, video, and even documentary came close to the sheer magnitude in terms of production values, publicity as well as commercial and critical success. Nor does any other attempts' on making Malcolm X' came close in terms of the controversy generated. Malcolm X' by Spike Lee is a fine piece of work, but I'm sure many will agree that it is not without it's flaws. <br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>	Spike Lee had said that he wanted to target the young audience, especially black youths; that is why he wanted the film to be rated PG 13. But I'm not sure whether that intention has led to some of the problems that I have with the film. For example, I personally think that the first act in reenacting the story of young Malcolm, with all the Jitterbug' dancing, the love scene on the beach, and supporting characters like Shorty' (played by Spike Lee himself), felt some what contrived. I was lost in the midst of all the colors, music and dancing. It makes me feel like I'm watching a Broadway show rather than a Bio pic, and no amount of suspension of disbelief is going to convince me that this is even remotely close to the recreation and depiction of young Malcolm's life. Despite a high-spirited performance by Denzel Washington, it is simply unconvincing to see a middle aged man (Denzel was about 38 then) playing a juvenile delinquent.<br/><br/>	Having prior knowledge about Malcolm X before watching the film didn't help either. For instance, the autobiography, which the film is based on, did not confirm that Clansmen murder Malcolm's father, but the film seems to portray that as a fact. I have doubts as to whether other facts have been manipulated by the film to tell the story, especially towards the more ambiguous early history on Malcolm's life. <br/><br/>	However, I do find the stylized gangster treatment on Malcolm's hustling days to be tasteful, with a very noir look and feel to it. The period when Malcolm was incarcerated, although falling somewhat short in length, is adequate in serving as a transition between the different periods and getting it's messages across. The second stretch of the film, documenting Malcolm's rise as a Minister in the Nation of Islam, was impressive, mainly due to the great performance of Denzel Washington in portraying the Malcolm of this middle period. I take for granted many of the quotes and things said by Denzel are verbatim of the real Malcolm, which all the more accentuate the effects that you are watching the real Malcolm in action.<br/><br/>
	The last act of the film, which Malcolm X went through great turmoil after realizing the truths behind the deceptions that he had been living upon, his subsequent religious and spiritual redemption, and the final scene of the inevitable assassination all happen in quick succession within the film. Contrary to what many critics feel about this act in not deliberating long enough, I think it is again the choice of the filmmaker to cater to the film's target audience. Already stretching beyond 3 hours, it is hard to expect young people to remain seated and captivated if the story of Malcolm X is not condensed. I also feel that the quick pacing towards the end somewhat mirrors the real life of Malcolm X, because he did not stay alive for more than 100 days after his return from his pilgrimage to Mecca. The focus is more on his internal struggles, contrasting with the escalating events surrounding him, and I feel that the film deserves credit for its chosen treatment on the subject. <br/><br/>Lastly, I was incredibly overwhelmed by the juxtaposition of the archival images of the real Malcolm X with the eulogy recited by Ozzie Davis at the end of the film. It has been quite a long time since cinema had such a cathartic effect on me, especially with simple words like `How can you judge a man like Malcolm X? Do you know himHave you spoken with him?' The finishing coda that follows, with a surprise entry of Nelson Mandela giving one of Malcolm's X speech which bears the infamous `by all means necessary', and the kids unanimous responses, again was overdone and portentous. If only there is another more creative way of relating the messages across that ties what Malcolm X represents to today's youth."

","Make NO mistake:<br/><br/>It is HARD as heck to do a bio-picture, I don't care WHOM it is about.<br/><br/>
To do it as a major release feature film is even harder but Spike Lee pulls this off and it is as great and as epic  -- even moreso -- as any bio film out there.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Malcolm Little who becomes Malcom X, one of the most recognizable names of African American and American History of the 60's. What one learns about this man from watching this film is NOT what many perceive, which is why this film is excellent in it's telling.<br/><br/>
The story, adapted from Alex Haley's book is a realistic and biting view. It shows a man -- a very strong but conflicted man and his changes, but a man none the less who believed in what he believed in to the dismay of many in a time, not to long ago in America, where the voices and ideas of minorities were stiffled.<br/><br/>The very important element of this film of course of the casting of Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. This is one of those rare instances where you forget about ""nice Denzel, the actor"" and he becomes that lead character. His Academy Award Nomination for this character was very well placed.<br/><br/>Another rare and haunting roll was that of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad played by Al Freeman Jr. on the same Academy Award calibre as Denzel's performance. <br/><br/>Spike Lee's direction (what a wonderful ""eye"" he has!), Ernest Dickerson's Cinematography, Production Design by Wynn Thomas, the Casting of Robbi Reed-Hume (who won the casting society's award for casting of Malcolm X and rightfully so!) and the acknowledgement of any and everyone to get this film COMPLETED is also what makes this an excellent achievement.<br/><br/>Whatever YOU think of Malcolm X is your right. But this film does not make ANY opinions, it just goes through and presents. It's not a pretty life, there are racially charged as well as religiously charged points in this film and as I've written before, it will surprise those who think they knew what Malcolm X was ""all about"" and ""who"" killed him. It will be HARD to do films like Malcolm X in this day and time, being his ""being"" was controversial, but I am glad this one was accomplished by the team that did it.<br/><br/>Beautifully made, painstakenly made, top notch performances by all actors and actresses, great production teams, great direction teams, excellent adaptation, excellent music...an excellent film."

","Malcolm X was an excellent movie. Many say that Malcolm was a contraversial character. But in truth he wasn't. He was the black product of the centuries of racism and opression that blacks endured.  His father was murdered by the Klan. His mother couldn't understandably handle the stress and ended up in a mental institution(That part was in the book by Alex haley The Autiobiography of Malcolm X on which the movie was based) him and his siblings were split up by the state. Malcolm once told his teacher that he wanted to be a lawyer and his white teacher told him that it wasn't a black man's profession and that he should be a carpenter or plasterer(I forget which). If most men faced what young malcolm did by their 21st birthday most would have gone mad. true he was also a criminal in his youth and went to prison which was a saving point in his life. He then does a complete 180 degree turn in prison and gives his life to Islam.<br/><br/>Although he hated whites during his NOI days he goes to the Mecca and sees Muslims of all races and starts to lose his hatred for whites. Case in point is that Malcolm's life was about constant change. Without change we cannot adapt and thus cannot hope to survive."
"chthon2","Null","3","10","14 February 2003"," Biggest Oscar snub of the 90's.
","In this film, Spike Lee tells the story of Malcolm X (Denzel Washington), touching lightly on his younger years, and detailing the change going to prison brought on in him, and the change leaving Elijah Muhammad's (Al Freeman Jr.) Nation of Islam to become orthodox.  We also get to see X's private life away from the camera's, from the influence Baines (Albert Hall) had on him to the life he lived with his wife Betty (Angela Basset).<br/><br/>I was already familiar with Spike Lee's work before this film, but this is the movie that turned me into a Denzel Washington fan.  Before I saw this, I brushed him off as another star gliding by on his looks - not because of his choice of roles or anything, but because I had never seen him in any films and tend to be skeptical about everything.  When I saw this, I realized what a powerful presence he has.  The glimpse we get of Malcolm X's transformation has Washington virtually portraying three completely different people.  The scene where he breaks down when he meets Elijah Muhammad for the first time is one of the most powerful moments on film.  I suppose the soundtrack helped that scene, but both Washington and Freeman Jr. were breathtaking there.<br/><br/>Basset was great, but she always is.  Not to diminish her talent, but to be honest, I haven't seen her give a merely average performance yet, much less a poor one.  So, I wasn't expecting any less of her.  Lee was very unbiased in his portrayal of X, showing the audience how angry he was, and how when he first converted to Islam, he didn't do it because of religion - he did it almost as a means of channeling his anger.  I also like how Lee shows him eating with white Muslims in Mecca at the end.  Some of my family adhere to the Nation of Islam, and they seem to forget that Malcolm quit hating white people near the end of his life.  It is just too bad that his life was ended by other black nationalists.  In Islam we have something called maktoub - you cannot escape fate.  So, I suppose he was meant to go down for taking a stand.  Very sad, yes, but out of all the ways to die, it's probably the most honorable.<br/><br/>Both Lee and Washington were amazing here.  I used to keep up to date with Oscar nominations (until films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan started sweeping the awards - they were good, but not the best), and out of the 1991-2000 decade, Washington's nomination for Best Male Actor was probably the biggest snub.  But, who cares.  It's a good film on it's own, one all people should see."

I was left numb viewing the scene of X's murder. His death was so needless, so wasteful. Yet Spike Lee does not over-glamorize X, who at one point tells a willing white girl that there is nothing she can do to help blacks. This is certainly one of the best films of the 1990's. One may not agree with X's views or beliefs, but you have to respect the man who will walk what he talks. And also respect Spike Lee for directing Denzel Washington's career-defining performance.

It is interesting to note that most people in this country shy away from anything controversial.  Our country has spawned controversial people of all kinds, but no matter, we cannot blame the blacks for some of the outrageous things some of them do.  This film made me think about all this, and Denzel Washington who played Malcolm X Little did such a commendable performance!  He truly is a remarkable actor!  As Malcolm X he projects so well, but it was his attitude of revenge against the whites and authorities that brought him down.  It had nothing to do with what he said but it was the way he said them; his anger was so deep. It was his own Muslims who killed him which made him a martyr."

","Malcolm X, the Black panthers, soul brothers, power to the people,..those words spoken in the 60's and 70's spark images of riots, impatience, anger. And yet after the smoke has lifted (not cleared) we see layer by layer echoes of thoughts and sentiment from black ancestors who where silenced by the systematic social-polictical machinery. The 20' thru 40's were a MF for blks in the south. The popularity of radio and TV put social and economical issue in our living rooms. Ask yourself, as a dominating presence in America,and evaluating the Black role in it's economics would you stand and allow a system that basically ""tortured"" both physically and mentally an entire race? (exaggerating? hardly;). Ask the four girls in Alabama who died in the church bombing. What has this to do with X? Remember that bully in grade school? The one tha humiliated you and you could'nt do a damn thing about him? Remember now as an adult and meeting up with that bully?  This man was not a Castro, Stalin, or an Amin, he simply said if you swing at me, I'm going to swing back. You cannot appreciate a movie/documentary of this<br/><br/>man w/o knowing/bearing the pain. Sure he started out a hustler, pimp, drug pusher,addict etc. and eventually became one of the prominent leaders in the black community-(although not black America as a whole). Where would he be today? Probally on Larry King, maybe. Anyway this movie is based largely on the brilliant autobiography by Alex Haley nothing more, nothing less. Mr Lee's crown jewel. The reason it was shun at the Oscar's are obvious. Mr Washington's portral of Malcolm is uncanny, brilliant and possibly his best. (Oh sure I remember him getting the Oscar nod as a confederate slave in Glory as whitey crack his ass up and down with a whip). But for this so called black militant?

","It's a biography showing how an Afro American subjected to ultimate discrimination was initially saved from the world of crime and prejudice by a ""missinterpreted"" Islam and became a leader to which a ""Nation of Islam"" was grown and a new perspective and respect gained to those once oppressed people.. However, this version of him was mislead into believing that prophet Muhammed (PBUH) was actually guiding him - resurrected from death and living amongst them as a black man. Consequently, all his charisma was directed against the whites believing that Islam came to empower blacks and that Allah's prophet was black and that it was time for them to rise after 400 years of suppression. His followers increased by time and his word became highly credible and this caused envy and divisions within this ""Nation of Islam"" where the so-claimed Muhamed started tensing things up with him after once appointing him to be his voice to the people. It was then that Malcolm started doubting the beliefs he taught and that this man to whom he was ready to sacrifice himself was no more than a hypocrite; therefore, he split from the group, publicly announcing his independence as a leader and his formulating an Islamic group of his own to which he would lead after fulfilling his pilgrimage duties. Nonetheless, his trip to Mecca was the actual light that lit his path back from where he was deviating. Once back at America, his preaches took a different direction and he started preaching of equality rather than supremacy, and it was then that he proclaimed his errors and tried to call for real peace. Unfortunately, it was too late.. The diversities within what was once one group calling for their rights to breathe the same air were exploded with the intrusion of power and the fight over the spotlight. Malcolm's verdict was now defined and he was assassinated in front of his family in one of his preaches in New York. However, his death that day was the birth of hope; it was a significance of how one man could rise from the dumps and choose to fall and meet his death so that others could forever value their gift of life and to search for truth rather than live blind folded under others' rules."

It was important to see his transitions from early hoodlum, to prisoner, to Elijah acolyte, to independent man. He was a living example of what liberating one's mind can do for an individual.<br/><br/>As a production, this was fantastic. There were a couple of Spike Lee-isms that could have been removed (e.g. himself as an actor and the invasive soundtrack at times) but overall I was pleased.

","Malcolm X, Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the street hustler turned spokesman for the Nation of Islam who was assassinated at the age of 39, is undoubtedly the director's most assured, complex and mature film, but it is a wonder that it was ever made at all. Controversy began long before production even started, with heavy criticism laid on the fact that Norman Jewison was lined up direct what many, including Lee, felt was a project a black director should handle. When Jewison gracefully bowed out and Lee took over, many still felt that the polarising activist's life would somehow be whitewashed, labelling Lee a 'Buppie' (middle-class African-American).<br/><br/>The irony of many of the statements thrown at the biopic before it was even made was highlighted, and the resulting film was a 3 hour 20 minute testament to Lee's persistence at getting his hands on a story he had dreamt about making since film school. The studio had thrown in a budget for and insisted on a 2 hour 15 minute running time, but Lee, understanding that the contradictions and evolution of Malcolm's teachings and the many events and influences that helped shape the man demanded a longer running time. When the budget was exhausted, Lee called in for donations from the African-American community, and many of them obliged. Somehow, it's still too short to really get to heart of Malcolm, but it's certainly a far better film than it would have been had Lee not been so insistent at bringing his vision to the screen.<br/><br/>Malcolm's life was crammed with incident, and Lee does a decent job getting almost everything in. Flashbacks to his childhood, when his mother and father were tormented by the Ku Klux Klan and his family lived under the constant threat of death, are juxtaposed with his early life as a sharp-suited, ambitious numbers runner in Harlem known as Red, working underneath gangster West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). His actions soon land him in prison, where he meets Baines (Albert Hall), a fellow inmate working for Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) and the Nation of Islam. Baines teaches Malcolm that the drugs and alcohol he enjoys so much are simply ways for the white man to keep the black man in their place, and that the white man is, without exception, the devil. Malcolm leaves prison as Malcolm X, ditching the 'slave name' given to him by his ancestor's owners, and is transformed into an extremely enigmatic and convincing spokesman for the Nation of Islam.<br/><br/>The rush of excitement and danger of the opening third soon gives way to a more serious tone, as Malcolm's radical views on segregation under the watchful eye of 'the honourable' Elijah Muhammad makes him an incredibly controversial figure; loved, hated and feared in equal measure. Malcolm's popularity soon causes rifts and jealousy within the ranks of the Nation, and he sees the man who once took him under his wing become a deadly nemesis. His wife Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) receives threatening phone calls, and the family's house is set ablaze. Lee's technical discipline throughout these moments, especially for a director who usually embraces visual flourishes, ensures that a steady, gloomy momentum builds up towards Malcolm's eye-opening pilgrimage to Mecca and eventual murder.<br/><br/>A film of such emotional weight also calls for a great performance, and Denzel Washington delivers in spades. Even when Malcolm is at his most questionable, Washington imbues the character with the same charm, wit and magnetism that no doubt saw him sore through the ranks of the Nation and become loved by many. When the pace sags, and it frequently does, Washington manages to draw you back in with his effortless screen presence. The film manages to paint a well- rounded picture of a man who underwent a few radical changes in his life, thanks both to Lee's thoughtful approach and Washington's incredible performance. Lee does go slightly overboard with his worship of the man at the climax, as Ossie Davis reads a eulogy over a montage of children declaring ""I am Malcolm X!"" and a speech from Nelson Mandela, but this doesn't do too much damage to what is engrossing, detailed and fearless biopic of an inspirational man."

","Malcolm X is a film, that while long, is very much worth the time to watch. The movie focuses on the adult life of Malcolm X, yet uses flashbacks to help the viewer understand his past as well. Although I did not find the scenes very effective as flashbacks, overall they served well to the purpose of the movie. Lee decided to portray his early life as a hustler glamorized tone. I found his techniques with camera movement to be effective, he used old Hollywood camera movements like crane shots, and sweeping tracking shots to give it this effect. This style was effective because old Hollywood films were meant to enchant the viewer as much as possible.<br/><br/>Although, I found the most effective part of the movie to be the opening credits. Denzel Washington's reenactment of Malcolm X's speech about charging the white man with his injustices is voiced over the American flag slowly burning into an X. Interspersed throughout is footage of Rodney King being beaten by Los Angeles police. This, to me, was the most moving scene in the film as the words are so powerful and the image of the US flag burning is jarring for Americans. Even more jarring was the footage of King being brutally beaten. The combination of these things drew me in as a viewer because it was shocking.<br/><br/>The film overall is split into three parts, Malcolm's early adulthood as a hustler, his discovery of Islam and his preachings for Elijah Muhammad, and his self discovery and preachings after his ""hajj"" to the Middle East and Mecca. I found his early adult life prolonged and dragged out, but the rest of the film I found effective and important to Malcolm's story. As I had said earlier, if you have the time to watch it, it is a film much worth your time. Denzel Washington's performance is spectacular, and Spike Lee uses a lot of interesting techniques to portray Malcolm's story emotionally and sends the message he lived for very well."

","Malcolm X is considered one of the most influential and brave individuals recorded in history. After being dead for more than twenty years, he has been brought back by a stunning and electrifying performance by Denzel Washington. Not only has Denzel proved to be one of the best actors in Hollywood, but he also can make any person believe in him.<br/><br/>The movie is well-researched and well captured by Spike Lee. It covered a whole lot in the three hour and twenty minute film from Malcolm's youth to his assassination. The costume design by Ruth E. Carter added much to the authenticity of the time period. The work of editing and cinematography was also a nice addition to the film.<br/><br/>Despite such authenticity and a performance by Denzel, it does not make it a classic. Even though much is covered in the film, it got boring. The first hour covers his youth as a pimp, gambler, drug abuser, and sex addict. Nothing really exciting happens until he is sent to prison and learns of the Muslim religion. From there on, it kicks off.<br/><br/>But after awhile, even his role in politics gets dull. As I said, Denzel is powerful in his performance, but yet I can't help but see him as a shouting figurehead in when he delivers his speeches. I've seen documented footage of Malcolm X, and he did have an accelerated voice.

","I cannot imagine the hoops Spike Lee must have had to jump through to get any form of investment into either the concept or the production of this truly groundbreaking study of a man who divided opinion in a way few others have since the end of the Second World War. I say a study of man, but this is way more than just about him, it identifies and develops themes about inter and intra racial and gender attitudes and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. All of that said, it does struggle as a piece of entertainment. I don't mean to trivialise the subject matter, but if it wanted to be a documentary then it should have been more tightly focused on fact and less on the dramatisation of events, some real, some not. As a biopic, it kind of falls between two stools. We are presented with, essentially, a collective of unpleasant individuals who either started out that way, or were corrupted by the environments in which they existed and/or created - clearly illustrated, for example, by the way the women are treated by their husbands/bosses etc. This left me with an overwhelming feeling that had there been more general respect and decency on offer here - across the board - then a lot of the violence from both ""sides"" might have been avoided. It is a must see movie, but perhaps time has robbed it of much of it's potency and left us with a sad reflection of a time when vileness didn't care about your colour."

","Malcolm X is definitely an important person in American history for the things he stood for and the things he had achieved. So I think it is an important film for whoever is interested in his life and/or that era in the US history. It doesn't try to make things nice and interesting or likable, it just tells his story as is. And that for me is what a good biopic should do. Denzel is Denzel.<br/><br/>Biography of the controversial Malcolm X who goes to prison for living a gangster life, but learns about the religion Islam there.

","Malcolm X, though noticeably affecting to American audiences, is not so much a stirring biopic as, say, ""Andrei Rublev"" (1966), or structurally innovative as Paul Schrader's ""Mishima"" (1985), or as crisp as Fincher's ""Zodiac"" (2007), but it is a fairly respectable work, held up by its ceaselessly fascinating subject. Thematically similar and with the same fire-and-fury be-damned-to-you attitude as Do The Right Thing (a far more visually creative, quick-paced, lively, idiosyncratic, stylized cultural landmark), this one is a lot more straightforward, and the only thing that really keeps it afloat is Washington's embodiement of Malcolm. It's fairly serviceable, but feels like it could've been made by anyone - it doesn't have that Spike Lee vibe that even his bad movies have - though at least here, he's pretty restrained and tones down his trademark over-the-top Spike-isms to deliver one of his more coherent and concise movies. A pretty typical biopic, though by no means a bad one, and relatively solid for a director whose entire body of work is a mixed bag. Despite some of its flatness, its still in the upper tier of his work. A fine watch, but not much more."

","With Malcolm X, director/co-screenwriter Spike Lee has produced a true-to-life biopic on the title character who was first a strident advocate for the American Nation of Islam during the 1950's and early 60's, later becoming an extremely high profile human rights activist during the civil rights movement, before his assassination in 1965.<br/><br/>The film dramatises key events in Malcolm X's life with the main thread beginning with his post war criminal career and later conversion to Islam whilst in jail, which directly led to his assumption of the identity of Malcolm X . Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatised in (ironically) brief flashbacks, considering the elephantine length of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>From my understanding of the life of Malcolm X, Lee has stuck closely to the facts in constructing his biography. I believe there is only a limited amount of fictionalisation for artistic and dramatic licence. For that, I guess many will be grateful. Lee has also recreated the roughly two decades the film's story covers, extremely authentically. The sets and costuming are first class, with occasional pieces of newsreel footage and still photos supplementing that of his own filming. The performances are uniformly outstanding. Denzal Washington must have been desperately unlucky to miss out on the 1992 Academy Award for his powerful, central portrayal of the conspicuously, hard-nosed and divisive X.<br/><br/>For me though at 202 long minutes, this film is too dragged out and warranted tighter editing. The first act focusing on his early life of crime in Harlem and later Boston is for instance, needlessly protracted with interesting, but ultimately quite unimportant night club dancing and musical interludes. Could it possibly be that its prolonged appearance is due to Spike Lee himself, appearing in this section as a supporting character?<br/><br/>Malcolm X is a technically well-made, obvious labour of love for Lee, but I think it may have reached wider audiences if edited to a more manageable, less indulgent length."

His camera movements might be good, but I found myself very confused by how the story line kept jumping across. I remember one scene where, out of nowhere, the scene cuts to X's father being killed.<br/><br/>The best way to have done this movie, in my opinion, would've been the way the book did.

Following Malcolm's autobiographical text the film deals with the turbulent career of this often controversial leader. On a parallel with the film Denzel Washington in the lead role improves as it goes on, pulling off Malcolm's mannerisms very effectively.

","All I have to say about Malcolm X is that Spike Lee made this film human, portraying the civil rights leader as a person and not an angel as in almost every other biopic that is spewed out by American studios these days. Norman Jewison was originally slated to direct this film but was replaced with Lee after Lee stated that a black person should direct this film.  I am very glad he did, because after seeing The Hurricane, Jewison would have probably left out all of the mistakes Malcolm Little made during the earlier parts of his life and made him out to be a saint like he did with Ruben Carter. The intention of the biopic should be to accurately portray a person, not to make that person larger than life...Spike Lee did a great job of this...I only wish he would have directed the Hurricane."

","By far, in all of movie history, this ranks among the top. I first saw this film in the theater in 1992. However, it did not have a major affect on me until years later when I watched it again at home. Only then did I realize exactly what Mr. Lee was trying to achieve in this movie. Those who know little outside of media information about Malcolm X need to see this movie. It brings Malcolm X to light--by showing the audience a phenom, someone who finally understood his life. Someone who was never allowed to realize their full potential. There are many movies about this man but none portray him as he truly was. What I find most heartbreaking(but not surprising) however, is the total lack of media-praise for this movie. This film was not just for African Americans. This movie is about a part of American History. Here is why I can say this:  I noticed when I was on my way out of the theater there were more whites present than there were blacks. Most of the whites were old enough to remember Malcolm X being alive. The look many had on their faces at the end of the film surprised me. I took note of a range of emotions; mostly sadness but best of all--enlightenment. It did my heart good to see this becuase the film accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. Not create more hate but to show one man's transition from being a victim of racial hatred to pro-actively findng a way to end it-- by creating an attitude for African Americans that up until that past few decades was not allowed: Self sufficiency, self pride, high standards of education, and love for ourselves. If there is ever any doubt in your mind that Malcolm X was not a thinker, philosopher, healer, and one of the greatest men that have ever lived, then please see this movie. I am only sorry that I never knew him personally. I am not sorry that someone took the time to introduce us via film."

","I must admit, I used to despise this film. I had to watch this tedious bio-pic as part of an assignment for a sociology class and write an analysis of it. Needless to say, I did not have a paper to turn in. I just did not think (and still do not think) that Malcolm X was a very pleasant person. Like Jerry Falwell, and Louie Farakhan, he had a tendency to push the wrong buttons in the statements he made. He seemed to be driven by pure hatred most of the time. And even after his conversion to orthodox Islam, following his Hajj, currents of racism still remained in his philosophy. That is what the Black Nationalist movement is/was. Keep blackie in one corner of the room, keep whitey out. That isn't reconcilation. That is segregation. What a way to move forward! <br/><br/>But I saw the movie again on BSTRZ and imagine my surprise...I enjoyed the heck out of it. It is completely uncompromising unlike the pathetic ""Hurricane"", which tries to sanctify an unpleasant person who was probably a murderer. Malcolm X presents the man as he was, based on what he said, what he did. It does not pull any punches. Most people will not come away from this with a greater sense of respect for Malcolm. Unless you believe in the things he said. Apparently, Spike Lee does, yet, he does not attempt to whitewash (pardon the pun) this controversial figure. And in that sense, this film is very enjoyable, historically accurate and heck, it is quite moving too. I did find myself thinking a bit differently about some issues."

It's too controversial a movie to ever win a best picture oscar and as has been shown before the idiots at the academy hate different movies (Apocalypse Now, Clockwork Orange, JFK). This movie is powerful throughout and once  get hooked in it u stay hooked in it. the first hour introduces us to Malcolm and the events in his life that shaped him as a grown man and figuring how his father was killed by the KKK and his family split by a government agency, there really can't be any blame towards him for his hatred of whites along with the fact that blacks were abused and treated unequally at that time. Spike Lee gives a great analysis of Malcolm X and doesn't stoop to making him a heroic myth but rather portrays the truth and contrary to most critics he doesn't put in his racial bias.. When a white student asks Malcolm if she could help him with his struggles, he replies no and walks away but instead of just ending it there we see the hurt look on the student as he walks away.. It's a great movie and a great tribute to a great man and the speeches in the movie tremble with fury and grasp u.. the prologue has got to be a highlight.. The Rodeny King tape airs as if to reinforce Malcolm X's speech showing how things are still the same today and when the flag burns to an X, its as if his words are breaking the very foundations of America and exposing its injustices to the world."

","I turned this film on accidentally last night, and just left it on screen while I found something better to watch.  An hour and a half later I still hadn't turned it off.  Utterly engaging central performance by Washington.<br/><br/>At first (once Malcolm X gets to prison and meets Brother Baines) one is impressed by the power of the arguments used, and the value of truly understanding the history of black repression.  Your heart goes out to Malcolm because of what he is trying to achieve, which is that the African Americans take control of their own destiny and make their own prosperity, by eschewing crime and drugs and all the other easy escapes, and instead to promote a moral life of education and achievement.  Then, gradually, almost without you noticing it, the other aspects of Malcolm X's views come out: the sexism, the Anti-Semitism, the segregationism.  This is what I meant by my subtitle.  This film does not compromise in its portrait of a figure it admires - it does not sweep the uncomfortable facts under the carpet.  I also like the way the film sees everything from X's viewpoint.  We don't find out about Elijah Muhammed's shenanigans until Malcolm X does, and there is only the slightest hint that the NoI leadership had turned against X before he finds out the full shocking truth.<br/><br/>If Spike Lee has a fault, however, it is in not allowing powerful images to speak for themselves.  The demonstration outside the police station comes to an abrupt end when X raises his hand and points:  everyone shuts up and quietly shuffles off.  A brilliant scene with an unmistakable message.  So unmistakable, in fact, that the police chief, Peter Boyle repeats it for our benefit: ""That's too much power for one man to have.""  Hey, Spike!  Malcolm demonstrated the power of the masses, and his own power over them, in a brilliant, non-violent way.  We got it!<br/><br/>Of course the most egregious example of this was the coda, which repeatedly told us that Malcolm X is a much-denigrated figure who nevertheless deserves our honour and respect.  Well, why did Lee spend millions of dollars making a 3 hour film about him then?  Did he suddenly lose all his confidence as a filmmaker?  Did he think that, having sat through all three hours, we would still not quite understand whether Malcolm X was admirable or not?  Hey, Spike!  Anyone can put together a montage with an upright-sounding voiceover.  Only Spike Lee can make ""Malcolm X"".  You did a good job, leave it alone!"

","With this epic biographical tale of Malcolm Little who becomes the great political, religious, and cultural leader known as Malcolm X Spike Lee ascends from the platform of good directors to the pantheon of the great. This film is an excellent example of what a director like Spike Lee is capable of when he is willing to set aside his agenda and simply tell a story about people, places, and moments that are very meaningful to him. Malcolm X is at once one of the best among biographical and spiritual films (And spiritual without shoving religion down the viewer's throat.) and is perhaps the most enlightening film I've ever seen.  This film has everything.  Great photography by Ernest Dickerson who has worked with Lee on many previous productions, but seems to be even better here, a terrific screenplay, astounding performances by Denzel Washington and Angela Basset, and all of it comes together brilliantly to encompass an individual's life in a way that perhaps other productions have never as fully succeeded. Throughout the course of the film though you may not always agree with Malcolm's philosophies, actions, and words you can at least appreciate the metamorphosis he goes through.  I don't know if I've ever seen or heard of an individual growing as much as Malcolm X does in this film, constantly transcending yesterday's mold and always aspiring to something greater. This is truly a great film.  Lots of films have style, some have content, few have depth, but this one is an amazing amalgamation of all three and is a great tribute not only to Malcolm X, the makers of the film, but to the indomitable spirit of humanity."

You learn about his young beginnings, youthful upbringing, how he became transformed into the Islamic leader, then his eventual disillusionment and further transformation.<br/><br/>This story was a fascinating view with strong acting by Denzel. He seems to thrive in characters where he can go a little over the top though, and at times, that can get a bit tiring, much like in the more recent Fences, where his non-stop action is something you cannot keep up with. Malcolm X was a bit like that, but you saw that Malcolm had a deliberateness and an immediacy to his actions that pushed action.<br/><br/>The setting was inner city with excellent costumes. His friend shorty and his other crew grew up to support and eventually adore Malcolm, but he also gained enemies. As his views started to venture from the strict Islam line, he created enemies. <br/><br/>The film got a bit slow at times, but Angela Basset as his girl helped bring a nice evenness to the plot by solidly standing by her man thru thick and thin. <br/><br/>This movie was a fascinating view of how a person can change colors, while always still doing the right thing according to their convictions. Such morals as Islam play a big role in our world today.

","One of the finest films Denzel Washington every has acted in. A brillant job he did first as 'Detriot Red' most people probably aren't fimilar with Malcom's previous way of life,but from what i've read about 'Detriot Red' he was portrayed well in this film in then some.<br/><br/>
There never was really a boring spot in the film...verey dramatic of course..got your attention,kept your attention. The film covered all points of life,childhood how he is the only black in his school,and how his teacher discourages him from becoming his dream of being a lawyer. As a man in his twenties,where he becomes a con artist...his time spent in jail,his conversion into Islam..and they whole period of that,in his exile out of Islam,which led to his tragic and untimely death.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10 stars Denzel arrived after this movie,that's for sure!"

","First of all I want to applaud Denzel Washington and Spike Lee on their great work. It is a outrage that Denzel and Spike did not win any Oscars for their roles. This movie depicts Malcolm X's life just the way it really is.I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it and recommend it to anyone interested in Malcolm's life. I am from Harlem and get to see first hand the racism that is still evident in America. BLACK POWER."

","Before MLK, Before O, there was - X.<br/><br/>MALCOLM X. A black man fighting for the black man in a white man's world.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is Malcolm Little (whom everyone calls ""Red"" for his conked red hair), a petty thief, cocaine addict, prostitute peddler, and all-round small-time gangsta before the term was invented. During the War Years, Malcolm falls in with West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo), plying his trade in Boston and New York, eventually being busted with his long-time friend and accomplice, Shorty (Spike Lee) and sent to jail.<br/><br/>In jail, about the time that Jackie Robinson made the major leagues in baseball, Malcolm Little becomes Malcolm X, to shuck off his ""slave name."" So begins the rise to power of one of America's great black leaders. But it is in jail that the movie MALCOLM X falters, as Malcolm's criminal outlook on life flip-flops to that of Islam, schooled by a pushy, annoying, racist fellow convict, Baines (Albert Hall). <br/><br/>Malcolm leaves prison as one of Islam's greatest exponents, an articulate, intelligent, outspoken community leader, preaching fire and damnation against the White Man, causing so much civil discomfort (even whilst awakening the self-respect of the black community) that it leads to his assassination by the Nation of Islam.<br/><br/>Proving my point about religious hypocrisy.<br/><br/>As I write this in 2009, there are ""two"" Americas - pre-Obama and post-Obama. Films like MALCOLM X created righteous outrage - but in a post-Obama world that outrage is obviously diluted. The Dream has been realized - where else is there to go for the Black Man? Yes, there will be racism - always. The human animal is built that way. But what more can be done or said than achieving the highest post in the world? <br/><br/>The point of films like X was to create righteous outrage so people would aspire to the goal of equality. To that point, X served its purpose bodaciously - in a pre-Obama world. In a post-Obama world, well, the struggle may not be over completely, but the ""outrage"" part surely must be. X opens with a burning American flag - power to the peeps an' all dat - but if you burn a flag NOW, isn't that just disrespect to the Black Man? Who happens to also be THE Man? <br/><br/>Spike Lee directs MALCOLM X from The Autobiography of Malcolm X, as told to Alex Haley. Though it is not Lee's fault, Malcolm's messages were garbled in religious hypocrisy and overt racism, and the messenger himself precluded this movie becoming an epic due to his small-mindedness; due to not being King: He called the Kennedy assassination ""justice... the chickens coming home to roost,"" saying it didn't make him sad, but glad. He called for ""complete separation between the black race and the white race"" and subscribed to juvenile mythologies like the Tribe of Shabazz, an ancient race of black kings and queens from whom the Caucasian race descended. (Nowhere nearly as sensible as the Tribe of David where an olive-skinned virgin gave birth to Jesus the Magic Caucasian and started a white race of Christians even though he was a Jew...) <br/><br/>Malcolm preaches, ""The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us the white man is the devil."" He doesn't say ""some white men"" - he says ALL white men are devils. These are the lessons he learns from that idiot Baines in jail. (I call him an idiot because religious fanaticism is a form of idiocy.) You could play a drinking game to this movie, on every time Malcolm X says, ""The Honorable Elijah Muhammad"" and by the end of the movie, you'll be drunk enough to convert to the Nation of Islam.<br/><br/>The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, though treated like a deity, was a flesh-and-blood guy, supposedly the apex of spirituality, his exact words: ""I have built this nation under the divine guidance of Allah"" - but the old Honorable Elijah Muhammad turns out not so honorable when news is leaked of two teenage girls who have sired children through his heavenly sperm. Malcolm meets with the girls, learns the pornographic truth, and is so disappointed in the Honorable Elijah Muhammad that he splits with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. (Jesus in Purgatory! Now he's got ME doing it!) <br/><br/>Malcolm X was a fiery political leader - Denzel's sexuality and charisma are tuned to breaking point on the podium, a perfect role for a perfect black panther - but it's unfortunate he had to resort to the crutch of religion to unite people. After he splits with the Honorabl--yeh, that guy, he has to maintain that his words are now not the Honora-- geez, there's no escaping this guy-- and that his words are his own. Why couldn't he do that from the start? Was Malcolm that weak-minded he needed to lean on the platitudes of a philandering old goat to unite people under a false aegis? <br/><br/>Spike Lee's movie-making is stupendous, Denzel's performance, electric. Malcolm X was charisma and brimstone and an inspiration for the black movement. But his message of Islam was plain stupid. I don't take away from the man - he is greater than I will ever be - but the delusion of religion obfuscated his underlying messages and this movie is shot through the prism of Malcolm's religious journey, which weakens the movie.<br/><br/>Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom the same faction who called him a religious hypocrite for splitting from them, The Nation of Islam ""under the divine guidance of Allah."" Need I say more about religious hypocrisy, the godlike manner in which they silenced him, or the Honorable Elijah Muhammad? A messianic eulogy ends this powerful film. But it's too late. I'm already drunk.<br/><br/>--Poffy The Cucumber"
"pmtelefon","4","1","3","11 December 2019"," Self indulgent and way too long
","I remember reading during the production of ""Malcolm X"" director/writer Spike Lee saying in an interview that he needed this movie to be over three hours long. He said that all of the great movie biographies were over three hours so this movie would be too. If a lengthy running time is a director's primary goal, his priorities are out of wack. A director's primary goal should be telling a good story. However, the very long running time isn't the only problem with ""Malcolm X"". The first half (the weaker half) is filled with distracting costumes, camera movement, dance numbers and endless cameos. For a while I thought this movie was going to have more cameos than ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". Another problem is Spike Lee's misuse of music. It pops up at the wrong times and takes you out of the drama of the scene. On the plus side, the acting is very good. When this movie was released film critics Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert said that movie was made for all audiences. That not true. ""Malcolm X"" was made for a very specific, very small audience. I am not part of that audience. If you are, more power to you. Honorable mention: Delroy Lindo."
"Thanos_Karagioras","7","1","3","8 January 2019"," An amazing movie for an amazing person...
","""Malcolm X"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the life story of Malcolm X. He was a legendary African American leader. He was born as Malcolm Little but he changed it to Malcolm X. When his father was killed by the Ku Klux Klan something changed him, he became a gangster and he spent some time in jail where he discovered Islam from the writings of Elijah Muhammad. He became a member of the Nation of Islam and he also visited Mecca.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because it is based on the life of a very controversial person who also influenced a lot of people. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was simply outstanding and I enjoyed very much the way it was presented all the life events of Malcolm X, from his early life as a young boy to the time he became a member of the Nation of Islam. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Denzel Washington who played as Malcolm X and for one more time I wasn't disappointed at all because he was simply amazing on this role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Angela Bassett's who played as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Albert Hall's who played as Baines and Delroy Lindo's who played as West Indian Archie.<br/><br/>To sum up, I have to say that ""Malcolm X"" is a very good movie with a great plot based on the life events of Malcolm X, some great interpretations made by its cast especially Denzel Washington's and a story that will be in your mind for a lot of time. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that every person no matter the religion he/she believes in, he/she has something to gain by watching it. This movie will make you think a lot of things except religion and the story of Malcolm X, it will make you think about your life, your choices and also your legacy."

","it escapes from each desired verdicts. or definitions. not only for the admirable performance of Denzel Washington but for the inspiration of Spike Lee to explore, with grace and precision, a not real comfortable way of a symbol of American XX century history. and the result is great. for the nuances and for the science to give a realistic portrait of society more than of man. for the admirable courage to not build a statue to a hero but to show the evolution of a honest, vulnerable man. for give the picture of an American society for who the radical positions are result of a huge pressure. and to use the shadows for a clear image of a leader and his powerful convictions."

","It's taken me a while to watch this film. I have to say that it's got it's problems. Mainly, the beginning is way too long and looks like it was shot for a different movie. And there are other nits.<br/><br/>However, Denzel Washington shines. He gets better and better and better as the film goes on. Wade through the first 30 mins, because the rest is well worth it.<br/><br/>I agree that Russell Crowe got gypped during the Academy Awards for ""A Beautiful Mind."" But Denzel clearly deserved the Oscar for ""Malcom X"" (Pacino won it that year for ""Scent of a Woman""). Does this make it all fair? Not really, but maybe a little."

","So concerned with making a powerful movie are some directors, they disdain the making of an entertaining one. Charming moments will imbue both players and message with a trust that viewers embrace and then recall with warmth for years to come. The best freedom epics are peppered with such moments (In-the-Heat-of-the-Night Lawrence-of-Arabia The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood 1970-New-York-Knicks). Had Mr. Lee this in mind, Malcolm-X may've pleased more (2.5/4) (4.2.20)."
"wkozak221","9","0","3","27 March 2020"," Excellent film except for one thing...
","I remember when Malcolm got killed. It was sad and jarring. This film does a good job in giving an in-depth, accurate portrayal. It moves along at a good pace. The only minus was when several black characters in the film say the white man is the genesis of all their problems. My grandparents and other came to America from Europe. They were poor, didn't know English, etc. . THEY DID NOT OWN ANY SLAVES! I am tired of hearing that excuse/opinion. Turn the page!"
"Mr-Fusion","8","0","1","17 February 2020"," An unbelievable life story
","Right to the point: I've got nothing but love for ""Malcolm X"".<br/><br/>Less a biopic than a sweeping American epic, it details the man's staggering journey from guttersnipe to cultural firebrand. It's absorbing on that aspect alone, but Denzel Washington in the lead role is another matter entirely. This is an actor who manages to embody the character, nearly disappearing into the role and making it come alive. Washington's skills at the pulpit highlight the ferocity of this character who inspires rebellion among his congregation. This is a resplendent film, well-mounted and carried out with conviction. It's easy to get wrapped up in and hard to forget once the credits role."
"Angeneer","7","0","6","17 May 2000"," A bit too long but well done
","Spike Lee created an epic in two parts. The first one illustrates the atmosphere of Malcolm's childhood and junior years and is less focused on the facts, the second one recites the story and leaves the atmosphere in the background. I cannot comment on the accuracy of the facts since I'm not familiar with Malcolm X's life, but I sense an effort to make him likeable to everyone. Of course this might be attributed to Denzel Washington, who does a remarkable job. The film has the right blend of personal and social life and it doesn't become cheesy except in the last minutes. It would be better for everyone if they didn't exist."
