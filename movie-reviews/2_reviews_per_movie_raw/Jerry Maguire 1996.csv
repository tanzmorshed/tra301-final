","I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story."

","This movie is a comedy, drama, romance, sports movie, and a money movie (e.g. Wall Street, where the main character is trying to make a lot of money). The problem such a movie faces is maintaining a consistent tone. Remember Prizzi's Honor? JM solves that problem by using restraint. It doesn't go over the top, although its characters sometimes do. It has funny moments, but it's not Animal House or American Pie. It's a drama, but it keeps the stakes low. This isn't Armageddon: they aren't trying to save the world. There are no life or death decisions. The romantic stakes aren't that high either: Renee Zellweger loves Tom Cruise, but she's been in love before and if this doesn't work out, she will be again. The only really high stakes are the money. By keeping the stakes low, JM let's us watch it with a bit of detachment.<br/><br/>This is more of a drama than a comedy. A good test is whether the characters change. Here, Tom Cruise starts off completely cynical, abruptly changes to ridiculously idealistic, then spends the rest of the movie finding the right balance. Renee Zellweger starts by loving Tom Cruise from afar, then gets him, then has to work out her ambiguous feelings.<br/><br/>JM is fun to watch. The characters, though flawed, are sympathetic. We enjoy watching them succeed, fail (sometimes in funny ways), and try to discover what they really care about. It's complicated, thoughtful, and surprisingly subtle."
"classicalsteve","9","50","61","31 August 2007"," Agent Seeks Something Higher -- Possibly Cruise's Best Film
","At the 1997 Academy Awards, host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees (of which Tom Cruise was one) as being ""a burned guy, a mentally-challenged guy, a mentally-abused guy, a paralyzed guy, and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable."" Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film ""Jerry Maguire"", Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.<br/><br/>""Who am I, and what am I doing?"" Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency, SMI, tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring, transcendent, and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration, he loses his place at his agency and many of his highest-paying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently, he also loses his attractive but shallow fiancé. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athlete/clients' multi-million-dollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence, he retains his client Frank ""Cush"" Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father, played by Beau Bridges. However, on draft day, he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar, through deception, convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now, Maguire has retained only Tidwell, and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point.<br/><br/>So the question asked of the movie is: Can a sports agent find a more meaningful, possibly spiritual, life and still acquire the high-paying clientèle? And maybe even more to the point, can an agent make a difference beyond just being a high-powered money negotiator? ""Jerry Maguire"" is a thoroughly entertaining riches-to-rags-to-transcendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence.<br/><br/>The film works at almost all levels, particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Award-winning performance, playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and more-satisfying existence. Rod Tidwell (Gooding), wide receiver for the Cardinals, is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband, emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world, Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team, and Cruise giving to his clients and co-worker/lover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself.<br/><br/>In the materialistic world of late 20th-century America, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the money-obsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of self-promotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. ""Jerry Maguire"" offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind."

","By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, `Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in `Jerry Maguire,' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.<br/><br/>	Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really? Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding `No.'  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.<br/><br/>
	In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' as in `Money talks, Jerry walks.'  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the `real' Jerry Maguire. <br/><br/>	Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with `Say Anything' in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In `Jerry Maguire' he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.<br/><br/>	Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.<br/><br/>	Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he `Show me the money!' Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.<br/><br/>	Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a `giving' actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  9/10.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic."

","It's all well and good to stroll through life with a healthy air of scepticism, but despite some peoples' views on these supposedly 'manipulative' romantic films, there are an elite few that really do have things to say based on something more noble than ticket sales - things that are actually worth listening to.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is one of these rare beasts. No, it's not perfect, and no, it doesn't ring true for every last second of its running time, but if you come away from it with a sneer rather than a genuine desire to take a step back and look at yourself, then there's no romance in your soul at all. It's a genre that's always been particularly susceptible to the flood of lacklustre money-spinners, so to come across something that's had so much visible thought and effort thrown into it from all corners is a revelation. I'm not naive enough to think that anything making it big in the film industry these days can be purely a labour of love, but Jerry Maguire at least comes close.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise demonstrate that, against all odds, he can act his heart out when given the right role, as can Cuba Gooding Jr. (neither of them better previously or since) - and the rest of the cast give it every bit as much passion. It's beautifully written, and shot with an easy style that makes me wish there were more directors like Cameron Crowe in this world.<br/><br/>And on top of that, it gets better with each viewing. Even the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent fine-tuning it to perfection, and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like, I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your self-awareness questioned once in a while."
"GilbertAlmond42","8","77","103","19 April 2006"," An amazing film
","I refused to see Jerry Maguire for several years, assuming it was a cheap movie about money, sports and sex. When i finally watched it on TV, i was blown away. This movie is about hope, redemption, love, and finding out the meaning of life. Tom Cruise does a spectacular job playing someone with nothing to loose, and Cuba Gooding's performance brought tears to my eyes. Renee Zellweger fits perfectly by having great chemistry with Jerry, and by having a normal, plain look. This film works because it's so real and easily plausible; its a witty, romantic drama more than a romantic comedy that proves its never too late to start over or take a risk."

","""Jerry Maguire"" did something very strange in 1996: it had both critical and commercial success.  This was evident in the fact that the four other Best Picture nominees for the year were all independent productions.  ""Jerry Maguire"" shows the business world of America at its worst, in this case in the sports industry.  When Jerry Maguire, a sports agent, (played by Oscar-nominated Tom Cruise) has a breakthrough one night he realizes that quality is more important than quantity.  Of course he is fired from his job and loses all of his clients except Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in his Oscar-winning performance).  Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) has left the business with Maguire, agreeing with his views.  However, Maguire struggles with his separation from the sports corporation (losing his fiance and the first pick in the NFL Draft).  However, he survives and learns that living well and loving well are the keys to happiness.  All in all, ""Jerry Maguire"" is classic Hollywood stuff made in the present-day.  Cameron Crowe's script and direction are subtle, but extremely effective.  Tom Cruise delivered his best performance to date.  Renee Zellweger proved to be the find of the year and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s quotes and scenes he stole were enough to win him the Oscar in a very competitive year in the Best Supporting Actor category.  ""Jerry Maguire"" is not a perfect film. In fact it is flawed in many ways and is not very accurate in some areas.  However, its ability to mix comedy, romance, and drama make it a very entertaining film.  The performances are all excellent.  4.5 out of 5 stars."

","I just finished watching this movie for the third time and I still love this movie as much as I did after the first time I watched it. Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story, The whole is absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about ""Jerry Maguire"", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.<br/><br/>I read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.<br/><br/>So my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Tom Cruise had one of his best roles and earned his second Oscar Nomination for Best Actor for his charismatic JERRY MAGUIRE, a richly entertaining comedy drama that is a seamless blend of character study and romantic comedy. Jerry is a driven and ambitious sports agent for an international agency that represents professional athletes in all sports who has a crisis of conscience that motivates him to write a ""mission statement"", which turns out to be more of a defiant manifesto blasting everything that is wrong in his business. he distributes his ""memo"" throughout the office and though it gets faint praise initially, it does end up getting him fired from the agency. We then see Jerry try to continue his business though he only has one client who agrees to stick with him. Director-writer Cameron Crowe (FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH; ALMOST FAMOUS)solidified his position as a master cinematic storyteller with this epic story told on an intimate scale. His extremely deft screenplay is sharply delivered by a perfect cast. This role seems tailor-made for Cruise and he makes the most of it. Cuba Gooding Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his star-making performance as Rod Tidwell, Jerry's most loyal client; Renee Zelwegger was the find of the year as Dorothy Boyd, the secretary from the agency who follows Jerry when he's fired and agrees to work for him and eventually falls for him; Bonnie Hunt scores as Dorothy's sister as does Kelly Preston, in one of her best performances as Jerry's shark of an ex-fiancée. Regina King should have received an Oscar nomination for her solid performance as Tidwell's wife, Marcy; Jay Mohr is quite funny as Bob Sugarman, a rival agent who is battling Jerry to represent another football player (Jerry O'Connell)who is being watched over by his protective dad (Beau Bridges). A rare gem from the 1990's that is not only grandly entertaining, but vividly real...there's nothing false or affected here (though some might find Gooding's Tidwell a little over the top), this film is one of those rare treats that is long, but you hardly feel it. A real treat and a must for Cruise fans."
"deadpool2008","10","13","16","24 September 2011"," Cheesy, contrived, bloated...but I love it
","I've seen Jerry Maguire a number of times but it was only on my most recent viewing, at the age of 23, that I came to truly appreciate it. Yes it is all the things I described in the title; but it is also a charming and original film filled with excellent performances, under the control of a man who knows exactly what story he wants to tell. I'm not going to tell everyone it doesn't have its flaws- I can picture Crowe sitting there and smiling to himself after writing ""You had me at hello""- but this is anything but a bad film. <br/><br/>Jerry Maguire features an unusual central romance, with Cruise and Zellweger's characters getting together more out of convenience than love (on his part anyway). The relationship is handled with maturity and honesty by all involved. Cruise is terrific throughout the whole film but it is his moments with Zellweger and her character's son where he truly shines. Zellweger herself, oft maligned, also puts in a great performance and in my opinion she has never looked lovelier. But it is the relationship between Cruise's Maguire and Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr's Rod Tidwell that is the film's real selling point. It's a relationship built on loyalty, trust and friendship. The film has its twists and turns (and it is too long) but it is the bond between agent and star that keeps the film afloat and ultimately gives it a happy ending.<br/><br/>Oscar Note: I don't know what the reaction was like at the time but popular opinion nowadays is that Gooding didn't deserve the Oscar. Bill Macy and Ed Norton are often cited as being robbed, and I can't deny that they were excellent in their respective roles, but I believe Gooding to be more than worthy. You'd be hard pressed to find a more electric, entertaining and effective performance in any film."

It's given us the lines ""Show me the money"", ""Help me, Help you"", ""You had me at hello"" and ""You complete me"". And it's that last line, that really describe this movie. It's really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, it's not an easy trip but for the most part it's an entertaining one. <br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and he's engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital, the client's young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a ""mission statement"" for the company. The ""mission statement"" basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesn't like it. <br/><br/>The movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athlete's earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning they're just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end, Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients they're more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise, and he gives one of his best performance. I think it's every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jr's. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. It's sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger, who plays an office worker in Tom Cruise's office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his ""mission statement"" into practice. <br/><br/>All in all, I think it's a good movie with a very observant script, complimented by great acting."

Some scenes fall flat and Gooding Jr's Oscar winning turn is hard to support when watched under current conditions, all yelling and hyperactivity, it's not exactly the type of performance that you'd call the ""year's best"" although those feel good vibes and the films overall success no doubt influenced many who were under the spell of Crowe and his audience appeasing venture.<br/><br/>A fun, smile inducing film that's influence can't be underestimated, Jerry Maguire is over the top and filled with Hollywoodized moments, plus it's fair share of over the top scenarios and performance but with Crowe in the best form of his career as a filmmaker and Cruise on peak likability mode, Jerry Maguire is a film worthy of its reputation even if it's not quite the classic some would label it to be and absolutely a product of its time.<br/><br/>3 ½ memo's out of 5"

Summararily canned by his agency, he's forced to scramble to save his career, with the help of his assistant Dorothy (Renée Zellweger) and their one client, head-case wideout Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.)<br/><br/>With this movie, it becomes clear that Cameron Crowe took the ball from John Hughes and ran with it. The kind of films Hughes used to make, of weepy love scenes and whipsmart wisecracks set against an esoteric pop score, are the kind of films Crowe makes, only with adults. In that way, ""Jerry Maguire"" satisfies.<br/><br/>What grates about this movie, and more with other Crowe films like ""Almost Famous"", is the way people speak to each other in the form of taglines rather than actual human speech. ""Just jump right into my nightmare, the water's warm!"" ""I'm her disapproving sister."" ""I've had three lovers in four years, and all of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath."" ""That's more than a dress. That is an Audrey Hepburn movie."" ""Help me help you!""<br/><br/>At least Crowe has the good sense of turning the last line into a running joke. He also is helped, unlike ""Almost Famous"", with the kind of top-notch cast that can make the most of groaner lines like the almost-infamous ""You complete me"".<br/><br/>Cruise is electric on screen, finding the perfect channel for his high-energy persona in the always-on Jerry. Zellweger has a lot of gooey moments, but extracts every ounce of rightness from them to make for a compelling emotional center. Jay Mohr as a rival agent is a wonderfully hateful foil. I can hear him say ""Whatever"" now.<br/><br/>Gooding won an acting Oscar for ""Maguire"". Watching him, you understand why. Every time the film seems ready to sag into some touchy-feely moment, his Tidwell is on hand to keep things hopping and real. I can't say I understand why exactly Jerry is constantly questioned about the honesty of his feelings for Dorothy, though it is a major theme of the film's last hour. It's probably why ""Jerry Maguire"" is not a guy film despite the sports setting. When people talk and talk so openly about their feelings, I feel like a nun at a Sam Peckinpah double-feature.<br/><br/>This film didn't quite have me at hello, but kept me watching longer than I expected. Give Crowe credit for investing his chick flick with enough humor and energy to keep things from getting too soft. Give Cruise and the rest of the cast praise for strong performances around the horn. And give Dicky Fox a big salute for that fabulous final line. I wish you the same thing he did."

","For those who endearingly miss Tom Cruise as a fine actor, or Cameron Crowe at the top of his games, JERRY MAGUIRE is a blast from the past. Our titular hero (Cruise) is a smug predator in a cutting-throat capitalistic business, who suddenly grows a conscience, and then immediately makes a wrong move, trying to exhort his peers to also grow a conscience, unfortunately the majority of those is too cynical to accept his noble motion, he is therefore blackballed and according to Murphy's law, must hit the rock bottom, which only leaves him a loyal admirer/accountant Dorothy Boyd (Zellweger), his only client, an under-the-radar football star Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr.) and a goldfish. <br/><br/>Tailored to USA's pernicious winner/loser ethos, the subsequent upswing must diligently tackle two most important things a man must obtain, his career and his love life, to prove the world that he is not a loser but a bona-fide winner, aka, it is the ""kwan"", that really matters to one's truth worth, a magically coined word by Crowe. Cogently the film thrives as a sincere page-turner albeit Crowe being rather deferential towards all the genre tropes, his script coruscates with a cordial sympathy towards Jerry's fix and a tangential self-awareness of eschewing the mawkishness, conceivably, it is a story borne out of affection and deliberation, but one defective looms large in the end is that Crowe doesn't get more into the agent business maybe because it is not his forte, the triumphalism is approached through Rod's doughty sportsmanship (a cinematic but garden-variety antic with a sharp tang of cruelty, in real life, more often than not, a player is physically permanently damaged), and what Jerry has attributed to the triumph is regretfully left largely untapped, however he would right this wrong in his next film ALMOST FAMOUS (2000), which is more in his element, inspired by the days when he was a contributing editor of Rolling Stones Magazine. <br/><br/>One might argue JERRY MAGUIRE is the film where Tom Cruise's Hollywood golden-boy charisma is in his highest voltage, and his effort is incontrovertibly contagious, ever so remarkable he devotes himself entirely to a character which is quite self-referential in a manner (riding a money- seeking business, deviled by commitment issue, cannot deal with being alone), sheds self- consciousness and flexes his muscles to bring forth exigency, compassion and warmth, in company with a honest-to-goodness romance playing off against a self-abasing Renée Zellweger, who also punches above her weight in a conventional ugly-duckling role but spiffed up with a strong sense of dignity and sensibility, she knows when to waive what doesn't worthy of her even it is what she really wants, that is in my humble opinion, the most valuable takeaway of the whole movie. The homey atmosphere is also magically graced by a heart-melting Jonathan Lipnicki as Dorothy's cutie son and Bonnie Hunt's protective but amenable elder sister (although that divorced women group gag should be relegated to a cheesy chick flick dud).<br/><br/>Lastly, about Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Oscar victory, he does strut his stuff with a highfalutin bravado, errs on the side of being clownish but essentially an entertaining hoot, like the film per se, a feel- good treat concocted with a conscience."

","I finally re-watched this after about ten years, and it's still great after all this time. No one can bring out the emotion and heart out of, what in any other writer director's hands, would have been just another romantic comedy. Crowe's script is funny, warm and thoughtful, and he brings out the best in his cast. Cruise is as charming as ever, and Crowe's script offers a deconstruction of the typical shark character Cruise can play with ease by giving him a wife to not only love, but rely and depend on. Zellweger is charming and really pulls off playing a single mom without feeling too much like a movie star. Gooding Jr's Oscar-winning performance is delightful, but characters like (the perfect) Bonnie Hunt as Zellweger's ""disapproving"" sister or Jay Mohr as a scum-bucket agent bring out the natural charm and joy in Crowe's script and stop Cruise and Zellweger from turning the picture into just another romance.<br/><br/>What really sets Jerry Maguire apart however is the focus that a successful marriage depends on both husband and wife giving themselves over to each other completely. What a great message in a world where most big romantic films end just as the real relationship begins."

","This movie had me laughing; crying; smiling; staring; anticipating; everything.  When I viewed the voter history for this movie, I couldn't believe the rating it had received after 13,400 registered users had voted. This movie was excellent from the direction to the production sets.  The acting was superb by all but could not and would not have been as great if it had not been for the vision of the director.  I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it everywhere.  The scenes, the sequences, the editing were all great.  Though I'm not involved in the movie industry yet, I try to observe details in a production that make a good, bad, or great movie.  In this case everything fell into place.  The music for certain scenes was perfect.  The characters were extremely believable.  Everyone in the lead and supporting roles deserve an award of some type.  I'm a 49 year old male with two grown kids and two grandchildren but I'm not ashamed to say I was filled with emotion as I watched this film.  I believe a film should consume the viewer- to me that's great filmmaking.  If I can leave my seat or carry on a conversation while watching a film, it's not great- it might be good, but not great.  Jerry Maguire had my undivided attention.  Kudos to everyone involved in the production of this movie.  I waited four years to see this movie which I finally purchased on VHS cassette two or three months ago.  It was a worthy investment and I will soon purchase it on DVD.  Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!"
"nell_ward","8","6","9","12 March 2012"," Very emotional
","It's all well and good to stroll through life with a healthy air of scepticism, but despite some peoples' views on these supposedly 'manipulative' romantic films, there are an elite few that really do have things to say based on something more noble than ticket sales - things that are actually worth listening to.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is one of these rare beasts. No, it's not perfect, and no, it doesn't ring true for every last second of its running time, but if you come away from it with a sneer rather than a genuine desire to take a step back and look at yourself, then there's no romance in your soul at all. It's a genre that's always been particularly susceptible to the flood of lacklustre money-spinners, so to come across something that's had so much visible thought and effort thrown into it from all corners is a revelation. I'm not naive enough to think that anything making it big in the film industry these days can be purely a labour of love, but Jerry Maguire at least comes close.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise demonstrate that, against all odds, he can act his heart out when given the right role, as can Cuba Gooding Jr. (neither of them better previously or since) - and the rest of the cast give it every bit as much passion. It's beautifully written, and shot with an easy style that makes me wish there were more directors like Cameron Crowe in this world.<br/><br/>And on top of that, it gets better with each viewing. Even the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent fine-tuning it to perfection, and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like, I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your self-awareness questioned once in a while."
"blanche-2","8","7","11","28 March 2008"," A sports agent finds the high road steep
","Tom Cruise, before his chin implant, is ""Jerry Maguire"" in this 1996 film also starring Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jay Mohr and Bonnie Hunt. Beautifully directed by Cameron Crowe, the film tells the story of a hotshot sports agent who writes a piece about the ethics of being a sports agent, encouraging a smaller client list and more personal service. He then passes it out to the rest of the agents in the firm, SMI. It goes without saying that he's fired, but before he goes, he asks if there is anyone who wants to go with him as he sets out on his own. A single mother, Dorothy (Zellweger), inspired by his missive though partially blinded by the stars in her eyes, says yes. Jerry ends up minus his fiancée (Kelly Preston) and stuck with one client (Gooding) that no one is particularly interested in, a football player whose mantra is ""Show me the money!"" But no one is. As he struggles to make a lucrative deal for his client, Jerry has to also deal with his personal life - Dorothy and her love for him, which he can't really return, her mistrusting sister (Hunt) and Dorothy's son (Jonathan Lipnicki) whom he adores.<br/><br/>This is a fast-moving film with wonderful performances and lots of warmth, humor and honesty. Jerry learns quickly that when it comes to money, he's friendless, that there's very little loyalty and lots of liars. Tom Cruise is excellent as a young man trying to find his way through a labyrinth of a client with a bad attitude, no money, a hasty marriage and staying with the principles in his manifesto. Zellweger, in her career-making performance, is sweet and touching as Dorothy. Gooding has the most flamboyant part and makes the most of it as an athlete who has to learn that in order to have someone show him the money, he has to show a little heart first.<br/><br/>A great movie, highly regarded for a reason, with a soundtrack to match. Highly recommended."

","If Jerry Maguire is a typical American, give me a one-way ticket to Winnipeg.  This is a film whose values are so out of whack that it shocks me that it's universal acclaim confounds me.  The film tells us the following: money is important, public affection is important (sure Cuba Gooding and the Daughter from ""227"" are a cute couple, but if they were making out at a restaurant in front of me, I'd slap 'em till they were insane), jazz is bad and lame (I guess John Coltrane and Miles Davis aren't as venerable music talents as Heart), and of course, America sets the tone for the world. The whole film can be summed up with one sequence.  Rod Tidwell catches a touchdown and inspires a nation on Monday Night Football.  What does that mean?  Tidwell can now bank on a fat new contract.  Boy that's a real tear-jerker.  Go rent ""Brian's Song,"" and get your priorities in order."
"slaterms","Null","21","44","28 September 2003"," Not a total waste of time, but...
","I recently saw ""Jerry Maguire"" on NBC.  While it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, it is probably the worst with a pro-football based theme that I can remember.  It was predicatable and woefully saccarine.<br/><br/>This was the movie which coined the phrase ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!"" back in '96, which I found almost immediately irritating.  Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire) was his usual over-emoting self.  Renee Zellweger's character (Maguire's love interest, Dorothy) was revolting.  Cuba Gooding Jr, (Maguire's only remaining client, the cocky Rod Tidwell) was annoying throughout.  That little kid (Dorothy's son), although cute, seemed awfully stoic for a youngster when saying goodbye to Maguire when he and his mother were about to move out of Jerry's life.<br/><br/>The bright light here was Jay Mohr's excellent portrayal of a sleazy, aggressive, backstabbing fellow sports-agent.  Mohr's portrayal was so good that I found myself wanting to come through the screen an wring his neck -- and this even though I found no emotional attachment to Cruise's character.<br/><br/>[possible spoiler warning] ..probably not necessary since this movie was so transparent.<br/><br/>The writing and acting was so bad, the outcome so predictable.  Tidwell gets k.o.'d after scoring the winning touchdown, and the world holds its breath. After sufficient nail-biting time, he leaps up, does and end-zone jig, climbs up the side of the stadium, etc...pretty good for someone who just sustained a near-concussion.<br/><br/>Tidwell gets his long sought $12.8mil contract(or something like that, the obscene salaries of these guys was about the only believable aspect of this film).   He then hugs everyone in sight and weeps.<br/><br/>Maguire enters a ladies divorce support group with Dorothy in attendance and says to her something like ""You will not get rid of me, I won't let you go!"" (something that would get many men a restraining order, and their girlfriends a stay at a battered woman's shelter).  Dorothy, of course, takes him back, and they live happily ever after... la la la!<br/><br/>Sports fans, you can do much better.  Ditto romance lovers.<br/><br/>3 of 10 *s"

","Every time I see a football player act like he's been mortally wounded, and then gets up and continues playing just fine, I think of this movie. Cuba Gooding plays just such a character but Tom Cruise is the star of this movie which did pretty well at the box office. You wouldn't think a film about a sports agent would be this successful.<br/><br/>THE GOOD - Generally nice people that you want to root for, especially the kid, ""Ray Boyd,"" played by Jonathan Lipnicki, That was this child's first film and he went on to further fame in the Stuart Little movies and now on television. Cuba Gooding was funny in an exaggerated role of the greedy and show-boating football player. Cruise and Rene Zellweger are big names in the business who usually deliver good performances.<br/><br/>THE BAD - Nineties morality (sex right off the bat, and a few other attitudes) and overuse of the f-word. There's not an excessive amount, but way too many f- words for a nice romantic-comedy like this. The film gets a bit soap opera-like at times, and is a little long. <br/><br/>OVERALL - Despite the good outweighing the bad, and a generally likable group of characters, I really never had the urge to watch this a second time. Oh, and a postscript: those soccer players in the World Cup that just concluded did Cuba proud with their ""swan dives"" throughout the tournament.

","This movie is about two guys, both of whom are on the fringes of their respective professions, neither of whom are particularly liked, both of whom who are angry and disillusioned, who transcend their racial differences to form a bond of friendship. This movie strives to achieve greatness, and fails. If it wasn't for Tom Cruise, this movie would have been entirely unwatchable. Just another pretentious movie.<br/><br/>Ever watch a movie the first time and like it, then, some time later, watch the same movie a second time, and not like it? Well if that's happened to you, then you will understand where I'm coming from. After watching this movie the first time, I was really impressed with the story and with the acting, and overlooked some major annoyances in the story. But while watching this movie a second time, the annoyances and contrivances were so glaring that they could not be ignored. The relationship between Jerry and his co-worker ... no, his secretary ... no, his girlfriend ... no, his partner ... or whatever, was so awful that it made me cringe in embarrassment; nor was the girlfriend particularly attractive or smart. What was worse was the girlfriend's son, whose role was played by an actor who has to be one of the most bizarre-looking and bizarre-acting child actors ever in the history of Hollywood. This kid made Spanky and Alfalfa seem as normal as apple pie. Then there was Jerry Maguire himself. Who in their right mind would want to have anything to do with a loser like Jerry Maguire? Yet the director apparently wants the audience to believe that Jerry is really a good guy, even after getting punched on the nose and kicked in the stomach by his fiancé, who couldn't take Jerry's erratic behavior anymore. Not exactly the stuff for an entertaining movie. The one character I did like in the this movie, however, was Jerry's one and only client, an angry football player who, unlike Jerry, had reason to be angry and who demands that Jerry get his act together, do his job and show him the money. Yet the relationship between Jerry and his client is so contorted, contrived and improbable that even allowing for literary license, it's hard to buy (get the pun?), even for a movie. After watching this movie for a second time, my advice for any would-be professional athlete is to avoid a Jerry Maguire and represent yourself instead --- you'll get a better deal."

I suffered through three hours of seeing Renée Zellweger (very talented actress, this was the first time I saw her) say that Tom Cruise's character was such a great guy for actually saying he should spend time on his sports athlete clients.  At the expense of other clients. Zellweger does a good job, though there's no reason why her character or anyone else would quit her job because some guy wrote a few words about caring.  Many of us receive stuff like this in regular inspirational e-mails from our bosses or coworkers, and see what Dorothy (Zellweger) failed to see -- it's talk, and it's cheap. Cruise spends three hours trying to show that he cares about something or everything.  There's little reason to see this as anything but acting through the lines in the script, as Cruise never once manages to show that he does care. The great thing about this movie is how it resusciated Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career from unwarranted obscurity.  Aside from that, there's little to like here.

When I often encounter the typical passionless British citizen with a fat belly who works in I.T, who has nothing but dislike and hatred for Tom cruise (and this is common in Britain), it paints a clear picture of the emotionless society we British people live in.<br/><br/>People in Britain often live life in a disheartened state. British people are often disheartened by their sexless marriages, their mundane jobs, and their cowardice nature that prevents them from embracing the many beautiful things about life.<br/><br/>In my experience, more often than not, British people live unhappily (compared to American's anyway) and they point their fingers at wonderful people like Tom Cruise to make themselves feel better. Jerry MaGuire is often considered a cinematic catastrophe by the British  and it's all because the British have no idea how to connect with their souls.<br/><br/>This is why we are famous for disparaging our great people (until they are dead of course), because we are a gutless nation with no zeal for life and the things that make our existence so special.<br/><br/>America is the greatest country in the world, and I think it has everything to do with the fact that their people are generally the most affable, genuine, happy, good-natured, passionate, people on the planet. I think the overall opinion of great cinematography says everything about a nation and its people.<br/><br/>Jerry MaGuire is a film that is held dearly in the hearts of the American people. A film of love, trust, friendship, loyalty, and all the essential attributes required to be a great human-being who makes others happy also.<br/><br/>Jerry MaGuire is a film of passion that inspires the human spirit to become a better spirit  a film that illustrates the unique beauty of the American people that very few Brits fully understand and appreciate.<br/><br/>I know I'm not one of those Brits.<br/><br/>Jerry MaGuire: you are my ambassador of Quan!"

But the premise of the celebration is very, very dubious indeed. <br/><br/>I kept waiting for the big revelation to arrive; when was McQuire going to reinvent himself or reinvent the industry to acknowledge and minimize the greed? I sat through an incredibly boring wedding and an even more boring break-up to arrive at the conclusion: an arrogant sports star is a hero for getting up after tripping over (in full protective gear!) and is now able to negotiate the contract which will keep his even more arrogant family happy.<br/><br/>When you consider that the average African-American family would have been more than happy with the offer that was on the table during the bleak dark days before this movie reaches its ""climax"", I fail to see how ""Jerry McQuire"" connected with anyone.<br/><br/>This movie insults the intelligence."

","Every person is probably bound to have to take a look at his/her life at some point or other. Movies often like to use this as a plot, but not all pull it off. ""Jerry Maguire"" manages to pull it off. As the sports writer title character, Tom Cruise makes the most of himself (something that he too often doesn't do). Fired from his job, he hooks up with single mom Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), and goes through a further life-changing experience.<br/><br/>It's hard to say who has the best role in this movie. Without a doubt, Cruise and Zellweger do very well in their roles - Zellweger was clearly showing the talent that she would later bring to ""Chicago"" and other movies. Cuba Gooding Jr. won Best Supporting Actor for his role as athlete Rod Tidwell. The imperfect but assertive Tidwell is a hard character to qualify, which is part of what makes him so interesting. Maybe ""Jerry Maguire"" wasn't the year's best movie, but I wholeheartedly recommend it. You'll never look at things the same way again."

All the Right Moves, and Days of Thunder echo in my mind. Sure, many people love this movie, for reasons beyond comprehension, but not this sports-fan.

","This is an awkward attempt at linking a sports movie with a romance story.

Gooding's fast babbling and shouting sometimes became an earful, but overall it an interesting and likable character. Gooding made ""Show me the money!"" a commonly-quoted sound-bite.<br/><br/>This was the first time I saw Rene Zellweger, and her performance as Dorothy was touching and sweet. You feel her growing sadness and frustration at her situation. Like Gooding, she gave us a memorable line: ""You had me at hello."" Johnathon Lipnicki is great as her son, who bonds with Jerry instantly, but is confused by his behavior.<br/><br/>Then there's Tom Cruise. As usual, he over-emotes, swings his arms all over the place when he's talking, looks bewildered at everything, and turns in yet another uninspired role. Like so many other movies, strong acting by his co-stars carries the load and Tom just poses for the camera with the same old glazed expression. Unfortunately, he's playing the title character, and as such, should do something beyond reading from cue cards.<br/><br/>Without Cruise, the film might have warranted a 7.

I also enjoyed Ray (Dorothy's young son) and really liked the relationship him and Jerry developed throughout the movie. Rod Tidwell, played by Cuba Gooding Jr was another enjoyable character as he was funny and I loved how he never lost faith in Jerry as his agent.

","Jerry Maguire is a sports agent at the top of his game working for Sports Management International.

However, after a bad TV dinner in a hotel room, Jerry realises that this molly-coddling, not-telling-them-like-it approach, that the agents industry has put out their over such a long time might not be what's best for his clients, and decides to speak his mind with disastrous consequences. Armed with only one client who would stick with him, and the one assistant from his old firm who would stick by him, with the help of her ever-so-cute son, Jerry has to re-build his shattered life and reputation from scratch.<br/><br/>The most apt description ever of this film is that it is a chick-flick for guys. Everything about this film screams chick flick, but because men folk are thick, because it has sports in it, we think it's for us. We're easily fooled! This for me was Tom Cruise's big breakthrough film, far from the confident, cocky, brash Tom Cruise we had seen before here was a different side, a human side, and it is his portrayal of Jerry, a man brought to his knees by an industry that doesn't care, that really sucks us in. You know that in spite of all the things that get thrown at him, he is a good person, and while he may have approached things the wrong way, his heart's in the right place, and it is inspired casting by Cameron Crowe and his team to get Tom in this role.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast fill out their rolls superbly well, and Renee Zellwegger, Bonnie Hunt, Jay Mohr and Jonathan Lipnicki (Apologies for spelling folks) all are great in the rolls as assistant, assistant's sister, rival agent and assistant's son. However the big turn on the film other than Tom is Cuba Gooding Jnr as the under-rated Rod Tidwell, whose un-noticed form helps carry his team to greater things. So convincing is his portrayal, by the time you're midway through it you almost feel like your watching some fly on the wall documentary.<br/><br/>The direction in this film is superb and this, along with ""Say Anything"" are arguably his best work. The script is one of the best I've seen out on the big screen and itnever lets you settle in you seat. But in spite of all the ups and downs of Jerry and the motley crew that gather round him of course this is a feel good film, and if you're not humming ""Shelter from the storm"" a few minutes after watching this film then you can show me the money.<br/><br/>Nuff said."

","Writer/director Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything"" and ""Singles"") seems to be very much in touch with human emotion as he penned this story about relationships. On the surface ""Jerry Maguire"" appears to be about a down and out sports agent who is desperately trying to keep life and soul together as his world crumbles about him. Really though this touching, often funny film is primarily concerned with the relationships we have with the ones we love.<br/><br/>Cruise has found some form again as he looks for true meaning in his work and his personal life, though he never seems to be able to get a handle on his emotions nor his true feelings. Renee Zellweger is also thoroughly enjoyable in her debut as the faithful accounts clerk who believes in Jerry's ideals more strongly than he does, but who ultimately only needs his love, not his admiration or friendship. Both the leads are easily, and quite willingly, outdone by young Jonathan Lipnick, too cute as Dorothy's six year old boy who steals many scenes and gets some of the funniest lines. A special mention must go to Cuba Gooding Junior in his Oscar winning role. His is a passionate portrayal of an aging footballer whose sincere love of his family is not reflected in his game. Also stars Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston, Regina King, Jerry O'Connell and Jay Mohr. Bruce Springteen's ""Secret Garden"" provides a moving love theme.<br/><br/>Many times Crowe seems more in tune with women's feelings than men's, so spot on are his female characters. A shame that such an insightful drama didn't have the morals nor the 'truth' to go with it (money doesn't matter, as long as you've got plenty of it seems rather a confused message).

"sherbetsaucers","8","4","6","6 February 2007"," Not Just A Chick-Flick
","Once, long ago, before Renée Zellweger was British or Cuba Gooding Jr. was famous, the two of them starred in a movie with Tom Cruise. That movie was called Jerry Maguire.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays the title role, a part originally written for Tom Hanks. Maguire is a professional sports agent, a self confessed 'Shark in a suit'. Unfortunately for him, one night he develops a conscience, which leads to him typing up a mission statement which contains the rather foolish line 'Fewer clients. Less Money.' This rather unorthodox approach is not appreciated by the company he works for, who promptly fire him. Maguire manages to take with him Dorothy Boyd from accounts (Zellweger), a fish, and one client, the Oscar winning Gooding, who plays a rather annoying American Footballer. He leaves everything else, including his friends, most of his dignity and his fiancée behind, though this last one is no bad thing as Zellweger has admired him from afar for a long time and now is her chance. By the end of the movie Maguire has realised what's important in life, and the audience all know it's going to be alllllll right.<br/><br/>Now, I can be as cynical as the next man, unless I'm on a coach full of estate agents, but this movie really gets me. Yes, we know exactly what's going to happen, there are no real surprises, but in a Romance like this the destination isn't the point, the journey is. And what a journey.<br/><br/>The first pleasant sight we can see to our left is that Tom Cruise is actually a very good comedy actor. I've never really been a fan of insulting Mr Cruise, and it's movies like this that reassure me that the man can actually do something other than look very pretty. Then of course there is Jonathan Lipnicki as Zellweger's son, Ray Boyd, who at the tender age of 6 manages to steal every scene he is in. It's like someone put the Milky Bar Kid, Shirley Temple and a baby puppy into a blender, hit go, poured the pulp into some kind of child star mold, put it in the freezer for a while to set, then got these big electrodes and attached them. OK, not sure where I'm going with this, but the kid is cute and lovable and not all that bad, OK? Renée Zellweger appears, (well done her). However her sister, played by Bonnie Hunt, actually gets something to do other than make the appropriate face at Tom Cruise (adoring, understanding, mournful and adoring) and so gets a chance to really shine, and believe me she does. This woman should be a bigger star than she is though I get the feeling she may well be more suited to a television format.<br/><br/>The real revelation is, of course, Cuba Gooding Jr. His portrayal of Rod Tidwell, which deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, is key to the movie. Despite his 'family motto' being the now famous ""Show Me The Money"", it is Tidwell who shows us that the pursuit of money is not a bad thing, just that it is not the most important thing, which is in essence the message of the whole movie. Further underlining this is the voice of Maguire's old mentor, Dickie Fox, played by an amazingly convincing Jared Jussim (who!?), a character who finally tells us that ""I don't have all the answers. In life, to be honest, I've failed as much as I've succeeded. But I love my wife. I love my life. I wish you my kind of success."" Testify brother Fox, testify.<br/><br/>So what Crowe has given us here is a romantic movie where love is indeed the most important thing, but not just love towards the object of your desire, but to everyone around you. It's about reaching out, realising how important other people are, and realising that if you do not love yourself then you really are never going to make it. Oh, and that you should love black people. Apparently."

""Let's get Cruise....oh, and sports are real popular now with the beer drinking public. Plenty of room for product placement if we can get it. Let's put Cruise and Sports in a movie together. Wait, Cruise doesn't play sports. Ok, let's make him an attorney people most like that cause there are lots of attorney shows on TV, no wait, a sports agent. He can yell into the phone he wants more money. Someone come up with a phrase. That's it, ""Show me the money"". Get someone from the writing pool to knock this thing out. Oh, and put in a little kid with glasses and a single woman he will be insincere with who he stays with out of loyalty cause it is too hard to write sincere romantic heartfelt relationships.""<br/><br/>It seems the writer of this film tries to convince people that simply yelling ""Show me the money"" into the phone is going to get you more money. Cruise plays a sports agent. While that might sound exciting to those 10 year olds that are into football, sports agents are about as exciting as overhearing an attorney talk on the phone about the fine points of a business contract. Since Cruise can't be the sports player in this film, they made him a sports agent. The role of the sports player goes to Cuba Gooding Jr who is directed to act like a buffoon of the likes of Martin Lawrence. This is a sad use of Gooding. He pulls this stupid stunt and for some reason the magic of the offers come in for him as a player. As any 10 year old knows, football is about playing the game and winning it. It is about gaining yards, making touch downs. That and that alone is why big money is paid to sports. Who knows what this movie started out to be and what it ended up being leaves you questioning what is actually happening in this movie.

Close up of profile of Cruise. Cruise on phone. Cruise on phone close up. Zoom in on Cruise eyeballs. mid shot of Cruise. Mid shot of Cruise being irresistible to women.

It's a walking self-advert designed to make him even more successful. You can see nothing but Cruise but what you can't see is any acting. There is a reason for this. He can't act. He's never been able to act. In one scene he is drunk but there's no difference to when he's sober. He's incapable of conveying even a simple human gesture without a range of exaggerated ticks and waves. Kubrick was a bright man. He must have realised Cruise couldn't act but he hired him. This collective madness extends to the audience who seem to love him. I don't get it. Show me the money. Cruise needs to be shown a space that doesn't have money piled up. His fee for Mission Impossible 2 film must be the most lucrative financial deal in film history. He can't act and they keep showing him the money. I don't understand. Help me to help you. Explain America to me. It does not compute. Tom,Tom,Tom, wherever you go. He just gets more successful no matter how bad he is. His ego is so huge that in one scene he keeps hitting an overhead light although he is reported to be a shorthouse. Eric Stolz is in this picture. He's the same age and he can act. Show him the money. Give him the lead. Jerry O'Connel of sliders fame is in this film. He can act. He doesn't twitch. He won't laugh in an outrageously bogus manner when sharing a cute scene with a kid. Show him the money. Or let him slide to an alternative earth where Cruise is a janitor. He'd stay, believe me. But they keep showing Cruise the money. And he's hopeless. What does that say about corporate America and the people who go and see movies? Is it all just about the fantasy of success?<br/><br/>Why do they let trains crash rather than install proper safety systems? Why do they let the plane go up when there have been warnings about engine problems? Why does Cruise keep getting roles when he can't act? Show me the words that mean nothing."

","Jerry is a sports agent and a very good sports agent at that. However when he suffers guilt at the nature of his business he proposed that his company take on fewer clients and put more personal care into them and prints up mission statements for all his colleagues. It isn't long before Bob Sugar is telling him that he is fired. Jerry decides to go it along but only manages to get two clients and one employee to come with him, but quickly even his small successes start turning into failure.<br/><br/>Famous for its success, its awards and its catchphrases, this film tends to be loved by a lot of people and hated by a lot of people as well. Now the truth is that it is more or less in the middle in terms of quality and it needs you to meet it on its turf because it won't be coming to meet you. I say this because the film rather coldly aims for its target audience and rarely misses a trick for squeezing out emotion from a moment. Few viewers seem to care that Jerry's epiphany doesn't really see him seeking happiness outside of the world of money but just seeking to chase it in a different way. Others ignore the fact that the central romance of the film seems to be built on slogans and weak spots and even more viewers accept the fact that the emotions and characters rarely run deeper than superficiality. Of course the only viewers that will really hate these things are the viewers that hate the film as a whole, because OK, it does all these things but it is ruthlessly effective in how it does them. You may not like the fact that it does it but you have to admit that it is very effective! It is hard to criticise it for what it does because it is so clear what it is aiming for and it really doesn't seem to be aspiring for much more than that. You can see this in the music, which is good but is used to maximum effect whenever it is needed (I love the Springsteen song but it is used with the subtlety of a sledgehammer) but nowhere moreso than the use of Lipnicki as the impossibly cute child who is never anything other than cute comments and toothy smiles. In fairness he goes as deep as Cruise himself does because he doesn't really go beyond the movie idol level. Sure he does some soul-searching of a sort but he rarely risks being anyone other than Tom Cruise. Zellweger is served up with a hard task and she can't manage it. She comes across as so weak and submissive that she makes their love even less convincing than the script already does. Gooding Jr is better than he has been since (although his career has sort of gone into freefall since this high) although his character is very much the sort of role he can easily play and not anything that deep or complex. Mohr, Hunt and King all fill in the edges.<br/><br/>Overall then a pretty manipulative and sentimental film that pushes all the buttons it can get in anyway it can. Some viewers will hate it for this while others (the majority it seems) will just accept it for what it is and embrace its easy emotion and cuddly billboard life messages and slogans. Very superficial and manipulative stuff then, but ruthlessly effective in its delivery."

","(Spoilers ahoy!) This movie spoke to me as someone entangled in a competitive and cold profession who through only partly his own will finds himself placed right in the face of becoming a human being.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. steals the show - wonderfully acted.  Zellweger too gave us an outstanding and compelling character.  Cruise too did well but I found one critical flaw.  After Jerry marries Dorothy, we immediately can tell the intimacy isn't there - this Cruise played so well I noticed it before it's really emphasized by the viewing of the wedding video.  But at the end, when he decides he does love Dorothy he doesn't make the switch to truly loving her.  There's just such a mismatch between Zelweger's convincing devotion and Cruise's almost forced plea for her.  In fact, looking back at his scenes with Preston (ex-fiancee) show more electricity.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this film has great, swift pacing.  Only thing I noticed: there's just too much music.  It almost becomes a cliche having the scene start with an apropos 70's tune commence shortly afterward.  Personally I like when the actors set the audience's reaction without the music - ala Kubrick.<br/><br/>Apart from these minor things, this is a must-see."

","If Jerry Maguire were made 30 years earlier I can see Jack Lemmon playing the title role. You wouldn't think of Tom Cruise being up for parts that Jack Lemmon would have been cast for, but he does an incredible job in the role of go-getter sports agent Maguire who decides to leave the high pressure agency that Jay Mohr runs and going out on his own.<br/><br/>Cruise has one of those chew the scenery moments when he leaves Mohr's office and secretary Renee Zellweger decides to leave with him. She's been crushing out on him for the longest time even though he's been seeing Kelly Preston. But patience can certainly be its own reward sometime.<br/><br/>If Jerry Maguire lacks something it would probably be Billy Wilder's surefire wit and sense of satire. Jerry Maguire would have been a great film for him to write and direct. Satire however might have crowded out romance in a Wilder film.<br/><br/>And it's romance that the movie going public likes with Tom Cruise. Some of his and Renee Zellweger's best scenes are with little Jonathan Lipnicki who is her son from a previous marriage. The kid is a scene stealer, mainly because he acts like a real kid, not some Hollywood creation.<br/><br/>Cruise has some tough sledding at first, one client he had counted on was college sensation Jerry O'Connell who is being inundated with draft offers and endorsements. O'Connell and his family, despite the whole honest country boy shtick, do disappoint him.<br/><br/>His one client who does stick with him is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell, a running back for the Phoenix Suns. Tidwell's one egotistical handful and Gooding won a deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar. However the reason he won it is that his portrayal of Tidwell is multidimensional. His scenes with wife Regina King and the rest of his family are far removed from the Muhammed Ali like face he shows the public.<br/><br/>Cruise also was nominated for Best Actor in the title role. But he lost to Geoffrey Rush for Shine. In fact Jerry Maguire lost for Best Picture to The English Patient. I was pulling for Tom that year myself.<br/><br/>Though I think a lot of Billy Wilder type satire was missed, Jerry Maguire is still a very well done film. Maybe it needed a Billy Wilder to direct it."

Then I borrowed it from the local library a few days ago, and today I saw it again... I'm still as baffled by its reputation as a good film as I was when I first saw it. It seems to be a chick flick, since just about all of the elements are there... but maybe it is just a generic bad movie that has gotten popular because of the star power or whatever. I mean, everything in the movie... the obnoxious little kid, the weak attempts at comedy mostly consisting of old stereotypes, the unbelievably poorly implemented and uneven love-story... no. Just no. I can only guess that the popularity of this film lies in a strong audience of people who are either easily impressed or girls who are into chick flicks. Possibly both. The plot is OK, but the pacing is awful. It moves unforgivable slowly and seems twice as long as it is... at least. The acting is flat or overplayed... everyone seems either terribly uninterested in the material or to not be sure how to perform, and therefore overdo it. I can't believe that this was actually done by Cameron Crowe... come on, he made Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky, two movies that are great at best and impressive at the least. How could he screw this up? I recommend this film only to the biggest fans of the people involved in the making of it, and possibly fans of chick flicks. Everyone else; don't listen to the hype.

The film is clever and touching as well as being made in a highly sophisticated style which after being broken up reveals much more than a simple love story.  The emotions shown are depicted with accuracy and confidence to such an extent that at points you actually forget you are watching a film and you become part of the universe which Cameron Crowe has skilfully created.

","Jerry Maguire was released a good few years ago and, despite knowing a few of the quotes from the film, I had never seen it. I knew it was Tom Cruise as the sport's agent Jerry Maguire, but never really knew the ins and outs of it. I was quite surprised to find out it has a good hint of comedy in it, and isn't as sporty as I thought it was. I was shocked when I sat down to watch this.<br/><br/>The film begins showing Maguire as a hot shot agent, who represents many top sport stars across the country. One night however he has an epiphany and writes a 'mission statement' about how his agency should worry about the cliental instead of the money. He posts this 25 page mission statement in everybody at the company's pigeon hole and is greeted at work the next day with a huge round of applause. The big bosses of the company though don't agree with his document and instantly fire him, to be fair why would a company earning millions want to stop earning millions? <br/><br/>After being fired he heads off to set up his own business, but first tries to persuade his current sport stars to come with him. They all choose to stay with their current representation, apart from one who is willing to still use Mr Maguire as his agent, Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr). Maguire's company consists of himself and, an assistant who followed him from his former job, Dorothy (Zellweger). The company gets off to a bad start when the biggest football star in the country drops him and goes with Maguire's former company, leaving Maguire to put all his worth into Tidwell, who is an egotistical footballer with a severe attitude problem. <br/><br/>As the film goes on Maguire and Dorothy begin to fall for one another, and Tidwell becomes more of a friend than a client. Maguire and Tidwell, who both have different views on life, manage to teach each other subconsciously how to be the men that will make their career flourish. It isn't really a film about sport, it is more about the relationship people have, and especially since it is stated, Maguire struggling to be alone but lacking intimacy with anyone he is close to. The themes are deep, much deeper than a typical sports movie.<br/><br/>The script for the film is very good. The characters are so well drawn, and each one manages to bring something to the forefront, all to aid in Jerry Maguire's development as a person. The character of Tidwell is a great character and he is so pivotal for the outcome of this movie. The characters are also aided by some great acting. Cruise is very good in his role here, and is utterly believable as Maguire. He has the look and the mannerisms of an arrogant sports agent. Tom Hanks was originally slated for the role, but Cruise is definitely the right choice for it. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as Tidwell. He is over the top, brash and smitten with his wife. Gooding Jr. brings this character to life so well and thoroughly deserved his Oscar for Supporting Actor that year. Zellweger is also on top form as Dorothy. Her scenes with Cruise are full of emotion, and their chemistry is full of romance, despite one very uncomfortable scene where he kisses her all over on the doorstep. She is clearly in love with Maguire, and Zellweger shows this very well.<br/><br/>The film does have a good script and a strong cast but it isn't the best movie out there. The best this movie could possibly be is average. It is an easy watch but the middle sector especially is a little dull. The opening of the film, where we see Maguire have a slight breakdown, is good but it begins to run out of puff towards the end. It is a fairly long film and probably doesn't need to be. The end has a strange climax, and I wander why Tidwell manages to become a bigger star due to him having an injury on the pitch. It was something I just didn't understand. At the end they also announce Tidwell's new contract on the air of a television show, would they do that? Why would people want to hear about it? If anything I would say that would put fans off of him. Here it was pushing the audience to love the football star but why would you be happy for him securing a huge contract. <br/><br/>Small issues with this film really bring it down. It isn't a bad film but it also isn't great. The script and the acting are good but there are points that really bring the film down. It is an average film at best, made better by the talent on show. It does have some brilliantly quotable lines, and if you haven't seen this than you will notice which ones I am on about when you watch it. Despite being average I would suggest you watch it, mainly because it is an easy watch and one you won't particularly be disappointed with.<br/><br/>3 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Jerry Maguire may be rather overlong and a little pedestrian in places, but overall it is a very interesting and somewhat unusual film. The concept really intrigued me and one of the main reasons why I saw Jerry Maguire in the first place, and this concept worked really well thanks to the well written story and the witty and poignant script. Jerry Maguire is also beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is warm and infectious. Cameron Crowe's direction is very good, as are the relationships between the characters. Jerry Maguire also benefits from some superb performances. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances here, and he is perfectly matched by Renee Zellwegger at her most beautiful and the adorable Jonathan Lipnicki. Though the real star is Cuba Gooding Jnr who is absolutely marvellous as Jerry's sole remaining client. To conclude, a very good film, well worth watching for the performances and concept alone. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","Well I certainly don't need to recap the plot of the film, that has been taken care of by many others. My input for what it was worth really is to do with the casting of Jonathan Lipniki. Simply put, I thought he was outstanding. He really added some beautiful moments to the film and I only wish they could have cast him more. Sadly due to his very tender age and stamina levels at the time, they had to keep his cameo's short and to when he was at his best. But it was a lovely film all round, I loved how the characters evolved but for me it was held together by Ray. I can watch his parts over and over. From what I've seen since, Jonathan adored Tom Cruise and I think that is clear to see in the chemistry on screen."
"Spleen","4","12","32","14 December 1999"," Down with chick flicks
","I thought this was supposed to be about a sports agent.  What's Renée Zellweger doing there?  What's that unendurable kid doing there?  I can just HEAR the cynical clanking of gears in the writer's mind.  `Okay - so the average member of the audience will simply fall asleep when we show it the story of an ethical quest.  Look how Quiz Show' fared.  So we'll write this quote, love story, unquote, one that has NOTHING WHATEVER to do with the basic plot, and we'll make the hero go through both the love story and the real story simultaneously.'<br/><br/>Only it's worse than that.  Jerry Maguire undergoes his change of heart too early in the film - all we find out about him beforehand is that he's the kind of person with a conscience on the point of rebellion, and then - surprise! - his conscience rebels.  We don't see how he became corrupted in the first place or how he escaped corruption in the end.  Well, maybe we'll see some more of this corruption-in-the-sports-agency theme later.<br/><br/>`Well sorry,' says the writer, `screen time is limited, maybe I can spare half an hour from my contrived and sappy romance, but I tell you what: I'll let you watch Cuba Gooding, Jr. bellowing at people in a zany fashion. That's vaguely to do with sport, isn't it?  After all, he's a -' (consults notes) `- football player.'<br/><br/>Finally - SPOILER AHEAD - I have one more question for the writer.  I don't know much about American football (apart from the fact that it's STUPID), but when Jerry urges Rod to play in such away that he swings through the air and lands smack on his bare skull ... how is that any different from what he does to the bedridden footballer, at the start of the movie?  I mean, he makes the bedridden footballer risk concussion in the pursuit of money, and Rod risk concussion for the love of the game, but in either case the result is concussion.  And what is Rod's reward?  He gets to make a zany-antics ad for one of those reptilian sports shoe companies, in exchange for a fat cheque.  Nope - no naked greed there."

","I still remember the fuss ""Jerry Maguire"" made when it came out back in '96 and I still remember the first time I saw it and wondered what the big deal was.<br/><br/>I respect Cameron Crowe and I think he has good intentions. ""Almost Famous"" is a really, really good chronicle of its era. It had interesting characters who I felt for.<br/><br/>""Jerry Maguire"" is cold, distant, and frankly, rather boring. Clocking in way past its limit, it's basically about a loser sports agent Maguire (Tom Cruise) who suddenly finds all his friends and co-workers and even family turning against him as he nears middle-age.<br/><br/>The moral is effective - don't let your life be ruled by materialism -- but it's hardly a subtle one. Even Rene Zellweger's character is a huge cliché, being the female love interest who is pure, good-natured, sweet, and represents everything Jerry doesn't have in his life. (His current fiancée in the film is portrayed as a materialistic fraud.) The whole yuppie culture thing is kind of over and ""Jerry Maguire"" would have worked a lot better during the '80s, a decade Crowe seems more comfortable with (he penned ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" after hanging out at a real high school).<br/><br/>There's something about this film I've just never been able to warm up to."

With the brilliant performance of Cuba Gooding which casts an enormous shadow on the either flat or exaggerated interpretation of Tom, the nice interpretation of Renee Zellweger, and the kid even. I mean Tom Cruise should stick to the big productions, one man show, he likes so much, because without a point of reference nearby, it's easier not to be put in a bad light, as in this one.

I had no connection at all with any of the main characters or their situations, I mean I could care less about the contractual expectations of US sports stars and as for the somewhat forced romance of Tom Cruise's maverick sports agent and his acolyte Renee Zelwegger and her, shall I say, ""professorial"" five year old kid, (I'm being kind, I almost thought a grown-up actor was playing the role, so un-child-like was the boy's performance, never mind the dialogue he's given to speak).<br/><br/>And no, I didn't like Cuba Gooding's over-the-top performance as Cruise's only remaining client after he alienates his former employer and co-workers with a mass-circulated touchy-feely ""mission statement"" to cleanse his conscience and soul. Talking loud and saying nothing, as James Brown once said. There were a few good lines and situations but these were hopelessly outnumbered by many more which were poorly conceived and executed and while I understand ex-Rolling Stone magazine writer Cameron Crowe filling up the soundtrack with 60's and 70's tracks by the Who, Stones and McCartney, none of the songs has any relevance to anything in the film.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was universally flashy and shouty, with no exceptions and you can see each of the leads acting if you watch closely enough. For a far more incisive and entertaining exposé of the soft white underbelly of sports and at a deeper level, morality at large, I'd suggest viewers look at Billy Wilder's ""The Fortune Cookie"" instead."

","Tom Cruise had a good year in 1996 showing everyone the money by starring in two of the top four grossing films of the year (""Jerry Maguire"", $153M; and ""Mission: Impossible"", $180M).  Of the two, ""Jerry Maguire"" was clearly the better film, garnering five Oscar nominations and winning a best supporting Oscar for Cuba Gooding, Jr.<br/><br/>It is the story of a sports agent who falls from grace with his agency because he develops scruples and has the bad judgment to share his newfound principles with his firm.  This results in instant unemployment and the necessity to start his own agency.  Upon striking out with his trusty new assistant Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), he finds to his chagrin that the only client that stays with him is a loudmouth of a football player named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) whose psyche is in a state of delicate imbalance.  As time goes on and his depression and debt get deeper, Jerry's only hope is that Rod can play football as well as he can talk trash.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Cameron Crowe is excellent at writing amusing human-interest stories with offbeat themes (See Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  The combination of the high-pressure world of sports representation, a whacked-out client and a charming love affair makes for an engaging tale with something for just about everyone.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise shines as Jerry Maguire.  He gives that character a false bravado that belies his desperate lack of confidence.  Yet, despite his feelings of hopelessness he never gives up, not on Rod, Dorothy or himself.  This film put Renee Zellweger on the map as Dorothy, Jerry's idealistic and loyal secretary and love interest.  She was enchanting and resolute as she stood by her man no matter what the costs.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was fantastic and stole the show repeatedly with his over the top performance.<br/><br/>This is a fast paced and highly entertaining film.  I rated it a 9/10.

He is practically everything that he has ever been asked to do as an actor, minus the running and action stuff (oh, no, wait, he does run a little bit in the climax, how about that) and it's one of his major performances (to the point where I wondered a few times if this could be an unintentional sequel to Risky Business). He, and not Cuba Gooding Jr (who is fine but given a largely two dimensional character, a type to be sure), deserved the hell out of that Oscar. This is his movie, and he rules at every moment.<br/><br/>The movie around him is fun and entertaining, and it's Cameron Crowe also at his most...Crowe-ish (for better or worse, mostly better, from his can't-help-himself wit to the musical choices, from the Who to Miles Davis), though not as deep as it might think it is early on. It also has a wonderful turn from Renee Zellwegger, a sleazy turn by Jay Mohr, and Jerry O'Connell for a few key scenes in one of his best turns (hey, no small roles, right?) The key thing for me about all this: Jerry Maguire was one of my cinematic blind spots until... Well, now.<br/><br/>I knew all of the major cultural references (it's just how it is, whether it's seeing a parody long before the actual source, to a Patton Oswalt bit about seeing it on Christmas), and seen a few scenes here and there, but I'd never seen it start to finish. What I come away with is... It works. Mostly. Largely on movie star charm and some snappy Crowe dialog that only occasionally is too, uh, cocky for its own good.<br/><br/>It also is a much more compelling story when it's focused on the sports world, and the first part seems to be indicating it'll be largely about that. And then roughly halfway through, when the thrust of the story should be about how Jerry picks up the pieces and gets back on track, Crowe remembers he wants to kick in his romantic comedy/drama plot and it takes over. Arguably, a bit too much and yet, there are some really touching scenes late in the film between Cruise and Zellweger, like it almost makes up for a sluggish middle.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire, not without flaws, is what used to be a quality example of a popular and massive Hollywood hit in the mid 1990s. I wonder now if it would go straight to Netflix or not, with a different star. Is it still an iconic Hollywood piece of the 90s? I dunno. But I did laugh. And I could see how Crowe could go down the path he has for the last 15 years."

","1996 seemed like a weird year at the movies.<br/><br/>People could finally laugh at horror movies with SCREAM, American culture's obsession with the end of the world led to INDEPENDENCE DAY and TWISTER's box office success, both FARGO and TRAINSPOTTING caught audiences and critics by surprise, and the whole sector of cinephiles stood together in disgust that a movie like THE ENGLISH PATIENT could win Best Picture.<br/><br/>I'm not a sociologist so I'm not sure how that amounts to when defining the cultural zeitgeist of the late 90s. However I will say that if there's any movie that, to me, properly distills what life felt like back then, I'd say it's either JERRY MAGUIRE or FARGO. Since I already saw FARGO, this Scavenger Hunt is dedicated to this instead.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe missteps quite a lot since his heyday as director, but boy did he had a voice. The sensitive, emotionally broken vision he conjures transcends this otherwise melodramatic story into something we can all relate to. Beneath our grin and multi-million dollar facade, we are all still people with emotions and needs. The center of all this is the Space Pope himself Tom Cruise, reverting his TOP GUN swagger into a performance packed with charm and pathos.<br/><br/>Whereas FARGO captured the cynical extremes of human choices and how it affects all of us, JERRY MAGUIRE encapsulates a time where we get so fixated on fame and success to mend our lonely lives. And Cameron Crowe reassures us that sometimes, expressing your emotions won't cause the end of the world. Maybe it's okay to settle down and warm up to people once in a while. Even if you're on the hurdle towards your lowest point, all you can depend on is that one person who really cares about you for you.<br/><br/>It cannot possibly compare to the extended cut to ALMOST FAMOUS - because almost nothing can - but I was shocked that this still hits in the feels."

","Unlike many films in which the central character has a career changing epiphany near the end of the story, this one occurs right at the start. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a highly successful sports agent who ultimately comes to grips with the empty life style and endless quest for money that takes over one's life when they find themselves at the top of their profession. The movie handles Maguire's transition with considerable skill without overlooking the doubts and fears one would expect when making a life altering decision. For those who had faith in Jerry all along, Cuba Gooding Jr's Tidwell learns a lesson in humility when taken to task for playing with his head and not his heart, while Renee Zellweger's own heart wears consistently on her sleeve for Jerry's time and attention. Their eventual marriage is tested when it becomes a question of love versus loyalty, but once again, Jerry Maguire returns to a principled conclusion that his new family is worth more than all the mega-bucks available in the fast paced world of celebrity sports and multi-million dollar endorsements. Here's a movie with a different kind of 'show me the money' message and well worth your time."

","I have seen this movie two times. I liked it both times. The Story with Cruise as a unsuccessful sports agent suits him well. In this role it's possible for him to open himself and can do his best acting. I also like Renee Zellweger as the woman who always believes in Jerry Maguire and the harmony between this two actors is very fine. But of course it's significant to mention the oscar winning performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. Whenever this actor is on the screen in this movie he shows us that he enjoys the work like nobody else. In my opinion they could have short the movie 10 - 20 minutes, so the movie has his lenghts sometimes but all in all it's a movie that's worth to be seen.

","Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Jerry McGuire (1996)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: When sports agent Jerry Maguire (Cruise) has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and a former co worker.<br/><br/>In a time when I'm becoming less and less interested in new movies, Jerry Maguire reminds me why I love movies. Cameron Crowe has wrote and directed a really good movie. A movie that is all about its characters, and whose main character spends much of the time desperate and out of luck. Movies like that can be depressing and a tough watch, but Jerry Maguire isn't. <br/><br/>It is not without its problems!! It's a tad too long, has too many subplots, we get your standard sports movie cliché scene, and the kid is a little too movie cute too. <br/><br/>Cruise (who won the golden globe) holds the full thing together he is literally in every scene. You need to root for the hero in the movie, and you do root for Cruise, who spends more time on the ropes here, than in any other movie.<br/><br/>I find Cuba Gooding Jr really annoying here!! He is just so loud!! All he seems to do is yell!! I could not spend more than 5 minutes in a room with his character!! I'm amazed he won the Oscar. Something Crowe is good at, is giving characters with a small amount of screen time, personalities that made them stand out! Regina King is really good at standing out in her small role. Kelly Preston, so adorable in Twins, is so unappealing here and Jay Mohr is perfectly sleazy as a rival sports agent.<br/><br/>Jerry McGuire was nominated for 5 Oscars and grossed $153 million at the domestic box office to end the year, the 4th highest grossing movie of 1996. <br/><br/>This was Tom Cruise's fifth consecutive 100-million-dollar-plus film, a new record at the time."
"davispittman","8","2","3","17 March 2017"," Very well acted film!
","Perhaps one of the most quoted movies is Jerry Maguire (1996). So is it really worth all the hype? I think so! Tom cruise and Renee Zellweger give masterful performances in this sports agent drama. Tom of course is always great, he's one of my very favorites, but if I'm being honest, Zellweger shines the most of all here. ""You had me at hello"". That probably is the most popular quote of the whole film, and it's deserving of that title. That is just good heartfelt writing, some may think it's cheesy or overly cliché, but I just think it's her character being honest about her true love for cruise's character. Cuba Gooding Jr. is the actor who won the academy award for his supporting performance, and yes it's true, he is very good here, I'm not totally certain it was worth an Oscar, but it's still good work. The script is pretty well written, it's all centered about tom cruise and his revelation as a person, and the romance between Zellweger and him is all apart of his big change in himself. The chemistry between all the actors on screen is good and believable, cruise and Zellweger having the best and most real seeming. I suggest this movie for both men and women, young and old, you certainly do not have to enjoy sports to enjoy this. Hell I'm living proof of that. 8/10 for Jerry Maguire."

","Cameron Crowe is probably one of the most talented writers in the movie business. He wrote the Fast Times at Ridgemont High movie back in the 80's, which is still one of the best Comedic somewhat Dramatic Romance movies of all time. This, however, is another well done creation from Mr. Crowe.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as Jerry Maguire, a sports agent. All of a sudden his perfect life completely comes tumbling down. Throughout the movie Maguire embarks a love interest with one of his new clients, played by Renee Zellwegger. Then along the way he also manages to continue managing his prospect, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to the top.<br/><br/>So really just check this one out if your looking for a Dramatic Romance story with some slight comedic material.

","This movie was billed to be about the sports-agent scene.  A good idea for a film.  Instead, I saw a flat, predictable, highly choreographed and seemingly endless film.  I thought the whole premise of a guy writing the ""Sports Agents Manifesto"" at the beginning was a joke.  No wonder he got fired.  As far as a Hollywood love story goes, it was passable.  Nothing too new however.  Basically, (if you could not already tell) the movie simply did not make me care about the characters.

Touching to the level that the relationship gets to you, the relationship of an agent and his client and inspiring in a way that we should never stop believing in ourselves and should never stop bettering ourselves.<br/><br/>Change your life, write your own ""mission statement"". It was a different feeling seeing Cuba and Tom having tears in their eyes, specially Tom. For the first time I really saw an emotional performance from Cruise without his sometimes over the top charm.

","Two good leads, Cuba Gooding Jr. yelling, and a freaking adorable little kid make this a super fun feel-good movie that is worth your time.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is great as usual, and turns his charm up to 11, Renee Zellweger is good, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is great. This is a pretty excellent cast, and the movie basically coasts on the charm of its actors.<br/><br/>I can appreciate the premise and the movie's message; personal connections, but I don't think it ever really embraced what it had to say. Jerry has this epiphany early in the film and changes his life, but it never seemed like he really did what he was promoting, which is value people, though I guess he did with Cuba. The romance with Zellweger is cute and charming, sure, but I'd you think about it, he was terrible to her and didn't respect her at all really.<br/><br/>Also, yes the living room scene near the end was moving and great, but think about what changed between Cruise and Zellweger towards the end. Literally nothing. Cruise just had a great night, and channeled his circumstantial happiness into a failing relationship to somehow save it.<br/><br/>So yes the movie is certainly well-done and charming and hilarious and very quotable, but it's not my favorite romantic dramedy and it's message seemed muddled. It is a classic though, so it's worth at least one watch, especially for Cruise or Gooding Jr. fans."

","Jerry Maguire is more of a love story than a sports story but that's exactly what the doctor ordered. I was expecting something different but instead I decided fall by the wayside and decided to let Jerry help me help you help you help me. Tom cruise stands up for what he believes in by writing the manifesto ""what everyone is thinking but no one says."" He reaps the consequences of this move by getting fired but has the fortitude to never give up. He loses his marquee client and still never gives up. Jerry lives life on his own terms and would rather die than become a victim to his ideals. Jerry's story is a story of hope, determination, and pride. Jerry always sticks to his guns and gets rewarded for his behavior. We can all learn a lot from his determination, resilience and his desire to help others."

","""Jerry Maguire"" I watched in 2020 for the first time, and I was absolutely captivated by the insanely quality acting by part of Tom Cruise and the many supporting roles in this film; the beautiful/funny/iconic cinematography; the witty/perfectly timed dialogue (I loved the au pair); and the internal/interpersonal conflict that drives forward oh-so-well the plot in a way that never bores. Did I mention the incredible acting? You don't find quality of acting with a similar depth of expression these days. The development of Jerry's relationship with his client over the film, as well as the fantastically dynamic change of pace in Jerry's character (excited, fast, over-the-top to mellow, sensual, and thoughtful) aged like fine wine over those 2 hours. The way in which they finally achieve their goal is unique, hilarious, and tearjerking too. This film made me feel a LOT of things, and I was hooked from the beginning and now attached to it for good, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Sure, this film has its downsides too (it is Hollywood, after all).
-Renee Zellweger's character predominantly plays the role of the typical, head-over-heels woman who falls for the guy literally every single time he makes even a half-assed attempt to win her back. Clearly she gets what she wants, but not having learned a damn thing about herself even by the end of the film (not a good female role model - that's Hollywood for ya). Not blaming Renee - she was fantastic - but the ones who created the persona of her character fatally missed the vital interesting ingredient: true female empowerment.
-I felt like the blah, typical happily-ever-after dramatic scene in the living room truly took away from the brilliance of this film, which succeeded in making this story come to life from so many different facets.
-Tom Cruise is so attractive that it is mortifyingly distracting (maybe not the worst negative to a film, but worth mentioning nonetheless).<br/><br/>All in all, although I gripe with the lack of substance behind Renee's character, I can't help but preach that this film is brilliant and one that truly had me at hello."

","I finally watched this movie because people talk about this particular line ""You had me at hello."" It all started from this one quote. First, the screenwriter must have done a good job because he or she left this remarkable and timeless one line. The rest of the story line may seem simple and bland, but the writer manages to absorb the audience till the end without uproar.
Second, many characters possess charm. Jerry, an ambitious sports manager, come to realize the importance of love and the way to express it. We all love this kind of story, right? Dorothy, a pure-at-heart but strong single mom and Ray (Gosh, he is so adorable in this movie.) who is the prototype of cuteness make this move upbeat and warm at the same time.
There are some drawbacks as well.
First, the narrative is too simple. Even though it doesn't feel too simple with charms of characters and good lines, how Jerry come to realization is a little bit abrupt.
Second, Tom Cruise's acting is too much. When I see him act, I can tell him he's acting. A whole facial expression, tone, and how he says the line overall say ""Here I go, I am acting right now. See! I'm serious.""It may be personal opinion because I think great acting makes me see the character not the actor."

Only one athlete stays with him and his former secretary.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie very much because it had a very good plot and a well-written script. In addition to this, there is a nice direction with some plot twists that I didn't predict so, that made this movie even more interesting. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I believe that Tom Cruise who played as Jerry Maguire made for one more time an exceptional interpretation and I also believe that Cuba Gooding Jr. who played as Rod Tidwell made his best interpretation so far (Academy Awards, 1997 Oscar Winner - Best Actor in a Supporting Role). Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was Renée Zellweger's who played as Dorothy Boyd and she was very good at it. The direction which was made by Cameron Crowe was very interesting and I enjoyed the way he presented the many changes in the life of Jerry Maguire and how he had to fight in order to get back on track and also how this influenced his personal life and the people loved and cared him the most (great character evolution).<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""Jerry Maguire"" is a nice movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to have a lot of fun. The contrast of this movie between drama and comedy scenes is very well placed and makes this movie very interesting."

","Jerry Maguire is a feel good romantic drama which surfed a zeitgeist wave in the mid 1990s and coined catchphrases such as 'Show me the money' 'You had me at hello' and 'You complete me.'<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays the successful sports agent Jerry Maguire who upsets his bosses with a mission statement such as having less clients in order to serve them better. His rival at the firm has to fire him and then compete for all his clients.<br/><br/>Maguire is only left with one client, a mouthy, flamboyant football player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding jr) who is upset that he is not getting the top endorsement deals. Maguire also is also chasing a hot shot player for the draft and thinks he has bagged him only to be snatched away by his rival.<br/><br/>Maguire starts out at the bottom with Tidwell and Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) a single mother and one of the assistants from the sports agency who has followed him. Dorothy and Jerry fall in love but we are not sure if he genuinely confused her loyalty with love.<br/><br/>Maguire needs to persuade Tidwell to play football with his heart and not think about endorsements or why other players are earning more. Tidwell shows loyalty and friendship to Maguire but in the football field he comes across as shallow and selfish. A reason why Maguire is struggling to get a lucrative contract deal for him.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is actually a corny film, Cuba Gooding jr provides the laughs but the romance angle is very cheesy.<br/><br/>At the end Maguire is successful because of the one to one relationship he has with his only client which other sports player are envious of.<br/><br/>I saw this film again after 20 years because part of the scenes were featured in The Lego Batman Movie, the implication being some of the lines are hackneyed."
"sharky_55","7","1","1","17 February 2017"," Show me the money!
","Jerry Maguire is what happens after the kid in Risky Business grows up. The beginnings have the same glimpses of sharp wit, comic satire and endless ambition that gave the latter its humorous bite. Tom Cruise is the fast-talking hotshot, a one man Wallstreet of sports representation with a vice-grip over his domain: he scouts young stars early, adds them to his collection, and rakes in the cash when they hit the big time. His job is to know everything about these clients - their ambitions, their strengths, their prickly personalities - but at the same time his voice-over treats them like impersonal investments, with the highly-touted number one pick in the next draft as the biggest catch of them all. Only when his conscience hits a brick wall does he come to re-evaluate how he wants the world to see him, and how brutal this cut-throat business really is. <br/><br/>So Jerry Maguire is really a romance, but not between Jerry and his designated love interest (the 'nerdy' girl who has always been shyly hiding behind her desk while he dates supermodels), but between him and his last client. Yes, these two men put on emotional facades of stoic, unmovable strength and attitude, but all they really need is a hug. That final sequence, where Rod parts the sea of cameras and reporters to intimately embrace Jerry, who's been hovering around nervously in the background? That's from Manhattan, from Notting Hill, from every single romantic comedy that ends with the guy/girl running after the guy/girl and sealing the deal with a dramatic declaration of love. How sweet. <br/><br/>Cameron Crowe has never bettered his debut, Say Anything, which had more nuance and understanding than most films in the genre. In Jerry Maguire, the annoying add-ons come in the form of Dorothy Boyd, the woman destined to bring Jerry to his heels, to humble him, and to finally complete his redemption from selfish egomaniac. As if Crowe is afraid that audiences might not get what he is trying to say, Dorothy is also a poor, single, struggling mom - in fact one of the first signs of Jerry's renewal is his growing potential as a father to Raymond. Ray is not just cute, he's cuteness overload, with oversized glasses and a head of messy blonde hair. He's not playing a little boy but a cuddly teddy bear designed to assault our sympathies, to coax Jerry into the suburban dream. What kind of monster would deny Jonathan Lipnicki?<br/><br/>Opposing Zellweger's damsel in distress is Avery, the poster-girl for the vanity of the high life. Both are just as shallow in personality, but Preston goes into comic overboard and finds hilarity in her best impression of a success barnacle. Watch how the break-up scene unfurls: it's a high speed walk and talk, her furiously setting up tables for work, and him tentatively trying to slide the bad news underneath. When it's revealed that he's the one doing the dumping, Preston attacks it like a challenge; success is not just a goal but a state of mind, and she's never faced an obstacle she can't climb. When Jerry shows signs of giving up and displaying a defeatist attitude, she takes him down right there and then. Later as they cross paths her finger and thumb are in the shape of a big L for LOSER. The people in this business rarely come out and show their intentions like this - she's just being upfront about it, like a peacock strutting its plumage. Preston brings some much needed levity when the film gets a little tired and bogged down in cliché. It's satire, but only just. <br/><br/>And then there is Regina King as Marcee Tidwell, who is much more than just a negotiator on behalf of Rod. She is his wife, and of course wants a big, fat contract for her husband, but watch how King acts as a foil for Jerry. He's infuriated by the tiny contract offers for his client, exasperated that all his dealing and hand-shaking and smiling has been for naught (his monetary gain diminishes too). But she feels the disrespect for her Rod, and how the teams have denied his talent. In the heart-stopping climax, Rod lays unconscious and every character's real feelings and motivations emerge. If the whole thing is overly cheesy and melodramatic, Marcee reigns it back with perspective. Her moment is personal, and all the dollar signs have vanished. The plea in her eyes is a million times more meaningful than any ""You had me at hello""."

","This film spoke to me in so many ways. It was almost as if ""Jerry Maguire"" had been written with me in mind. From Jerry's epiphany at the start of the story through his struggle and eventual triumph over his fear of intimacy, it all seemed to be drawn from my experiences. These are the things that concern me every day. Tom Cruise was amazing. He showed perfect acting the whole time. It is perhaps, the finest work so far in his career. You could see every flicker of doubt and insincerity cross his face. I was laughing out loud, then crying and then so tightly happy that I forgot to breath. All of the other cast members seemed perfect as well. I particularly liked the doubting, divorced but totally caring sister Laurel. And let's not forget Dorothy's son Ray, what a little charmer.<br/><br/>The person that stole the show for me was Cuba Gooding Jr. Every scene he was in made me laugh. This was the first movie I had seen him in and thought he was a terrific actor, deserved of the Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor. The ""Show Me The Money"" scene will have you in stitches. His character changes the life of Jerry Maguire in the film and does it with such of enthusiasm that you can just admire Rod Tidwells life, where every piece is in the right order. The beautiful cinematography, editing and music makes the strong story and characters to look good.

","In a career full of high profile movies, ""Jerry Maguire"" represents perhaps Tom Cruise's single best performance. Playing a sports agent fired from his job after having a moral epiphany, Cruise's effortless charm fits the role perfectly. His character's slick exterior comes naturally but what's surprising is the depth of emotion that's exposed over the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe's Oscar-nominated script is integral to the success of the film. With the premise established, the plot follows Jerry as he desperately holds on to his last remaining client (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and the one co-worker who stood by him (Renée Zellweger). Part love story, part comedy and part sports drama, the movie should not be dismissed out of hand as a typical shallow rom-com.<br/><br/>As already noted, Tom Cruise is the movie's anchor. His Oscar nomination was well deserved but he didn't have to carry the movie by himself. Cuba Gooding Jr. made the most of his character and found his career-best performance rewarded with an Oscar. Renée Zellweger excelled in her role as well, which turned out to be her breakout performance. Of the many notable supporting players, the most memorable are probably Regina King, Jay Mohr and young Jonathan Lipnicki.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is exceptional. Cameron Crowe's deft direction and the vibrant cinematography of two time Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski combine to create a consistently attractive viewing experience. The well-chosen soundtrack also deserves praise, with several memorable selections, including the Bruce Springsteen hit ""Secret Garden"".<br/><br/>All in all, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a movie that holds up surprisingly well and represents some of the best work from those involved. Not just a typical Tom Cruise vehicle, the movie captures something special with memorable moments like the classic ""Show me the money!"" scene."

","'Jerry Maguire' is a multi-genre film focussing primarily on the lives of a sports agent, an NFL playing, Oscar-winning Cuba Gooding Jr. and single mum Renee Zellweger. There is a certain feel-good factor to this film, as there are with most Cameron Crowe films which makes it very hard to dislike. The other great thing about Crowe's films is that everything is real from the characters to their emotions to the whole story. The casting of Tom Cruise is near-perfect as I could not imagine anyone to better portray an ambitious and willing sports agent. Asides the good movie and acting, this is surely one of the most quotable films to date with ""You had me at 'hello'"", ""Show me the money!!"" and ""You complete me"".

","Show me the money. You complete me. You had me at hello. Jerry Maguire is Cameron Crowe's bread and butter. Without it, there would be no ""Almost Famous"". It's one of the most quoted movies of an entire generation. Perhaps that's what lessens the experience in retrospect. Oh yes, I liked this movie. I liked it a whole lot in a few sections. The beginning monologue and montage is absolutely golden. An exuberant, excellent hook that highlights the best of Crowe's ability, and why I admire him so much as a director. On that alone, the movie rockets itself into watchability, and seizes our attention for the 2 hours and 10 minutes it lasts. Rene Zellweger is really good here, as well as the ever adorable, Jonathan Lipnicki. Can we get a child star Oscar going? As if it wasn't enough, is ""Boyhood"" a better incentive to start? Cuba Gooding Jr., who won the Oscar for his performance, nails it. He's the smartest and funniest person in the entire film. He had Jerry in the palm of his hand the whole time, and he picked his brain like no other. SHOW ME THE MONEY, JERRY! The performances rule. What's the biggest flaw? Well, the screenplay. I know, 20 years down the line, any movie is going to become cliché, but for some reason, this movie has spectacularly clichéd moments. The closing speech that Jerry gives is one that really highlights it. So, freaking, corny. Cameron Crowe is a great writer (a genius actually), and this movie has many memorable scenes of dialog, but he's always had trouble with writing touching speeches.. something he's been struggling with pretty severely as of late... (cough) ""Aloha"" (cough). This is a fine piece of work, and worth seeing, but bring a toothbrush.. that's all I have to say."

","This movie completes me. I was actually surprised my kids sat through this with me. Usually, they resent the idea of me pulling a old movie out of my ass and forcing them to watch it.

""Luke, I am your father"" Many moments to remember. The Lipinski kid was a cute little bugger as well. Thanks to him I know a human head weighs 8 pounds. I would have thought it was no more than 6 pounds. This movie also shows us what Renee Zellweger looked like before she was abducted by aliens and replaced with a not so exact copy."

Now having watched it, I know what I've been missing out on! This is a great film about someone realising that they are a good person who is not doing the best for the people that need him to be. Jerry Maguire strives to do what's right for his clients and through basically the collapse of his life looks back to the life lessons that his original mentor taught him and realises that he has lost his way.

","Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a top sports agent. Only lately, he's noticing something morally wrong in his world. In the dead of night, he types up his 'mission statement' punctuated by 'Fewer clients. Less money.' He distributes it to his officemates, and it eventually blows up in his face.

Only it's more a rom-com between Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. than Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger."
"hall895","7","1","1","24 October 2013"," There's more to life than money
","You wouldn't think a sports agent would be a good choice to be the central character in any kind of romantic film. It is a profession with a reputation for sleaze and slime. But Jerry Maguire is not your typical sports agent. Well, he is at the start of the film. But then he has an ethical epiphany. Unfortunately this epiphany gets him fired from his high-powered agency. Jerry is left with just one client, Rod Tidwell. Rod, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is brash, bold, bombastic and exceedingly self-confident. And with regard to Jerry he is interested in only one thing: ""Show me the money!"" When Jerry is cast out on his own with his one client he also has only one employee for his new start-up agency. That is Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who apparently was the only person at Jerry's old agency who shared his ideals. Or who was willing to admit she shared them anyway. She leaves her secure job to take a chance on Jerry and it becomes clear pretty quickly that she may have made a big mistake. But as Jerry flounders professionally he and Dorothy grow closer. They come to count on one another. They fall in love. At least they think they do. Their relationship is a challenge, a love story which it turns out may not include much love at all. Did they come together for love or for convenience? They know true love when they see it, as they do in the rock-solid relationship between Rod Tidwell and his wife. Seeing what Rod and his wife have only makes it more painfully obvious to Jerry and Dorothy what they are lacking.<br/><br/>So this is a rather challenging romantic film. The main characters don't fall instantly in love and settle into a life of constant bliss. If this relationship is to succeed they are going to have to really work at it. It is an interesting journey Jerry and Dorothy take and director Cameron Crowe was fortunate to have two excellent performers filling those key roles. Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger were at the top of their games here, playing off one another beautifully and creating two truly outstanding characters. The actors are certainly helped by Crowe's terrific dialogue, this is a script with so many memorable lines, both funny and poignant. Of course Cruise and Zellweger don't get all the best lines for themselves. Cuba Gooding Jr. shines, injecting so much life into the movie playing the outrageous Rod Tidwell. Bonnie Hunt provides some laughs as Dorothy's wary sister. Kelly Preston is a stunner, both in looks and in what she says as she plays another woman in Jerry's life. And there is also room for a wonderfully precocious child, Jonathan Lipnicki being incredibly endearing in that part. There's also Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Regina King, Beau Bridges...it is a really long list of quality performers and Crowe gives them all their moments to shine. There is a sense the movie struggles at times with the balance between comedy and drama. Is it a comedy that's trying to be dramatic or a drama that's trying to be funny? And how do you squeeze a romance into that mix? Oh, and it's sort of a sports movie too. Crowe really does have a lot going on here, maybe a little too much. But by and large it works. The movie manages to both entertain and charm you. And it is great to see the characters grow. Maybe even Rod Tidwell can come to learn that it is not all about the money."

He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Renée Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor.

"ckolet37","8","1","1","7 June 2013"," Tom Cruise's Greatest Performance
","Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Renée Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it."

Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances.<br/><br/>The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions.<br/><br/>The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Renée Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother.<br/><br/>The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor.<br/><br/>The ugly.

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","1","20 April 2013"," More than about showing him the money
","This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again.<br/><br/>The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it.<br/><br/>Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fiancée because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well.<br/><br/>This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid.<br/><br/>This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened.<br/><br/>But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","6 October 2012"," Behind every great man, there is a (great) woman ...
","Is ""Jerry Maguire"" a heart-warming romantic comedy with sports as a subplot? Or a sports drama with romantic undertones? Or is it a fascinating character study introspecting the professional and private life of a sports pro manager, and the way these two poles of his personality influence and affect each other? I like the third option, especially since the title says it all; it's a film about a man named Jerry Maguire.<br/><br/>So, who's Jerry Maguire? At first, he strikes as the kind of character tailor-made for Tom Cruise; Maguire is the guy who's successful both in business and privacy. In fact, the two worlds interact so intensively that you can't quite differentiate between his friends, his colleagues and his clients, even his fiancé, Avery (Kelly Preston) is an ex-athlete. Tom Cruise is the ultimate yuppie and he plays the part perfectly with this extraordinary capability to make himself unlikable enough so you can better perceive his redemption, the same way he did in ""Rain Man"". But ""Jerry Maguire"", as if Cameron Crowe, the director, was already aware of its viewers' expectations, is pleasantly surprising because the redemption comes right at the beginning.<br/><br/>After a series of eye-opening incidents, one night, Jerry wakes up and has a sort of breakthrough illumination; he realizes that he wasted his life, by cumulating a generous quantity of clients (professional athletes) without taking time to understand them, to deal with them in a decent way. Struck by this rebirth of humanity, he writes an inspirational memo titled ""Things We Think But Do Not Say"". The memo elevates him into a sports management guru status except that he's the only one who seems to believe in his new humanistic theories  him, and a young accountant, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) who 'saw the light' through Maguire's inspirational words. And naturally, when Maguire is forced to leave the company, she's the only one who chooses to follow him, she's the kind of women who stand for her beliefs.<br/><br/>Then, Jerry and Dorothy work together with the only client who stays, Rod Tidwell, a football player, smaller than average, flamboyant, truculent  maybe a little too much, and he's played by a scene-stealing (and Oscar-winning) Cuba Gooding Jr. And it's funny how Gooding seems to embody the trademarks of Tom Cruise's archetypal characters through his cockiness and exuberance, but that's part of his 'character', I mean within the movie. Tidwell believes he's a great man, and naturally behind him, there's a woman, his wife Marcee (Regina King) who keeps a vigilant eye on his career's evolution. She doesn't trust Maguire but she gives it a shot. Tidwell trusts him and stays out of loyalty. And Boyd genuinely loves him because she knows there's something good inside that man. Maguire is a good guy because good people believe in him, and it works the other way, too.<br/><br/>Indeed, the 'friends' in the beginning, the pedant Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) and Avery, not to mention the cocky football player named Cush (whom I just discovered, was the chubby Vern from ""Stand By Me""), they all represent the dark side of Maguire's world, and it's only when he gets fired, when he leaves Avery and is betrayed by Cush' father who ends up signing with Sugar (leaving Tidwell as Maguire's only option), it's only when he's an outsider from that cynical world, that we start rooting for him. And Cruise is perfect because it's crucial that Maguire starts being unlikable enough so we can give him the benefit of the doubt and then supposedly change but not enough to make us lower our guard. <br/><br/>The suspicion must remain whether he's a good or a bad guy, if he's going to make it because he believes in his ideas of if he's going to sell his soul back to the devil. It's a two- way process, Rod considers him a friend, not his wife. Dorothy loves him and so does her adorable little kid, Ray, but her sister (Bonnie Hunt) is perplexed. Well, we expect a happy ending, but it's all in the ""how"" and ""when"" it will happen. The film deals with human relationships with a powerful mix of cleverness suitable for a comedy drama and touching tenderness, incarnated by the beautiful Renee Zelwegger, in a breakthrough performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. She's so adorable, so unbelievably sweet, that she puts something new and unusual in romantic comedies: genuine, shameless, passionate and innocent love. <br/><br/>There is something quite gutsy in the way Cameron Crowe's film tries to cover sports, character study, romance in one story, but the multi-layered format works because Jerry Maguire remains the center of gravity. Dorothy Boyd is a great character because she awakens the best out of Jerry and saves him from his own megalomania. Ironically, Jerry does the same with Rod, also blinded by his own ego too and obsession with money. The way the two stories interact transcends a lot of predictable elements, and even when it doesn't avoid some archetypal situations, the acting makes everything believable. We know that Maguire will get back to Dorothy, but the way it's handled never feels forced and insincere. Jerry listens to Rod who's got the greatest day of his career, and he's simply talking to his wife. Jerry knows he can be a great man, but only if behind him, there's a woman, not any woman: a 'great' woman.<br/><br/>The film is notorious for having introduced many iconic lines in Cinema's Dictionary: ""show me the money"", ""you complete me"" and last but not least ""you had me at 'hello'"", a line that owes more to its awkwardness than romantic appeal. Interestingly, the romantic catchphrase was used in the American Film Institute's 100 Passions montage right after Nicholson's ""You make me want to be a better man"". And after watching ""Jerry Maguire"", I understood this is exactly why Dorothy Boyd was a great woman."

It's sad the movie had that clichéd part: when Jerry read the final contract that stated if the athlete had health problems the contract'd be over, I instantly knew one of these things would happen: or Tidwell would break something of his body or he would make we all think he really did when actually it was just a shock. And the second guess happened. Also, I didn't feel a good chemistry between Dorothy and Jerry - which is good, because we've already seen tons of movie where the couple is perfect and made for each other.<br/><br/>And I feel this movie is a bit overrated, but that doesn't influence my rating since I don't think it deserved more or less than 7/10."

","You expect a punchy, cynical movie about sports and a behind the scenes look at a sports agent job through Jerry Maguire, and ultimately you end up enduring an extremely conventional and corny rom-com.<br/><br/>This love story occupies a huge place in the script and you wonder why because it is boring to death and so melodramatic that it becomes cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>The part related to sports is almost anecdotal, overshadowed by this boring love plot, and it's quite difficult to understand why Cameron Crowe didn't chose to focus on football since it augured good things especially thanks to Rod, the exuberant Cardinals wide receiver, embodied by the excellent Cuba Gooding Jr., only satisfaction of this insipid and overly long movie."
"wainot","10","5","12","12 June 2004"," This movie keeps getting better for me ...
","While Jerry Maguire is equal parts romance and sports-related movie, JM is among my favorites in both genres. And yes, I got sick of the phrase, ""Show me the money"" and even, ""You complete me"", shortly after its release, but that's not the fault of this movie.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I think this is his best role to date. In JM, he is equal parts movie star and actor, and his scenes with everyone in the cast are great. Ditto for Renee Zellweger: I admit to having a bit of a love-hate (well, not quite that extreme w/ her.)..to me, she never looked better or did better acting - from the heart- (w/ out dipping into a bag of tricks a la Cold Mountain) than in JM. She is radiant, sympathetic, charming and shows great comic instincts as well.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding, Jr. was very worthy of an Oscar nomination (I personally would have had him runner-up to Wm. H Macy in Fargo that year) --nevertheless he energizes the movie in creating the inimitable Rod Tidwell. The other supporting players all hit just the right notes: Bonnie Hunt as the jaded older sister, Jay Mohr as the sleaz-o agent, Regina King (brilliant) as Marcy Tidwell, Todd Louiso as the nanny/child technician, Kelly Preston as the b__tchy fiancée, and on and on. And then, they're probably all upstaged every time little Jonathan Lipnicki appears as Ray (go on, name me a more endearing child performance - ever - in the movies). This movie offers terrific, sharp writing, great acting, solid pacing and perfect use of music as well, and a great blend of comedy, romance and drama. .. For me, this movie earns a rare 10/10! It's made w/ great care, is wildly entertaining, and is even more meaningful in the little moments than in the big ones ...full of terrific scenes, not just two or more enduring catch phrases!"

And maybe that's what's wrong with it. It tries too hard to be a great movie. It seems forced at times.<br/><br/>Having said that, I did enjoy the movie and I would even see it again. It's filled with memorable quotes and classic scenes. I mean, who will ever forget Jerry telling Dorothy ""You complete me!"" or Jerry yelling ""Show me the Money"" over and over again.

"rob_kubiak","6","3","6","25 March 2008"," Why I Love to Hate Cameron Crowe
","Sitting alone in my living room on the sunny, yet frigid eve of Easter Sunday 2008 amidst six inches of snow that was dumped upon the Chicagoland suburbs the day before. Fueled by nicotine and caffeine I found myself straightening up my apartment and channel surfing when I happened upon an early morning screening of Jerry Maguire on TNT. That's right Jerry Ma-freakin-Guire. I found myself completely and utterly intrigued and drawn in despite the fact that I've seen this movie somewhere in the vicinity of 10-20 times before, typically on random weekend days on basic cable. First things first, I HATE, capital H through E, Renee Zelwegger and the charm of Tom Cruise died for me somewhere between Top Gun and his ill-conceived notion to pick up where L. Ron Hubbard left off on the proliferation of Scientology tip. And don't sleep on little Jonathon Lipnnicky, the cute little over-sized glasses wearing son of Zelwegger's character in the film, speaking of which, has he gotten arrested for marijuana/cocaine possession yet or fallen into the child-star trap yet? As I digress.<br/><br/>Anyway, without even realizing it  it happened  the film had my undivided attention and I became emotionally invested in the subtle intricacies of the dialogue and was provoked to the point of inspiration, which in my humble opinion is truly one of the greatest pleasures on Earthbut to arrive at this point watching Jerry Maguire? What was wrong with me  had I become a softy in my late 20s? I even found myself getting the chills and near-tearing up as the relationship between Jerry (played by Cruise) and Rod Tidwell (Oscar winning performance by Cuba Gooding Jr.) progressed and Jerry left himself emotionally vulnerable, which apparently is atypical of your big shot sports agent in this day and age, only to win back his wife Dorothy (played by Zelwegger) with one of the more memorable lines in recent film history  'you had me at hello'.<br/><br/>I then began realizing that despite my anti-Hollywood, screw all major studio releases attitude cultivated sometime between my junior year of high school and becoming a film studies major during my college days in Madison, WI, I did not hate Columbia TriStar or Cruise or Zelwegger or even Cuba (Gooding Jr.  not the home of Fidel Castro people). My hate was centered on Cameron Crowe, the only man with the verbiage and directorial skills to make me give a rat's arse about a movie like Jerry Maguire. The relate-ability of every facet of every relationship and every exchange between these actors that I truly love to hate is so deceivingly obvious and spot-on that I can't help but succumb to the magnetism and emotion of the scenes as they play out. I'm still watching the film and having this epiphany and rather than admit that it's the film I enjoy, I start shaking my head in disbelief amidst teary eyes and thrust all of the recognition and responsibility for the way I'm feeling on Mr. Crowe. I feel vindicated in doing so rather than chalk Jerry Maguire up as another guilty pleasure of mine, kind of like the Hanson song MMMBop. It's then that I decided I needed to write this, if not for the therapeutic function that it's currently providing me, but more so because I feel I owe it to Mr. Crowe.<br/><br/>I'm a proud purveyor of classics like Fast Times at Ridgemont High (granted Amy Heckerling directed it), Say Anything and Almost Famous. I'm still trying to be half the man Lloyd Dobbler was in courting (pun intended) Diane Court and churning out 'In Your Eyes' through his ghetto blaster and longed to have experienced the 70s rock scene like William Miller in Almost Famous. Those films equally capture me emotionally, spiritually, have terrific soundtracks and when mixed together in only the way Cameron Crowe can - they inspire me to believe that possibilities are limitless and that anything can happen and eventually, will happen. And when they do, they'll inevitably involve me getting with the perfect girl amidst the backdrop of the perfect song to capture the all-encompassing essence of purity, honesty and lovewhether it is for Diane Court, Stillwater or Dorothy BoydAnd that is why I love to hate, but really just plain admire Mr. Cameron Crowe  or maybe I just enjoy his films. Either way, I think I made my some kind of point, right?"

","This movie seems to have all of the necessary ingredients for a blockbuster. No wonder it was so well liked.<br/><br/>1. The basic setting itself, that of sports agency, is exciting -- a cross-section of high-stakes business and professional sports.<br/><br/>2. The basic plot is compelling: a David-Goliah story, with the sincere David (Jerry McGuire) going up against the Goliaths of the sports agency industry. So many Hollywood films have scored using this formula.<br/><br/>3. Lots of fun, clever, snappy dialogue, with the highlights: ""Show me the Money"", ""The Kwan"", ""You had me at hello..."" 4. There are so many well-written scenes, such as the frantic telephone chase, or the bathroom confrontation between Jerry and Rod. And there are so many ""big scenes"" throughout.<br/><br/>5. Character development: so many of the characters, such as Jerry, Rod, and Dorothy, have real characters. But the minor characters, such as the Nanny, are also very engaging.<br/><br/>6.

And needs to start anew, losing his fiancé, and most of his clientèle.

Plus you can't hate a movie with a young kid who says adorable things, that's why that tactic is used way to often in film.

","""Show me the money!"" Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a successful sports manager who makes a fatal mistake and writes a memo which causes his big problems.<br/><br/>After getting fired at a local restaurant Maguire's life becomes a struggle. He has to manage on his own by being his own boss. Still he gets one employee of his ex-job to follow him and become his secretary. Dorothy Boyd (Renée Zellweger who's role made her famous) is a widow and a single mother of an adorable boy Ray (John Lipnicki) who is loyal to his new boss despite the fact he could not provide a great deal of personal benefits to his secretary.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire loses all his clients except a footballer Rod Tidwell (amazing and energetic Cuba Gooding Jr.) who wants to make profitable contract with the Football league. This becomes a crazy hullabaloo trying to satisfy Tidwell's great demands. Jerry has to think is it worth it to work hard with only one client.<br/><br/>""Jerry Maguire"" is a mix of drama and comedy spiced up with serious relationship tangles. The director and writer Cameron Crowe is good at handling problematic relationships and obstacles of life. The neurotic sport agents life is a story with a lot of growing pains but believing your self and your abilities is the key-word to success. A little help from people who love you can make a huge difference.<br/><br/>As usual the former rock'n'roll journalist Crowe has put up with another amazing soundtrack. Rock legend Bruce Springsteen's ""Secret Garden"" is capturing and fits perfectly into the theme.<br/><br/>""Jerry Maguire"" has provided some great, very often quoted lines. ""Show me the money""-sequence is raving funny. ""You complete me""-line melt my heart as mushy it sounds like. I wish somebody would say that kind of things to me also."
"MyDarkStar","4","5","14","28 November 2001"," Two different movies...
","This movie basically has two different parts to it : the part at the beginning depicts Jerry Maquire as a low-life sports agent who will do anything to make money with his clients. The second half shows how he puts his life back together through a deep and enlightening relationship, after being fired. The problem is that the earlier part with him being the slimy sports agent is more interesting than the romance ! ...and that's a very big criticism considering the theme of this movie !<br/><br/>I would rather see more of Jerry Maguire as that slimy sports agent. That was the entertaining part of the movie (besides Cuba Gooding Jr., who is very entertaining in his role). The romance is just stale here. Also, in my opinion, the kid's appeal wears thin in about, oh, 5 seconds ?<br/><br/>Worth seeing once - but not twice."

"the red duchess","5","4","11","31 July 2000"," Brilliant Cruise transcends film.
","It's enough to make one weep.  The first hour of this film is good fun, an exposure of a certain kind of American bluster, schizophrenically epitomised in Mr. American Bluster himself, Tom Cruise (hard business; 'touchy-feely' ethics).  The second half replaces this with another kind of bluster - cute kid, family values, success, reconciliation, redemption.  With a cute taste of misogyny too - women are either ridiculed divorcees (Crowe gets to mock two American bugbears in one - women and collectives), hard-nosed career, er, ladies (independent!  Sexually liberated!  Careerist!  Help mummy!), sterile wisecrackers, or dippy drips who despite being (presumably highly qualified) accountants in a multi-million dollar company, are dumb enough, despite being single mothers, to give up a well-paying job for a phoney ideal, are prepared to marry a cynical creep AND aren't actually impressive human beings in their own right, juggling family and career, but a kind of spare limb, a foot maybe, lying around, waiting to make Tom Cruise 'complete' - i.e. just another mother.  Same with Rod Tidwell, less a character than a series of amusing bits, whose own rich family life is just a reflection of what Maguire's is not.  His blackness, sponged by Maguier, probably makes the latter's whiteness complete too.<br/><br/>This is a shame.  Crowe has never been the most visual of directors - you can see why he worships Billy Wilder - and the second half gets bogged down in dispiritingly trite speeches; but the first half is a pretty good deconstruction of Cruise's persona, brilliantly developed by Paul Thomas Anderson and John Woo in 'Magnolia' and 'Mission Impossible 2'.  All the familiar signifiers are there, presented in the classically flattering stylistic manner - the smile, the perfect hair, the easy beauty, the suits; but mostly the talk, the promises, the hyperactive loghorrhea, hiding a very empty core, a despair visualised by some sequences of dreamlike blue; we can see Maguire slowly break down, swallowed up by his own vacuity.  The 'mission statement' is a typically empty-headed response, a way to order the emptiness of his life, a kind of American dream, a purpose; the very American need to break ruts and drive for something, which is much easier than just changing what's wrong with the rut.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Crowe takes him at his word.  It is possible that the denouement, as with Rod's concussion, is pure fantasy, a fake injection of uplift in what had become a very gloomy film - Jerry's increasing the uppers to blot out some serious downers (and it is reassuringly American and capitalist that heart does actually mean money anyway).  Jerry is like a Western hero, interminably restless, roaming freely over states, but he is also a parasite, a horse dependent on a rider, a man of no active power, hanging on the decisions and betrayals of others.  This is like some kind of metaphor for (American) life, and the heterosexual family unit provides security against it, a fixed abode, a sense of coherent, whole identity and self-worth, a properly defined masculine role.  No thanks.<br/><br/>But, although it's hard to take a multi-millionaire egoist telling us to reevaluate our values, Tom Cruise is amazingly good, giving a depth of performance so rare in today's mainstream cinema, awesomely self-aware, revelling in the blurring of star and role."

","Jerry Maguire is not a perfect creation, I think no one can objectively affirm that Jerry Maguire is the perfect film experience. However it is what I call an event. If I were to completely analyze this title I'm sure I would find a consistent number of misplaced scenes, scenes which shouldn't have been put, in the first place, and which seriously diminished the depth of the subject.<br/><br/>The story is hardly new, same scenario in which an apparently ruined agent spectacular rises and take revenge on those who fired him. If you are looking for surprises Jerry Maguire will not match your expectations. But if you want a joyful, funny, vivid film which isn't stupid and trashy at the same time, than Jerry Maguire truly is the perfect choice.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire beautiful played by Tom Cruise, is an agent who has a one in a lifetime, nocturne revelation which ends with memo in which he suggests that agencies should have fewer athletes under contract, so that the agent/athlete relationship would be much closer, more sincere. However, it seems his employers do not appreciate Jerry's altruism and chose to dismiss him rapidly. If you think Jerry Ma-f..king-guire is the guy to back down well you're dead wrong. Instead he immediately decides to get his revenge on the agency, especially on Bob Sugar, his rival. The problem is the only athlete under contract with, it's the mouthy ,always unsatisfied Rod Tidwell... ...<br/><br/>I dare to say that the characters are the main attraction of this film. Jerry Maguire, played very well by Tom Cruise is the handsome type, a spontaneous charismatic, character, extremely skilled in his job as a sport agent. Rod Tidwell, though at least as spontaneous as his agent, is no more no less than a flippant, always dissatisfied with the financial aspect, arrogant and recalcitrant black male, just like his wife Marcee, the female version of her husband. Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) - sweet and her son Ray (Johnatan Lipnicki) - a simple woman, perhaps too simple which still hasn't found her love, but looks to change this when she accompanies Jerry his attempt to regain his position as the best, most appreciated sport agent.<br/><br/>As I said, this title, focuses more on character study rather than on a great scenario, which is, in fact, a regular, linear one. But the way it was illustrated by the director and actors in particular, was really special, making Jerry Maguire one of the most lively film that I have ever seen. I think the defining word for Jerry Maguire is alive, with great significance on dialogs, which were nonetheless sparkling and generous with unique lines like: ""show me the money!""<br/><br/>As a conclusion, I state that Jerry Maguire is Overall a good film, very good at times, well worth a **** out of ***** rating (8/10)"
"bobsgrock","7","2","4","6 October 2008"," Mediocre film, superior stars.
","For the movie Jerry Maguire, a story about a sports agent who feels he isn't being completely honest in life and decides to write a career-changing mission statement about his thoughts, there really isn't too much wrong with it. There also isn't too much right with it as it is pretty straightforward the whole way through and lags in a few areas. However, the bright spots far outshine the dim ones in this terrifically acted story that tugs on the heartstrings and gives an inside look as to how the sports business is run.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, this has the feeling of an insightful drama that wants us to consider how we conduct our lives and be brutally honest with ourselves and those around us. Indeed, there are plenty of long monologues about people not being honest with each other and how that affects our lives. I'm sure most of us already knew that, but that doesn't take away from this movie and how great the acting is by Tom Cruise as the title character, Renee Zellwegger as Dorothy, the woman who believes in him, and Bonnie Hunt as the no-nonsense sister. The show-stealer, though has to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for his role as a loud-mouthed by very loyal athlete that is keeping Jerry alive. Certainly not a bad film, but just a mediocre, Jerry Maguire is fun to watch and learn from."

","It's not a masterpiece but it is a very good film not so much for the meaning it may contain but for the images it sends in the audience. First it gives a positive image of sports by showing how one man, one agent can be different from all others in this ""industry"", and that the main difference is to believe in what he is doing, to believe in what his heart is telling him, to work with his heart and to love the players, the athletes he is working for, he is working with. That emotional, personal and very close relationship is what everyone needs all the time to feel needed, supported. The film shows that this is also the winning method because athletes want that contact and they can recognize that human attitude and they will work for this warmth of the heart, from the heart and in the heart. And what's more this relationship will enable the athletes as well as the agents to face the difficulties life is made of and life brings up all the time. This will mean success to the athletes as athletes and success for both the agents and the athletes financially. What's more the film conveys another tremendously positive image because the agent is white and the athlete is black and their relationship is one of trust, total friendship and confidence, one of love nothing but love and care and that is the right model to send in the public: what is important is not the differences among people but the possibility to establish trusting and loving relationships beyond these differences and accepting them totally.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","Show me the Money! This is a classic film because it had those few key lines in it that are always going to be cute and recognizable when you hear them! I mean ""I you had me at Hello"" what a great line. ""The Human head weighs eight pounds"" so cute. I'm not the biggest Tom cruse fan, but I enjoyed the speech he made when he left the office. I like his taking of the gold fish very ballsy. Rene Zellweiger does a really great job playing the cute single mother who needs to make a change in her life. Cubba Gooding Junior is very funny I love his show me the money dance, his positivity is infectious. The movie is fairly entertaining, it's kind of like cambels chicken noodle, it's not the most colorful or the best but it taste good and it comfortable. It's a good movie to pop in when your sick because it will make you laugh and feel warm fuzzies in the end!"

"mtiller12","8","2","4","7 June 2003"," A loveable drama, rom com
","""Jerry Maguire"" came out in 1996, it hit the box office and it proved it could cut it at the academy awards. It probably did so well at the box office because of Tom Cruise, the man was the main image of the posters and of course he played the title character. What ""Jerry Maguire"" did then was revitalise the rom com, drama. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent, the guy you don't normaly see, everything he does is for money, not for one second has he ever doubted his place in the world and the buisness he is in. That is until one of his low key stars is injured severly and causes Jerry to think about what he is doing. What happens is he decides to share his views, in one night he just pours his feelings out. He is loved by everyone at the office and cheered for his courage (He would probably be fired) Now he is the man, he no longer questions himself, but just then, he is fired. Jerry is left to go it alone, with only one of his clients left, a failing family man named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). The rest of the movie can not be broken down as it would be a spoiler. The first thing you say about when you hear the name ""Jerry Maguire"" is the Show Me The Money scene. It is one of the greatest scenes of all time and perhaps, the greatest scene of the nineties. Completely memorable, one of the biggest phrases of all time now, Tom Cruise potrays that scene excellently. He is desperate, time is running out, he now knows it is over and Cruise also givs the mood a boost by showing us how far a man will go to keep at least something from being over. Cuba Gooding Jr is also good there as well as his character is annoying Jerry and dosen't quite realise how important this is. When I write a review, I start with a little introduction with my thoughts and a few facts, then I write the plot, then I say the first thing that comes to mind about the movie I am reviewing and lastly I then comment on the cast, the directing and the script in that order, bu today I am going to do it in importance and how important they are into how the movie works. The directing by Cameron Crowe is his best. Good work, worthy of the oscar nomination he recieved. His simple shots are excellent with each one capturing the charaters features and thoughts. There is no room for style here, just a gritty portrayl, the tone he gives this film is just pure brilliance. Cameron Crowe never overdoes anything, nothing in this film is uneeded, this is just great directing, to simple to be fully appreciated like him not recieving the academy award. Now people's first thoughts is this film is long, I never question how long a movie is as long as it is good and I never questioned the quality of this film and it's script. It is witty, dramatic at times, maybe sentimental, brilliant in dialogue that moves you and great scenes. Crowe, who directed, was nominated for the script he wrote I think and I think it was beaten by ""Fargo"". Something I can't complain with is that, the script is better than the directing ecause of the effect, a work of brilliance that will always be more congratualted than the directing. Lastly in my three, the greatest thing about this movie, apart from Show Me The Money, is the cast and acting. Acting in this movie is completley memorable. Tom Cruise for starters was oscar nominated, Jerry Maguire is proably his most in depth character and Cruise gives him more depth than he proably has. It is comedic, deperate, calm, sweet and complete. Jerry is a characte who has decided to make a U-turn in his life and throughout the movie you can see at time that Jerry may be questioning his decision or sometimes believing it is the right one. Cruise perhaps has the best character he has ever had. Cuba Gooding Jr is also right on par as the fun loving, ego manic, Rod Tidwell. The character of Tidwell is perhaps harder to plat than people think because of the situation he is in, he is a family man trying to make a good home for his family but he also wants to play football and that he has a large ego needs to show as much as that he is a family man. Again Cuba does what Cruise did in the eyes, I always watch an actors eyes, his eyes says that I desperatly need this, I may be going out of buisness, but MAY go out of buisness. Rod is someone who accepts what is happening because he lovs his life more than people may know. Renee Zellwegger made a name for herself in this movie as Dorothy Boyd, who is single mother and Jerry's loyalist friend who loves him. The character again has massive depth but not as difficlt to pull off as the other two, Zellwegger makes the most of her screentime. The most astonishing part o the acting is the realtionship between Dorothy and Jerry, you can see these two people love each other but just can't show and for some reason are uncomfortable with it. They have a reconcilation at the end with another great peace of solo acting from Cruise and in the end are together hand in hand, you can see in their eyes now that they love each other and they are married. This really is a great achievment in modern day filmaking beacuse I beleive this movie is very appealing, characters who are completley memorable, scnes everything. I am thirteen years old and I love this movie, I love films like this, Sure I like the odd eighteens, adult crime movies and I have loads, but when a film like this comes along you just can't help but be gripped by it. ""Jerr Maguire"" is one of the best films of the last decade. You will love this movie anybody that has been in love, anybody that has gone it alone, anybody who know what these kind of situations are and underatnds then will love this movie. I mean ANYbody, ""Jerry Maguire"" A GREAT  romatic, drama... with a pinch of comedy."

","Jerry Maguire (1996): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jay Mohr, Jonathan Lipnicki: Effective drama about caring for those you do business with as oppose to just making a quick buck. Tom Cruise stars as sports writer Jerry Maguire whom everyone seems to love until he loses his job and his clients. He issues a challenge to others to join him independently but only Cuba Gooding Jr. remains who beams, ""Show me the money!"" Directed with insight by Cameron Crowe with low grade production. Crowe's work seems aimed at the idea of youthful conquests and the ability to dream big until standards are met high. He previously directed Say Anything and Singles, also about the ambitions of young America. Cruise plays Maguire as a man cheated by the system yet regains just enough faith to rise up. Gooding Jr. is great as a football player who remains as Maguire's client right up to a booming finale. Renee Zellweger appears as a loyal supporter in a predictable role but ultimately enacts our sideline cheering. She is the one co-worker who joined him upon his challenge after termination. Jay Mohr play his sleazy ex-boss in what could have been standard yet he brings out the conniving qualities. Jonathan Lipnicki plays Zellweger's son who delights his scenes with his young charm.

","Jerry Maguire is not a perfect movie in the sense that it is a masterpiece, but it seems difficult to dislike this movie. Despite being rated R for some swearing and sexual content, this movie deals with the notion of family and is definitely easy enough for a child to watch. It is very entertaining while it is simultaneously a touching story about relationships and their importance in our lives.<br/><br/>More than anything, Jerry Maguire is a film with heart. It can be argued that it has two protagonists: Jerry and Rod (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and both seem to need to learn about love. Jerry needs to connect to people, specifically to those who he claims to love, and Cuba needs to learn to play his sport with love and not just for the money. It is brilliant in the sense that Maguire's story and Rod's story are intertwined since the two depend on each other. Maguire is all about making relationships with clients more personal while Rod is all about wanting Jerry to pay attention to his needs. One is the professional, the other is the greedy showboat. Ultimately, they both depend on each other since Rod is Jerry's last client and since Jerry might be the only agent willing to put up with Rod's ego.<br/><br/>The film is well-acted, especially by Cuba Gooding Jr., and we like each character for different reasons. The kids in this film are adorable, especially Ray, Dorothy's son, who proves to be funny even though we know he is the reason Jerry wants to get together with Dorothy.<br/><br/>Half a sports film and half a romance, Jerry Maguire proves to be fun for a variety of people.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"

The character Jerry Maguire is developing on two levels, both based on connecting to another person and finally understanding the concept of loyalty witch Jerry has constantly talked about but never really understood. Cruise and Zellweger characters are perfectly complementary, his hastiness, her emotional side, their shared optimism and confusion were the main combination of their success. Cameron Crowe has a perfect career, every next film picks up where the previous one left off, raising the level of quality over its expected size.

","Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire is the first and the best sports-agent movies that I have ever seen before and it is a film that also knows a lot about TV sports-casting as well. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Maguire one of the top sports agents that works for a company called SMI and goes by the philosophy that ""being a sports agent isn't about how much money you get and how many clients you may have it is about the friendship with your clients"" and gets fired as a result after his boss Bob Sugar (played by Jay Mohr), and before he leaves he decides to go establish a new business with a co-worker named Dorothy Boyd (played by Renee Zellweger) who is the only person that believes in Jerry, and his only client Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Oscar winning performance) who acts like a brother to him, and as a result for Tom Cruise he goat a best actor Oscar nomination for his work. Crowe's screenplay is also well written and inspires many to follow their dreams whether you want to be involved in the sports business or not.Even though this isn't a great movie I did enjoy watching the movie. There are some other good things about the movie as well mainly being the humor of this movie which is funny in a goofy kind of way.

"ThomasDrufke","9","0","0","15 May 2015"," Loyalty Without Intimacy
","Cameron Crowe is a genius. Every movie is made to make an audience member feel something. Whether it be laughter, horror, entertainment, or maybe just to be feel good. I simply don't think there is a better director at just making you feel good about life. He must be a tremendously happy person or maybe just too optimistic. No matter, I love his movies. Some would argue that at times his films feel too happy and perhaps unrealistic, to that I say nonsense. I don't mean nonsense as in they are completely invalid, the arguments have a point. I just don't think that always matters. Movies are made to be enjoyed and entertained by, and Crowe almost always comes through there.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent who is down on his luck after being fired and is left with only one client who still stands by him. But what it's really about is a man with major intimacy issues, who learns how to enjoy life with his heart more than with his wallet, or lack there of. It's pretty much Tom Cruise's quintessential role and one that he very well could have won an academy award for. Cruise not only brings some surprisingly well timed comedy, but a great amount of heart and realism to Jerry. Renee Zellweger also has a career defining performance as Dorothy Boyd, a single mom and a co-worker of Jerry. Crowe has a knack for creating great chemistry between romantic co-stars. Zellweger and Cruise are great together, along with the hilarious son of Boyd, Ray. It's the scenes with all three of them that really touched me in a way that only some films do. Not to mention just how funny the three of them, particularly Ray are in the film. For a film that isn't straight comedy, it made me laugh a whole lot.<br/><br/>With Cameron Crowe you also get a great soundtrack and score. Nancy Wilson does an impeccable job scoring at the right times, and the soundtrack choices couldn't be more spot on with the various moments throughout. But it's also Crowe's ability to make an admittingly predictable film feel fresh and re-watchable. He surrounds the wonderful main cast of Cruise, Gooding Jr, and Zellweger, with standouts Regina King and Bonnie Hunt. The writing, music, and direction are all top of the line as Jerry Maguire is simply one of the most enjoyable films I have seen recently. To go along with the fact that being a huge sports fan, it was fascinating to see how the agent business may work. Of course, the film is famous for the endlessly quotable lines, but I feel like the enjoyment of life is what I'm going to take from it, and really how little money can mean in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>+Cruise at his absolute best <br/><br/>+Real romance <br/><br/>+Quotable lines <br/><br/>+The kid is hilarious <br/><br/>+Great sports film <br/><br/>+Supporting cast <br/><br/>-A little bit predictable<br/><br/>9.7/10"
"Kings_Requiem","9","0","0","23 March 2015"," Real human beings
","Jerry Maguire is a comedic drama starring Tom Cruise, Renee Zellwegger, & Cuba Gooding Jr. among others. The story follows a sports agent named Jerry whose life is inadvertently turned upside down when he decides to write a ""manifesto"" describing how his fellow sports agents really act behind closed doors. And so begins the journey of Jerry Maguire. <br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent across the board starting with a very down-to-earth performance from Tom Cruise as the title character Jerry. This character isn't necessarily unlike any of his previous characters. He starts out as basically a jerk before evolving into a sweet, caring individual. The thing that I believe sets his character of Jerry apart from the others that he's played, is the fact that he's actually acting like a real human being and not just some random drone that the writer created. He breathes life into Jerry in a way that I'm not sure another actor could have. I'm not the only one who thinks this either - Cruise was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Of course, Jerry would not be who he is throughout the movie without the help of his co- worker Dorothy Boyd who is played with a very sweet girl-next-door quality by Renee Zellwegger. I'm usually not a fan of hers, but for the first time in her career she showed me something that was very similar to that of Tom Cruise...she was able to create a fully rounded 100% human being who is very relatable. She's a single mother who carries herself very independently. She's not necessarily supremely confident in her actions, but she's definitely learned throughout the years of raising her son on her own that she doesn't really need anyone in her life except her son. At least that's what she thought. The final member of the cast to really make a lasting impact is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell - a Wide Receiver for the Arizona Cardinals and Jerry's sole remaining client. This is a man who only wants to provide a great living for his family and against all odds he believes that Jerry Maguire is the man who can bring him to that promise land. That belief is heard loud and clear in one of the movies most talked about scenes where Rod and Jerry are on the phone together and Jerry is trying to persuade Rod into keeping him as his agent. Rod: ""It's something very personal, a very important thing. Hell! It's a family motto. Are you ready Jerry? I wanna make sure you're ready, brother. Here it is: Show me the money. Show! Me! The! Money! Jerry, it is such a pleasure to say that! Say it with me one time, Jerry."" Jerry: ""Show you the money."" Rod: ""No, no. You can do better than that! I want you to say it brother with meaning! Hey, I got Bob Sugar on the other line I bet you he can say it!"" Jerry: Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. Show you the money."" Rod: ""No! Not show you! Show me the money!"" This conversation alone shows just how much of a report Jerry and Rod have together and that report is exactly the reason why Rod decides to stick with Jerry as his agent. The conversation also proves that Rod Tidwell is also, just like Jerry and just like Dorothy, a complete 100% human being and it's Cuba Gooding's performance that proves it. He was also nominated for an Academy Award and he won for his performance. <br/><br/>The beauty of Jerry Maguire and the thing that makes it so watchable is the fact that it's a very human story with very relatable characters. That's the main thing I look for in a movie...even if it has an extremely predictable story and a predictable outcome - the movie can overcome all of that as long as it has those relatable characters for us to follow along on this journey with. Over the years Jerry Maguire has also kind of taken its place among pop culture lore. Some of its quotes are still used today by several people around the world. That just goes to show how the lasting power of a movie like Jerry Maguire goes a very long way and that's a good way to judge a movies greatness in general years down the line."

","Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner"" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to ""takeover"" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fiancÃ© on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?"

Tom Cruise was amazing as the lead character who starts out as a egotistical sports agent and then he becomes more compassionate as the film goes on.

Not to mention, the film housed yet another case of the sports world being one of the only avenues to black success.  In many cases, some of the world makes general assesments of minorities through film because they don't take the time or feel it is necesssary to learn much about others through personal contact, if they aren't forced to.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel a film like Jerry McGuire with such stereotypical undertones, adds on to those second and third hand assessments.

","This was a life changing movie for me. While I was disgusted by the first sex scene and the overuse of strong vulgar language in places; I rediscovered what I had lost in my own life. A relationship with that one who is my life time companion needs to be much more than just an existence of being polite to one another. The thought of completing one another just sent thrills up my spine. As a result of this movie, I have been getting deeply involved in her world and her. I didn't tell her about the movie or my motives. She has responded to this new romancing by moving so much closer to me. I have rediscovered that girl that took my heart some years ago But the story line is not only one of romance. I loved the logic in the movie! Watch for a theme of heart in work but not in personal relationships set against the theme of heart in relationship but not in work. Watch for the theme of one lover interested in only herself and her goals while another lover is interested in the loved one's goals. Watch how the loved one responds to each manifestation of each lover's view of him. Tom Cruise's dynamite control over audiences comes out strongly in several situations where he uses, as in every movie I've watched him, his Harvard lawyer alter ego. This added dimension of intellect is what I like most about Tom Cruise. You see him play ""thinking on his feet"" so well. This sets Tom Cruise over all the other actors. He looks sharp and greatly intelligent without the appearance of being an egghead. The scenes in which he refutes illogic statements and takes command of a living room both with one person or with a whole group are a reminiscent shadow of his brilliant performance in ""A Few Good Men"". Renee Zellweger's performance was spectacular. I didn't know she existed until now, but I will be sure to watch for her in the future movies that I watch. I also greatly enjoyed Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Rod Tidwell as a warm, but explosively tough football player. I have watched and will watch this movie over and over. I recommend this movie highly to all movie watchers who want to add an extra thrill in their own personal lives."

The movie holds Tom Cruise in one of his most finest performances ever. But I guess almost all his movies are good, because he seems so dedicated to the cause.<br/><br/>The whole movie is centered at being number 1. Based upon an sports-agent life to support the best athletes. But there is an opposite side to every coin, even a sports agents job isn't completely filled with good morals.

"MusicDefined","10","4","12","3 May 1999"," just when I think Tom Cruise is done
","Every time I watch a Tom Cruise movie, I compare it to my favorite one, Rain Man.  Even though he wasn't the main character, I still feel that it is his best acting job.  The closest he has ever come to that is Jerry Maguire. When I sat and watched this movie the first time, I kept thinking to myself, ""This better be much better than 'Days of Thunder' or I'm walking out."" Then within the first five minutes, I was hooked.  Tom Cruise has some kind of magnetic charm over everyone in the world...it's scary.  So that is my favorite aspect of the film, the acting. Next is Cameron Crowe.  I thought that this movie was a little better than his previous work, Say Anything-which I love-and Fast Times At Ridgemont High-which is okay.  The writing seemed to be very similar to Say Anything, with the monologues and the quick dialogue back and forth between characters...and of course the dramatic love scenes. I also loved the child, Jonathan Lipnicki...he was so cute.  He is the kid that should be in every movie, but of course that is impossible. I wish that the movie would have been longer...or lingered more on the relationship between Jerry and Dorothy...I felt that that part of the movie went by way too quickly...but that is just me. Finally, I love the way the movie ends...it is one of those endings that makes you feel why they make movies anymore...besides, I know that I had you all, ""at hello...I had you at hello."""

"MrSharma","7","3","8","5 December 2005"," meh...nothing special
","Viewing this film for the first time after being made aware of its several Academy Award nominations, included the reputed Best Picture and Best Director (Cameron Crowe), I was disappointed in how thin this film actually was. But then again, how deep can you go when you're dealing with a romantic comedy? Still, I am yet to understand what all the big hype is about.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise delivers an excellent performance as Jerry Maguire, a disgruntled sports agent who loses his job and dignity after having an epiphany about the lack of morals within his basic workplace. He falls for a single mother (Renee Zellweger), simultaneously developing a strong bond with her child and hence embarking on a trip of personal and professional redemption. Cuba Gooding JR is full deserving of his Oscar win as Best Supporting Actor, and Renee Zellweger is solid as always. But that's just about it. A fine cast delivers memorable performances, but what else has this movie got? Crowe's direction is very simple, arguably crossing the line from being ""unpretentious"" to ""boring"". The more technical elements of the picture are also mediocre at best, with simple editing and cinematography contributing to what is ultimately a fairly simple film all round. At the end of the film, you are left feeling that what you viewed was practically the same as any other feel-good romantic comedy that you would watch otherwise. The only difference: a better cast.<br/><br/>I must say here that this film's critical recognition by the Academy is one of the most ridiculous things that I've ever heard of. Sure, the film was OK and simple, but to claim that it stood up even as a nominee against the likes of the brilliant ""The English Patient"" and ""Shine"" at the 1997 Academy Awards is an insult to that year and illustrates a deterioration of the medium. This is not to say that Crowe is a bad director or that this was, by any means, a terrible film, but it is by no means deserving of the critical hype that accompanied its theatrical release.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent romantic comedy with excellent acting and relatively good editing. But, by all means, nothing special."

Literate, yet occasionally pretentious, overextended comedy-drama that uses every conceivable romantic-movie trick to wring tears from its sugar-coated scenario: the single mom and her cute kid, the emotional client and his pregnant wife, the movie star grins in close-up from Cruise...they're all part of a cinematic formula, yet the film does work on a fantasy kind of level.

"ciaobox2k","Null","3","8","4 November 2001"," Excellent film. What films should be about!
","Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" is my favourite film of all time.  It such a great character driven movie with great writing, acting and directing.  I have wrote a little bit about why it's my favorite film ever. Enjoy...<br/><br/>                      Jerry Maguire<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe's `Jerry Maguire' is my favourite film and when I ask myself why I love it so much, I always come back to the same points:<br/><br/>1. Jerry Maguire is a good-hearted decent guy. 2. `Jerry Maguire' is film based purely on story, acting, writing and directing. 3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.<br/><br/>
1. One of the reasons is that Jerry Maguire is good-hearted decent guy. I have been thinking about why we should find this so amazing to see a good, decent guy.  I think it's because there is so few of them out there.  Jerry is a hard working guy who is taking the bad with the good.  He is trying to take his one client, Rod Tidwall and get his career back after being fired from his job at SMI.  At no point does Jerry give up.  There are many times when he had come close because he knew he was over.  But he didn't.  He fought and fought and in the end he succeeded.<br/><br/>Jerry makes mistakes like we all do.  He messes up from time to time.  He's human.  It's these little touches that make us love the character Jerry Maguire and be able to relate to him.  Even if we have never been through what he has, we can still see his motivations for his actions and understand why he does what he does.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire's biggest problem is not being able to commit to a woman. He's great at friendships but bad at relationships.  At the end of the movie when Jerry has success he realises that it's not all perfect because he cannot share it with the woman he loves.  Only after his hard work and he has now got success does he realise that he needs to have someone in his life to share his life with.<br/><br/>When Jerry worked at SMI he was just, as Jerry says, `another shark in a suit', he was all about money.  He had a job; good money and he didn't really need to commit.  But Jerry's journey throughout the movie has made Jerry grow as a person and made him realise a few things.<br/><br/>2. The movie is based purely on story, acting, writing and directing.  This movie doesn't rely on big explosions or effects to make this movie fun or interesting. All this movie has is a great script, actors and a great director.  <br/><br/>I love, just like everyone else, now and again to go along and see a big Hollywood blockbuster full of guns, explosions and guys taking out entire army's with only a handgun.  Those movies are important because they allow you just to relax for a few hours and let your imagination go wild.  But these movies are not satisfying full-hearted movies like `Jerry Maguire'. Those movies do not have the heart and soul that `Jerry Maguire' has.  <br/><br/>
Tom Cruise acts with such comic skill and is so natural.  He is so relaxed and confident in this role and it's obvious he is having lots of fun. Cruise gives a great heart-felt performance, which is one of the best of his career to date. Child actor Jonathan Lipnicki holds the screen with Cruise extremely well and it's a delight to see them share a scene together.  Renee Zellweger gives a fantastic performance as always delivering the lines with passion.<br/><br/>The direction from Cameron Crowe is nothing short of amazing.  The atmosphere that the film has is so relaxed, funny and enjoyable.  He uses simple set ups to shoot the movie which works extremely well because there is no fancy shots which make you think `Wow look at that shot'.  He shoots it so subtly that at no point does it ever distract you from the story.<br/><br/>3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.  It is clear that Cameron Crowe made this movie with passion and a real story to tell.  These kinds of movies do not come along very often.  This movie is the kind of movie that could have been made on a much lower budget and still have succeeded because the movie has heart.  It has a story to tell.  As I have said before, I like to see action movies now and again too, but movies like `Jerry Maguire' are what you call real movies.  The film industry today is treated too much like a business and too many filmmakers make movies for money and not because they have a passion for it.  <br/><br/>
Cameron Crowe thank you so much for this film!<br/><br/>Ciaobox2k@hotmail.com"

","I don't think Jerry Maguire is the best film of all time, but it's certainly my favorite of all time.  This movie really got me respecting Cruise and his work.  He really gives a top class performance in this movie.  The best part about this movie, however, is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brilliant, hilarious performance.  He really gets this role down pat.  No body could have done this role better than him.  Zellweger, my favorite actress, is fabulous.  In fact, the whole cast is a marvel.  I also love Cameron Crowe's really witty script.  It is so sharp.  How does it lose to Fargo for best original screenplay?  Don't get me wrong, Fargo was great, but Jerry Maguire was just better.  If only Kenneth Branagh's version of Hamlet wasn't released that year, Jerry Maguire is the best film."

","I just watched Jerry Maguire again last night for, like, the tenth time on the cable. The film could still pretty much shook me emotionally. I still remember the first time I had watched it; I had almost cried at the ""You had me at hello"" scene (And I can assure you that I am the kind of guys who don't cry). Last night, the impact of the scene was still there for me, though not as much as it used to be but, hey, I have watched this film more than ten times already.<br/><br/>I just can't describe how much I love this movie. Everyone gives a superb performance including Tom Cruise and, yes, you heard me right, Tom Cruise. He should have won an Oscar for the role of Jerry Maguire, period. For me, no offense to Cuba Gooding, I think he is even better than Cuba in the movie. Rene Zellweger couldn't be cuter in the movie, She makes Dorothy the girl of every man's dream. Bonny Hunt also gives believable performance as Dorothy's caring sister. It's a shame that she hasn't had any decent roles ever since.<br/><br/>All in all, the biggest kudo should go to Cameron Crowe. This is definitely his best work ever. It may not be as personal as ""Almost famous"" or as raw as ""Say anything"" but it is his best all around movie. Cameron Crowe is one of the best directors of his generation along with Alexander Payne.<br/><br/>This film ranks high up there in my all-time list"

"TxMike","Null","3","9","14 March 2003"," Formulaic, but one of the best of its genre.
","The first time I saw Jerry Maguire several years ago, I thought it was a film about sports and agents. When I re-watched it this week on DVD loaned from my local county library, I realized that it is really a story about people getting grips on who they are, and what really matters in life. Tom Cruise is always a very dependable actor, much like Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, and Patrick Swayze, but never 'great.'  In this film, Renee Zellweger is great, giving us another glimpse, after ""Whole Wide World"", of how good she really is. And Cuba Gooding Jr., as the spoiled wide receiver, is 'great.' They are the two who lift 'Jerry Maguire' above the ordinary.<br/><br/>Funny moment, for me, was about half-way when she and he are going to dinner together the first time, he is in the street in his shoes with lifts, while she comes walking out into the street carrying her high heel shoes, obviously to make sure Renee didn't look taller than Tom, even though she is only 5'-5"". <br/><br/>some SPOILERS - One way this film breaks from most formula love stories is they get married just past the middle of the movie, instead of falling in love right at the end. This early marriage sets up conflicts which follow, including whether he really married her for love, which is the only way she can accept him, or if he simply felt sorry for her and her small son. This is resolved near the end when he comes back after a road trip, into the ongoing ""divorcee meetings"" her sister has, looking for his wife. As he begins to tell her, tearfully, how he misses his wife, she soon says her famous line, ""Shut up, just shut up. You had me at 'hello.'"""

","In the 90's Tommy Cruise has been the undisputed box-office master, having managed the feat of starring in Five straight $100 million grossing movies (Days of Thunder, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire). He can do no wrong, and Cameron Crowe manages to get another superb performance from him, in what is essentially a romantic drama.<br/><br/>The film, while relying on a dialogue heavy script, is really about triumph in the face of adversity. This is portrayed through Maguire who at one moment has it all, then the next minute has nothing, and so has to go it alone with one sole client. The Gooding character also faces a very personal battle, trying to salvage a career that is seemingly on a downward spiral. Ultimately, this is a feel good movie, which while clearly aimed at the female audience, is still an extremely professional production that a lot of men probably enjoyed but were frightened to admit it. Gooding thoroughly deserved his Oscar, and the highlight of the movie is still the ""Show me the money"" scene. Cameron Crowe is a director/writer to look out for in the future.<br/><br/>7/10."
"SKG-2","10","3","9","4 April 1999"," Cameron Crowe does it again
","Cameron Crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers after only three films to his credit as director (he also wrote FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, which was a little rough around the edges but still good, and THE WILD LIFE, which was a huge mistake).  SAY ANYTHING and SINGLES were classics, and now comes JERRY MAGUIRE, which is the first time he's made a film about people his age or around that.  It manages to avoid being cynical and at the same time avoid being saccharine in its tale of a sports agent named Jerry Maguire who, thanks to a memo(or mission statement) that came from a brief bout of conscience, loses his job and his fiancee, and must not only claw himself back but admit to himself that he did in fact write that memo and really does believe in it.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has spent half of his career coasting, and half of it giving great performances when he works with a real director.  This fits in the latter category.  As the script shows Jerry's growth in small steps, so does Cruise.  It's not until he really has grown and has something to lose (his marriage) that he has a big emotional scene at the end, and this feels earned, rather than cheap, as it does in so many other movies.  And while he is the star here, Cruise doesn't horn in on everyone else, but really plays off of everyone else, and even allows them room to steal the movie.<br/><br/>As for the rest, a lot has been said about Cuba Gooding Jr., and among the people who were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he would get my vote. He also felt honest and was funny and energetic.  And the rest of the cast is good as well.  But the real force, for me, anyway, came from Renee Zellweger.  I think it was Gene Siskel who said he felt the movie might have started out being more about sports, but when Zellweger was cast, it was shifted towards her character more simply because she lights up the screen. Now, from what I've read, I don't think the movie was edited towards her, but she certainly does light up the screen.  She has the two best moments of the movie; when she finds out Jerry's dumped his fiancee, the look on her face is incredible, and I also loved her line to Jerry after his big speech near the end, ""You had me at hello.""  A great moment in a great movie."

"Siamois","5","2","5","12 October 2009"," Probably deserves its classic status...
","Watching Jerry Maguire again recently, I can understand its status as a (cult) classic of the 90s but the movie did not have such a strong effect on me. <br/><br/>We follow Jerry Maguire on his transformation from cynical, go-getter player agent to a less materialistic, better grounded person. Here's the first reason I had problems getting immersed: we only get but a glimpse of his former, superficial life and jump right into the ""epiphany"" portion where he longs for change. From a dramatic point of view, it makes the character's transition less lifelike and we lose the impact of such a transformation. Not to mention all the comedy moment we probably miss out (cynical characters lend themselves well to comedy and good setups that can be exploited later on).<br/><br/>As much as the central figure is Jerry Maguire, two other characters go through transformations themselves: Dorothy Boyd is Maguire's love interest. A young single mother in a precarious situation (fringe job, living with her sister and longing for partner to complete her family). Rod Tidwell is the typical feisty but underrated player at a critical juncture of his short football career, looking for a big payoff in his next (and likely last) contract.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is excellent in a role that fits him like a glove. He is right in his comfort zone in this role which makes it easy effortless to become Jerry Maguire. As much as sometimes we find him clueless and want to punch him, we greatly enjoy the ride. Renée Zellweger was probably put on the bigger Hollywood map thanks to her role as Dorothy Boyd. Zellweger, much like Cruise, is perfectly cast here. These roles as quirky, vulnerable, romantic interest are almost a speciality for her (think Bridget Jones, Me Myself and Irene, Nurse Betty) and she is immediately endearing and she makes people around her shine in scenes. A good actress with a good feel for chemistry and synergy. And lastly is Cuba Gooding Jr. as the sometimes hilarious, sometimes obnoxious Rod Tidwell. Gooding sometimes overreaches to the point where the character is nothing more than a caricature, and none of it is as well done as, say, the various weird, over-the-top characters that populate The Big Lebowski, for instance. <br/><br/>The famous ""show me the money scene"" probably deserves its cult status but loses a lot of impact the second time around. You wish the script was a little tighter in some places, that more context was provided. The mix of drama and comedy often feels a bit awkward. <br/><br/>The peripheral characters are lacking. Particularly Dorothy's kid, Ray... who ends up annoying most viewers and is not endearing at all. Dorothy's sister and Tidwell's wife (both acting as catalysts to push Dorothy and Tidwell to bigger and better things) are also equally annoying. <br/><br/>The direction is unremarkable. The cinematography is sub par. Every memorable scenes (there are few) is driven by acting and a lot of the quotes sound rather cheesy and corny for a movie from the 90s. ""You had me at hello"" is what one might expect from a 50s movie, not the 90s. <br/><br/>But through it all, Cameron Crowe manages to never sink completely into happy-happy Hollywood crapola, making Maguire a flawed and somewhat believable character. If only the lines had been refined. The writing is too self-conscious at times and the movie doesn't expand enough on the ""old Maguire"" to make the journey he takes truly remarkable. <br/><br/>It's still a good movie and deserves at least one viewing. Especially worth it for the great chemistry between the three actors, a very strong and engaging premise and some memorable scenes.<br/><br/>I can totally see why it's a classic but it just didn't do it for me enough to buy a DVD."

Zellweger, as the love interest at her absolute finest! forget Bridget: Cuba Gooding Jr in his well deserved Oscar Acadamy award winning role, as the frustrated NFL front man, was impeccable. This is a moral tale tinged with a funny theme to it. Whether in real life uncles Sam, reality would prevail, only the great one himself knows.

That was a mistake, as this was throughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>This was a great movie about love,friendship and the highs and lows of the entertainment industry.

This movie really hit everything on the head and in addition to the realism of the characters(sadly this type of thing happens way to much in ANY industry) manages to inspire hope as well without being to over the top and the main characters are both likable and interesting. It's a really good film.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Tom Cruise tremendously and as I'm not a big fan of his(or wasn't until now) that was nice. Renee was as always flawless and I was bowled over by Cubing Gooding's performance. (I had particular interest in seeing him to see who could possibly beat out Ed Norton for best supporting actor.) I won't say he was better then Norton but he WAS great and he earned his Oscar and nailed the character to the tee. <br/><br/>This movie also has some absolute great quotes like(here it comes): SHOW ME THE MONEY!!<br/><br/>If anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie go rent it.

No personality---a real nothing movie. It gives the impression of being one of those dreams we all have and can't quite remember. I actually fell asleep about six times! I kept rewinding and going back to the parts I missed. It didn't help. The only good thing about this movie is Bonnie Hunt. I have always liked her.

","It always feels like it's building towards something, and it has it's moments, but it unfortunately goes nowhere but to a sappy, sugary ending and a walk off into the sunset.<br/><br/>First of all, Tom Cruise can't convince me of much.  IN ""Born on the 4th of July"", he was good as the naive kid signing up to 'serve his country', but as the jaded veteran who realized the harsh realities and political motivations behind war, he began to wear thin.  Here, he's great as the cocky, successfull agent, but as soon as that job falls through Cruise's performance seems to follow.  He pulls through in moments of anger, but otherwise it's uneven and even at times spooky.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. does play his role very well.  Renee Zellwegger...well, I know she's a better actress then what we see here.  I think it's the writing that just demands her to play the same stupid emotion in every other scene. Her son, in the movie, is so over-the-top cute that at times you expect a studio audience to start piping in with 'aaaaw's.  This is good or bad, depending on your outlook and cynicism (obviously I have too much of the latter).  The best acting in the film actually comes from those in the much-ridiculed 'divorced women's group' that pops in and out of the movie - those scenes actually come off a little too realistic in a film where the main characters are anything but.<br/><br/>This film just takes on too much, doesn't explore enough and tacks on the ending that it knows will make mainstream audiences happy but hardly completes the story.  What it needed was more dialogue.  Too many scenes were just 'this is what happens' and not 'this is how it is going to happen'.  The only scenes that they let hang are those where Cruise and Zellwegger start kissing.  Could have explored more through dialogue, but I guess there were so many themes in the movie there just wasn't enough time."

","Why do people hate Jerry Maguire? I read about 5 comments on this film and they are all wrong. Jerry Maguire is a great movie. Even if you don't like sports or Tom Cruise, you have to like this movie. It's a simple plot, but some how the movie turns into an Oscar winner. It's about a sports agent who gets fired from his job and starts out on his own. The only sports athlete that he has left is Cuba Gooding JR(who won best supporting actor). There are also a lot of cry baby moments in the film. The relationship between Jerry and the little kid is priceless. And how about that very funny scene when Cuba wants more money. SHOW ME THE MONEY!SHOW ME THE MONEY! And again, what about the fact that it won an Oscar? Do you think that a movie is going to be very,very terrible and win an Oscar? The overall plot and point of the film is to when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. <br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is a film that when it comes on TV, I have to watch.

"jboothmillard","8","2","6","9 September 2005"," Jerry Maguire
","From director Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous), this is a funny, touching and charming sports comedy romance. Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Cruise plays Jerry Maguire, a sports agent who is ""at the top of his game"", and he is breaking down after being fired. The only person willing to go with him to make a new company is Dorothy Boyd (Bridget Jones's Renée Zellweger). When he loses his best client Frank Cushman (Jerry O'Connell) to his mean opposition Bob Sugar (Small Soldiers' Jay Mohr), the one and only client he can try and make a career for, and from, is ego-maniacal football player Rod Tidwell (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Cuba Gooding Jr.). Jerry is doing everything he can (for free) to try and resurrect Rod's career and get him the recognition he knows he and his wife Marcee (Regina King) want. Also on Jerry's mind is his close relationship with Dorothy and her lovable son Raymond (Stuart Little's Jonathan Lipnicki), turning into real love and eventually a marriage, that does fall apart for a little while, but in the end is saved by Jerry's words. Also starring Kelly Preston as Avery Bishop (Jerry's ex-fiancée), Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt as Laurel (Dorothy's sister). The scene where Cruise and Gooding Jr. are shouting the famous catchphrase on the phone is pure entertainment. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Jerry coming back, it was number 100 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 52 (""You had me at ""hello""."") and number 25 (""Show me the money!"") on 100 Years, 100 Quotes.

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","2","6","5 September 2004"," Brilliant Feel Good Movie
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>In the world of sports, there came a time when the sportsmen cared less about the sport and more about the money. One of the reasons for this is that heinous of people, the sports agent. In ""Jerry Maguire"", Cameron Crowe has written a brilliant story about a man who realises the error of his ways and does things his way.<br/><br/>Staring Tom Cruise, ""Jerry Maguire"" tells the story of agent Maguire. Maguire is your typical, money obsessed, agent who is more concerned with the financial aspects than the person himself. Suddenly having a crisis of conscience, Maguire writes a booklet describing his views on where the industry is going wrong. Whilst truthful, this booklet has the negative effect of getting him fired. Leaving the office, Maguire finds himself with a single mum accountant (Renee Zellweger) and one remaining, extreme client (Cuba Gooding Jnr in an Oscar Winning Performance).<br/><br/>The beauty of ""Jerry Maguire"" is that it's yet another of these brilliant feel good movies, but it's one with brilliant acting and an equally superb script. Yes this film follows the simple script of negative, to positive, followed by a brief dip in the heroes fortunes before the typical conclusion. Crowe's script might follow this pattern, but ultimately it just works.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about ""Jerry Maguire"" is just how amazing the acting is. Cruise turns in his best performance to date as the confused Maguire, whilst Zellweger might look like she's going to cry a lot, but she does a brilliant job showing us the emotional mother who falls for him. The two staring roles of this film are sadly not these two actors, but Cuba Gooding Jnr and Jonathan Lipnicki as Zellweger's cute little kid Ray. A lot of films feature children which annoy the audience and make us want to scream in annoyance. In contrast Lipnicki is superb as the funny little kid which makes the audience laugh and smile. It's a brilliant change from so many awkward child performances, and it helps make this film.<br/><br/>Therefore, to summarise, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a brilliant film. With brilliant performances and an excellent script, this film is simply superb. If you've never seen this film, go out now and make the effort. It's well worth it."

The praise for this must be Cameron Crowe, who has written an excellent script full of nice ideas and great lines. The film is loaded with quotable material (from the ""Show Me The Money"" scene to the beautifully poetic ""You complete me"" speech).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives what is possibly his best performance, without really trying, while it is easy to see why Jerry falls for Renee Zellweger's Dorothy. Not only stunningly beautiful, but with the sort of personality that any man would fall for. Cuba Gooding Jr is excellent with his larger-than-life Rod, but the one person who seems to be left out throughout the reviews is Bonnie Hunt as Renee's sister.

","Jerry Maguire is one of my favorite movies, because it's a modern movie with a heart and soul. Not very many modern comedy/drama/romances actually have one, but that is what this movie is all about: relationships. Although there are some cliched moments where it seems like the typical comedy/romance, the romance part actually explores issues about true love, intimacy, marriage, and commitment that most movies are afraid to, even though these are very timely issues. The questions of why we marry, why we are we afraid of commitment and intimacy, and what true love is are all explored by the film, as well as deeper questions about what is important in our lives, through the lives of Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his family, and various other characters throughout the film. In addition to the excellent script however, the acting is also great. Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger are all wonderful, and Bonnie Hunt shines as Laurel, Dorothy's protective older sister. <br/><br/>

The movie not only relayed a message through the dialect and content, but on a more personal level where you could relate in one-way or another, no matter what age.<br/><br/>Whether you're an athlete striving for excellence, single mother trying to get ahead in life, the child of that mother, or even a sports agent, this romantic and funny drama is a movie to be treasured. I definitely recommend, if you liked this movie, that you see 'A Walk in the Clouds' with Keanu Reeves.

He's just one of those actors that has such a commanding and irrepressible screen presence that even if a film is otherwise crap, it's still pretty good as long as he's in it. Witness Cocktail!!<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire however is nowhere near being that heavy piece of luggage that Cruise alone must carry to bring it salvation. It's a strong ensemble piece with accurate insights into the cynicism of the sports world and the soul searching mission of one man who must break free and live free in order to attain redemption from this world. The plot is about Jerry Maguire (Cruise) who thinks the world is his oyster and thinks that everybody loves him until he gets fired for speaking his mind about the need to start caring for his clients. Cruise loses everything except the feisty, seemingly average wide receiver Tidwell(Gooding Jr.) and a loyal employee Dorothy (Zellwegger)who embraces the same ideals as Maguire and accompanies him on this trek of redemption.<br/><br/>I must admit that Jerry Maguire is not an Oscar worthy picture in the cinematic sense; it is as entertaining and oftentimes as moving as anything you may have seen but 5 Oscar nominations raises a few eyebrows. I suppose every year Hollywood needs to recognize a film that lives by the credo 'Everything may seem bad at the outset but there is light at the end of the tunnel and if you are true to yourself you will invariably succeed'. Maguire lives by this credo and audiences consequently loved it because Cruise reigns supreme at the end and as always, we love the guy!<br/><br/>The first 1/2 of the film is particularly insightful and well presented. Cruise feels suffocated by the hypocisy of the world he lives in and needs to escape otherwise his soul will be devoured by the forces around him. We see ugly side of endorsements and promotions, the clash between money and loyalty (in fact there is no clash, money always is the bottom line!!) and greed and backstabbing that lies at the very heart of this world. Jerry Maguire is a metaphor not only resigned to the sports world, but to any competitive environment where only the fittest can survive!! Of course in the real world, the happy endings are few and far between, but what the hell!!! Cruise needs to exert real emotion into his role without tiring the audience. The movie is long and Cruise undergoes significant metamorphosis which will test the audiences patience and endurance. Some may become annoyed by Cruise who puts so much heart into this role that he sometimes completely over-acts and outdoes himself. Others will recognize that Cruise is still a young actor and is still learning, and therefore we should admire him for the committment he's given the role. And he sure is committed!!! He has to play the cold cynic, the ostracized has-been, the real nobody, the loser, the comeback kid, the romantic lover, and ultimately the victor all in one film. This is a tougher task than he may be given credit for.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr, who won the oscar for best supporting actor, is the money-obsessed, second-rate hot head athlete that Maguire must transform in order for him to realize his full potential. Gooding like Cruise plays the chracater with a refershingly endearing streak that does so much to keep the film moving at the proper momentum. At the heart of his character is a man also searching for his identity. We see that he's man who is passionate about his wife and children but lacks heart when it comes to performing. Cruise must help him discover this. The chemistry between the two is explosive; they are together, onboard a ship without a destination. And they must navigate the ship otherwise they will be stuck at sea forever. Their plight is very convincing because we gradually see how fragile the two men are. At the outset we are introduced to two bad-ass contenders but as developments occur, the two men's weaknesses are exposed and they must find the inner strength and power of love to keep them afloat.<br/><br/>Rene Zellwegger is a newcomer who is Cruises partner come love interest. Her charm and the warmth she brings to the screen cannot be ignored. She is vital to the film because she is so integral to the evolution of the central character. She need to be a good actress otherwise Cruise's performance is indirectly affected. If she cannot convince us, then Cruise's job becomes impossible. Gooding and Zellwegger are carrying Cruise on their shoulders. If they are not strong enough to sustain the weight, then the whole thing falls apart like a house of cards. Zellwegger has extra baggage in the form of her son Ray (Lipnicki), a kid with the most incredibly cute, awesome screen presence. It is so powerful that he steals each scene he is in and we are left begging for more from him. Cruise's attachment to the boy is the catalyst to the evolution of his relationship with the mother. As time goes on, we see Cruise marry Zellwegger because he doesn't want to lose the kid and not bacaue he fully loves her. This leads to an eventual painstaking conflict between the married couple who begin to fear that there is no hope for people like them. Cruise asks ""What do you want from me, my soul?"" to which Zellwegger replies ""Why not, I desrve that!"" It is a meaningful and moving scene as the two start to realize their marraige was a mistake. It is a saddening yet ironically identifiable moment. Cruise and Zellwegger are two good people in a world polluted by bad seeds. They should be perfect for one another because they both believe in the same things but the conflicts that surround them are just too apparent. It will take more than that for it to work and Cruise must search the pit of his soul to get it. His body language when he's around her exercises tremendous potential on his part as an actor. He seems so uncomfortable around her, whereas she is so keen to keep him close. It is a conflict that makes the audience feels uncomfortable. Back to Lipnicki,he needs to be convincing enough within limited screen time to turn Cruise's world upside down. And he does thereby intensifying the conflicts that envelop Cruise. Even love makes Cruise more confused. This is a strong ironic touch and we can easily identify with it. What's it's trying to tell us is even the good things in life can be detrimental if you don't fully believe in them. Cruise doesn't believe he can love so the confusion mounts.<br/><br/>Side characters like malicious,venom-spitting rival agent Jay Mohr and ex-fiancee Kelly Preston give sound performances which manifest the horrible face of the environment that Cruise wishes to detach from. Of course their self-interest and killer instincts run counter to Cruise and we really do hate them. This makes Cruises comeback all the more popular with us because we want him to make them look silly. Bonnie Hunt plays Zellwegger's cynical (endearingly cynical) sister who vehemently opposes her sisters relationship because she thinks to know how it's all gonna end. She has been down the road that Gooding, Zellwegger, and Cruise are experiencing now and she fears it will all end in heartbreak. She is a very good actress with good screen presence and has always proved invaluable to the films she starred in.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this film and although we don't get to see exceptional cinematography, his job proves very successful. The film could have been a flop had the cast been different. I say this because there are bits that go on for too long. It seems that Crowe knows where the film should have been cut but seems to have been more content to work the stretch and exhaust the audience with superfluous dialogue and scenes. His intention was to get maximum emotional effect from the audience but we often teeter on impatience and frustration. This does not ruin the film; the actors are so likeable that we are happy to bear the occasional superfluousness. Crowe, who also directed Singles, apparently considers himself a paragon in the field of relationships and he gets the thumbs up. The sentimental value is preserved throughout despite moments of cheesniness. Then again what realtionship film doesn't suffer from this????<br/><br/>The soundtrack was much lamented but I think that the tracks from Aimee Mann, Springsteen, and Ricki Lee Jones are excellent and complement the various emotional facets of the film.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is such an easy traget for bashing and I'm sure it's received it's fair share. But I cannot go down that road. I cannot be that cynical or else I would be in danger of having the world aroung me envelop and suffocate me. I am quick to cite the films shortcomings but I still loved it. Tom Cruise isn't the world's highest paid actor for no reason. He alone can make the film more than watchable but in this case he profits from an outstanding supporting cast that makes the job all the more easy."

","I have a theory. Romance movies tell people more about themselves than any other type of film. This film touched me. I was more deeply moved by this films sincerity than by all of ""Titanic's"" sap. The film is a story of a man who finds himself in the middle of his life is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. A man who was self aware enough to stop himself on the road to fruitless life soon enough to turn around and straighten his life out. <br/><br/>It was a touching character study of two men of completely different backgrounds who go through a series of events that change them for the better. This movie was inspiring. It's never to late to fix your life. The best films are the ones that motivate, inspire, or show you things about yourself that you would've otherwise overlooked. This film is amazing. Great script, great performances... great music too. See this movie and be moved."
"homeboy-5","10","2","6","2 December 1999"," An incredible journey
","Jerry McGuire is an incredible journey of a man finally growing up and confronting his inner demon.  This movie rips your heart out if you have ever had a relationship at that level before.  Never has Tom Cruise been so true to his character as in this movie.  Jerry McGuire was alive in this movie with real depth and real feelings.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing.  Rating: 10"
"Maverick-63","10","2","6","18 August 1999"," One of my favorite movies ever
","Jerry Maguire is one of my personal favorite films. Cameron Crowe's wonderful script and direction is full of nuances and subtleties that reward repeat viewings, and indeed gets better with each viewing.<br/><br/>Each scene of Jerry Maguire is so ""perfect"" that it looks like  Cameron Crowe went to the kinds of lengths Stanley Kubrick did on that other Tom Cruise vehicle, the (awful) film Eyes Wide Shut. Of course Crowe did not try to achieve that kind of perfectionism, which leads me to believe his vision and talent were just so strong that he did not need to--he achieved as close to ""perfection"" as possible anyway.<br/><br/>Never has a role been more suited to Tom Cruise. And one realizes just how good Renee Zelwegger is when viewing her other performances (which are so utterly different from Dorothy Boyd), and seeing how she truly inhabits the character (I was convinced that Renee Z. was not ""acting"" and simply ""was"" a Dorothy Boyd-like character until I saw her other (mostly bitchy) prior roles).<br/><br/>I cannot give enough praise to Cameron Crowe's script. Jerry Maguire is such a true-to-life, three-dimensional character. I love that he does not always say the right thing. I have always found it slightly annoying that in big dramatic scenes, the main character always has the ""perfect"" line, retort, etc., whereas in real life we all know this rarely if ever happens. I love that Cameron did not give Jerry all the perfect dialogue--he fumbles and babbles, which for me kept him quite believable. (Until his ""You complete me"" line anyway.) God knows if this film had been written by the typical big-budget Hollywood ""team"" of writers, there would be no truly memorable lines like ""you complete me"" and ""show me the money"".<br/><br/>I love the Dicky Fox scenes dispersed throughout the main storyline. I wish the DVD version had indexed those scenes, because they are priceless.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is wonderful. Regina King is perfect (as always). Bonny Hunt as the older sister Laurel is delightful. Kelly Preston and Jay Mohr are brilliant and pitch perfect. And Cuba got an Oscar so nuff said there.<br/><br/>This is that rare Hollywood film with a unique artistic voice, and I greatly look forward to the next Cameron Crowe film."
"Enoch-3","Null","2","6","1 October 1998"," Absolutely fabulous!
","This is one of those rare movies that you can see over and over again without getting tired of it. Cameron Crowe has come up with something warm, humourous and touching, which I'm sure inspires every viewer on one level or another, if not more than one.<br/><br/>Without doubt this is the wittiest movie I have ever seen. It is so beautifully written, and some of the subtle touches are indescribable. You just think about it afterwards and marvel at it.<br/><br/>The performances are faultless. Tom Cruise is just marvellous, while Cuba Gooding Jr. is personality all the way. Renee Zellweger is an absolute revelation - I'm sure you'll see more of her undoubted talents in the future. And I think mention also to Bonnie Hunt and Jay Mohr - their characters were not easy to portray but both brought them out very clearly. But I have to say my favourite actor in the film is Jonathan Lipnicki as Ray Boyd, the little kid. This kid's a talent.<br/><br/>""The human head weighs eight pounds!"" Enough said. 9 out of 10."

I never got a little teary eyed when Cuba Hugs Tom. I really think this is a film with a purpose. To teach us about real feelings, and how they are more important than any comission or money."
"Chris-463","Null","2","6","14 April 1999"," A Great Movie
","Is there a movie that captures the 1990's better than writer-director Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire""? There might be, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing it better than this tale of a cynical, money-driven sports agent who abandons his high lifestyle to find refuge with a single mom and an enthusiastic client. It's a riches-to-rags story where the hero finds redemption, and it's wonderful. ""Jerry Maguire"" is everything a modern romantic comedy should be: smart, funny, character-driven, and incisive. Crowe occasionally allows his movie to drag a bit (It clocks in at just under two and a half hours)but his characters are so interesting and human, and their predicaments so vital and involving, that the movie's extended running time is hardly anything to complain about. Tom Cruise has never been better in a movie. He deserved his Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of the title character, who goes from greedy and shallow to warm and human. The charisma and confidence that have always served Cruise so well in his career are put to great use in the movie's very funny first half. Cruise really does something special in the second half of the film, however: He lets his guard down and allows Jerry's emotions to shine through. Cuba Gooding, Jr. won the Supporting Actor Oscar for his work as Rod Tidwell, Jerry's lone client after he leaves his sports agency. Gooding, Jr.'s performance is uniformily hilarious and perfectly over-the-top, but he never strays from showing Rod's human side, which is expressed through the character's love of his family. The other great performance in the film (and one that was sadly overlooked by Oscar) is Renee Zellweger's as Dorothy Boyd, the warmhearted assistant and single mom that Jerry falls for. The actress is a constant delight, lovable and energetic. But her character is not simply a sappy romantic foil for Jerry; She's an intelligent and perceptive woman who ultimately makes Jerry earn her love. The supporting roles in Crowe's film are also written with remarkable complexity and the actors portraying them all give terrific performances. Bonnie Hunt is tenderly funny as Dorothy's skeptical sister; Regina King is wonderfully spirited as Rod's loving wife; Kelly Preston is refreshingly ruthless as Jerry's coldhearted fiancee; Jay Mohr is enjoyably sleazy as Jerry's underhanded nemesis; Jerry O'Connell and Beau Bridges make a nicely believable future football star and his father, respectively. The real scene-stealer in this remarkable bunch, however, is young Jonathan Lipnicki, who is adorable and hysterical as Dorothy's son. This is a great movie. Crowe writes and directs moments of perfect tenderness that never become cloying or manipulative and he also has a knack for creating scenes of pure joy. Included throughout the film are monologues from Jerry's mentor, Dicky Fox, that allude to the film's overall themes. They are completely random and completely perfect and they show that Crowe (who also directed 1992's ""Singles"" and 1989's ""Say Anything..."") has not lost his sense of quirkiness. In fact, Crowe hasn't lost anything with this one. ""Jerry Maguire"" is a winner in every sense, a movie that overflows with intelligence, humor, romance, and enormously engaging characters. It's a perfect movie for its era, one of the decade's best comedies, and a glowing example that even a business as cynical and jaded as Hollywood can occasionally still do things right."
"Jaime N. Christley","Null","2","6","5 April 1999"," Bliss
","I've seen over 1,600 films in my life.  This one was the most fun.<br/><br/>Everything was just right:  acting, photography, music, writing.  Forget all that, though.  ""Jerry Maguire"" glowed, and emanated warmth and laughter. It's a terrific satire of the unknown industry of sports agents and sports marketing.  Many classic (and I try not to use that word) scenes abound:  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s first phone conversation with Cruise; the entire first date between Cruise and Renee Zellweger; the eight-year old Lipnicki whose precociousness is for once appropriate and not annoying; the climactic football game and the reactions of peripheral characters.  The Academy Awards screwed up again in 1996, snubbing this film for its Screenplay (I'll be honest--fun aside, ""Fargo"" should have gotten Picture and Director) and for Cruise's dynamic performance."
"jj-81","10","2","6","23 February 1999"," a great mix of everything
","Tom Cruise gives his best performance to date as Jerry Maguire. For the first time he didn't play a character who was cocky.  He was totally vulnerable. Cuba Gooding Jr. gave one of my favorite performances as a mediocre football player that is full of love for his family, and that is nice to see.  He did deserve his Oscar and all the success he has been having.<br/><br/>This has a beautiful mix of drama, romance and comedy. A must see. My grade: A-"

","Jerry Maguire stars Tom Cruise in an academy award nominated performance. And the nomination should have turned out a win for Cruise because he was terrific in this movie. Cruise is Maguire, a sports agent who loses his job. He scrambles to get a client and gets the worser of the possibillities, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr., in an academy award WINNING performance and rightfully so). Rod makes things more complicated for Jerry, but he motivates Jerry more than he frustrates him. And all through his world of complicity, Jerry Maguire meets a beautiful office worker and her adorable and charming son, and the two fancy a love interest with each other. Lest we forget that world famous saying, ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!!"", which was created in this movie. That's a real funny scene with ""show me the money"" and the whole film overall is great. It's romantic, it's dramatic, and it sure is funny! All the performances were nearly flawless; great movie 8.9/10"

The plot is good and interesting, it touches some of the problems of the rich society, the difficulties to get through and the need to have someone who will popularize your person, no matter if you are not the best singer, the best sport man or scientist, the problem is to create good fame to start the game. Here, obviously the promoter plays an important role and Cruise (Maguire) tried to show what he did, how he was disappointed and how he overcame his crisis."

"HelenMary","6","1","2","15 January 2013"," a good sports agent movie with some schmaltz
","I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles.<br/><br/>Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles."

","The film is of the same type as many films. This is a good film but there have been so many like this and to me it did not offer anything new. I know this was nicely acted and crisply directed one, but maybe there was too much uncertainty every time. I still could not get the theme of the film. To me in the starting it seemed to be a struggle story and then diverted to romance. And frankly I think they might not have handled any one of them properly. Tom cruise shows superb acting in this one also. If they would have shown either of the struggle or romance maybe it would have been better.<br/><br/>""Watch at your own risk."""

","Jerry Maguire is a movie about a sports agent who tries to go it alone by injecting heart into his relationship with his clients. To do this he needs fewer clients. His employer complies by firing him for his 'subversive' ideas. The title character, played by Tom Cruise, is not the most sympathetic of guys, and Cruise does not seem to know how to play him. He alternates from sentimental calm to over the top wild.<br/><br/>Cruise's remaining client, a footballer played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., is an unlikeable and also over the top character. Gooding, Jr. plays him as a greed-driven, wild and noisy moron-jock. Gooding, Jr. is actually quite repulsive here, extremely annoying when on the screen (Oscar for what?).<br/><br/>I am not a football fan (don't even understand it), so the scenes of the game were no boost for me. I do know enough to notice that Gooding, Jr. seems way too small to play a pro. <br/><br/>It is hard to understand what this story is about, and the movie does nothing to clue us in. I found Jerry Maguire to be marginally entertaining, mostly due to Renee Zellweger and a host of cameos by the likes of Beau Bridges, Eric Stoltz, etc. JM is worth a look on a rainy Sunday afternoon when there is nothing better available and no game on."

","In 1996, ""Jerry McGuire"" proved itself as a breakthrough film for many of its cast and crew. It earned many awards, including five Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Tom Cruise),...), winning two (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Cuba Gooding Jr.)). Therefore, this film proved the true potential in several of its cast members, namely Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., and producer, director, and writer Cameron Crowe (2000's ""Almost Famous"", 2005's ""Elizabethtown""). Though some had previously stretched themselves as artists occasionally, this film earned them newfound respect like never before. ""Jerry McGuire"" follows a greedy workaholic sports agent who suddenly loses his job. This begins his path of soul searching, which teaches him many life lessons, namely his true love. When Dorothy enters his life, he realized the true worth of money is much less than the finer things in life which are free. Meanwhile, he begins his own agency. Only few of his clients follow him. All except one, Ray, maintain this relationship with Jerry. This becomes closer than ever as Jerry struggles to help him find his place in football and later, of purpose. These series of story lines create an eyeopening masterpiece that leads to a powerful and unforgettable conclusion. Cameron Crowe begins his series of masterpieces with this film. He proves in this film that he is one of the finest filmmakers of today. He takes a creative, unique story and adds great substance in its events. These written words often find some humorous scenes that maintains its dramatic theme unbelievably. This shows that films don't need a large budget to attract audiences or to be amazing. As with his following films, he never rushes any of his projects. He assures himself that they are full quality, and that every storyline fit one another. In particular, ""Jerry McGuire"" adds some clever quotes that make this film for added viewing pleasure including ""you had me at hello"", ""you complete me"", ""did you know that a human head weighs eight pounds"", and the most prominent ""show me the money"". This undistinguishable writing style proves that sometimes, the most unexpected becomes the highlight. This roller coaster film could not be as enjoyable if it wasn't for the brilliant performances, namely but not limiting Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. They give their characters the unforgettable presence that may be close to impossible to most other actors. Cruise offers his signature acting style to new extremes to the main character Jerry McGuire. Zellweger's more emotional performances gives greater strength to the film's dramatic and romantic value. Gooding offers the more eccentric theme that often gives the famous film quotes new meaning. Such film quality proves that ""Jerry McGuire"" has and always will stand the test of time. This will surely please a variety of audiences, the more dramatic and the more comedic. It has proved its capabilities as a future film classic."

","Jerry Maguire is one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie stars Tom Cruise, Renee Zellwegger, and Cuba Gooding Jr in one of their best performances on screen. Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent who one night realizes that he is ashamed of his life, and types a mission statement about the future of the company he works for. That mission statement gets him fired, and changes his life forever. Dorothy Boyd is a single mother, who is an accountant for the company. When Jerry gets fired, she leaves the job with him. After Jerry gets fired, he is only left with one client. This clients name is Ron Tidwell. Dorothy and Ron make Jerry a better person. This movie provided many touching moments, and had a lot of laughs. This movie basically kicked off Zellwegger's career, and it is a movie which in my book is a must see."
"hernan_amado","Null","2","8","14 June 2002"," ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!
","Having seen this. I can honestly say it has certainly been my misfortune getting to see this stale movie. I say `stale' because the movie itself doesn't teach us anything at all. What do we learn about this movie after its ending? Do we learn that love for a `ridiculous football game' is everything in life? This movie is centered on a football game, which makes most people who like this movie fool themselves and enjoy Mr. Cruise's and Cuba Gooding's failed performances without realizing how bad and shallow they are. The plot of this movie is certainly flawed because of the uninteresting language used throughout the movie and lack of qualities to make us enjoy this. The people who don't like it, including myself lose interest after it begins; the story is so uninteresting and simple, since it's only about a football game and a love story, which make us uncomfortable every minute in the course of this movie.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe did his best to bring us one of the most ridiculous and over-rated movies ever made. I'm not ashamed to say that ""Jerry Maguire"" is one the worst movies I have ever seen. I know what I say. I have seen lots of bad movies. No offense, but if I think carefully I'd be pretty sure it's probably worse, since it's extremely over-rated and unpleasantly acted. One of the reasons why it's that way, is that many reviewers surprisingly gave it a good score and the Academy had the nerve to give it about 5 Oscar nominations, unfortunately including both best performance by an actor in a leading role and best performance by an actor in a supporting role. Added to that, best screenplay, best picture, etc (I don't want to remember all the nominations it received, since it makes me sick) how could the Academy give an Oscar to Cuba Gooding for best supporting actor? Could they not see how shallow and overdramatic it was? He thinks he's an excellent actor and that his performance in this mess was fascinating, but it wasn't at all. It seemed to me that he overacted too much, whenever he cried, he did it in a so fictitious way, that instead of making me feel what his character was supposed to feel, he made me laugh at his `supposed' wistful feelings, which obviously he didn't make moving at all. If you want to see an amazing and moving performance, watch Martin Donovan's performance in `The Portrait of a Lady', who should have won the academy award for best supporting actor in 1996, but sadly he didn't even get a nomination. He portrays the main character's sickly cousin and he does it amazingly, look at his facial expressions, the way he coughed truly made me think he was dying. I don't understand why the Academy couldn't see his riveting performance and instead of seeing it, gave a nod to Cuba's failed performance, who felt the king of the world when he won it. Perhaps he thought that showing himself naked in `Jerry Maguire' could give him the coveted statuette, painfully he was right! Anyway I don't dislike him, I'm just saying that his performance in this movie wasn't that great to be an academy award winner. He gave a better performance in `Men of Honor'; I'd have enjoyed seeing him win an Oscar for this performance instead of wining it in this mess of movie.<br/><br/>
What a shame! It's the worst best picture nominee ever! At least other very bad movies I've seen, haven't been nominated for best movie, which makes me a little bit glad. Anyway my concern is how it could receive about 6 nods for academy awards. There were amazing movies in 1996 like `The Portrait of a Lady' and `The Crucible', which should have been nominated for best picture, but they grievously didn't. How could this? At least they both received two Oscar nominations, which are something to be proud of, no nominations would be worse. I always ask myself: How could The Academy think that this ridiculous and sappy movie could have been better than `The Portrait of a Lady' released in the same year? How could Jane Campion's masterpiece be under-rated? How could it get academy award nominations for best screenplay and best picture? The plot of Jerry Maguire is horribly made and not recommendable at all. This is not what movies should be like! This movie should have shown a subtle or a different dialogue, which would have made it worth watching, but the dialogue in this movie is boring, bothersome, slow, pretentious, isn't it?? The whole movie was about Jerry Maguire's lovers and an uninteresting football game. Every character in this movie is so annoying because they only talk about this game. Seriously all they do is to talk about this.<br/><br/>Let's analyze Mr. Cruise's performance, if you see it closely, you'll find out that he gives a very disappointing performance, since he doesn't care what the viewers think of him, look at his expressions, he thinks he's interesting and funny, but he isn't, instead he's annoying and his shallow performance is totally obvious. No offense, but he needs to be taught by his beautiful ex wife Nicole Kidman who gave a pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in `The portrait of a lady' as well as her magnificent co-star Barbara Hershey. He doesn't really make his performance plausible because every word he says in this movie seems to be a lie, it seems like he memorized the whole script without thinking about the deepness of his character. For instance we see that he tries to help Gooding's character, but he helps him without feeling the character himself. He only talks to everybody without interest and the deepness that his character probably requires. I don't have anything against Mr. Cruise; however I don't think it's one of his best performances to date. I'm sure he was better in `Magnolia', which also earned him an Oscar nomination and a golden globe. I was just shocked to see him getting an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role for this movie. I have seen some of Tom Cruise's movies and I think some of them are fairly good; nevertheless, they weren't as horrible as this one. I think Tom Cruise is a good actor, but as a leading actor in this movie, Mr. Cruise leaves too much to be desired!<br/><br/>I don't really like comedy romantic movies like this one. It only shows how a man quits his job and falls in love. This plot makes me consider it so romantic, pointless, sappy and extremely ridiculous; All the scenes in `Jerry Maguire' aren't worth watching, they only show love for an insipid football game and love for uninteresting people like Renne Zellweger who hopefully gave a better performance in `Bridget Jones's Diary'. She thinks she's so tender and sweet in this movie, probably she is in real life, but to me her character in this movie only makes me somewhat upset, because it is annoying since she's only led by Jerry Maguire to carry out a gushy love story. It's very sad that it got so many accolades. The accolades that many interesting and under-rated movies should have got in 1996.<br/><br/>It's worth watching if you like mediocre, romantic and comedy movies. I bet you'll not regret it. Otherwise don't watch it, because it's highly unlike you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>Overall, TWO THUMBS DOWN!! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has truly been simple, uninteresting and gushy. I respect Cameron Crowe as a director, I know he's a distinguished filmmaker, but I have to say that `Almost Famous' and `Jerry Maguire' are indeed over-rated and so pointless that don't make me excited about seeing his further movies.<br/><br/>It's a sorrow that many people loved it. You should try seeing powerful and interesting stories that do teach us something for our lives, not like `Jerry Maguire' that fooled lots of people and especially the Academy with its fake charming, didn't it? I hope nobody is offended by the possible objectionable content of my review. I just needed to say what I felt about this horrible movie; by the way I'm rather glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is a horrible romantic movie, some of my friends disliked it as much as I did, and I could see why. 2/10"

","this movie rocks. i first saw it when i was maybe 12, and i liked it, but didn't really get it. i am now 17 and have seen it about 3 times in the past month. it is amazing. it has everything a movie could want. it has comedy, Cuba's character is pretty funny and sarcastic, it has unintentional comedy just because it is tom cruise and he is clinically insane so it is funny, and the fact that it is the only movie where Renee Zelwegger didn't gain 50 lbs to perform, which makes it a classic in its own right. how can you argue with a movie where they feature a line about ""shoplifting pootie""? in addition to the comedy it is also an incredibly sweet movie with a seemingly doomed relationship struggles through hardship to eventually succeed, and who doesn't like a good success story? (it happens twice, the relationship and the business succeed)it also has some awesome cameos: Mel Kiper Jr, troy Aikman, Al Michaels, and of course Jay Mohr in his typical jerk character. just to get a sense of how good it is, i put it on at 3:30 in the morning with my friend the other day, because we simply needed to watch it. anyone who says cruise doesn't put on a good performance is a gosh darn liar, and i would be willing to bet their pants are on fire."

","Jerry Maguire(Tom Cruise) is a talented sports agent who has a breakthrough one night in a hotel one night. The idea Jerry wanted to get across was ""Fewer clients, Less money"". He gave the 25 page mission statement out the every worker at SMI where he worked, eventually getting him fired and replaced by his friend Bob Sugar(Jay Mohr) who takes almost every client from Jerry behind his back. After causing a large scene in the office, Jerry offers the idea that anyone can come with him and start a new company. Dorothy Boyd(Renee Zellweger), an acquaintance who admire Jerry very much, was the only one who went with him.<br/><br/>After the scene, Jerry's two clients were narrowed down to one and his fiancé(Kelly Preston) left him because he was a ""loser"". Jerry must take his one client, Rod Tidwell(Cuba Gooding Jr.), to the top, finding love with Dorothy on the way.<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe does a remarkable job and the movie touches anyone that watches it. The acting is incredible but I don't just mean Tom Cruise. The supporting cast is the best that I have ever seen. Renee Zellweger was great and Cuba Gooding Jr. was made for the role as the bickering, unsatisfied, Rod Tidwell. The writing in the movie was brilliant and included some very well known movie quotes such as: ""Show me the money"", ""Help me, Help you"", and ""Shut up, you had me at hello"". Overall, the movie was very well done and is a personal favorite.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

The film is basically about a successful sports agent who has a crisis of consciousness as the movie begins. He pens a moving memo but is fired by the seniors because of it, which leads him to start his own sports agency with just one star- a not so great throwback played sumptuously by Cuba Gooding Jr. For anyone who has forgotten the feelings that a wonderful movie can trigger, Jerry Maguire provides a welcome reminder.

"imdbbl","Null","1","3","9 December 2009"," Somewhat silly but still entertaining
","Contains one minor spoiler: Jerry Maguire it's one of those classics that people talk about and remember for years. However when the film came out, I was only 6, so I watched it for the first time today. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), is a very successful sports agent. His job requires him to constantly manipulate,lie and deceive and he's great at it. But one day, Jerry starts to have second thoughts about the nature of the job, he starts to question himself and ultimately grows a conscience. He proceeds to write a ""mission statement"" suggesting a change of behavior and alternatives to the current methods being used by agents, and because of it, he gets fired. Only one client stays with Jerry, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), an egomaniacal football player. Meanwhile Jerry starts a relationship with Doroty (Renée Zellweger), a 26 year old single-mother who worked at his agency but decided to quit and help Jerry because she was inspired by the mission statement and also because she has a crush on him. Now Jerry has to balance his personal life and help his only client reach success... Jerry Maguire it's a good film, entertaining and somewhat engaging, however it does gets a bit touchy-feely and corny at times. The writing has some inconsistencies, for instance; Jerry marries Dorothy, basically because he doesn't know how/want to be alone. Later on, he starts to question the marriage and his feelings, only to come to the conclusion( after a quick break up) that he does love her. It's just not very good writing, if you ask me. Having said that, Tom Cruise carries the film on his back and delivers a tremendous performance. Now that I'm seeing his ""old"" films, no wonder he went on to become such a movie star. He has tons of charisma and it shows on screen. Cuba Gooding Jr was great and very funny as Tidwell, Jerry's only client, but, although he did won one, it's far from being an Oscar-worthy performance. Renée Zellweger was OK and so was the rest of the supporting cast. All in all, Jerry Maguire is not great, but it's still a good time. The film is also known for some lines that have become extremely famous and its funny too see how it all began. Watch it for Cruise's performance and for its classic status.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I just saw Jerry Maguire again for the first time since I saw it on the big screen back in 96.  What a great flick!  It was even better than I remembered it.  What struck me was how great the three leads were: Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger.  Cruise has history.  There was no way that he'd be defined by Maguire, but the other two were more newcomers -- at least to me. I can remember saying: watch Gooding and Zellweger, they're going places! But they never did.  Not on to level I expected.  Is it possible that Jerry Maguire set the bar so high for these two young actors that they could never again meet the audience's expectations? <br/><br/>This seems to be a problem for Zellweger in particular.  I thought Nurse Betty was a fine movie.  Bridget Jones less so.  But they were both disappointing because Zellweger could not raise her performance to the level she did in Jerry Maguire.  Same story with Cuba Gooding.

","JERRY MAGUIRE is genius! Proof that with the right direction, writing, and acting, a film can be exceptional no matter how untested it's subject matter might be. Who'd have thought a film about a sports agent and his early mid-life crisis of conscience would be such a watchable, enjoyable flick? Not me! The anchor of this wondrous film is none other than Mr. Tom Cruise, who of course plays the title role. This is arguably the best work that Cruise has ever done. He makes you believe that he truly is this man who has had up to this point has lived a very fun, yet unfulfilling existence. The key to this crisis is that Jerry is himself unsure about what the future holds for him, but he takes the risk of going out there and regenerating himself and focusing not on what is profitable, but what is right. Rightfully so, Cruise was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy for this film, and flat out should have won! In retrospect, it shouldn't have even been a question.<br/><br/>Cruise gets magnificent support from newcomer Renee Zellweger (who plays Dorothy Boyd and who should have been nominated for Supporting Actress), Bonnie Hunt (Dorothy's sister Laurel, who I wouldn't have minded getting a nom also!), and Cuba Gooding, Jr. (who actually won Best Supporting Actor as Jerry's sole client NFL wide receiver Rod Tidwell). Special mention should go to Jonathan Lipnicki (as Dorothy's son Ray). Regina King is also wonderful as Rod's wife, Jay Mohr as Jerry's rival agent Bob Sugar, and Kelly Preston as Jerry's girlfriend early in the film.<br/><br/>Dorothy worked at the big firm that Jerry was fired from after his crisis and leaves with him to start his own agency. A very uneasy and uncertain relationship forms and it seems more like a business partnership than anything. Then Jerry forms a special bond with Ray and he wants an instant family, even though it appears he is not in love with Dorothy. Jerry and Rod have an uneasy alliance also as Rod thinks Jerry is only interested in using him as a tool to jumpstart his new business and nothing else. In the end, the respective pairings form unbreakable bonds with each other. In particular, Jerry's revelation that he is in love with Dorothy, not just idea of stability and family, is memorable.<br/><br/>The brilliance of JERRY MAGUIRE is that it dares to talk and discuss things that people take for granted all the time (dating, relationships, family, raising children, friendship). It treats all of this as the most serious of things. Characters actually question Jerry's motives and refuse to let him off the hook (and vice versa!). Dorothy and Rod see in Jerry things that no one else ever saw to, or cared to, see in him. In doing so, the payoff in the end makes you realize why it focused on all of this. Directed by the great Cameron Crowe (who also did SAY ANYTHING and ALMOST FAMOUS), JERRY MAGUIRE is one in a million!"

","After seeing this film several years ago, I can see why it touched so many hearts, and is known to be one of Tom Cruise's best films. Cruise plays mild-hearted Jerry Maguire, a sports agent, while Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd, his opposite, the woman he falls in love with, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Rod Tidwell, the only sports star that Jerry has to manage, at least for now.<br/><br/>As time goes on, Jerry begins to love hanging out with Dorothy's son, played by Jonathan Lipnicki. Then, he decides to marry Dorothy, only to discover how much he really loves her. He becomes best friends with Rod, who tries relentlessly to help Jerry find a real meaning to life, and not just the money.<br/><br/>When Dorothy decides it is time to leave Jerry, he comes home early to surprise her and sweep her off her feet. The two reconcile, and all is right. Rod and his wife have a new baby, and after a near injury in football, he continues to play, with Jerry as his agent.<br/><br/>The film is both beautifully written and directed by Cameron Crowe. The music we hear, including the song ""Secret Garden"" are from Academy Award winner(for ""Philadelphia"") Bruce Springsteen.<br/><br/>This film fairs well enough with me to receive 9 out of 10."

","I just finished my forth viewing of the movie and in one thing I disagree with some of the reviewers is that t gets better with every viewing. I think when it comes to ""Jerry Maguire"" the best experience you get from the first time, but nevertheless this is one of the sweetest, most adorable movies I've ever seen in my life. Beautiful film.<br/><br/>This is movie about transformation, about finding yourself in this ""cynical world"" with ""though competitors"" in every aspect of our lives. Competition. The survival of the fittest. It's a movie about true values, about friendship or maybe loyalty, money, being able to sleep at night, enjoying what you are doing, it's movie about learning what really matters, it's about being happy. Actually this is a movie about love. I found it. It is about living out onefs life with the one who makes you say: ""I love you. You... complete me"".   The casting was great. Renee Zellweger was the hearth of the movie. This film made her a star but unfortunately there hasn't been much from her ever since. Cuba Gooding Jr. deserves his Oscar for supporting role and Regina King as his wife was perfect. And of course this is Tom Cruise's movie, top to bottom, though I don't think that this is his best performance. My favorite one is in ""Interview with the Vampire"".<br/><br/>Cameron Crowe the music critic-turned-director, the creator of this film. That's why the music in each of his movies fits so right. Really looking forward for his next movie after ""Vanilla Sky"". He is the man. <br/><br/>I donft think that you can go wrong with this movie. I haven't read a bad review so far. Just sit back and enjoy it. This is what Hollywood is (should be) all about."
"Silverzero","Null","1","4","16 May 2003"," `Feel-good' comedy drama, best for it's brilliant performances.
","`Show me the money'. Cameron Crowe's breakout debut is good to say the least. `Jerry Maguire' is a soft-centred, romanticised and rather enjoyable character study of the struggle to return to the top. There's plenty of memorable dialogue along with a biting verbal. It's proud, if not boastful of its sometimes-arrogant style. It works best in its more comedic and satirical moments. <br/><br/>The movie opens brilliantly and energetically and draws some modest laughs. However, this unique style is completely abandoned after the first 80 or so minutes and it gradually settles in familiar territory with lightly sentimental drama. The latter plunge isn't a huge mistake. It holds your interest and keeps the same pace, but isn't as good as the poignant first half.  <br/><br/>The performances are what keeps this film alive and kicking. In an Oscar nominated turn, Tom Cruise loses the ego in one of his best roles to date. He is well suited to the title part and proves to his critics that he's more than just a shallow Hollywood star. Cuba Gooding Jnr. is ecstatic as the egotistical self-worshipping sports star. Renee Zellwegger perfectly balances comedy and drama in a breakthrough role that was done brilliantly. The three leads were enough to hold the film in its place but there's some good (if not irrelevant) support from the likes of Kelly Preston, Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Bonnie Hunt and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Eric Stoltz. <br/><br/>The script is also very sharp and imaginative and the finished product is better than the sum of its parts. There are some neat touches such as a man-eating divorced women's group and a male jazz obsessed child technician (male nanny). It builds up (perhaps too much) momentum and doesn't know what to do with it so gradually turns into a `too serious' drama at the halfway mark. This is a shame because had it not been for this, then I think it would have lived up to the entirety of its hype. <br/><br/>Still though, `Jerry Maguire' is an intentionally inflated, but very enjoyable and very good for what it's worth. My IMDb rating: 6.8/10."

He has a delicious Kelly Preston as his fiance,the respect of his peers, success and ties with the sports world. What he doesnt have is the relationships with the people that he wants to. He is wants so much more but cant express it. So he types up a memo for his agency addressing the goals that he wants and how everything could be better run. He is fired and his dignity is shred. The only remaining client he has is a hyped up Cuba Gooding Jr. who he promises will get the cash money that he wants. Rene Zellweger plays his secretary who believes in him and left her other job for him. Jerry's fiance leaves him and eventually he falls for Rene. The ending is sappy and predictable but you got to hand it to Cameron Crowe for making it durable. Strong performances by everyone. Jerry cantrell rocks out in a small role.<br/><br/>*** 1/2"

Tom Cruise's character, Jerry Maguire, had a personal epiphany. He paid a huge price for it....but gained everything back, and more, because of his innate integrity.<br/><br/>His character both learned lessons and taught lessons, as did Cuba Gooding's Oscar winning character, Rod Tidwell.  Jerry and Rod needed each other for opposite reasons, and their respective mates (Renee Zellweger and Regina King) played enormous roles in both men's individual awakening to the big picture.  I left the film believing they were such transcendent forces in one anothers' lives that they'd all be friends forever and a day.

"Howlin Wolf","10","1","5","30 March 2001"," An immensely likable movie. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","The reason this film succeeds despite initially appearing to have a poor premise is its fantastic writing. The characters at once seem like real people we can identify with, but not so mundanely 'real' that they forget to say something funny now and again. The dialogue is by and large NOT full of banal observations about the economic state of the sports industry, because Crowe wisely realises that the crowd who go to see romantic comedies will most likely not care about that aspect. What they WILL care about is mostly sympathetic characters, a believable central romance and an ounce of chemistry between the two leads. Crowe and his performers ensure that they get all that, and at times unexpectedly more too...<br/><br/>The film does occasionally lapse into sentimentality with the whole 'play with your heart, not for the paycheck' thing, but this is offset nicely by the charm of the leading players and Maguire's acknowledgement at the beginning that his 'rebirth' will sound ""somewhat 'touchy-feely'..."" The supporting characters are all so skillfully drawn too, that even if the central relationship doesn't quite work for you, you're sure to find something of interest in the more minor characters. A particular standout here is Jay Mohr as the slimy agent ""Bob Sugar"". He shows real talent here and it's a great surprise (possibly down to poor script choices) to see that he's still woefully underused by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Whilst Cuba Gooding Jr is fine here, I still cannot believe he won an Oscar for his performance, as he doesn't come anywhere near matching the other talent on show. I'm not saying that Cruise should have won an Oscar, but I could have understood that a whole lot more...<br/><br/>Great soundtrack too. You can tell as much care has gone into the composition of that as has the rest of the movie. A rare thing in today's market, that's filled with horrendous ""Music inspired by.."" rip-offs.<br/><br/>(At the time of writing... ) this is STILL the only Cameron Crowe film I've seen. Judging by the mostly glowing reviews heaped upon his other works, it seems safe to say that Jerry Maguire isn't merely a lucky one-off for this director. The film really is delightfully enjoyable to watch."

Tom Cruise tones down the overacting for once, and Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Jonathan Lipnicki are all as charming as they come.<br/><br/>But that said, the movie is hardly the cinematic masterpiece it's been made out to be.  It certainly has a fair amount of substance in its treatment of the theme of moral growth, but it's nothing to write home about technically, and, while it may be cute, the plot in general is nothing we haven't seen before and doesn't offer any real ingenuity.<br/><br/>But it is certainly worth spending a couple of dollars, since it is a particularly good example of its genre and has a genuine feel-good quality. Just don't expect anything too exceptional."

","JERRY MAGUIRE, in my opinion, is one of the most charming, romantic, hilarious, and enchanting comedies about having the courage to express yourself I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) decided to stick by Jerry (Tom Cruise) after he got fired. In addition, when he got dumped by Avery (Kelly Preston), my emotions were mixed. I'm sure yours will be, too. I laughed really hard when Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Jerry yelled, ""Show me the money!"" Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Kudos to Cameron Crowe and everyone involved for a job well done."" Now, in conclusion, if you are a Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., or Renee Zellweger, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it"

","This movie seems to be a mix of many different genres (comedy, romance, drama, sports, money) and we can see as to why it is such loved. But as a film, it is actually quite pretentious, and overly long and sappy. The sports angle starts off as intriguing but once the romance and love story come in, it takes away from the excitement, and becomes a predictable rom-com.<br/><br/>The performance from Tom Cruise is him playing his essential character, lovable guy but also a slick ""all about me"" type. He's the lead and who we are supposed to root for. Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar for his role but was playing a more over the top athlete type, and came across as annoying- yet people love his character and performance for how ""authentic"" it is. And Renee Zellweger is the love interest but happens to be a rather weak and uninteresting character. Also her son is one of the more annoying and corny characters in the film.<br/><br/>People love this film for its famous catchphrases (""Show me the money!"", ""You complete me"", ""You had me at hello"") and it has a nostalgic feel.<br/><br/>It seems that Cameron Crowe desperately tried making a film to ponder to many different demographics, and seeing its box office resume and the fact it won or was nominated for several awards, he succeeded in that sense. But as an audience opinion, the film isn't serious enough to be a drama, not funny enough to work as a comedy, too womanly to be a sports movie, and too sporty for a Lifetime movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Jerry Maguire is watchable and somewhat intriguing at times, but as a while is quite long and becomes a bore. It really is a romantic comedy disguised as a sports film. Not nearly as great as people clamor for it."

","I love movies that can't necessarily be classified by a single genre. Jerry Maguire isn't a chick flick, but it's not a sports film either. Nor is it a traditional comedy. It's possibly all three, but never just one. That's what makes it great. It appeals to both genders equally without alienating either of them.<br/><br/>The title character is played by Tom Cruise in one of his best performances. He's a slimy sports agent who, one day, has an epiphany, realizing he no longer wants to sell lies to his clients, but real relationships. The only problem is he doesn't even know how to have a real relationship in his personal life. At work, he sends out a mission statement that lauds the idea of having less clients to improve quality. This sudden life-changing notion wins over the approval of his cohorts, but his high-level agency disapproves and fires him.<br/><br/>Starting from the ground up, Jerry has nothing and no one to work with. The only people that follow him are a low-level employee, Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).<br/><br/>The chemistry between Cruise and both of his costars is natural that you can't imagine anyone else in those roles. You see him seamlessly transform over the course of the film, only taking notice of it in the end. Honestly, it's very much reminiscent of Pacino in the Godfather--only backwards.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire equally covers the depth of multiple characters brilliantly. The film not only goes inside the mind of a scuzzbag-turned-nice-guy, but of an athlete. Gooding plays a talented football player with a chip on his shoulder. He's not on his way out of the league, but he's no Jerry Rice either. He's on a middling NFL team and thinks he deserves a bigger paycheck than he gets. He knows he's good, but no one else sees it. The film brings very relatable themes to seemingly unrelatable people. There is more to the movie than demand for money. It's about friendship and knowing what's important in life amidst all the menagerie.<br/><br/>Writer-director Cameron Crowe has a knack for storytelling--already evident by his previous work--but he outdoes himself with this one. Nothing is ever truly predictable, which is an impressive accomplishment considering the type of film. Never is there a dull moment, and the dialogue is so effortlessly perfect without ever feeling contrived. The sappy moments are never that, when any other writer would know no other way. It's a rom-com for the ages and may even be the pinpoint for redefining the genre.<br/><br/>It has aged so well and is still a great watch to this day. Highly recommended for those of you who haven't seen it and are arguing with your other half about what to watch on movie night. I promise you'll both enjoy it.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"

","Be it in sport or carrier. The story of an individual's success after a s*** load of odds is always something that we can connect to in one way or another. I tried to watch this movie in one piece but could never sit through this. It just tests our patience and our intelligence. Like the scene where Jerry realizes and says ""he hated his place in the world"" coz of what he had become ""another shark in a suit"". The scene that made him realize that and the montages that follow through after that lacks even the slightest emotion so one can connect to his change over to what he really wants to be. That's when the titles roll. That's what you get from the rest of the movie. Its like somebody pushing down savor-less food down your throat. The only relief was Jonathan Lipnicki.

","This film is nothing more than a pretentious Tom Cruise flick. The movie is all about him. Probably demanded by Tom Cruise himself. It is not about Jerry Maguire. It is about this guy who has the girl of his dreams, and everything in his life is so perfect. Dumb clichés and cheesy moments. I mean really. Forget that this film is about a famous sports agent. It's about Tom Cruise's dream world. He comes into work and people start clapping like he's this extraordinary hero. He was just a freaking sports agent! It was completely forced.<br/><br/>So many of those moments where the film pushes for drama or comedy. There is this kid with glasses who is cute but it is all about Tom Cruise. A perfect Dad, loves kids, can play football, he is wealthy, has a girlfriend and he is handsome. The story serves no purpose. It is all just to make Tom Cruise's fame shine. The boss' party scene dedicated to Jerry Maguire is so stupid. The clips shown of all the girls talking about Jerry Maguire's looks and Maguire being uncomfortable by it--meaningless. Of course Tom Cruise loves it. He is clearly a narcissist. This film is about nothing more than just a handsome guy, or should I just say, truthfully, it is about Tom Cruise? <br/><br/>All the drama is stupid such as the ex-girlfriend punching Tom Cruise in the face, man getting punched by a woman, or ""Show me the money!"" or the scene where Maguire asks someone in the office to go with him (to I forget where) and Renee Zellweger's character says, ""I'll go"" Over the top drama and acting. This film has just about all the cheesiest/cliché and dumbest moments you can think of.<br/><br/>This might be a fun movie if you're drunk but it is seriously really bad. All in all, the idea of this film's marketing is to say that it is about a famous, inspirational, sports agent is just a farce. Because it is not. It is just a movie about a movie star. It was about selling you Tom Cruise's life."

","This movie works on so many levels. 7.3 is way too low. When I watch a great movie, one thing I like to think about is how unpredictable the journey is. Most movies, you know who wins, dies, falls in loves, and you can pretty much predict how too if you're good. This was definitely not one of those movies. I mean, when you sat down to watch this movie, you'd never be able to predict this is what you were about to watch. Obviously the acting is fantastic, and that's what everyone talks about. What I think is severely overlooked is how amazing this script is though. <br/><br/>First of all, to have a romantic comedy deal with the macho world of sports is brilliant. That it was able to work with both the romance and the agent part was honestly pretty unique. I just felt like every turning point was organic and unifying. Who would think that putting the marriage halfway in the movie would work? 99% of writers would put that at the end, but it works here! Also, what a cool and interesting thing to have the arrogant but up and coming football star be the role model for a good marriage, and what ultimately inspires Maguire to make his marriage to Dorothy work. <br/><br/>The scenes were fantastic-the dialog wasn't lame and ""on the nose."" The jokes were hilarious, and obviously the little boy was so perfect and added so much. You could tell Cameron Crowe spent those 3 years writing the script tweaking everything to perfection. That effort paid off. <br/><br/>I'm glad this was a hit. Although people might see it as ""commercial"", I think this was an excellent Hero's Journey and airtight screen writing. I was moved and I identified with every character so much. Thank you for such a great movie!"

","Jerry Maguire follows the story of a slick sports agent at a crisis of conscience, he pens a heartfelt company-wide memo that promptly gets him fired. Desperate to hang on to the athletes that he represents, Jerry starts his own management firm, with only single mother Dorothy Boyd joining him in his new venture. Banking on their sole client, football player Rod Tidwell, Jerry and Dorothy begin to fall in love as they struggle to make their business work. There hasn't been such a elegant film quite like this one in such a long time. It just full of compassion and sympathy towards its chosen storyline and characters, Tom Cruise giving easily one of his best performances of his career in this multi Oscar nominated film. Along his side is Cuba Gooding Jr. playing a football player named Rod Tidwell who is still intact with Jerry even with what's going on in his life, Cuba gave this Oscar winning performance as a charismatic person with lots of humor to fill the void with lots of respect and Encouragement. With all the ups and downs that Jerry is faced with, he still has the massive energy to get him through anything that comes in his path. You could call this film a comedy, romance or a sports film but mainly it sticks to the tone of a drama because what Cameron Crowe gave us was a man who is down on his luck and will do anything to not see himself fail no matter what kind of traits come his way, we are presented a man who you can actually relate too and root for. Even though this is mainly focused on a shortcoming sports agent, just think, this could happen to each and everyone of us in you will do anything with your luck to get back in the game. The character development to each is brought up so well because Maguire starts off as a cynical man but ends up realizing what really to the world and people and the romance he brings with Renée Zellweger comes off as a strong love triangle that make you think ""how could this people connect with each other?"" Jerry Maguire brings all sorts of goodies and surprises that you love to see on the screen, Maguire brings the love to many even especially the MONEY!"

","I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. <br/><br/>For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious.<br/><br/>One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy.<br/><br/>I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement.<br/><br/>If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends."

","You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire."

","Tom Cruise is an actor I've never had much time for. He has a certain way of looking in situations that shock his characters that I never found realistic, and it borders on annoying. Also, I can't help but feel his career is slipping downhill in recent years.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a review of 'Jerry Maguire' not Tom Cruise. This movie was fairly poor, for a few reasons. <br/><br/>Firstly, the acting fails to convince, Cruise gives a respectable performance and Gooding Jr, having seen him in two movies, gives the best performance of his career (but not Oscar worthy; how did that happen?) and Bonnie Hunt puts in a decent shift. It is Rene that unfortunately drags the movie down. Her character is overly vulnerable, to an almost caricature point, and I'm not sure if its down to the script or her, but she looked uncomfortable in the role. Combined with a weak and predictable plot, a overly long running time and several thoroughly annoying characters, this movie fails in just about every department.<br/><br/>You can do far worse than 'Jerry Maguire', but not worth the view"

A sports agent that grows a conscience, gets fired and has to rebuild his career and most importantly his life, I thought I was in for a boring couple of hours watching your typical sports drama but how wrong could I have been. It actually had very little to do with sports. It was a love story but again not your typical one. For me, it was all the different characters that made this film such as success. Tom Cruise has always been kind of an action figure in his movies which he's good at but for me, playing Jerry Maguire was by far his best work ever. He has brilliant timing and plays a character who's down on his luck so well, he should have got an Oscar for this but it's not only him that deserves credit. They all do. From Dorothy (Rene Zellweger) as the doting mum who falls hopelessly in love with Jerry even though she knows she shouldn't and her adorable son Ray who even as a small child, he even steals some of the scenes in this film. Also I loved Bonnie Hunt in this. This role definitely suited her as she plays the disapproving sister of Dorothy's. And of course, probably the main reason to watch this is to see Cuba Gooding Jnr as he plays the American football star Rod Tydwell and he is absolutely brilliant as both him and Tom work really well with each other. This film has everything. It will make you laugh, cry and will make you feel good and will always be remembered, not only for those famous quotes but for the characters as well. I think those casting agents should congratulate themselves on this one. Watch it, I know you'll love it"
"Christian_Dimartino","Null","0","1","27 July 2011"," Not quite Almost famous, but still enjoyable.
","Tom Cruise plays Jerry Maguire in, well, Jerry Maguire, an overrated but enjoyable film from the good but sometimes great Cameron Crowe. I wouldn't quite compare it to some of Crowe's other works, like Almost famous, but its still a heart felt, funny, and powerful film.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire has a simple story: Jerry is a sports agent who is having a midlife crisis, pretty much. He has just gotten fired from his job, and has rebounded after he meets a girl(played with such cuteness by Renee Zellweger)and her son.<br/><br/>There are a ton of funny moments, and memorable ones, that will stay with you. I'm sure that nobody could forget,""You complete me"". ""Shut up... just shut up... you had me at hello"". There are a lot of great performances also, such as Cruise, Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. in his Oscar winning role, as Jerry's client, a football star.<br/><br/>Jerry Maguire is a heartfelt dramady, but its not really that great. I'm sure that a lot of people would disagree, considering it was nominated for Oscars. But, to me, it's not up there with Almost famous. But what I like about Cameron Crowe is that all of his films have a heart(well, not Vanilla sky), but Singles, Say anything, Elizabethtown, Almost famous, so on and so on.<br/><br/>Crowe and Woody Allen are the only two directors in Hollywood who can capture good romantic comedy, though, I never saw Elizabethtown. So, for a romantic comedy, Jerry Maguire is a triumph. But I still don't love it.<br/><br/>B+<br/><br/>*Note* I have re-watched Jerry Maguire and it is now a great movie to me. It isn't and never will be Almost famous, but now I give it an A."

","As much as I wanted to like this movie- I couldn't...it was soooo hyped that maybe I was just disappointed by the result. The children are cute...some moments are funny...but there is something about this movie that seems insincere..maybe it's Tom Cruise's acting. Sometimes I really do think that he looks like such a ""pretty boy"" that it takes away from the reality and the truthfulness of the characters he plays. This movie is an example of this. I don't know...something about his performance irked me. Renee Zellweger was great though and so were the kids in the movie and definitely Cuba Gooding was good, but I don't think he deserved an oscar for it. watch it...you just might find it to be entertaining....

"NoArrow","Null","0","4","1 July 2003"," Overrated, but still a good drama
","I find ""Jerry Maguire"" incredibly overrated, and it shouldn't have been nominated for such awards as ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Actor"".  It's a good drama, but it's certainly nothing different from the usual Tom Cruise flick.<br/><br/>Although, if there is anything in this movie that deserved it's award, it'd definitely be Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance.  He plays the loud, obnoxious, but still lovable football player Rod Tidwell.  Gooding Jr.'s acting is one hundred percent, and he deserved his Oscar win.<br/><br/>Aside from the supporting actor, this is an overrated, sappy, ""feel good"" movie.  7/10."
"MovieAlien","Null","0","5","21 February 2001"," Cinematic equivalence to vomit
","Let me just point out the arrangement of roles for the film: A white agent, a black football player. I have to agree with some friend's assessments that this is a deplorable stereotype, however it's nowhere near explanatory in providing the details on why this film reeks.<br/><br/> I thought the morality tale was poorly conceived, and it didn't look like Cruise's character changed much towards the end. (He was supposed to ""find his scruples"", but I didn't see much in the fellow except that he was less constipated than before.) The romance has faux-sugar sweet, and I can't see it appealing to anyone except romance fanatics (but according to the story, that's not what the film was made for.)<br/><br/> It would have been interesting, if, the film was instead about a coach (not an agent) who physically and mentally assaults his players to the point that he's fined, and perhaps sentenced to jail. When he leaves jail, he finds the sport he stands up for is nothing more than barbaric and starts out by denouncing the commercialism mounted behind it. That would make the film increasingly more interesting, especially due to the fact that people who don't watch sports may find this moving and fascinating. I'm sure the idea will eventually be used.<br/><br/> But this is a poor movie. Thumbs down."
"otter","Null","0","4","4 January 2001"," Made by yuppie scum, for yuppie scum. DIE YUPPIE SCUM!!
","Big cheese sports agent Tom Cruise is struggling to find meaning in his lucrative shark-in-a-suit, love-em-and-leave-em, what's-my-client's-name-again existence. In a fit of what passes for normality in this movie he writes a ""shocking"" Mission Statement and loses his job. His only supporters are his sole client Cuba Gooding Jr., and lowly clerical worker Renee Zellweger, who works for him for apparently no salary, takes him home to her sister and sickly little boy, and of course falls in love with him. Of course Tom has to redeem himself and prove he's worthy of Renee by the most meaningful challenge the writers could think of (one that's undoubtedly near and dear to their hearts) - getting his overpaid client millions and millions of dollars instead of just millions of dollars.<br/><br/>The first thing that I can't stand about the movie is that it's deadly serious about all those buzzwords and management fads that make my teeth crawl in real life. Like how Tom loses his job over a Really Important Mission Statement - have you ever known an actual working human being (not a yuppie) who takes those things seriously? And the way Tom constantly uses the phrase ""Customer Service"" to make his firing worthwhile and give meaning to his shallow existence. In the real world ""Customer Service"" has an entirely different meaning: It's a terrifying buzzword that inhuman managers use to mean ""I don't just want 8 hours of work from my employees - I want to control every aspect of their behavior, I want to micromanage away their individuality, I want their very souls!"". And the writers seem to think it's inspirational.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is as slick and shallow as Cameron Crowe's direction, all dazzling grins and big-eyed vulnerable looks photographed from the most flattering angle, his usual Star performance. The supporting cast is excellent, in fact much better than the two leads. Bonnie Hunt as Renee's bitter sister has all the good lines and shares scene-stealing honors with five-year-old Jonathan Lipnicki, a genuinely cute child actor, and the lively and charming Cuba Gooding Jr. But it's Renee Zellweger's `Dorothy' who delivers the other killer blow to what might have been a good. better film. The character is the most annoying female lead of recent years. She's introduced on an airplane where the audience is supposed to feel sorry for her because she has to fly coach! Where she isn't given ONE glass of champagne, oh da poor widdle ting!  Face it, her character is truly gullible and dimwitted, and like many badly written female characters, never talks about her own needs, just what she can do for Jerry.  She's not a written as a person, she and her kid are just there to allow Jerry The Jerk to show his vulnerable, caring side - in relationships that are 100% All About Him. (Plus she strongly reminds me of some real-life women who act vulnerable and self-sacrificing, and are in fact manipulative bitches)<br/><br/>In short, if you like this film you probably are or aspire to be the kind of yuppie who inspired the catchphrase ""Die Yuppie Scum"". Let this movie serve not as entertainment, but as a test and a wake-up call. If you enjoy it at all, or identify with Tom, or even go through the whole film without ever once wanting to hit any of these people - change your life immediately! It may not be too late for you to rejoin the human race!<br/><br/>DIE YUPPIE SCUM!!!"
"Tapio-5","Null","0","5","9 May 1999"," Dull comedy
","I waited lots of this movie, but I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. It was dull and not worth of watching many times. The beginning is good and the actors are good, especially Tom Cruise. I would give this ** stars out of ***** (4 out of 10)."
"MovieAlien","Null","0","4","3 April 1999"," A horrid film. As phoney as a rubber chicken!
","This movie had so much potential. About the first 25 minutes of this film were classic. But what Hollywood had to do to make it `friendly' for the stupid audience ruined the whole movie.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a Sport's Agent, the title character (played by, who else?) who discovers that the players' well being is much better than money. In a very dramatic scene at a hospital, an injured player in bed is manipulated by Cruise to play again very soon. When the player's son tells him his dad is unfit, he does not care about the kid's feelings at all. The boy curses at him, flips him off, and runs out of the scene.<br/><br/>He then writes a short composition about his scrupulous beliefs, losing all his team members as a result. That's when the film revolves into an interesting character study to a sentimental and annoying romantic comedy (Remember the nervous breakdown scene in the office?) filled with stereotypes and syrupy dialogue. Oh gosh, a black sports' player, a white agent. What does that make you think?  More annoyance is the fact this movie was nominated for 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. My eyebrows lifted when I heard this was a work of Cameron Crowe (of `Fast Times at Ridgemont High' fame.) Renee Zelwegger is beautiful, and a great actress, and never should of been casted in this trite and predictable film.<br/><br/>Certainly not as bad as The English Patient in terms of Oscars, but it goes to show that 1996 was just a very bad year for movies."
"phiggins","Null","0","3","22 January 2002"," Tom Cruise somehow manages to portray an over-confident and hyper-active guy with great teeth
","LIke that other big budget, high-gloss exercise in subservsion, ""Fight Club"", this big budget, high-gloss movie is packed with perfect-looking people claiming to be fighting for freedom, individuality, the common man, the little guy, truth, justice and the American Way.  This kind of film is much more palatable when all concerned are unbelievably gorgeous and dentally superior to the rest of us mere mortals.  ""Fight Club"" would not have been nearly so attractive a proposition if the Brad Pitt role had been taken by Steve Buscemi.  Likewise, ""Jerry Maguire"" would have its work cut out if its central role were played by Danny Devito.  It's so much easier to be subversive if you are charismatic and physically perfect. <br/><br/>For the record, Tom Cruise plays the eponymous sports agent, who suffers a crisis of conscience and decides to go it alone, and be, y'know, a better sports agent.  And hey, if that means making millions of dollars along the way, so be it.  Yeah, I know, sounds pretty awful doesn't it?  Sounds like the kind of movie that makes you want to slash the seats and torch the cinema.  And yet, somehow, it transpires that Cameron Crowe has managed to write a witty, fast-paced, character-driven script and directed it with such verve and style that all criticism seems redundant. He's very good at this sort of thing.  Like his more recent ""Almost Famous"" this is the kind of film you thought they didn't make any more: Hollywood Bollocks, yes, but the kind of HB you don't mind.  In fact, the kind of HB you wish would never end. All the performances are excellent, meaning that Mr Cruise has now, to the best of my knowledge, appeared in a grand total of three good movies (I've not seen ""Vanilla Sky"" yet): ""Color (sic) of Money"", ""Magnolia"" and this. When you compare this with the rest of his oeuvre, okay, the duds outweight the gold nuggets by about five to one, but even so. Renee Zellweger, meanwhile, proves she can play Americans almost as well as English people, with her fine portrayal of the plucky Dorothy.  Her kid has too much sticky-up hair and annoying glasses, but otherwise he's okay. Cuba Gooding Jr (a name to conjure with.  Has he got a brother called Chile? A siter called Argentina?) gives the performance he seems to be spending the rest of his career recovering from.  He's on top form here, as the enthusiastic American footballer who stands by Jerry, for all the right reasons.  The scenes with his family watching him, anxiously waiting for him to get up from what looked like a crippling injury are both heart-rending and hilarious.  Which would seem to be Crowe's speciality - tugging at the heart strings and making you laugh, sometimes simultaneously.  In the ever-more vacuous world of Hollywood, his brand of comedy/drama/whatever is more and more necessary."
"Geofbob","Null","0","3","21 January 2002"," Well crafted and enjoyable but lightweight
","This is a well-made, entertaining film with excellent performances, but it is let down by a lack of substance. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Jerry Maguire, a sports agent seemingly as superficial and go-getting as any in his business, until one day he gets back in touch with his conscience, issues a touchy-feely mission statement, and is duly fired by his corporation. Renee Zellwegger is as sweet as only she can be, playing widowed mother Dorothy, who follows Jerry into the wilderness and into a relationship. And Cuba Gooding Jr earned an Oscar for his stand-out role as Rod Tidwell, a fearless wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, and the only client to stick with Jerry.    <br/><br/>The problem is that while Jerry may be a tad more personable than fellow agents, the film fails to demonstrate that his change of heart leads to his doing business any less materialistically or more ethically than they do. Clearly, he isn't helped by Tidwell, who is portrayed as charismatic, straight-talking and family-loving, but also fixated on getting big bucks - as exemplified in the great ""Show me the Money"" scene. Indeed, if the film has any message at all, it is that there is precious little scope for ethics in the sports agency business, and that Jerry's moralistic crusade is doomed to failure - but it's unlikely that this is what writer/director Cameron Crowe was actually trying to say. <br/><br/>Correspondingly, on the romantic front, the movie is rather lightweight and vague. Jerry and Dorothy have their inevitable getting togethers and breaking-ups, but on none of the occasions is there a great deal of passion or thought. Again, we could put a cynical spin on the movie - Dorothy only wants Jerry as a father for her cute son Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki); and Jerry wants a son more than a wife - but it's doubtful if that's what Crowe wants us to think.  <br/><br/>It's a pity; Crowe could have made a stronger film if he'd given his characters some tougher choices, and had been willing to sacrifice a bit of the fun for some real conflict - conveyed by action as well as words."
