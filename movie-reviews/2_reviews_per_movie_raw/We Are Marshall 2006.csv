","Wow...I just got back from a preview showing of ""We Are Marshall,"" and I am still in shock I'll admit it, I originally only went to see this movie to see Matthew Fox. I mean I like football, but normally I wouldn't go to the theaters to see a movie on it. I expected it to be like a lot of sports movies--good, but repetitive and forgettable. However, I was completely wrong. The movie is excellent on so many levels. The acting is extremely good. Matthew Mcconaughey is extremely likable as the head coach, Matthew Fox is incredible as the assistant coach (especially his emotional scenes), and so is the supporting cast. The film itself is just extremely well-made as a whole, and extremely touching and moving.<br/><br/>Right now, I feel really bad that the movie hasn't gotten more buzz than it has. It was one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. I am surprised that it didn't get nominated for any Golden Globes because it really is probably better than a lot of the movies that got nominated. But really, it is an extremely good movie, and not just your typical, cliché, sports movie. It was such a nice surprise, and I am really glad i decided to see it."
"llogan1-1","10","147","178","14 December 2006"," This is not just a sports movie!
","I graduated from Marshall University and grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, where the movie takes place, which of course, made this movie especially meaningful to me. I drove 300 miles to see the Premiere in Huntington two days ago, and the audience actually clapped during certain scenes, laughed quite a few times, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house at the end. Though it was extremely poignant for us West Virginians because there were people in the audience whose family members died in that horrible plane crash in 1970, and one of my high school friends was actually there at the crash site with her father who was a State Trooper, and I know other people who lost someone. However, aside from all that, this movie is extremely uplifting. When you are faced with such a horrendous tragedy as losing 75 people, 55 of whom were members of your football team with only a handful of players left as well as the head coach and family members of the football players and other university faculty, etc., it is completely devastating! I remember seeing scenes of the crash on TV, and it was horrible. And then to rebuild a team from scratch when no one even wanted to coach the Thundering Herd (Marshall's football team)? That's totally amazing! <br/><br/>And the way they went about it was ingenious! I didn't know a lot of the details of what happened after the crash or how hard it was to rebuild the team because I was 5 years old at the time, but the director/producer McG, the writer and all the actors really give you a sense of the horrendous loss that my hometown experienced and how they really did rise from the ashes to honor their teammates who perished on November 14, 1970. Even if you're not a sports fan, this movie shows the indelible spirit of the human condition and what you can accomplish if you really give 110%. Matthew McConauhey, Anthony Mackie and Matthew Fox and the entire cast gave absolutely incredible performances, and after the film ended Matt M and Matt Fox were both so choked up they could barely speak. And I guarantee that people who are not a little emotional after watching this film, then those folks didn't ""see"" what I saw--an Oscar-Winning film whether it gets nominated or not! <br/><br/>Lynne Logan Novelist/Screenwriter and very grateful fan of ""We Are Marshall"""
"dshepherd-6","9","18","19","4 January 2007"," I loved this movie
","I hate football, but I loved this movie! I went to see it because Nate Ruffin was my Supervisor for several years and was the most supportive, understanding human being I've ever known. He often told anyone who would listen how his life took a downward spiral after the crash because he felt so guilty for surviving. But he got his life together and decided the best way he could honor his former teammates was to be an inspiration to others, and he was more than that! Anthony Mackie portrayed Nate wonderfully and caught his spirit of leadership and caring! Nate knew from experience what hardship could do to a person's life and used his story to help many of us through major upheavals in our lives.<br/><br/>The movie matched much of what Nate told us throughout the years, and I think he would be ecstatic that the story was finally told and told this well!"

","I saw this film on November 21st, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>This film is based on a true and tragic story. On November 14th, 1970, the Marshall University football team, football coaches, athletic staff, key alumni, and friends were flying home to Huntington, West Virginia after an away game against East Carolina. Their plane crashed killing all seventy five (75) aboard. <br/><br/>How do a University and a small town of 50,000 people respond to a massive tragedy that affected so many students and town residents? This movie is about their struggle to come to grips with that tragedy.<br/><br/>Without bitter rancor and with humility, some felt the University should start up a new football team and persevere through a long rebuilding process to honor the dead. Others, again without rancor and with humility, believed that starting up a football team would be too painful a reminder of the tragedy.<br/><br/>It was decided to start a new football team immediately and play the next season in 1971. This movie is primarily about the difficulties of the development of the team.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays the new Head Coach brilliantly and believably. He is a combination of country bumpkin enthusiastic huckster and a wise man. And he does it simply because he believes  ""Maybe I can help."" He displays courage and perseverance and makes sacrifices with a career move that could throw him out of his beloved profession, head football coaching, forever. <br/><br/>The town and University have to quickly break the Vince Lombardi-like notion that you play the game of football for one reason only  to win. They learn how you play the game matters, and even simply showing up is a kind of victory too.<br/><br/>This is a compelling story well told and very moving. <br/><br/>FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."
"seagoddess76","10","76","93","16 December 2006"," Loved it!!!
","The critics seem to be trashing this movie, but for those of us who grew up in Huntington, WV, it was an amazing story and an incredible movie. I laughed, cried, cheered, and then cried some more. I have never been more proud of my hometown. This is not just a story about football. I'm sure you will hear that more than once. It is a story about getting back on your feet. Even when you think things are at their worst. This is a point the critics seem to miss. They compare it to Invincible and other football movies. Don't listen. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I believe you will love it too! Even if you are not from Huntington, you will be able to relate if you have ever lost someone close. As one of the other posters put it...We are...Marshall!!! Go Herd!"
"JLeighSD","10","62","75","22 December 2006"," Great inspiring movie.. We Are Marshall
","I went to watch the movie here in New York State. I absolutely loved the movie as did my entire family. I cried a lot but also laughed here and there. The movie was well done with only a few little things I noticed that were changed, but overall it was very true to the story I grew up with and the facts I know.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox did a wonderful job in their parts. I was quite impressed with every actor in the movie actually, they all did a fantastic job. McG did a great job in bringing the story to the screen. You were there in that time and during the tragedy and felt what Huntington went through.<br/><br/>As I left the movie, I thought about the ones who died in the plane crash and cried again. For those of you who haven't seen the movie or know the story this isn't just a story about loosing a football team. The crash also claimed members of the football staff and prominent people of the town of Huntington. The other players in other sports lived in the dorms with the football players who perished. They felt the impact when returning to school and all those faces now gone from their halls. The staff was down to almost nothing. The citizens that died included doctors, lawyers, a car dealership owner, dentist,a council member for Huntington and radio announcers for the herd. So, you can see this impacted the town in a way most won't or don't understand. If you watch the movie you can see how it effects everyone. I would like to now take a moment to remember those who passed .................................................................. We will never forget you.<br/><br/>In the end this movie is about moving on, dealing with your grief or loss and how to live again. How as to rise above the ashes and move forward as it is said in the movie.<br/><br/>I think people of 20 years of age and older will love this movie. I ran into several people of these age ranges that asked me questions and told of how they were going to tell their friends to go see the movie as well. I hope this movie touches and shows everyone how to rise from the ashes and move forward. In today's world of tragedies this is a movie that will touch you if you have dealt with a tragedy yourself. So, I think several people will be able to relate to this movie and find it inspiring.<br/><br/>Being a Huntington native I will always bleed green. GO HERD!!!! We Are ......................................... Marshall."
"gainsburys","9","107","134","8 December 2006"," We Are Marshall
","I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of 'We Are Marshall' for audience research purposes therefore being part of the first audience in Britain to see the film.<br/><br/>We were given a brief plot description when offered the tickets which didn't interest me to be honest (I was more interested in seeing a free film!) So when I went to see it I didn't know what to expect, just that apparently it is supposed to be very good and quite emotional.<br/><br/>I was pleased to see that it managed to live up to that, as coming out of the cinema I felt it managed to stand by what I heard in being a very good film, in fact I would go so far as to say brilliant. Staying behind for a quick discussion about the film for research purposes, two people (including myself) rated the film as 'excellent', four rated it 'very good' and two (somewhat miserable and stubborn) people rated it 'good'.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the film manages to portray the death of the football team in a tasteful and respectful way, showing the emotions of the characters in the way the town cared for the team. However, shortly after the plane crash I felt that the film stumbled into a very slow and boring corner. Luckily about twenty minutes later, the film manages to pick up very well. I found the remaining hour of the film very enjoyable and emotional, with a few humorous lines from Matthew McConaughey.<br/><br/>I was also very pleased to see how well Matthew Fox managed starring in a feature film. Being only fifteen, my only knowledge of Fox is Jack form 'Lost'. I feel that he managed to play the character of Red very well - very quickly in the film, the role of Jack was soon forgotten.<br/><br/>The ending to the film is done very well and manages to keep you in suspense, despite a quite predictable result. I was also quite surprised how little knowledge of the game football is needed. Being English, I can't say I have ever seen a game of 'American' Football, let alone understand the rules - I found myself thoroughly enjoying the action packed games despite knowing nothing of the sport.<br/><br/>All in all, in my opinion this is a very, very good film which I strongly recommend. As said, I found a part of the film rather dull but felt 'We Are Marshall' delivered a second half so good, I soon forgot about it.<br/><br/>Go see this film!"
"mugirl25","10","78","102","14 December 2006"," Born and Bred Herd Fan comments on We Are Marshall
","I was taken from the moment it started, crying within the first few minutes. I definitely cried more than I thought I would, but I also laughed and cheered. It is truly an all inclusive movie. I have herd this story on many occasions throughout my life, but I still feel that learned some things by watching the movie. I know that not all of it was historically accurate, but there are always things that Hollywood has to add to make things more interesting. I did notice a few mistakes, but only a couple, and they were things that a movie critic at heart, or someone from Huntington would notice (lucky for me, I am both). I was definitely impressed with the way my hometown was personified. Most films portray West Virginia as nothing but poor redneck hillbillies, but this movie has made a difference. I feel they really showed Huntington for what it is. The most touching moment for me involved our favorite rival...WVU. I do not know if it actually happened, but it took my breath away when I saw it. I won't tell you what it is, but you'll know when you see it. I was completely consumed during this movie. I was incredibly impressed with Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox's performances. These men WERE our coach and asst. coach. The only thing that distracted me was the local connections to some of the extras in the film. Other than that, I was completely sucked in. I don't want to give anything away, because I want you to experience it for yourself, but I promise to go see with all of my friends, no matter how many times that takes. Most people I know have told me that I am the biggest Marshall fan they know, and I hope that is true, because this is my passion, my pride. I hope that those of you who aren't as familiar with our history will learn some things and will be touched by the story. It is a wonderful movie. I highly recommend it to everyone. So go see it on Dec 22nd and enjoy! Don't forget to bring tissues, or grab some napkins at the concession stand like we did.<br/><br/>~Kelli~ WE ARE MARSHALL!!! 4 ever!"
"wlb","9","12","13","1 January 2007"," A movie that needs no dramatization - was accurate
","I spent many summers with my aunt, uncle and cousin in Huntington, WV and was at the University of Virginia in Nov 1970 when the plane carrying most of Marshall's football team crashed. It crashed just a few miles from their home.<br/><br/>While my school was 300 miles from Huntington many weekends I'd make the trip to Huntington to see my aunt & uncle. <br/><br/>Just a week before the accident my uncle and I saw one of their games - a home game playing Kent State - and it was such an eerie feeling for me to know that virtually everyone I saw on the field that day was gone in an instant.<br/><br/>I don't think it would be possible for any director to truly capture the level of grief in Huntington at that time, but this movie gave a pretty good glimpse inside.<br/><br/>While this movie is about the rebuilding of a football team that all but vanished, the greater message to me is how they kept building through their intense grief, and why that effort was important.<br/><br/>Almost everyone in my circle knew someone - or had a loved one - killed. A poster mentioned that some in Huntington don't like the film - everyone I know - including my cousin, felt that it really captured the time.<br/><br/>The Huntington Quarterly devoted an issue to describe the making of the movie, and how the actors met - and mingled - with members of the community. I believe that the community embraced the production crew.<br/><br/>Kate Mara's character, according to my cousin, is a composite of several actual individuals and the restaurant has a different name but everything else is factual. Incidentally I loved Kate's character.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey has said that it is the most meaningful movie he has done.<br/><br/>I have recommended it to all my friends."

","I'm giving We Are Marshall 9 out of 10 stars because I guess I'm somewhat biased, being an M.U. alumnus. From an objective point of view, however, I do have to say that the quality of this movie was outstanding. To me it was a breath of fresh air that the movie producers didn't use this film to perpetuate the many stereotypes surrounding West Virginia and its inhabitants. Matthew did an amazing job with his role as Jack. The other actors really reflected their characters as well! The cinematography was lacking something- can't quite put my finger on it. Overall- I definitely have to say that I'm very impressed with the film. I'm hoping that it wins a few awards:-)"
"jdp512","10","82","114","17 December 2006"," We Are ... Marshall is a must see
","As a parent of an existing student at MU, I feel every currently enrolled student, potential future student and their parents should see this film. Prior to my daughter's enrollment at MU, I had no idea of this tragedy. Even though one of the assistant coaches killed lived 5 minutes from me. In my daughter's years so far at MU, I've learned MU stands for tradition, history, and pride. This film depicts that in a most inspiring way. Matthew Fox deserves an award for his portrayal of Coach Red Dawson. Matthew McC. brings Coach Lengyel's personality alive on the big screen. The Director, McG, truly captured the emotion of the entire town. After seeing this film, I will never sit at that football stadium again without feeling the presence of 75 people looking down upon that field and smiling.<br/><br/>I have never been in a theater where complete silence occurred. Within 10 minutes of the start of the movie, the only sounds you heard were the sniffles of the audience. Yes, its tragic but this movie shows you never let the ""licks"" life hands you get the best of you and win. Not only on the football field but in real life. Go see the movie but bring tissues."

"treywolfe","9","64","89","11 December 2006"," Great Movie!
","This was really a great movie for anyone that's spent time in West Virginia. I was very surprised at some of the things McG chose to cover in the movie. For instance, the Marshall coaching staff took a trip to Morgantown to ask Bobby Bowden (WVU) to teach them the veer. Everyone I've spoken to that is a WVU student or fan had no idea that happened, nor did anyone from Huntington. Very Emotional on many levels and I thought the writers, producers, and director really did the town of Huntington some justice by making it as real as possible and not ""hollywoodville."" There were some things that you could tell were thrown in there to make the story more dramatic, but the story was dramatic from the very beginning. You should really waste the 7 bucks to see this one....cause its absolutely worth it."
"JEBeezie52","10","52","72","22 December 2006"," Better than Rudy
","While I understand some Marshall alumni, students, and fans may have bitter feelings toward the movie, I do not think McG could have produced or directed a better film! The feeling you get when watching the movie is indescribable and can certainly touch those of us who were not alive when the crash happened. After seeing this and crying so much I can't even imagine what it must have been like nearly forty years ago. It is an amazing and truly inspiring story that has touched my heart greatly! The actors showed amazing emotions and attitudes which honestly made the movie. This is a must see for everyone - whether you like sports, are a WVU fan, or were around or not around when the crash occurred."
"jesseburgess57","10","15","18","24 December 2006"," Living in Huntington and seeing this filmed sent chills up my spine...
","This film captures our feelings about the ""Thundering Herd"" and not just towards the sport of football. I must say though that both Matthew's made a tremendous showing, I believe that the actor portraying Nate Ruffin did an outstanding job.<br/><br/>I do understand that the stadium scenes were filmed somewhere in Alabama (only because Fairfield Stadium no longer exists) it was close enough to pass.<br/><br/>The day that followed the crash sent shock-waves through our little city. I remember walking up to the newspaper dispenser in front of Billy's Market in Guyandotte and seeing the pictures of all those players who lost their lives in the crash through the glass window. I felt grief rushing through my body, even though I didn't know any of them. I remember just standing there for a long time just looking at the little red box that held such bad news. This film does an awesome job showing how hard it was for Marshall to even continue having a football program, much less get a team together. My understanding is that Coach Lengel's effort to get the NCAA to let Freshmen play was later adopted by the whole league.<br/><br/>""When people were leaving the Keith Albee Theatre just to see fire trucks rushing by, NOTE: The fire trucks were actually going the wrong way...the crash site was actually the other way.""<br/><br/>Please don't pass on this because you think it's just another sports/football movie, go see it first and then make up your own mind on how you feel. WE ARE MARSHALL...Go Herd!"

","I'm not sure I comprehend critics calling the film ""predictable"". OF COURSE going into the film one knows the entire premise of the film... Anyhow... the film does an excellent job of portraying the effect of the plane crash on a variety of characters. Both Fox and Straithairn are particularly moving. McConaughey's character is somewhat goofy, but his performance is believable. It is one of the better sports films I've seen of late and puts films like ""Invincible"" and ""Glory Road"" to shame. <br/><br/>Remember the Titans- 9/10 Brian's Song (the original version)- 8.5/10 We Are Marshall- 8/10 Hoosiers- 7.5/10 Rudy- 7/10 Invincible- 5/10 Glory Road- 4/10"

","As sick as I am of football flicks this year I must admit I rather enjoyed this film. Mainly because of the great performance of its lead. He does a great job as the weird coach that is so offbeat and positive that this town that is healing from the biggest tragedy it has ever known,just does not know have to take him. Mcg also proves he can direct something that is not flashy and slick. It will be a great film for families to see together and it does a good job pulling on the old heartstrings. Matthew Fox also does great as the assistant coach who lived through it all and has many demons to face. WE ARE MARSHELL is the best film of its kind since Remember the Titans."
"mammaw_ctb","9","9","10","28 December 2006"," I was totally captivated by this movie.
","""We are Marshall"" was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The story was told with both passion and compassion and everyone in it did a good job playing their role. I was a young wife and mother when this happened and had forgotten about it until the movie came out. Kudos to the young man who played ""Ruffin"", the team captain, and the gentleman who played the College President. In my opinion they both absolutely nailed those characters. It would be nice to see them recognized for those vital supporting roles. The audience in the theater we went to rose to leave when the movie ended and the credits started to role, but stopped and stood to watch as the photos of the original characters alongside their actor counterparts were displayed. Everyone was mezmerized. One can only hope that more movies of this quality will be provided for the consuming public."

","The year of 2006 had three football movies...""The Gridiron Gang"", ""Invinsible"", and ""We are Marshall"". Having seen the first two earlier in the year, I was not that excited for We are Marshall. I went in expecting a decent but cliché football movie.<br/><br/>I was wrong. We are Marshall is not another cliché football movie...it is so much more than that. The movie is definitely sad, as well it should be...throughout the movie, regardless of all the positive things that are occurring, you are often reminded that the plane crash is still in the characters' minds, and no matter what happens with their rebuilding the football team, that will haunt them forever. This isn't one of those movies where something bad happens and then it is healed.<br/><br/>Go see We are Marshall...will you be depressed? I was not...I left the theater calmly in deep thought.

","When I first saw the previews for We Are Marshall I didn't want to see it because I thought the plane crash scene was going to be too graphic but I think they did a great job of balancing being tasteful and showing what really happened. This movie made me laugh, cry, and stand up and cheer. The story follows the lives of a few key people that were affected by the loss of family and friends but also the town as a whole. It really shows how a town can be ripped apart in a split second and how you can start rebuilding your life once you let yourself depend on other people for support. What a great movie! I would recommend this movie to anyone. If you don't cry during this movie, then you don't have a heart."
"dbborroughs","8","5","5","31 January 2007"," Under rated movie that will make you feel good about the ability to come back from tragedy
","This one blindsided me. With some of the worst reviews of the Christmas season I thought that this was going to be time wasted, instead I found one of the more enjoyable movies I've seen in along while. The first half hour of this film is a great capsule of the events leading to and aftermath of the plane crash that wiped out the 1970 Marshall football team. At that point the film shifts gears as Matthew McConaughey is brought in to rebuild the team and be its coach. A feel good movie thats more about rebuilding the cracked soul of a community than football (though football is front and center) this is a movie that works because of the characters, we care about them so we care about the story. Its also got a great pop score. Though far from perfect, and probably not ""great"", its a better than really good movie that the critics completely missed the boat on."
"Alcatraz21990","7","5","5","13 January 2007"," Absolutely Phenomenal, don't believe the critics on this one!
","I understand that We Are Marshall received lousy reviews from the critics, descried as formulaic and the same old stupid football movie with the one ""Big Play"". Well, I can pretty much guarantee that the vast majority of those critics that gave this movie a bad rating did not even watch it and just looked at the name of the director and the lead actor and made their decision then. We Are Marshall is an uplifting true story about how faith and courage can overcome difficult circumstances. The movie is not about some great team that wins the ""Big Game"" and overplayed sports miracles, its about how a football team, a university, and a town experiences unimaginable tragedy, and how the efforts of Coach Jack Lengyel helped the town cope with their terrible loss. McConaughey is a little over the top as Lengyel but all his performance does not detract from the story. McG actually did a very good job directing with certain scenes, like the plane crash, the governor's meeting, and the last play and deserves some credit for a job well done, for once. Many movies are often not dramatic enough, or emotional enough, We Are Marshall might actually be a little too dramatic and heart wrenching, it is extremely difficult watching this movie for the first time to not cry at least once. Please, ignore the opinions of the critics for once and give this film a chance, it is absolutely worth it."

","This movie follows the real event very closely as it really happened. A saddened day for Huntington, WV and for the entire Ohio Valley (area along the Ohio river), it took many years for all of them to recuperate and this movie depicts the story so true.<br/><br/>The drama, the plot, and the thrilled suspense, will keep you on tuned in to the main characters who desire a result but are challenged to find themselves in a darken tunnel.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays an excellent role of depicting a true to life coach whose mission was survival and along the way manages to give the viewer a laugh just when it's needed.<br/><br/>If you're from the Ohio valley and remember this event, you will leave the theater with Marshall University on your mind and if you are from Huntington area you will know that your team has received it's recognition so needed but if none of these then you will definitely enjoy the drama, the personal stories lived out on the big screen, and the witness of the desire of the human spirit to rise above it all, even when beaten."
"wereuat06-1","7","8","9","23 December 2006"," Sad Stroy of Friendship and Teamwork
","This was a great movie, not a superb one but good. The action was on par, the emotions were st great. But this movie is not about that it is about what happened to that team and how the school was changed. It is a feel good story at the end that makes you want to cry but feel good at the same time. I was surprised that Matthew McConaughey was able to play a role as important as this one. But he played as he should have the coach that would not stop and keep pushing his team to the top to give the town and school and kids something good for a change. I also thought Matthew Fox played good coming off such roles as Lost. Every scene in this movie is a good performance and gives you something to think about. And everyone plays there part as if they are the real people from that town.<br/><br/>There is a good lesson taught in this movie to never give up no matter how bad things get you can always refurbish yourself. This is a good movie to bring your kids to, it is not scary but it will be sad at how realistic they made it seem. Also it is another good sports football genre movie along side Remember The Titans and Rudy. So I recommend you to bring your family to this movie and you will not be disappointed at the least. I give this movie a 7 out of 10."
"crmayne","7","10","12","26 December 2006"," We Are Marshall
","My family and I saw We Are Marshall Christmas night. I grew up in a Marshall family (Mom & Dad, M.U. grads; my oldest sister was in school at M.U. at the time of the plane crash, as well as her future husband). Dad worked in the newspaper business at the time; and my mom's father passed away the night of the crash (while we were glued to radio and T.V. reports from Huntington.)<br/><br/>A year later, I was fortunate enough to see the Xavier game portrayed in the film at Fairfield Stadium in person. It is still the single most heart-stirring moment in sports I've ever been around.<br/><br/>Attending Marshall myself just a few short years after the tragedy, we cheered for first downs by the Thundering Herd and agonized through fighting to be just competitive. Not all were mindful of the journey.<br/><br/>The film seems to capture the shock of the crash on the school and the community and the hopelessness both experienced in the times immediately following the crash. Due to time restrictions and to keep the story moving, the struggle to come up with representative football players was kind of oversimplified in the film, but the men who did play in those years are just as important as the heroes of the winning era at Marshall decades later. Not sure if the real Jack Lengyel was as tongue in cheek as portrayed in the movie, but it seems to work.<br/><br/>I think the movie will grow on people across the country not familiar with the story or who had no ties to Marshall/Huntington, in the vein of Hoosiers or Remember The Titans. My wife and sons have heard about it for years...that's why we wanted to experience the movie together.<br/><br/>The most incredible sports story I'll ever witness. I thought about the 75 when Marshall played in Detroit in the Motor City Bowl in 1999 and finished in the top 10 in the country. I think about them every time I visit the Marshall Student Center and see the 1970 team picture on the wall. I knew their names from the newspaper stories and the radio coverage of the era. It is quite a personal memory for me, and one I know I share with thousands, and now, many, many more."

","Seeing We Are Marshall this past weekend in Los Angeles was a film we were anxious to attend, mainly because I am from Huntington, born and raised, attended Marshall for 2 semesters myself and personally knew 3 people who lost their lives in the crash. I was at home watching the tube on that eventful, cold November evening when the news service flashed the story. The film brought back a lot of memories and I learned quite a few things that I wasn't aware of how Marshall, it's coaches and the team's resurrection of the football program.<br/><br/>My review is unbiased and not influenced in any way because I was from the city. First off, I was not actually expecting the film to be as good as I thought it would be. WB and their crew did an excellent job telling the story, working in the city and highlighting the action.<br/><br/>WAM, brought out real emotion, cheers and tears for us and it was very uplifting and exciting to see a brand new college freshman football team have the spirit and heart to move forward and pursue their dream to compete again, rather than just give up and sit on the sidelines. <br/><br/>I could think of no better actors for this part other than Matthew Fox or Matthew McConaughey to play the roles of the coaches. They had the coach persona down pat. Although I am more aware of McConaughey's work than Fox's, I think this role was one of MM best. He had the wit, the charm, the positive direction and inspiration to motivate a new team to go to the top and win, even though the team was basically started from scratch. He was tough but compassionate, wise and street smart, rational but realistic about the expectations of a totally new team who were very inexperienced and contemplating if they had a chance to even win a game.<br/><br/>Reading many reviews from a variety of sources since the film was released, I found most of them encouraging and recommendations to see the production. What amused me however, were the critics less than pleased that this was just another football movie. Well, of course it was a film about college football. That is certainly obvious, what else could it have been? The characters were developed consistently as time and script allowed and seeing the team go through their workouts, venting their frustrations and emotions, was a bit enlightening, for us anyway.<br/><br/>When Marshall played Xavier in their first season, I think that was the real highlight of the movie. It pushed my right-on buttons to the max! There were other things that were great in the film that brought back a variety of memories about Marshall and their place in football history. Of course despite the fact that I have first hand knowledge and some personal experiences realistically related to the film, you don't have to be from the town to see a very uplifting, true and inspiring story.<br/><br/>Go out and see the film for yourselves and tell us what you think. I give it 4.5 stars out of 5"
"Herd85","10","16","22","22 December 2006"," This one is a Masterpiece
","I believe this film will move anyone with a soul and is Oscar worthy. But being someone who used to pretend to be Ted Shoebridge, listened to Gene Morehouse call the play by play of the East Carolina game, heard the sirens wail as the emergency vehicles streaked through Adams Ave., and had Reggie Oliver for a gym teacher in elementary school, I am hardly objective and will let others judge this films artistic merit or the level of interest of this story to the general public.<br/><br/>However, I can say that this film perfectly captures the time, place, and people. This film is not a documentary, but I was stunned (and quite shook up) by just how close the story correlated with reality. This story does not come from the imagination of Hollywood; it comes from the real life experiences of real people. The story telling and character portrayals of this true story are delivered with breathtaking accuracy, and this is what sets this movie apart and makes it a masterpiece."

","It is factual that the charter plane carrying home the Marshall football team crashed and burned, killing all on board, on November 14, 1970. My second daughter was 1 month old. Only 4 varsity team members survived, those who had stayed behind for various injuries and personal reasons.<br/><br/>This is almost two movies, a short one followed by the longer one. The first part of this movie, ""We Are Marshall"", deals with the events leading up to the crash, and how the community deals with it. The second part deals with the efforts to re-build football at the Huntington, WV University.<br/><br/>The college administration was ready to indefinitely suspend plans for football, but the team captain who had stayed home for a shoulder injury got virtually all the students to gather outside the board meeting location and repeatedly shout ""we are Marshall"" as a sign they supported beginning again right away. Things were not easy, after going through a long list of former Marshall football stars, all rejecting the offer, someone showed up out of the blue for the head coaching job.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey is superb as Jack Lengyel, an unknown who came to Marshall to pump up the enthusiasm and get things going again. I don't know how true to the real character he was, but I know that he made the movie most interesting. Jack held no false pretenses, he directly approached everyone with what he thought needed to be done. Including a rival coach to learn how to run the 'veer' offense.<br/><br/>Key was David Strathairn as University President Dedmon, who needed to get the NCAA to approve letting true freshmen play varsity football, otherwise Marshall could not field a team, and could not recruit effectively. After letters and unreturned phone messages failed to get NCAA approval, Jack had a pivotal conversation with Dedmon. Asked if he was married, and getting an answer ""25 years"", Jack went on to say ""I'll bet you didn't propose by phone, and I'll bet she didn't say YES by letter. You need to go to Kansas City and talk to the NCAA in person."" Which he did, in the rain, and got approval.<br/><br/>Mashall wasn't successful right away, at least not in the ""V"" column, but they were successful at getting the tragedy behind them. Eventually they became very successful, surpassing anything they did before 1970. This movie is a telling of that story and it is a superb human-interest story, a very-well made one."
"bobh-16","8","4","4","17 February 2007"," A Very Good Film That Tells A Very Inspiring Story
","I have just seen ""We Are Marshall"" for the fourth time. The first three times I saw it I found the novelty of seeing locals being portrayed, as well as familiar locations being shown, on the big screen just a bit of a distraction. I won't bore you with the details of my life, but I am very close to this story. I have lived and worked in the Huntington area for my whole life, and attended both Marshall and Morehead State Universities.<br/><br/>For this fourth screening I decided to go alone and try to concentrate on the actual film. I can only say that it is a very good portrayal of an inspiring true story. Why this story was never told before is beyond me. All the elements are there. It is a story of triumph over adversity in the face of tremendous odds. It required little in the way of apocrypha to move the story along. I assume that Ian McShane's character was needed to give the opposition to fielding the 1971 team a face, but this could have been handled differently.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see this film get a nomination or two from the Golden Globes or the Academy. Matthew Fox turned in a performance that will probably not be given the recognition it is due until later on. I would say when looked at in retrospect, most critics will ask why he did not get a nomination in a supporting role. The same can be said for David Strathairn.<br/><br/>When I heard that McG was directing, I was concerned that he couldn't pull this off. I am impressed with how he handled the subject matter. I am quite pleased with the maturity and sensitivity he showed. I can't say the direction was Oscar-worthy, but I think it deserved a lot more positive feedback than I have seen from critics. It proves that he should not be pigeon-holed as a director who can only do action films. If this film is any indication, McG will soon get his due.<br/><br/>Please take your family to see this film. I think you will be glad that you did."

I saw this with my parents (both Marshall alum) and they said it was very well done and accurate to the story. Indeed, in reviewing the Marshall web site and comments found there, few things were dramatized or changed to make the film.<br/><br/>Since this is a true story, the history is available on the web.

"ccthemovieman-1","9","10","13","15 October 2007"," How To Respond After Tragedy - A Nice Story
","This was a nice movie, interesting all the way, a combination sports film and melodrama and based on a tragic real-life event: a 1970 plane crash that killed 75 people including all but a couple of the players and coaches on the Marshall University football team. <br/><br/>It's a film that when it is over, you're glad you watched it. That's a good endorsement right there.<br/><br/>I only found one scene overdone and a typically hokey, and that's the one football game that is featured more than any other. However, I found the rest of it totally believable and entertaining. Well, I should slight amend that in that Matthew McConaughey's role as head coach ""Jack Lengyel-"" was a little goofy. I question whether the real coach was this ""quirky,"" but I'm not complaining because it made ""Lengyel"" -- in the film - a lot of fun to watch. They probably did that for just for that purpose, and it worked. <br/><br/>The football action is good, the characters are based on real people, it's nicely filmed and moves very fast. The film involves you right from the beginning and is solid entertainment. I can't see where too many people, unless they are hard-hearted cynics, would not enjoy this film.<br/><br/>By the way, check out the bonus feature about ""Living Legends."" It has a half-dozen famous coaches in America give their philosophies on coaching and some of the segments are very interesting with some profound statements in them"
"bkoganbing","10","10","13","28 December 2006"," ""They Don't Know Your Heart""
","Forget the PG rating because some bad words are spoken. This film is one to take the family to. I have to say I was most inspired by the story of a whole university community coming together in the wake of a mind numbing tragedy.<br/><br/>On November 14, 1970 the chartered plane carrying the football team of Marshall University, together with a whole lot of alumni boosters and prominent citizens of Huntington, West Virginia crashed killing the 75 or so people on board. We Are Marshall is the story of how the community and the college found the strength to rebound.<br/><br/>The thing that impressed me the most was how a whole lot of ordinarily disinterested people helped out in the situation. The NCAA is an organization normally criticized for hidebound interpretation of arcane rules. Nevertheless they enabled Marshall University to field a team by granting an exception and allowing them to play freshmen on the varsity squad for the 1971 season.<br/><br/>During the course of the film it's mentioned in passing that Bear Bryant tells the new Marshall football coach Jack Lengyel about a running back he ought to look at. A small, but telling tribute to a college football legend himself who just as easily could have signed that prospect for his own Crimson Tide.<br/><br/>In fact my favorite moment is when Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox go to the University of West Virginia to view some football films for some play ideas for the new squad they're putting together. The coach let's them view them even though he's giving away some of his bag of tricks. At one point two of the West Virginia players come into the room and on their helmets is a tribute to the late Marshall team. Very understatedly moving indeed.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays Jack Lengyel who takes on the Herculean challenge of putting together a team for the next season. He cobbles it together from all kinds of sources, Bear Bryant being one of them. If I was a college jock, McConaughey's the kind of coach I'd hope to be playing for. I'm sure McConaughey's own football background didn't hurt with this performance.<br/><br/>Other performances to watch are Matthew Fox as the surviving assistant coach who did not make the fatal trip, David Strathairn as the Marshall University president who's not a sports fan, but instinctively knows how important it is to carry on and most importantly Anthony Mackie. Mackie is one of the original varsity squad who did not make the fatal trip because of injuries and starts the 1971 season still not 100%. Mackie becomes the prime mover in rallying the school to demand of the board of trustees that football continue. <br/><br/>We Are Marshall transcends just being a sports film. It's one of the best of that genre ever made. But it's a story about the will to carry on even after life deals you a below the belt blow. As such you don't have to be a college football fan to appreciate how the town of Huntington, West Virginia and Marshall University showed their heart and spirit."
"hbhs","9","10","13","21 December 2006"," Inspirational & funny: an excellent historical representation.
","McG has managed to accurately reflect the personality of Huntington, WV & its intimate relationship with Marshall Univeristy true to the time period of the event: 1970. The story could be construed as corny if it was anything but a true historical reflection. McConaughey has stretched to a higher acting level in his off beat character. Having spent considerable time in Huntington and working with Marshall University, I found that the film captured the cultural landscape and the community's rural America personality accurately. Coach Lengyel's movie character is an enjoyable, quirky diversion from the more austere historical figure but legitimately nurtures the film's landscape to considerably broaden audience appeal. For a historical documentary of the event, see ""Ashes to Glory."" For a feel good experience see ""WE ARE...MARSHALL!"""

Their performance as Red Dawson and Nate Ruffin respectively should lead to award consideration. David Staitharn, Ian McShane, January Jones and Matthew McCougnhey did a very nice job as well. Kate Mara's performance as a composite character was at best, average.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the score. Love that 70s music! I also liked the pep band drum beat during some of the critical football scenes.

","Marshall University must be an extraordinary place in Huntington, West Virginia. In the middle of the campus is a fountain that is cut off once a year to honor the football team members who perished in a plane crash in 1970. The community of scholars pauses to honor the young athletes and the coaches who left their football team to struggle with only three varsity players surviving to play on the 1971 team. Of course, Marshall has to regroup and recover slowly from such an immense tragedy.There is some thought at first to simply forfeit the next season. But, gradually Marshall rises from the ashes to reclaim its football greatness. The film includes images and music from the early 1970s to bring this time back 35 years later. Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox are the coaches of the new team, who give much skill and strength to their portrayals. ""We Are Marshall"" becomes a chant among them similar to the effect that ""Never Again"" became for the Jews after the Holocaust. The meaning in both cases is the same courageous defiance in the face of death: ""We Will Survive and Thrive Again."""

Matt and Matt, good job as Jack and Red, both made it happen. Marshall has come a long way since the 1970 crash and shows what teamwork is all about. If the city and University had not supported the team through thick and thin there would never had been a national championship.

Matthew Fox does a good turn as well-you could feel the survivor's guilt in his portrayal of Red. *SPOILER* My favorite part was the President of MU standing in the rain petitioning that guy outside the NCAA building in KC (I forgot his name)-it was spoken from the heart of David S. and I cried.

While the football program lost most of it's players and coaches, the city lost doctors, teachers, fans, and the like.<br/><br/>It is about the story of the city and the university being steadfast and, together, deciding that it must strap on the boots and take the first step forward.

My folks are from Huntington and my grandparents lived across the street from Faifield Stadium and I remember the team that died as I watched them in go through their spring drills in 1970. I remember the anguish of my mother when the news broke and her grief at the loss of friends who died in the crash. I worked in Huntington in the mid 1990s and I have seen what has happened since. I have seen the people of the area rally around a team, the Thundering Herd. That team is the heart of Huntington, which has lost much since then, heavy industry has moved out, and many people have moved away, but the story of the crash and the recovery from it is something inspiring. I cried through a lot of the movie and think it is a story that everyone needs to see, because everyone someday will have to deal with disappointment, disaster and loss. This film shows how to recover and move ahead while honoring those who died or lost those who were dear to them. Moving on doesn't mean forgetting.

Being from the area and being 14 at the time of the incident I remember how tragic it was. I think for a lot of people it was framed by Vietnam and the loss of life there. Almost every person who died in Vietnam was the age of the boys on that team. That spring the kids were killed at Kent State, Two years previous Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy were murdered, in that same area the Silver bridge collapsed, I think 3 years prior. The Marshall incident was just a really heartbreaking end to a really bad year. I remember thinking 70 some died in that plane crash and 50,000 plus had died in Vietnam. I think for a lot of people that crash was a way for everyone to grieve together the loss of their family\friends who had died in Vietnam. I realize that is a lot to pack into a movie but framing it from that perspective might have fixed it more firmly in time and in people's minds.

Their plane crashed killing all seventy five aboard. <br/><br/>How do a University and a small town of 50,000 people respond to a massive tragedy that affected so many students and town residents? This movie is about their struggle to come to grips with that tragedy.<br/><br/>Without bitter rancor and with humility, some felt the University should start up a new football team and persevere through a long rebuilding process to honor the dead. Others, again without rancor and with humility, believed that starting up a football team would be too painful a reminder of the tragedy.<br/><br/>It was decided to start a new football team immediately and play the next season in 1971. This movie is primarily about the difficulties of the development of the team.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays the new Head Coach brilliantly and believably. He is a combination of country bumpkin enthusiastic huckster and a wise man. And he does it simply because he believes – ""Maybe I can help."" He displays courage and perseverance and makes sacrifices with a career move that could throw him out of his beloved profession, head football coaching, forever. <br/><br/>The town and University have to quickly break the Vince Lombardi- like notion that you play the game of football for one reason only – to win. They learn how you play the game matters, and even simply showing up is a kind of victory too."

","'We Are, Marshall!' - any film that can make me want to chant a slogan for a school I have never heard of before, connected to a sport I have no real interest in and make me want to buy a jacket for football team that isn't even in my country when I do wear baseball Jackets anymore has to be doing something right.<br/><br/>Its 1970 and Marshall Football Team are on a high, they lost a game sure, but they're looking good and the coaching staff, the team and several people from the town and parents of many members are returning home from the game on a private jet when moments from landing disaster strikes. Can the surviving players who were left behind rebuild the team for the 1971 season, can the University find new coaching staff and will the morale of the town ever recover? <br/><br/>Such is the true story of the Marshall University Football Team of 1971, as the characters try to pull together, the re-building of the football team comes to illustrate the dilemma everyone is feeling in attempting to rebuild their own lives. <br/><br/>We Are Marshall is a simple story but as a well written script where brevity is key its a bit of an unsung masterclass in my opinion. Watch it a second time and you will see in this film every piece of dialogue in every scene serves a moment for either story or character, while not especially original and close to being in danger of 'true story of the week' WRM is much more than that because of the power and sincerity that is evident here in the film making, you can tell everyone wants to be involved and knows their making something that is a bit special, and they'd be right. It's a strong piece of moving writing that is well performed and I would suggest an extremely honourable way of portraying the suffering of a community that was hit by such a large wave of grief in one go that it does not know how to cope. <br/><br/>'How many children lost both parents?' cries a bereaved father. You cannot help but get caught up in the story. The film is entirely not about football, this is a film about grief and how we deal with it, both individually, collectively and to each other. Matthew McConaughey is at his best here as Jack Lenyel the new football coach and pivot for the story as the stranger who comes into town with boundless energy because he just wants to help 'What if it had been my children' - But look around the cast, this is an ensemble piece where many great actors are starting out early on in their careers. Anthony Mackie powerfully plays Nate Ruffin, who missed out on the game because of an injury, his team mate, conflicted Tom (Brian Geraghty showing his great talent early on) wants to help him re build but has survivors guilt because he overslept and should have been on the plane. But the three stand outs for me were Ian McShane as the grieving father who just wants the football programme to die along with his lost son, Kate Mara who is the bereaved girlfriend of that son, and David Strathairn as the University President who is out of his depth trying to please everyone in a situation he never thought he would have to face. All give solid and believable performances. Special mention must also be made of a young Arlen Escarpeta, the scene where he comes back to his empty room with a case of beer is really moving.<br/><br/>There are so many good scenes in this film its hard to name them all - We Are Marshall really goes for the heart strings, but it should, its a moving story about a group of conflicted people unsure of which direction to take to move on - Do they embrace the football programme and try and move forward or scrap it and try and leave everything behind? <br/><br/>While some time is dedicated to the new team training and the film even manages a few moments of comedy this is above all not a sports movie, sports just happens to be the historical background under which the events take place. Winning seems out of the teams grasp, but is healing? This is the real question the film asks you.<br/><br/>Its well worth your time."

","This movie certainly was a surprise. The only reason why I sat down to watch it was because of Matthew Fox. I myself do like sport but not really a big fan of football.<br/><br/>I didn't think I would enjoy this movie. I really can't understand the American obsession with college football and how small towns seem to revere their young football players as demigods. I am sure the same amount of reverence would not be given to the chess club or the school band. But the shocking loss of so many lives in one accident is a tragedy in any sense of the word - football team or not.<br/><br/>The sheer tenacity and perseverance of Jack Langley (Matthew McConaughey), Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) and the very likable President Dedmon (David Strathairn) really brought the heart into this movie.<br/><br/>The movie sends a good message in - if you want to achieve the improbable then you will have to take the road less traveled. This is portrayed through the rise of the new Marshall University football team after losing most of its much loved players, coaches, officials and fans in the horrific plane crash.<br/><br/>I am still not a fan of football and this movie certainly won't make you into one either but it will make you believe that anything really is possible."

","""We Are Marshall"" is a true story about the tragic plane crash containing almost the entire school's football team back in 1970 and the aftermath that followed (as aftermaths do).<br/><br/>In 1970, the Marshall Football Team chartered a plane back home after a game and the plane crashed into trees not far from their destination. The small community is rocked and everyone is impacted in a great way. After the initial grieving, the school must decide if it will field a team the next year. At first the feeling is to bypass the new season as nearly all the squad has gone, but a few of the remaining players push to do all they can to field a team. They hire coach Jack Lengyel (McConaughey, in a strong, charming performance) to assemble a team and soon find many supporters who will help them get on their feet, notably the NCAA who change a rule for them and their rival school, who assists with some resources. The story focuses on Jack, returning coach Red (Matthew Fox from that stupid ""Lost"" show) and a few of the players who missed the trip due to injury or suspension. It soon becomes clear though they face a huge challenge to be competitive and not embarrass the school. Will they prove to be a Cinderella story or will they suck? A solid movie and a little different to what you may expect from the genre. Fox, McConaughey and David Strathairn are all solid but we don't get to know too much about the players, and the actors who play them seem a little out of their comfort zone. A great story and worth seeing."
"michaelRokeefe","8","3","3","18 December 2007"," Inspirational dramatization of a sports tragedy.
","Based on a devastating true life story that rocked the small town of Huntington West Virgina. In November of 1970, the Marshall University football team was almost home from losing their game against East Carolina University; the plane a mile from home hit treetops on a ridge and crashed into a gully. In the fiery plane perished thirty-seven Marshall players, head coach Tolly(Robert Patrick)and five members of his coaching staff, other school staff, flight crew and twenty-two boosters. School President Don Dedmond(David Stratharin)wanted to indefinitely suspend the football program. For the betterment of the community, Dedmon hires a young new head coach Jack Lengyel(Matthew McConaughey)to continue the program. Assistant coach Red Dawson(Matthew Fox) who missed the fateful flight agreed to help rebuild the Thundering Herd. The NCAA under the circumstances waived their rule of not allowing freshmen to play varsity ball. It would be a slow go for the school and town to recover. This movie tries to show the relationships between the injured players that did not travel on the tragic flight, the new coach and school board of directors and the town trying to heal. Marshall University would slowly rise from the ashes that chocked Huntington West Virginia. Also in the cast: Anthony Mackie, Ian McShane, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Arlen Escarpeta, January Jones and Brian Geraghty."

","""We Are Marshall"" delivers from both an emotional standpoint as well as a story of substance. Matthew Fox and Anthony Mackie clearly shine as the best actors in this film. As a Marshall University alum and Huntington resident, I was concerned that movie-goers unaffiliated with Marshall and the city of Huntington, WV would experience the same heart wrenching feeling of loss for the 1970 Thundering Herd football team that I did. But after viewing it twice, I feel confident that audiences will embrace this story that is rooted so deeply in the Huntington community. Matthew McConaughey delivers an ""awe-shucks"" portrayal of Coach Jack Lengyel and at times is overshadowed by his supporting cast. Director McG deserves high praise for turning an average script into an emotional powerhouse. Well done! ""We Are Marshall"" scores winning marks."

","In this post 9-11 world we need to remember the good and moral qualities we possess as humans. Therefore, I believe only someone made of stone would not see the story of Marshall University and Huntington, W.V. as a great true example of the uplifting human spirit we should all let rise to the top in us.<br/><br/>That said, how is the movie? Simply put...Sincere and impressive! I think the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey as head coach Jack Lengyel, depict what happened in very real terms so as you feel you're watching those people. I wasn't sure McConaughey had it in him to do such a moving portrayal...Bravo! Matthew Fox also does well, but he is doing ""intense with conflict"" which is what he does so well on Lost, thus his acting was not nearly as impressive as McConaugheys.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone regardless of age, race, and gender.

","I found this movie very good (one of my favorites). Only thing is that no such player named ""Chris Griffen"" ever died in this disaster, making one of the major plot lines in this movie fictional. I understand that many families felt pain and went through similar problems as a result of this disaster, the least they could have done was show it from a real family's perspective. I figure they did this out of sympathy for those who were involved, which is a debatable subject. As for the rest of the movie, it seems to hold very close to the real story with real characters and great acting. This movie is very powerful and very touching. I definitely felt its emotional power while in the theater with my girlfriend.. I could only imagine what it could be like to be in that situation.

"colenavy","10","12","18","23 December 2006"," Forget the critics, make up your own mind
","This movie, contrary to what some of the critics might say, is worth your 2 hours and 15 minutes. I just walked out of the theater less than two hours ago, and not a single person moved until the white lights came on. The entire theater was glued to the presentation until the last name flashed across the credits.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie might appear to be ""overacted"", ""clichéd"", ""formulary"", even predictable at some points; but here is what is different from the ""typical football movie"": it's not about the football. This movie is about how both the town of Huntington and the University both handled their collective grief, and how the only way either was going to survive emotionally. Sometimes, we have to ""get back on the horse"" when we fall off, and this story is an example of that.<br/><br/>Matt M spent about 6 weeks with Jack Lengyel before shooting started, and learned as much as he could about not only the story, but the man he was going to portray. He practiced and labored over the hand gestures, catch phrases, facial expressions, clothes and the like that had become known as ""Lengyelisms."" Anyone who thinks that there was anything cliché, overacted, embellished, or exaggerated in this movie know nothing about the story or the people in it. <br/><br/>WHO CARES IF McG DIRECTED THIS MOVIE?!?! Just because someone has a reputation for making campy, silly, slick stuff doesn't mean they do not have the potential to make something serious and uplifting. Sure, I will admit that McG would not have been on my short list of directors considered for a story as poignant and verifiable as this one is. Everything in this movie can be checked out if someone wanted to take the time. The families and friends left behind in Huntington played a very large role in making this happen, and they would not allow anything made-up (except specific dialog in conversations, of course) to even be filmed, much less make it to the final product. Give the man a chance, I think he did a great job, and FINALLY painted West Virginia and West Virginians as more than coal miners, hillbillies, cannibals (The Hills Have Eyes, Wrong Turn) or some other negative stereotype. Thank you McG for finally treating the people of West Virginia like human beings, and fellow Americans, and not a joke.<br/><br/>Go see the movie, put yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself ""how would I have handled this if it were my husband, father, son, brother in that crash?"" What would you have wanted your college or town to do if faced with that kind of tragedy? If you can honestly say that you wouldn't have done the same thing, or something like it, then you wouldn't understand the point, and maybe should have watched ""Eragon"" instead."

"mike-mccracken","10","5","6","25 January 2007"," Great Movie
","A FORMER STUDENT'S REVIEW OF ""WE ARE . . . MARSHALL"" By Michael K. McCracken M.A., 1975 My wife and I recently saw ""We Are Marshall""  or, as it's known around our house, ""THE Movie""  for a second time. We both liked it better the second time; we both picked up on some things in the second viewing, that we missed in the first. We both cried again.<br/><br/>Having attended graduate school at Marshall University shortly after the crash (1973-1975), I watched first-hand as the football team continued its rebuilding process under Coach Lengyel. In fact, the Herd won four games in 1973  as many as in the previous two seasons combined. That 1973 record gave us hope. What we didn't realize was that Reggie Oliver and the others left over from the 1970 team were leaving in 1974. We didn't realize what that loss of experienced players portended for the 1974 season. The Herd won just one game in that year.<br/><br/>I also watched as the student body (myself included), local fans, and local media fried the Coach unmercifully for not yet having a winning program. In looking back at that period, I'm embarrassed by our lack of faith, our lack of conviction, our lack of compassion and understanding for Coach Lengyel. I'm embarrassed by the way a good and decent man was treated.<br/><br/>And on a very personal note: I'm ashamed that I never once asked a friend, a classmate, or a teacher, if they knew anyone on the plane; if they lost anyone to whom they were close. That regret stays with me to this day.<br/><br/>Some people out there are decrying its lack of originality and the director's attempt to break free from the movies he had made in the past. My question to those people is: so what? What's wrong with trying to do something new and different? In business, we call that ""innovation."" But also remember what this movie was not. It was not a music video; it was not ""Charlie's Angels."" What ""THE Movie"" does very well is that it tells a moving, deeply human, and, ultimately, uplifting story in an honest and forthright manner.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized Matthew McConaughey for his characterization of the Coach. Some have said that he was ""over the top"" in his mannerisms and his huckster ism. As a student-contemporary of mine  sports columnist Frank Giardiana  has said, the real Coach Lengyel was more polished, more sophisticated than the McConaughey character.<br/><br/>I remember him that way, as well. But I also remember him as being always positive, always ready to look on the bright side. Coach Lengyel always viewed the glass as ""half full,"" not ""half empty."" As mentioned, in looking back on the situation, I couldn't understand his view. All that I  and many others saw  was a losing team. We never put things into the proper perspective. Coach Lengyel had to view the glass as ""half full."" If he had looked at it any other way, it would have driven him to an early grave. In looking at the Coach's success since leaving Marshall, I'm pleased to see that his view of the world has served him well.<br/><br/>But the McConaughey character works  on several levels. As a coach in an impossible position; as a coach faced with a task that had never been done before, Jack Lengyel brought good will, a sense of humor, humanity, and a deep love of the game to Marshall. He also brought a single-mindedness to the task that only an outsider could have.<br/><br/>At the press conference where Jack Lengyel was introduced to the community, Ernie Salvatore asked the coach how he would respond to criticism that bringing the team back was not a good idea; that it was too soon; that it would just remind people of what they had lost. The Coach's response: ""I'm a football coach."" Right on, Jack! The rest of the cast was also superb. Matthew Fox deserves an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Red Dawson. Although Red was gone by the time I got to Marshall, I certainly heard many stories about him. I often thought that if he had stayed with Coach Lengyel longer than one year, the team's won-loss record would have been better.<br/><br/>Donald Dedmon was also gone by the time I got to Marshall. But again, everything I heard about him was positive. Yes, he was a true academic. And, no, he didn't understand much about football. But he saw his role as University President  as President of the entire University  as one where he could help the school and the community dig themselves out of the hole they were in.<br/><br/>Dr. Dedmon was a true academic. But he also understood the importance of a football program to the school and the community. He knew that football was an important part of the life of a university and he was bound and determined to put that life back into Marshall. The success of the Herd in the 1990's speaks to Dr. Dedmon's vision. David Strathairn's quiet, understated performance captured Don Dedmon perfectly.<br/><br/>And, finally, on a personal note: the two years I spent at Marshall were the two best years of my single life. My M.A. was in Speech, but I learned far more about life and the true purpose of a college education. Those things have stuck with me far longer than my memories of ""the theory of cognitive dissonance."" There have been a few people in my life whom I've truly respected and looked up to  four of them were Marshall professors: Dottie Johnson, Bill Denman, Ace Kellner, and Jerry Huang.<br/><br/>(Mike McCracken lives in suburban Cincinnati, with Pat, his wife of 27 years. They have two adult children: Adam, 22 and Emily, 19. He may be reached via e-mail at: mailto:mike-mccracken@cinci.rr.com)."

","On the same day, Nov. 14, 1970, that a chartered Southern Airways Dc-9 707 jet plowed into a foothill in Huntington, West Virginia, a cyclone-driven tidal wave swept through the Bay of Bengal, killing thousands of Pakistanis.<br/><br/>And even though only 75 aboard the jetliner perished, that story led the news for days after its occurrence. Of course, the real news was not the number of casualties on board, it was the specifics of who was lost that rainy evening.<br/><br/>Among the 75 dead that night was most of the Marshall University football team (only four injured varsity players did not make the trip); the squad was coming home from Greenville, North Carolina, after dropping an afternoon game to the East Carolina Pirates, 17-14.<br/><br/>Also killed were most of the club's coaching staff, including skipper Rick Tolley and Marshall Athletic Director Charles Kautz; as well as a state legislator, several Huntington city and civic leaders, six physicians and a group of prominent Marshall Thundering Herd boosters.<br/><br/>The National Transportation & Safety Board was unable to determine the reason for the crash, although the two most likely explanations were improper use of cockpit instrument data; or an altimeter system error. Whatever the reason, the school, the town and especially the families and loved ones of those left behind had to endure a searing, white hot grief that only comes which such a sudden and tragic loss.<br/><br/>Thirty-six years later, the pain is still intense in many areas of Huntington, and the newest Warner Bros. feature, ""We Are Marshall,"" captures the mood and feeling of what it must to have been like on that memorable night of Nov. 14 so long ago.<br/><br/>Director Joseph McGinty Nichol (better known as ""McG"") does a brilliant job here, making a sports movie that transcends the game and becomes an instant classic. Fine attention is paid to period detail (just look at the DC-9 jet in the background scenes early in the picture; its the same model that actually crashed while descending into Tri-State Airport), and the enterprise smacks of amazing authenticity.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting. In my opinion, Academy Award nominations should go to Matthew McConaughey (who plays replacement coach Jack Lengyel) for lead actor; while David Strathairn (""Good Night and Good Luck""), who plays the university president Donald Dedmon, and Anthony Mackie, as injured player Nate Ruffin, should pick up supporting nods (I know this won't happen, but it should).<br/><br/>After the devastating crash, most people in the town (and on the university board) would prefer to suspend the program, but Ruffin and most of the students feel different. A reluctant Dedmon sides with the latter group, but faces an uphill battle when he can find neither a coach to take Tolley's place or a sympathetic NCAA willing to let freshman players start for the varsity.<br/><br/>Enter goofy, playful Lengyel, whose slow southern drawl hides a quick and complex mind. He not only convinces assistant coach Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) to come back to the team (Dawson had given up his seat to Kautz at the last-minute and suffered survivor's guilt ever since), but he persuades Dedmon to petition the NCAA to grant Marshall an exception to the freshman rule.<br/><br/>In a great scene, Lengyel also gets rival West Virgina coach Bobby Bowden to help the Thundering Herd learn the veer offense. ""You're good,"" cracks Bowden. ""You're really good."" Still, with virtually no team, no chance to recruit quality players and the cloud of the disaster still hanging over the squad; this new group is expected to fail and only draw sympathy crowds for many seasons to come. Lengyel does his best to make sure that doesn't happen.<br/><br/>A truly memorable motion picture with fine direction and terrific performances. One of the best pictures of 2006, by far."

","OK. So I rated it a ten because I am biased. I live in Huntington West Virginia. The Home of Marshall University and the Thundering Herd. Having known many of the people who lost loved ones in the plane crash that claimed 75 members of the Team, Coaches, Boosters and our Local Civic Leaders I was a little nervous when I heard last year that Hollywood was coming to Huntington to film on a subject so close to our hearts. The plane crash completely and totally dissolved us into tears that was years in healing. As the film says at the end. In the 70's there was nobody that lost more games than Marshall. It was a great deal of blood and tears and back breaking work that made the team rise from ashes to glory in the eighties and nineties. I went to watch the filming with baited breath like many here. Hoping beyond hope that Hollywood would not represent us as Backwoods hillbilly's sitting on bales of hay and spitting tobacco juice everywhere. That is not who we are at all and would of been very unfair. But in seeing this movie they pulled no shots. They came here, They sat down with us and in the end they told our story to the very best of their ability. I think of myself as a pretty hard guy and I have to confess. I came out of the theater with tears in my eye's. To see just what it took for the team to get that first win and how nobody thought it possible in that first season after the crash. It did a lot to sooth and heal the community at large. Red Dawson I know very well. He built the house I live in with his construction company. I thought it depicted him very well. Matthew Fox did a brilliant job as did the rest of the cast. McG. The Director no matter where he lives is now and forever a citizen of Huntington West Virginia as we have adopted him as a part of our community. Brilliant Movie, True to life for the most part. Nat Ruffins part gave homage to the great man he was in life. He truly did keep the Herd alive when most of it died in the crash. I urge everyone to go see WE ARE MARSHALL.

"GBarraxjr","10","9","13","25 December 2006"," Moving and surreal
","This is a good film, but it's especially poignant, moving, and even surreal for those of us who attended Marhall University. I graduated from Marshall in 1983, which means I wasn't there during the year of the tragic plane crash or the subsequent year that's the focus of this movie. But no one can attend MU and not be aware of, and affected by the legacy of that team. There are annual memorials, and the landscape of the campus is itself a memorial to those fallen athletes and their associates. And the Marshall football team achieved such stellar success in the 90's, just two decades after having been decimated, that the story of the Thundering Herd demanded to be brought to the silver screen. In fact, over the past few years, as I relate to friends the amazing comeback of the Marshall football program, I have often said that it seems like something out of a movie. So it's about time somebody made a movie about it. The film's final line, ""from the ashes, we rose"" is perfectly appropriate. During my freshman year at Marshall, the Herd won the first game of the season--and lost all the rest. That was typical Marshall football. In 1984, the whole city was delirious over the team's first winning season. So when the team went on to win two Division IAA national championships, then dominate the MAC in division IA and win several bowl games, producing back-to-back Heismann trophy candidates, (Randy Moss and Chad Pennington) in the process, it just seemed like something out of fairy tale. Something from a movie. <br/><br/>And that brings me to the surreal aspect of watching this film. I've never seen a movie before that was filmed entire on location in a town in which I had lived. From the first sequence showing the steel mill adjacent to the campus to the epilogue including a closeup of Keith Morehouse (with whom I worked at WSAZ TV for three years), the entire film just felt surreal. I kept noticing familiar scenes and names. Places I'd been, walked, studied, lounged, and loved. The scene between Nate and Tom where Tom tells him about his misgivings was filmed on the seventh floor of Harris Hall, right above the art department where I spent most of my time obtaining my B.F.A. in commercial art. The floodwall is a place I've walked on sunny days. I've played on the basketball court outside the Twin Towers where the wide receiver was recruited. I watched the movie with my family and it was difficult for us to see it without constantly acknowledging these points of contact. I kept shushing my wife, as she pointed out to our children places we'd been and people we know. But by the end of the film, I was doing it too. <br/><br/>Besides being hauntingly familiar, the movie was emotionally powerful. The performances of McConughey,(as Coach Lengyel) Straitharn (as Dr. Dedmon), and Anthonie Mackie (as Nate Ruffin) were so intense I came close to sobbing more than once. To say this film is a tearjerker is an understatement. I cannot imagine the impact it will have on those who lived through it.<br/><br/>And based on being true to fact, I do have one nitpick. The ""We are Marshall chant"" for which the film is named, was not done properly. The chant is a tradition from the football stadium in which Herd fans on one side of the stadium will chant ""We Are..."" and the fans on the opposite side will respond ""MARSHALL!"". It is not done in rapid-fire succession as shown in the crowd scene in the film. It has a slow and powerful cadence that reverberates from one side of the field to the other inspiring the fans and the team and intimidating visitors. The impact of that chant is dredged up from the double inferiority complex that underlies Marhall's communal identity. It's a small university in a state that nobody respects where it plays second fiddle to the state's only well known university, WVU. This ""red-headed stepchild"" status was alluded to in the film but it couldn't really be communicated that well in the overall scheme of the film's agenda. It's hard to fully understand the resonance of that chant unless you've grown up in WEST (by God) Virginia, which most Americans don't recognize as a separate state and attended a university that continually gets passed over for funding and recognition (WVU is the only West Virginia university with a law school. Therefore, the state legislature continues to award it a disproportionate share of state revenue and resources). In short, America doesn't respect West Virginia and West Virginia doesn't respect Marshall University. That double underdog mentality is what makes Marshall fans' chant so powerful and binding. It's a chant of identity and defiance. We are NOT a bunch of ignorant hillbillies. We are NOT an insignificant school lost in the shadow of WVU. We are...MARSHALL!<br/><br/>So, as a Marshall alum, and a 20 year resident of Huntington, WV, I obviously cannot offer an objective review of this film. But I can say that if you want to see an honest portrayal of one of college football's most amazing stories, go see We Are Marshall."

I was just going in the theater to see another movie that i thought would be really good because i love football movies.. and little did i know that this was going to be the best movie i have ever seen. when i left that theater tears were still falling down my face. The whole theater stayed until the end even after you think the movie is over there's more. so def stay for it. the movie is really good and then the ending tops it off. this is a true story and when they are playing football it feels like your really there. i take my hat off to all the young men, the coaches, and to everyone of those 75 people that died that day when the airplane crash. i am sorry to all friends and family of those wonderful people. this is a must see movie. #1 in my book.

","I saw this movie in a special engagement tonight and was aw-struck by the level of directing in this movie, because so often we get regurgitated stuff over and over. This movie is probably the best role I have ever seen Matthew McConaughey in. It makes you sad it ,makes you happy, it makes you laugh, it makes you cheer. I usually don't bother myself with trying to figure what movies will win awards or not but this is one of them. As an example at the end of the movie when the credits start no one stood up in a full theater, not 1 person you could have heard a pin drop. No one moved till the credits were all over and it didn't just get a courtesy clap it got a serious feeling clap. This movie has its tragic parts and its laughing parts and during the extremely hard hitting scenes the ow that must have hurt parts. This is not a football lovers movie, or a sad dramatic scenes person movie its a everyone movie. I'm going to see it again and bring a friend and I guarantee this will become part of my DVD collection when it comes out."

","I grew up in Huntington, so this movie really hit home. This tragedy really effected me because my Dr. and his wife were on that plane. I now live in Dunedin, Fl near Clearwater. Since there are quite a few families from Huntington in this area we were honored with a private viewing at a local theater last night. This movie kept us crying and cheering as the same time. At the end of the movie no one got up and left until the screen went dark. It was so quiet, except for some of us still quietly crying, you could hear a pin drop. This beautiful story was told with honor and dignity to Marshall and the people of Huntington. The actors didn't seem like they were acting, but were the people they were portraying. The photography, the quality and the love that went into this movie will last a lifetime. We are so honored to have one of the best University and City in the country. Let always remember that. Oh, by the way women and men, don't forget to bring lots of tissues, you will need them. <br/><br/>And as always: WE ARE MARSHALL _________________ Rosemary S.M."

","This Movie is a little over two hours long and doesn't drag one minute of the 2 hours. Of course this is a human interest story that makes many points for everyone to ponder in their own way. The location of the movie is set in West Virginia, but the story line would apply to any State. I will be very surprised if you come out of this movie thinking that you didn't just see a Great Movie . The acting in this movie is better than good. Matthew has out done himself in this movie. He seemed to not only fit the part of the Coach, but before you leave the theater you will believe that he was the Coach. I highly suggest that you take your whole family to this movie A.S.A.P.

"celiselott","10","6","8","29 December 2006"," Honoring the Dead and the Living
","In a world where cynicism reigns and any sincerity is regarded as corny ""We Are Marshall"" chose to honor a town and ignore the critics. May reviews I have read spoke about how corny the movie was but I can only believe that it is because of the prevailing cynicism of our society. The characters were believable and I had no problem laughing and crying with them. There were even times in the movie where I felt like clapping along with the fans. ""We Are Marshall"" can take it's place among other great sports movies like ""Hoosiers"" and ""Miracle"". So go see the movie, and continue to remember the town that rose from the ashes and helped each other recover from great tragedy."

I have no particular emotional ties to the crash, except that it happened at my school and in my town.<br/><br/>I went into the movie, trying to be objective as possible given my close proximity to the story, and I have to say that We Are Marshall really is a more-than-worthwhile movie. I was brought to tears several times - real tears, not ""I'm supposed to cry here"" tears - and McConaughey made me chuckle more than once. Matthew Fox and Anthony Mackie give excellent, believable performances.<br/><br/>I found the screenplay to be well-written, the direction was good, and the ending of the Xavier game was unforgettable.<br/><br/>Give this movie a shot.

","I was very unsure when i first went to go see this movie, because I can't get into sports movies that much. When I walked out of that theater I was so happy I went. An amazing true story about a tragedy that happened to the Marshall University Football Team, the town, and many fans. When a plane crash takes the life of 75 players, coaches, and fans Marshall tries to rebuild the football program into a winning team. Even the least emotional people watching this film will find themselves holding back there tears. The cast chosen for this film was amazing and brought the movie to life. They showed the dedication and heart that was really given off the time of this tragedy. This is a must see movie, everything about it is wonderful. The plot, the soul, the actors, the storyline, the tears. It is all very wonderful!"

","I was hesitant going to this movie because of the bad critics reviews. They missed this one terribly. My wife and I both enjoyed the movie very much. We Are Marshall is an outstanding movie, makes you cry, and laugh, and cheer. A real true story without changing names or adding fictions for suspense. The actors all did and excellent job portraying the real people to perfection. The movie did not drag out and get boring at any time. After seeing the movie I'm even prouder of Marshall than before. They have come a long way and deserve to have their story told. A very moving story that everyone must go and see. Judge for yourself not from the bad critics. All I want to know is who called those reviewers critics. They need to get a real job."
"ChicagoGirl16","7","6","8","27 December 2006"," A feel-good sports movie
","An upbeat, positive feel-good sports movie that will also appeal to non-sports fans. Fun and hopeful without being sentimental. The audience was reluctant to leave the theater when it was over -- they wanted the movie to continue. An uplifting movie based on actual events. The tragic, shocking plane crash that killed 75 people is deftly handled off screen. The director showed commendable restraint in not creating a gory crash scene. Instead, the film focuses on the emotional trauma the crash inflicts on the entire town. The only injuries graphically portrayed in the film occur on the football field. This film emphasizes the fact that you don't have to win a bowl game, to be a winner. Okay, there is about 60 seconds near the end that is over-sentimental, but I guess the director was entitled. Be sure to stick around for shots of the movie stars with their real-life counterparts."
"stuff-249","10","7","10","29 December 2006"," lived there, saw that!
","I moved to Huntington in 1972 and had friends in school with no parents or only one, because of the crash, and watched the comeback while I lived with the story. I went to Marshall from 1976-1980, and saw nearly every football game because I helped televise them or I shot photos for various publications. The movie is dead on. It is a tear-jerker, very true to the story, and one of Hollywood's better renditions of a true story. There are scenes that are over acted, and a little dramatization, but the bottom line is that the story of the Marshall Thundering Herd football program from November 14, 1970 until September 1971 was told with tact, talent and everything good about a movie. I highly recommend it."

","I just got home from seeing this movie. It truly was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I would watch it again right now. Warning...you probably need Kleenex if you are female (grin)...very intense, quite a tearjerker and very heartwarming. I loved the footage at the end the update about everyone and their lives after the movie. MU just gained a new fan. My dad was from WV and I wish he was still alive to see this wonderful movie.

"lonelyonly15","10","7","10","29 December 2006"," Amazing - We ARE Marshall
","I saw We Are Marshall last night for my 17th birthday. I have to say that although I had a little bit of background knowledge about the crash, I didn't really know the whole story. We Are Marshall portrayed the storyline in a passionate, intense way that I will never forget.<br/><br/>My friend Paige Winters died in the Comair plane crash in Kentucky in August, so the movie brought back a flood of emotions surrounding that, but it drew me in from the start. Matt Fox and Matthew McConaughey and the rest of the cast did an excellent job of making the audience feel as though the story was actually happening as it was being watched.<br/><br/>Don't go to see this movie expecting a peppy, Remember-the-Titans-esquire sports movie. If you don't know anything about sports, it doesn't matter. Instead, I suggest that you see the movie thinking about your family and friends and what matters most. It's not about right or wrong. Sometimes winning is everything, but this movie brings a whole new perspective to the table.<br/><br/>We Are Marshall definitely wins my vote for the Oscars. It's not just another movie, and it's not just another football story. If you've seen Matt Fox in Lost or Matthew McConaughey in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days... forget all of that.<br/><br/>This is a story for the ages and a kind of movie we don't see very often anymore. It's not violent or fake or fluffy - it's real."

It is not your ordinary Hollywood football movie but it still works well. <br/><br/>Also when you think it is over it is not just a little bit longer as their is a slide show at the end where the credits are just after the restarting of the fountain in present day.<br/><br/>All in all go see it for yourself and you will be truly touched!"

","Until watching Jay Leno last Thursday evening (the 21st), I didn't know there was a movie about this terrible tragedy. My hubby and 21 year old son went to the show yesterday to see this excellent and truly moving film. When my 24 year old daughter was deciding on what college to go to, I found Marshall and read about his tragedy and couldn't understand why I had not heard about or read about this horrific tragedy, as I come from a football family. My dad was a junior high football coach, high school and college football coach and by the time he passed away, he was in administrative duties in the NFL. He had been an active official for 22 years, working 2 Super Bowls. As everyone has been saying, this is a film that everyone will absolutely love, whether you are a sports fan or not. My hubby isn't a sports fan and ABSOLUTELY loved this film!!! I, too, was surprised this excellent film was not nominated for a Golden Globe. I hope Matthew Fox gets an Oscar Nomination. I loved the soundtrack. I was only 22 when this tragedy occurred and I also want to remind everyone that my daughter did choose Marshall to attend, but because of so much stress of school, job and just being newly pregnant, she came back home to our small town in southeastern Washington. She told me she has pictures of the fountain by the hub. But, take a bunch of Kleenex. You'll need it. The film is VERY uplifting and because this true story epitomized the whole town, not just the college, makes this a story that really gets to the root of what life is all about and why America is great and should be proud."

We just choose not to be as involved/verbal as the rest of the world. The citizens of WV have always been there supporting who and what they feel is important to them.

"ppak11","6","8","12","14 December 2006"," Winning isn't everything - a Study of Grief and Team building
","I was too young to comprehend the news of the disastrous accident in 1970 but I still recalled it with ease when I 1st heard of this movie. It's an enormous story to attempt, certainly rich in real-life drama. The movie abjectly honors the memory of those lost in this tragedy, and it attempts to make us all feel what it must have been like to endure it for all the families and friends. It has some fine motivational speeches, it oozes with heart. It's your tear jerker. It's uneven though. Some quiet scenes are splendid, the dramatic scenes, not so.<br/><br/>The plot followed the stories of grief thru the eyes of several couples and players. Director McG adores extreme close-up shots of faces and eyes. So the two handsome Matts acting skills were tested. They both did very well. Also fine performances from David Straithairn, as the President of the University, and Anthony Mackie, as a tough corner-back who did not make the flight due to an injury. Ian McShane seemed to have tears in his eyes in every shot. Kate Mara was also lovely and admirable as the fiancÃ© of McShane's lost son.<br/><br/>The music of the film was one part great sixties pop hits and two parts weepy violins and pianos which would serve well as the score for ""The Titanic II"" . It's lovely music but it was cloyingly used as the barometer of good times and bad times. One sub-plot that doesn't really help is of the forlorn player who felt he cheated death and let his team down with no chance for redemption.<br/><br/>The movie picks up when the two Matts start to recruit and rebuild the team. Overcomeing many obstacles including the NCAA, they get some help from unexpected places.<br/><br/>I'm a football fan so I expected good game action. That doesn't happen. Instead, everything is in super slow motion, again so close up you can't follow any of the natural ebb and flow of the sport. When the football hangs in the air during the hail Mary passes, the band swells, McG cuts to every key face in the story, time and belief are suspended as gravity fails. Some might call that movie magic but I'd advise the director to place more trust in the game of football. Remember the scene when ""The Natural's"" hyper-dramatic home run sets off the fireworks at the end of that ""baseball"" movie? These overblown dramatics just weaken the scenes.<br/><br/>The good citizens of West Virginia are the true stars of this movie, the true herd, the real thing, an American team."
"VOSOT99_US","10","8","12","13 December 2006"," Incredible!
","I will sum it up very quickly, this move was absolutely incredible. Go see it, it is far more than a football movie, it is an American movie.<br/><br/>From Matthew McC's great performance to Matthew Fox to David Straithairn, everyone got into this role.<br/><br/>I played football with a guy whose dad was a coach on this team and he never got the chance to meet his dad and thru this movie, he gets, according to people who were around at this time, a great insight to what it was like back then, the accident, the tragedy and finally, the healing that everyone went thru.<br/><br/>Definitely a must, must-see!"

","On a rainy evening, November 14, 1970, I first learned of the tragedy that ultimately pulled me to attend Marshall University. I attended Marshall in the rebuilding days of the mid 70's, when many of the emotions so brilliantly captured in the movie were still evident around campus. We Are Marshall captures this moment in Marshall and sports history with uncanny accuracy.<br/><br/>The film very vividly depicts that fateful night in 1970, but that is only the beginning of the story. Coach Jack Lengyel is played incredibly by Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox as Red Dawson is equal in his brilliance in his role. The rest of the supporting staff rounds out a very well acted film.<br/><br/>The storyline is as close to what actually happened as one would hope in a true story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was extremely pleased with the entire experience presented in this film. Tears were shed, but that is to be expected from anyone of the Herd Faithful.<br/><br/>We Are.....MARSHALL!"
"tony-camel","5","4","5","5 March 2007"," We are ready...
","Just about every actor gets at least one big moment to cry. That's a given in a story of this nature, and some of them are better than others. Mackie's stoic attempt to take punches in an injured shoulder is full of passion, but Fox's random breakdown is, well, just like a flashback from Lost. He is better on the field, showing us a side to his personality we haven't seen yet. Strathairn seems the most sympathetic as the pained authority figure making tough decisions. Mara (Brokeback Mountain) looks so innocent you just want to hold her hand and stroke her hair every time she wells up. Aside from that, there's also a lot of personality in the film. McConaughey leads the team with a gleam in his eye and a smirk on his lips, but it never comes across as insensitive. He's hip, so of course he's the one who can lead them out of tragedy. And as an ensemble film, the cast comes together as a community, in which a single tragedy can affect them all, and a single victory can give them hope."

I went in without any preconceived notions, and came out a very delighted movie goer. If you like great story movies, then there is no doubt you have to see this one. If you don't, well, your loss. The character development was outstanding as I obtained a great sense of what each was going through, especially the new coach coming in with no connection to the tragedy, and the surviving coach who returned which had deep connections to everything that happened with the tragedy. The contrast between the two and seeing them come together is just wonderfully portrayed. All I can say is ""Wow""! (Oh, and watch closely during the closing credits and you'll see Chad)"

The fact that the depictions included many shots of men letting their emotions out, even to the point of crying, was very cathartic to many, I'm sure. Seeing different races bonding so closely was good to see too. The Christian references were much appreciated, especially in this day and age.

Many Triumph/Tragedy stories fall short, but this one delivers.<br/><br/>I rank this above other great football flicks such as Rudy, Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights.<br/><br/>My first clue that this was going to be a good film was when I read the poor reviews by some of the dolts who make a living writing about films they don't see, much less understand.<br/><br/>If you only see one film this holiday season, consider ""We Are Marshall"".

","I have to admit that the only reason I went to see We Are Marshall was because I am from and still reside in WV. Also, I will say that I hate sports movies. However, I really loved this movie. It was a very touching movie and brought me to tears a couple of times. Matthew McConaughey did a great job in this movie. This is a good movie to take your family to see. The movie builds up very quickly to the plane crash. It is mostly about the University and the community and how everyone pulled together to rebuild the team, despite the wishes of others. The story really gets good when you see all of the things the few varsity members that were left, coaches and even the President, have to overcome to rebuild a team. I'm not going to talk too much about the movie - just go see it! You won't regret it!"

","I just saw ""We Are Marshall"" again on cable, and again I wept.<br/><br/>I vaguely remember seeing the story in our local newspaper on page 1, below the fold (I was 10 at the time) and remember being stunned by the idea that a football team was there one moment and largely gone the next. A few years later I had classmates who had moved from Huntington to our home town, but I never thought to ask them about it until recently.<br/><br/>One scene I would like to acknowledge among many outstanding ones is a conversation between Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) and Coach Lengyel (Matt McConnaughey), where Coach Lengyel was trying to convince the team captain that his playing time was done. Mackie, in a performance that should have garnered him at least an Oscar nomination, had been the too-brave face of the survivors, but Lengyel, who cared deeply for his players, the team, and the University, finally broke Ruffin, as he dissolved into tears in grief and frustration and anger. I felt both characters' all-consuming pain as Lengyel kept smacking Ruffin's injured shoulder when Ruffin would insist that ""(his) shoulder's fine"".<br/><br/>In my lifetime, I have seen good sports movies and bad ones--and this is a great one--perhaps one of the best ever made."

"zkonedog","10","2","2","12 March 2017"," A MUST WATCH For All Sports (Especially Football) Fans
","At its core, this film tells the story of the Marshall College football program of 1971, when a year earlier nearly the entire team was wiped out in a plane crash and thus the entire team had to be rebuilt. Sadly, this is a true story, and this film is able to capture the essence of the entire story in two ways:<br/><br/>First, not only is the building of the football team extremely difficult, but more importantly was the rebuilding of the community after the tragedy, and director McG captured that emotional period brilliantly, showing how members of the school and community grappled with the issue of putting a team on the field (and risk dredging up bad memories) or scrapping the football program altogether. While some people yearn to see the green and white colors on the playing field, others are haunted by those memories and would prefer to keep them at an arms length, the conflict that provides the emotional punch to the film.<br/><br/>Just as important, however, is the quality of the acting. Matthew McConaughey breaks away from his traditional ""brainless"" or ""hunk"" movie roles to portray Coach Jack Lengyl, who brought football back to Marshall. McConaughey nails this role, bringing the enigmatic coach to life. Also impressive is Kata Mara in the role of Annie Cantrell, whose personal struggles mirror the struggles of the entire community. However, it is Matthew Fox (""Jack"" of LOST fame) who really steals the show. Playing a Marshall coach not on the doomed plane, Fox is brilliant in portraying the conflicting emotions (relief, sorrow, regret, anger, guilt, etc.) that arise from such a complicated, emotional situation. It has been a long time since I have seen an actor be so good at playing emotionally conflicted characters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very inspirational, yet also quite sorrowful film that will take you on an emotional roller-coaster. Yet, even in its most emotional moments, there always seems to exist a light at the end of the tunnel, or a way that things can start to be okay after such a tragedy. Though you likely already know how the situation turned out, that knowledge will not stop you for rooting on the Marshall boys all the same!"

","The unspeakable biographical film traces a plane crash that wiped out an entire college football team, coaches, cheerleaders, parents and others,is well realized in the picture.<br/><br/>Losing a coach that preached that winning is the most important objective, the college looks to suspend the program until they see the people in the town demonstrate for it to continue.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is a daunting task in total rebuilding and Matthew McConaughey delivers a knockout performance, which should have been recognized by the Motion Picture Academy, as the bubbly new coach, recognizing the huge task that was before him, while stressing that coming to terms with what occurred and going on is more important than just winning. The only thing that I can say is that these films tend to become quite preachy and that is true in McConaughey's delivery.<br/><br/>Still a very good film dealing with extremely difficult subject matter is to be treasured."
"WorthlessKnowledge","Null","2","2","6 November 2014"," Which actor gave the best performance?
","Many great reviews here, film is good, maybe not great, but good. But we feel MATTHEW FOX (as Coach Red Dawson) gave the best performance of all of them. Yes, through most of the characters here we feel the pain of the people, school, the town, the state. But Fox NAILS this role completely! He totally owns the 'emotional portrayal' of the loss that they all feel in each and every scene he's in - and each time he brings us to tears!<br/><br/>As an example of one of our favorite scenes: Coach Dawson (Fox) is in the locker room after their first win, crying his eyes out, all alone. And then the elderly team janitor walks in and congratulates the coach on his win. But in an awe-inspiring moment, the coach then, in turn, congratulates {the janitor} on the TEAM's win ('congratulations to you too, Jimmy'). <br/><br/>That simple statement is beautiful and priceless just in itself: Everyone plays a part, everyone is important to the team - even the 'lowly' janitor. This wonderful message permeates the film, and it will move you beyond belief when you recognize it for what it truly is . . .<br/><br/>""You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him."" — Malcolm S.

","Not a great movie, but hard to dislike. Fairly conventional against- all-odds sports movie, with a tragedy as background. Furthermore, it feels overwrought. Everything is over-dramatized and over- sentimentalized. The director blatantly manipulates the audience with syrupy sentiment and grandiose gestures.<br/><br/>However, it is difficult to dislike. The whole pulling-oneself-up-by- one's-bootstraps plot is well done, and given due attention. There is also an emotional impact of the team's progress. And who doesn't like a good sports story, especially when it's based on a true story...?<br/><br/>Solid performance by Matthew McConaughey in the lead role. Good support from Matthew Fox, Anthony Mackie, David Strathairn, Kate Mara and Ian McShane."

My nephew is in his senior year and has so many great memories.<br/><br/>I just saw the movie this year and I can understand now why my nephew chose Marshall University. It was so moving.

The college decides to restart the program after initially putting it on hold. The search for a coach - Jack Lengyel - whom Matthew McConaughey plays exceptionally well. The meeting with Bobby Bowden, a future football Hall of Famer, who graciously allows the new Marshall coaching staff to scout his team. A well-done movie that avoids becoming maudlin. A must-see. I can think of no real 'buts'. One would have wanted to seem more of what became of Jack Lengyel after his short career there. But, after all, this is a story about the college and football team, though he was a major factor."
"antonjsw1","8","2","2","4 May 2013"," Excellent effort from director McG and the cast
","After two Charlie's Angels movies, you would think a director you would NOT choose to do this film would be McG. Well all I can say is this film-maker has definitely scored a touchdown with this movie! His directing is restrained and he lets the excellent script (by Joe Linden) really shine through great performances from key members of the cast. The true standout is a terrifically charismatic but wonderfully accessible and empathic performance by Matthew McConaughey. He is ably supported by Lost's Matthew Fox, Anthony MacKie, David Strathairn and the rest of the cast who give intense but understated performances. McG wisely lets the performances shine in this movie, but brings strong filmmaking contributions, notably great filming of the football game sequences; the aftermath of a major event early on in the film; Christophe Beck's great musical score, and Shane Hurlbut's stylish but subtle photography.<br/><br/>The film's themes are powerful , yet accessible to a wide audience, and some of the emotional reaction comes across as genuine rather than overtly sentimental. Certainly the themes of never giving up, never accepting the status quo, never accepting the easy way out, as well as how people pull together in a crisis to overcome a tragedy, make this a very satisfying and enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Congratulations to both cast and crew."

"idnar_10","8","2","2","29 April 2012"," We Are Marshall is a movie about overcoming adversity
","Reader be warned that this could contain a spoiler. As it is based on a true story and all of the information is out there anyway, it is probably not; however, if you do not know the story then stop now. The film We Are Marshall is based on a true story. It is about the 1970 Marshall Football team that died in a plane crash, but it is also about so much more; this is a film is also about overcoming adversity. The film begins with the team and their coach as they lose a game against East Carolina University. After the loss, the team boards the plane to fly back to Huntington WV. Two of the coaches have a discussion about who will stay to do a recruiting visit and who will fly back with the team. Coach Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) ends up staying to do the visit. The plane crash happens very early in the movie because the movie is not really about the plane crash itself, but about what happens after that. Two of the recurring issues throughout the film are grief and survivors guilt. There is grief from the parents of players and families of the coaches and boosters who died in crash. Much of the story is about Annie (Kate Mara) who was the fiancée of the quarterback who died. Coach Dawson and one of the surviving players deal with survivor's guilt because they were both supposed to be on the plane. The university faces the decision of whether to try to field a team for the next season or to indefinitely suspend the program. There is a moving scene where the students of the university make it known to the board of trustees that they want the program to continue. Coach Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) contacts the university to let them know he is interested in the coaching position. A touching visit between the university president Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) and the coach ensues. Coach Lengyel ends up leading the team to 2 victories that season. Marshall's football program does survive and thrives in the 1980s. This film is sad early on but develops into a feel-good football movie in the vein of The Blindside or Remember the Titans. One difference between We Are Marshall and those two movies is that they are both about overcoming issues off the field to accomplish great things on the field. This movie is about overcoming issues on the field to help resolve issues off the field. The movie does great at recreating the period and location of 1970's Huntington, WV. There is a scene where Coach Red is working on building a shed. He and coach Lengyel are standing atop the structure and you can get a glimpse of the scenery around them. I have been to the area and it did give the same feeling. Overall, a great movie that tells a story about a university and city that overcame great loss and found their way through the sport of football."
"m-gerber","Null","2","2","20 August 2009"," Wichita State
","Six weeks before the crash of the Marshall University football team, Wichita State suffered the same loss when one of two planes crashed in the mountains of Colorado on their way to Utah. I felt the same sick feeling when I learned of this news and watching the movie brought it all back. I felt it would have been nice to give Wichita State just a brief word if nothing more than a nod to them. As a Shocker fan it was one of the worst moments in my life. However, I understand this was about Marshall but since the two tragedies of mid-major universities happened so closely together that it would have been a nice gesture. Also, Marshall has been able to stay in football while WSU dropped their program. I have to say, too, that I have a special place in my heart for Marshall and am always happy to hear when they win."

","We Are Marshall was a good movie.

My brother passed away a week later on the Nov. 17th.<br/><br/>Coincidently my brother's passing was just three days after the anniversary of the 1970 Marshall tragedy. In my opinion We are Marshall is a story about how to move forward from a tragedy and by doing so is paying respect to those who's lives are lost. To this day I wonder if my brother knew that and was why he chose to watch We are Marshall.<br/><br/>I have shared this movie with other siblings as a Remembrance to my brother and some day I hope to visit the fountain on campus where time stands still on November 14.

","Over the past few years, the movie theatres have been packed full of inspiration sports movies. Sure, there have always been films like that, but the past few years has definitely had a rise in the trend. One of the most popular types is the 'rise from the bottom' story. . . especially football. 'We Are Marshall' is one of those.<br/><br/>The story is one that most know: After the plane carrying Marshall University's football team crashes, killing nearly all on board, the players and coaches remaining decide to fight the odds and rebuild the team, continuing on with the season.<br/><br/>This is a film, like 'Brian's Song,' that was made solely with the intent to make men cry. I'll admit: I'm a crier. Not ashamed of that. And this film definitely did its job. From the start, it was extremely emotional. Ranging from the hardest of lows (seeing Paul Griffen's face as he searches the wreckage for his son) to the greatest of highs (seeing an entire school chanting in unison for their team), 'We Are Marshall' manages to capture it all. It does get a little too hokey & sappy at times and there's a LOT of crying by the characters in the movie (but I suppose it's excusable in the circumstances). The performances are, for the most part, good. I've never been a big fan of Matt Fox, but it may just be his style, not his talent.<br/><br/>Now, there are a few flaws. The writing is a bit predictable. Not so much the story, though they didn't do much to 'surprise' us (as it's a true story), but it's the dialogue that was a bit unoriginal. Regardless, it works, even if it's not exactly true to the era sometimes.<br/><br/>On the positive side, McG, who gets a lot of flack for his commercial film-making (sometimes rightfully so, but not here), does a good job with the direction and captures the town (which, to be honest, isn't as nice it looks here, no offense) in a good light.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a strong sports film that goes beyond and enters the realm of man-appropriate tearjerker.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 7.5/10<br/><br/>-AP3-"
"TermlnatriX","8","2","2","8 July 2008"," Surprising
","Color me very surprised! McG is indeed a capable director. This film lifted off a load off my shoulders concerning the horribly titled upcoming Terminator Salvation but that's small stuff. We've seen this story a dozen times before, while it is of course a true story, the subject matter does have its' ""sports movie"" clichés. That aside however, because the direction, acting, and cinematography combined pack an emotive punch resulting in a very well made drama ala Friday Night Lights, which I think is a bit better myself. I felt McG really demonstrated his potential in this film as a serious director and not a style over substance he seemed to be with Charlie's Angels films. Aside from a relatively strong story he did bring in the visuals, which added a nice look making the film style WITH substance."

","""We Are Marshall"" is a truly moving and enjoyable film. And as far as the sports movie genre goes, the film is better because it's based on a true story. Think of it as being ""Brian's Song"" multiplied by the tragic deaths of seventy-five people. You know how sports announcers will say ""Boy, if you saw this plot in a movie, you wouldn't believe it!""? A film like ""We Are Marshall"" is proof. Had this been a completely fictional film, it would rate much, much lower. But reality based it is and that gives it a free pass when it comes to all of the obvious clichés. Clichés with lines like ""I know what you have inside. You've shown it to me"" when coach Lengyel addresses the team before the first home game, or the standard issue slow motion game scenes that every sports film made over the past 30 years uses to heighten the drama. Mostly, the fact that it's a true story helps how predictable the outcomes of the games will be. You'll know just how much you like this film when you root for the team in spite of the fact you already know how the games will end. I did wonder about the reality of one thing. The portrayal of Coach Lengyel as being so quirky and eccentric. Perhaps it's a dead on depiction, but it got to be almost too much at times. If was a true reflection of the man though, then OK. Overall, a real feel good football movie that is very much worth watching. In fact, while you're at it, rent ""We Are Marshall"" along with ""Brian's Song"" and ""Rudy"". It makes a great trilogy!"

I had never heard of this story which probably made it easier to watch as I was not overly concerned about accuracy which sometimes happens to me when I watch true stories I know about. This film lifted me up. It is an inspiration to see how you can rise above whatever is thrown at you and succeed at what you believe to be true and good. I was also impressed with McConaughey and Fox. McConaughey is truly outstanding in this and I am not the biggest fan of his work. He kind of converted me with this performance. Go watch it. It is a bit predictable and slow in parts but the story and performances make more than up for that. Recommended!!"

They always catch that pass at the last second, or hit that home run with two out in the bottom of the ninth to win the game, but that doesn't spoil them for me. It is that coming back from the bottom that really inspires.<br/><br/>Coming back from the tragedy that struck Marshall was a seemingly impossible task. It wasn't just a football program that needed to be rebuilt, but a whole town that needed to believe again. It made for an inspiring story.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey was the right pick to play the coach. He just seems right in that position. Besides that, he knows how to survive impossible odds (U-571, A Time to Kill).<br/><br/>David Strathairn (The Bourne Ultimatum, Good Night, and Good Luck) is one of my favorites, and I think he did an incredible job here.<br/><br/>The only disappointment I have with this film is the fact that some people thought that Talladega Nights was a better sports film.

","After a plane crash kills all of the 1970 Marshall Football team and coaches, Marshall University tries to put its football program back in order to help heal the town and to honor those who died.<br/><br/>This was well done, not as sappy as I imagined it would be. Maybe we are too far removed from that time in 1970 when the plane carrying the Marshall Football Team crashed and left no survivors. Maybe this movie should have been made earlier to have had more of an impact. Maybe.<br/><br/>Still, I believe that as Marshall University put its program back to help heal the town and to honor those who died, this movie accomplishes the same. This is well told, and well acted. I was never a fan of college football, but I am now and intend to follow the Marshall football team's play. Yes, I know that the struggle was difficult in those early years and it took some time for them to be good and win some National titles and the town sort of healed, And, every year at the moment of the crash, the whole town stops everything for a few moments to remember.<br/><br/>That next year after the crash Marshall University lobbied the NCAA to use Freshman to play at Varsity level and that was approved eventually. I believe they won 2-games that year and considering they were made up of mostly Freshmen, that is huge and a credit to them and to the coaches, and to the town that supported them. There were also a few seniors who were injured who didn't go on that flight.<br/><br/>Have I given away too much here? Probably, but it all becomes new to you when you see the movie. It is that good, but you knew that by the fact that the movie was made in the first place, that things would turn out all right. But the town still mourns every year so all isn't 100 per cent right and never will be.<br/><br/>Violence:Yes, football violence, Sex: No, Nudity:No, Language: No"

","I was in Huntington in 2000, the 30th anniversary of the tragedy. I wasn't aware of the history of the school nor of the crash, I was there to visit a friend who was in her first year residency at Marshall School of Medicine. We were walking through the town when church bells began to toll and people stopped walking and stood, some with their head bowed. Only then did I begin to comprehend the profound loss and sadness that the town had endured and continued to feel, despite the 3 decades that had passed.<br/><br/>I say that because We Are Marshall captures the loss and sorrow in a way that isn't maudlin but sincere and heartfelt. The despair and confusion of what to do and why should it be done is done quite well. But somehow it gets done. Ian McShane does an amazing job, portraying a father of player killed in the crash but unwilling to succumb to the tragedy, trying to come to terms with his loss by having others yield to his demand that no more football be played. His journey to his acceptance of the need to go on is wonderfully done.<br/><br/>Some clichés are evident, but despite that, the performances are still outstanding and overcome the falloffs in the writing. Very good movie."

I am a football player, just completing my junior year of high school. I expect to go to college and play football somewhere as an offensive lineman. This year, my dad slowly passed away from colon cancer in the middle of my season. I refused to miss 1 game, or even 1 practice. I played every night, even the very night my dad died.<br/><br/>We Are Marshall impacted me not only because of my situation, but because it taught me a lesson that was difficult to learn on my own. I learned that honoring your loved ones doesn't mean you have to go out and do something special. To honor them, you just have to continue to maintain the morals and standards they set for the world, and spread their passion. Share their life with those around you. Love.<br/><br/>This movie was beautiful. The camera angles had me hooked, even when sometimes I thought ""Wow, this is too much"". The actors really grabbed my heart, tied strings to it, and played with it as if it were a puppet. When they wanted me to laugh, I laughed. When they wanted me to tear up, I had to fight the urge to cry. But I still feel good about this movie. Jack Lengyel's character was hilarious. Really well played. I also enjoyed the many unspoken side-stories in this film, especially the kid with the ""Fall's City Beer"", and the trip Coach Lengyel took to WVU.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. Don't expect a great, movie that focuses on football, because football is the last thing on your mind as you watch this movie. It's about fighting for something or someone you love."

Finally, on the 22nd, this movie came out in theaters. Eagerly anticipating the release, I went the following day to see the film, getting tickets early because the previous ones had been sold out.<br/><br/>I was shocked when the crash occurred so early in the film. It was portrayed in a way that would make the people, who didn't know what a small town had in common, realize the power of close-knit people. The scene is sad, and I doubt anyone in the theater moved. It is hard to realize that this happened, it was true, and it was close to home.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey played a great part. A true West Virginian, he did great. He had his southern ""twang"" and the sense of craziness that works.<br/><br/>I do believe this film will be a huge hit around our area, with Huntington being about an hour away. Nationally, I still challenge the popularity of it. However, this one hits close to home. At the end of the movie, everyone left in silence.... Some sat in their seats and thought. However, you could tell that in one way or another, this movie touched people's lives. I was speechless for moments after the movie was over. It really makes you think.

Do not miss this movie if this has happened to you because it is inspiring to the max. I give it a 10 and 2 thumbs up for a feel-good movie about a feel-bad situation that happens to everyone sooner or later in life...sometimes even in college."
"Andyh74","10","3","4","21 October 2007"," ""We Are Marshall"" and Catharsis
","""We Are Marshall,"" which concerns Marshall University's struggle to deal with the 1970 plane crash which claimed the lives of the entire varsity football team and their supporters, reflects on and is a cathartic experience, and is most enjoyable.<br/><br/>After the crash, Marshall is left with a question: Should we even continue to have a football program? University president Don Dedmon (reliable David Strathairn) believes no, and cancels it. However, a few of the surviving varsity players who were not on the plane, in particular Nate Griffin, refuse to accept this. Although Griffin's stance is admirable, even he has a lesson to learn--he must deal with his grief.<br/><br/>Catharsis is the process by which one releases suppressed feelings or emotions, and the entire town has to achieve this catharsis--of their grief over the crash--before they can truly move on. One of the surviving veteran players simply cannot play football because he felt he should have been on the plane; a father of a killed player (Ian McShane) refuses to let his late son's fiancée move on by her giving back her engagement ring; and the aforementioned Griffin, who feels that he must go above and beyond in his efforts for the new team because he feels that the late team ""left it in his hands."" But in being led by Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaghey), the town and the new team discover that you honor a team by continuing the tradition, and that by doing so, you find the strength to move on, to persevere, especially since the town invested so much emotional stock in the university and the team.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend ""We Are Marshall."""
"laf-outloud","10","3","4","21 September 2007"," A Must See
","It is very rare that you find a movie that moves you so much all you want to do is change the world. We Are Marshall does that. I just watched this movie for the first time. I knew nothing of the 1970 Marshall Thundering Herd or the tragedies that fell upon them. I do know however, that they overcame. They triumphed. I feel this movie did an amazing job, not only to tell their story, but to honor them as well. Their story is timeless, their story is inspiring. The director, the actors, and the crew did an amazing job to capture the true spirit of a football team, of a college, and of a family. May God Bless the 1970 Thundering Herds and all that were upon that flight and may this movie stand as an everlasting statement of what a community can do to rebuild.<br/><br/>a must see...simply amazing!"

This movie does an excellent job of showing how one college town overcame unbelievable tragedy. Student's at that time were speaking their mind's very much at that time against the war, the establishment women's rights.

","Marshall University, in West Virginia, experienced a tragic loss in 1971, with an airplane crash that killed its football team, coaches, and friends. This based-on-fact film opens with the final game played by the team in Carolina and the ensuing plane ride home. The flight goes down near Huntington, West VA, where the university resides. It is a fiery crash with no survivors, and the town and university are in subsequent turmoil. In the days ahead, the university's president (David Straithorn) has to decide, among other things, whether the football program should be suspended. However, a few remaining players who did not make the final game's trip, due to injuries, want very much to continue and so does the student body. Therefore, they hire Jack (Matthew McConaughay) to put the team back together. Coach Jack receives special permission to use freshmen in the season ahead and assembles a ragtag team of walk-ons as well. Assistant coach Red (Matthew Fox), who was not on the flight, makes a gut-wrenching decision to return to the team as well. Can this new team help relieve the sorrow of the university community and compete with more established teams? This is a very uplifting film, despite its rather mundane delivery. The cast has been well chosen, with Fox giving an outstanding performance as the lone surviving coach of the downed team. The football scenes are exciting and true to life. That said, the production values are okay but the look of the film is not always top of the line. Costumes are, appropriately, the now-funny garbs of the seventies and the setting in West Virginia a mixture of beauty and industrial ugliness. But, despite these quibbles, the story is a heart grabber many times over. The resolve of this new team to bring hope and encouragement to a community in turmoil is very touching. If you like football and true stories, do find this film. Tears may cover your face, at times, but you will take a new dose of courage and determination back to your own daily life."

You don't have to understand football to appreciate this film. It is more than about football. It deals with the aftermath of the crash. Ian McShane who plays in the movie is from Eangland but does not have a British accent. How can they do it.This shows that the acting in this movie is good.

The portrayals are exquisite. You feel the angst and the pain. The struggle was believable as was their victory! Although a very different focus, I believe that if you loved ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel Washington, you will love this movie even more.

The whole team, staff, and reliable fans went down with the plane when they were coming home from the game. No one survived.

Maybe see a son empty out his dad's doctors office or a wife cleaning out her husbands desk - a daughter praying at her mom's grave site.

The fact that it was based around American Football didn't put me off .If a film is good it doesn't matter what the subject matter is.What really put me off was the way almost every scene ended up with tears welling up in eyes and then the emotional music crept in.I cannot abide movies like this which fully intend to make you cry all the time and this movie was one of the very worst of it's type.<br/><br/>It was a truly awful experience sitting through this mush and I am amazed at some of the very positive reviews this film has had.It was tedious,tried way too hard to tug at the heartstrings and was incredibly predictable.You could almost guess every scene in the movie.Oh yes,Matthew McConaughey was really annoying in this and quite what that fine actor Ian McShane was doing in this drivel is beyond me.No wonder he looked bored stiff.<br/><br/>I know that it is based on a true story and what happened was a tragedy on a large scale.This saccharine attempt to tell this deeply moving story failed massively because of it's attempts to grab hold of the viewers emotions in a not very subtle way.The worst film I have seen since 'Hostel' and that's saying something.I only gave this three stars because it started promisingly.Boy did it go downhill rapidly."

","I was born nearly eight years after the events in this movie and I heard the story of the crash from my family while growing up.

I am an alumna of Marshall University and I remember during freshmen orientation when our campus tour guide enlightened us on the significance of the fountain (which is explained in the movie for those of you who have not yet seen this feature). Yet, it was not until I saw the film that I realized the measure of this tragedy's impact on the entire city of Huntington & Marshall University. I cried (and laughed) during this movie and I would suggest it to anyone. I am a big fan of Matthew McConaughey and this is the most poignant role I've ever seen him undertake. If you decide to view this movie, I suggest carrying tissues with you to the theater (or keeping a box nearby if watching it at home)!

"MLDinTN","4","6","14","9 January 2008"," I'd rather watch a documentary on this subject
","To me, this movie just didn't have much happen in it; hence, it was boring. An hour long documentary on the plane crash and what happened at the university would have been more interesting. I don't buy Matthew McConaughey as a football coach. He looks too much like a surfer dude, and dying his hair dark isn't going to change that. Also, this movie at over 2 hours is way too long for so little action. The crash takes place in the first 10 minutes or so, so we barely learn anything about those who died. Therefore; it doesn't make that great of an emotional impact later in the film when the team is trying to come together for its fallen teammates.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I like sports and sports movies. But this one just didn't do it for me. I don't recommend it."

"DICK STEEL","9","2","3","26 December 2007"," A Nutshell Review: (DVD) We Are Marshall (2006)
","It's not your usual movie where the hero/team are put together from a bunch of misfits, and learn about camaraderie and teamwork, before charting their successes from the first game to the championship, which they will inevitably take. That's formula, and easily what you'd come to expect. But here, while there are moments of cliché that are inevitable for movies of such nature, like the dealing with tragedy, and the sports elements, what makes this stand out, is how the events are portrayed with some degree of honoring those who had passed on.<br/><br/>McG is not one of the most prolific directors of our time, and I know those who actually cringe at his more recognizable work like the Charlie Angels remake movies. But here, he surprises with very muted direction, without all the unnecessary flashes of flamboyance, and puts together a very effective movie that tells the tale, to the point, and without hints of exaggeration. Come to think of it, there's more exasperating moments here than whoops of jubilance, which seemed more like winning the battle, but not the war.<br/><br/>With the tragedy, the board has to decide whether to drop the sport altogether from its sporting calendar, or soldier on. Even with the latter, the question is how to build such a team from scratch, and also to deal with the psychological blows the tragedy had inflicted on surviving members of the squad, which without a doubt, is a big demon to fight, given massive guilt which befall on some of them. Enter head coach Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), who volunteers for this impossible task. Racing against time, he teams with Red Dawson (Lost's Matthew Fox) to recruit for a football team, fighting a recruiting war with other more prominent teams, and to entice those who are engaged in other sports to join them, based on specific qualities for vacant positions.<br/><br/>Although we have a number of powerful character actors like David Strathairn and Ian McShane in the movie, McConaughey proved that he's not just another pretty face that should be boxed into romantic movies. His Jack Lengyel is physically crafted with that slightly hunched forward physique as if he's always on the go, and comes through as an effective never-say-die-until-the-final-whistle coach, who refuses to give up in the face of adversity, or to throw in the towel midway. Without pedigree credentials, he goes on to prove that he's the right man for the job, convincing everyone that it's not always about winning, which is blasphemy to any sports team out there. <br/><br/>And if you take a step back and ponder, this movie junks that formulaic plot development, just like how Lengyel throws out conventional thought and wisdom out of the window. There's a first time for everything, and he's there to try and change the mindset and philosophy of the game and the townsfolk. I thought he nailed it right of what I thought sports is - which first and foremost is about sportsmanship, participation, and giving your best, no matter what the end result is. That seemed to be the spirit missing amongst those looking for instant success, and his fight is to instill this back again. Success will come to those who work hard and are hungry for it, but for a rookie team with makeshift tactics, the point is to show that they will not buckle, and to rise from the ash like a phoenix, finding strength and to pick up the pieces, providing hope and some measure of cheer to its supporters. His coach is to become counsellor as well, but not to a person or a team, but to an entire university town.<br/><br/>We Are Marshall makes recommended viewing, and more so for the qualities it exudes."
"Getyoassoverhereboi","10","1","1","17 October 2017"," The review
","Every movie has some truth behind its story line. The movies that really emphasize it although are the movies based off of true stories. These movies are usually inspirational and overly dramatic about passing over the message of the story. The movie We are Marhsall is based around a tragedy that occurs in a small town of Huntington at the University of Marshall. Seventy-five lives are claimed at a horrific plane crash killing football players, coaches, staff, and sponsors of the team. It is the story of how the town dealt with the tragedy.<br/><br/>The small town of Huntington takes pride in the college football team at Marshall University. The town has sons, fathers, and husbands within the football community. On one evening though, everything would change when the football plane crashed killing everyone inside. Nate Ruffin, an injured player who didn't join the team on the plane, and Red Dawson, the assistant coach who decided to stay back and catch the next plane, are all that remains of the deceased football team. Reggie Oliver bought a sixteen pack of beer when he heard about the plane crash, his brother was part of the team. Reggie carried the pack around wherever he went since the plane crash. Gene Morehouse, the announcer for the thundering herd, also died that night. His son loved to listen to his father announce the games on the radio, striving to be just like his dad. The mayor of the town, Paul Griffen, lost his son that night as well. President Dedmon was unable to cope with losing so many dear friends and family, optioning to close the football program for the time being. A year later, Ruffin speaks out to the town jury about keeping the football program. He and the rest of the school wanted to keep the program alive and start to rebuild. President Dedmon obliged allowing the football team continue, but listed a great number of problems in order for it to happen. Ruffin did not care although, stating that he could start with a football coach. Name after name, Dedmon called various coaches asking if they would come coach the team. One after another, Dedmon was turned down and hope was being lost. It isn't until a man named Jack Legynel calls the principal for the job. His reason for coaching the team, was sort of an unusual response. He did not choose to coach the team because he wanted to win, he wanted to coach them because it didn't matter if he won or not. Stated in the movie, this was the first time that winning doesn't matter, all that matters is that they play the game. Jack went over to Dawsons house to ask him to be the assistant coach. He accepted after refusing to be the head coach for the school. Something about Jack drawer coaches to him. Even the their division rivals in Michigan allowed them to look at play books and strategies. It was the first time Michigan ever helped Marshall with football. Jack even convinced Principal Dedmon to personally ask the directors of the NCAA to allow them to play football. After being rejected to play football several times by the NCAA, he went over in person to ask them to allow the school to play. After being allowed to play, Jack unsuccessfully attempted to recruit players around the state. He failed though, losing to West Virginia in multiple positions. Dawson and him then thought outside the box, recruiting players in a unique aspect. He created an all freshman team through words and persuasion. He convinced players that going to Marshall, it would mean promised playing time on the field. Although Jack was able to put a team together and on the field, he only one game out of the several years there. It was just as he said though, the town didn't need a winning football team, they just needed a team to show up every game and play. <br/><br/>The Marshall movie is more inspiring based off recovery from the tragedy and doesn't seem so cliché. Recovering from a sever plane crash that devastated the whole town is something else. The Marshall movie is something no one can compare to because of how they recovered and rebuilt the community while honoring the deceased people. It was truly a miracle how a couple of people rebuilt the Marshall community and brought it back to life through playing football."

","It's 1970. After a tough lose, the Marshall University football team is returning home to Huntington, W.V. The plane crashes killing everyone on board. Injured Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) didn't play and Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) takes a last-minute recruiting trip. Both misses the plane ride and survives. Cheerleader Annie Cantrell (Kate Mara) loses her boyfriend. The next spring, the town is struggling and football is about to be suspended. Ruffin rallies the students. President Don Dedman (David Strathairn) struggles to find anyone to coach and Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) applies out of the nowhere.<br/><br/>Director McG is more restraint visually than normal although he isn't pulling anything back with the sentimental melodrama. This is all played with every heart string at the highest note filled with every cliché. Considering the subject, there is probably no other way to make this. My one main complaint is that the movie needs one lead character to focus on. However, I also do understand the need to spread the commiseration around. The acting is solid and flamboyant McConaughey injects a bit of energy. The film has that sepia tone to heighten the 70s look and McG fills it with era music. The movie is a fully formed tribute but not necessarily a great movie."

"TOMASBBloodhound","8","1","1","25 March 2014"," It's about healing. Football helps.
","The events that inspired the film We Are Marshall are definitely enough to inspire a great story. The trick is avoiding the many sports movie clichés that are potentially lurking behind every turn of the page of any possible screenplay. To its credit, this film avoids a lot of them, and uses its characters and its atmosphere to make the ones we see a little more forgivable. The tragic 1970 plane crash that took the lives of most Marshall University football players, boosters, and athletic department personnel is a story most sports fans are familiar with. This film doesn't provide us with any insight into its cause, or give us many of the details we didn't already know. What it does, and quite effectively, is focus on the survivors and how they attempt to move on. The school very nearly ended its football program, and nobody could have blamed them if they had never played another game. Funny thing about football... its just too much a part of our national passion to ever give it up.<br/><br/>This film could have easily been a feel-good vehicle for Matthew McConaughey, but luckily they had the sense to dial his presence down a tad. He certainly still stands out and gives a charismatic performance, but he isn't even introduced until well into the film as Jack Lengyel, the coach who will be the first to lead the Thundering Herd back onto the field. Matthew Fox as the only surviving assistant from the past coaching staff also does fine as the conflicted coach who takes a great deal of convincing before he joins the new staff. Film does a great job detailing the difficulty of blending new players with the few surviving ones who were not on the plane. Even in the heart of a tragedy, boys will still be boys... especially when they play football at a major university.<br/><br/>Of course we get the ""big game"" climax at the film's conclusion, but since this one is based on fact, the cliché is a lot easier to take. The film is visually impressive and seems to give great attention to detail. West Virginia is quite a beautiful place, and there are some scenes where the surroundings on the horizon take on a character of their own. I was generally surprised at how much I liked this film. I was expecting something a little more artificial. Not only is it thoughtful and nostalgic, but it shows us how many lives can be lost and transformed in one instant. 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"DKosty123","8","1","1","15 October 2007"," Inspirational
","This movie is about inspiration. It starts with a tragedy, in a true story the plane crash which killed nearly the entire Marshall University football team. Then, it deals with the reactions of everybody the tragedy touched.<br/><br/>When this movie deals with tragedy, it doesn't just make you get out your hankies. It shows real life how difficult it is to face, how it can take time to face it, & how people must eventually deal with it. This is not an easy thing to do. The recent Disney Film, fictional, The Bridge To Teribetha, does not do this same thing correctly when dealing with one persons death.<br/><br/>All the performances in this film are outstanding. It would be difficult to put anyones role in this above another's. Even the smaller supporting roles are done well. I was in high school when this really happened. This film has a clip of John Chancellor, former NBC News anchor, reporting on the plane crash early in the film.<br/><br/>As an inspirational film about sports, this is one of the better ones I have seen. The only thing I would add is at the end of the film, when Marshall wins it's first home game, I would add a clip of the same John Chancellor which I think I remember seeing after that first win. If I remember right, he reported it this way: ""Today, Marshall University won a football game. While one win is not usually such a big event, after all Marshall has been through this past year, winning this one game means much more to Marshall than that.""<br/><br/>This sums up the inspiration that is obviously put into this film, & how it really happened. To the folks who made the movie, We Are Marshall is much more than a story. This film, in the way it was made, shows a lot of caring in doing this story right on film, and it shows.<br/><br/>David Strathairn is excellent as the Marshall College President.

"tfrizzell","Null","1","1","8 August 2007"," The Marshall Plan.
","A tragic plane crash ends up killing all members of the 1970 Marshall University football team unfortunate enough to be on board. Marshall, a college located in Huntington, West Virginia is devastated by the horrific events. Struggles aplenty take place now as the university tries to heal itself, but healing is not always simple or easy. University President David Strathairn must do all in his power just to field a team as freshmen were not allowed to participate collegiately back in those days. Thus, special permission must be received from the NCAA. New head coach Matthew McConaughey and an assistant (Matthew Fox of ""Lost"" glory) who happened to not be on the doomed flight take center-stage as the two men who try to field a team in the face of the greatest of adversities. ""We Are Marshall"" is full of cinematic syrup, like you might expect, but it really does not matter. The film works due to strong performers (led by Straithairn) and a truly engrossing and emotional story which rises above many other productions of the type because of its realism and astute character development. One of those movies which excels because of its heart more than anything else. Kudos to director McG in bringing this important event in sports history to the silver screen. 4 stars out of 5."
"jcrawford-15","7","1","1","11 April 2007"," Didn't do justice to the real story. Star vehicle for Matthew M...
","I was there, I lived it. I lost friends. A lot of this film was manufactured for dramatic effect, I'm sure, and that's okay. There were some touching moments and some scenes brought back memories. But Warner Bros fumbled overall, I think, making it just another inspirational popcorn movie. Certainly Jack Lengyel was nothing like the guy Matthew portrayed in my memory,(although as an actor I enjoy his work - Matthew's, not Jack's), nor did Lengyel or any of the others dress in that goofy looking polyester. I remember them in green MU dress jackets and nice clothes. Huntington, West Virginia is and was a beautiful city, Marshall is a great university, and the people who died on that rainy night and those brave kids who followed them to re-build the Herd deserved better representation on the big screen. Nobody wants to see people suffer, and seeing a city shrouded in mourning all through the holidays and for months afterward probably wouldn't sell tickets, but that's the way it was. I just wish the producers would have filmed a better story, focusing on more than the Lengyel angle. That entire city and university rose from the ashes, and that was the greater story, believe me. More than anything in the film, the reality of that year showed the quiet strength of a shattered community brought together through tragedy and grief, who re-built from scratch something they had always held in high esteem. And when each little step of that goal was reached, we never forgot those we lost, and as important as, ""We Are Marshall"", became later on, we also said a silent prayer - ""God Bless the 75""."

","How can so many people give this movie such a high rating? I'm sorry, but this movie is so cliché and corny it had me shaking my head in disgust much of the time. It starts by claiming to be a ""true story"" which it most definitely is not. A more conservative ""based on a true story"" would have been much more appropriate. To begin with, the cheer ""we are Marshall"" didn't exist till thirty years after the plane crash. And when Bobby Bowden, then coach at WVU, agrees to help the Marshall coaches saying ""OK, we don't play you guys this year"" he should have said ""OK, we haven't played you guys in over fifty years and have no plans to ever play you"". Matthew McConaughey's overacting is to the point of being goofy. But the stupidest part of the whole movie was depicting all the Marshall people groaning in despair when Marshall didn't win their first game after having almost their entire team and athletic department die in the plane crash. No one I know expected them to win any games that year, let alone their first one. Oh ... Ian McShane was good, as always."

","I saw this movie and, like a lot of people already, I really liked it. It's a good sports-movie but it's a great people-movie. The movie is apparently true to actual events and I think that is really what made the movie so good--it wasn't glamorized by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Matthew M. did an excellent job. I think this is his best movie to date. His character was in a challenging position and MM played the part perfectly, balancing enthusiasm for the team, sympathy for the town, and really capturing the helplessness that Jack Lengyell experienced when faced with the mourning and confusion or anger of the people who didn't agree with the rebuilding of the football team.<br/><br/>The whole cast did well with the grieving process, wonderfully portraying the desire to move on while still feeling the hurt of the accident. There was a scene from the movie shown in the trailer, when they look out a window and the town is there shouting ""We are... Marshall!"" For me, this was a very moving scene and I got a little teary!<br/><br/>One thing for the parents who were thinking of bringing their families: I wouldn't say that there is ""quite a bit"" of language, but MM says the S-word several times. There is other, mild language, but this stood out to me and I was surprised to find that it was only rated PG. It's definitely not enough to ruin the movie and is still good for the family with it's uplifting message about over-coming tragedy and hardship, but just be aware that some parents might not want their kids to hear some of it. I don't recall anything worse than the S-word... but there was some drinking."

","Let me start off my review by saying that I am in no way trying to detract from the hardships that the school or the town had to face when confronted with such a hard hitting tragedy.<br/><br/>That being said, this is nothing more than an over-hyped paint-by-numbers formulaic sports movie that we have seen over, and over again. In just the last couple of months the same story has been redone be it the Rock in Gridiron Gang or Mark Whalberg in Invincible, the story of a football team that has to overcome some obstacle to win the ""big game"". Reaching back a few more years we can get even more examples of this, movies such as Remember the Titans,the remake of the Longest Yard, Friday Night Lights etc, etc There is not a shred of originality in this movie. You have seen it before. Their is little to no humor throughout the entire film, and most of the scenes are interchangeable and are just of people crying or giving some long speech riddled with clichés about how they have to over come. The acting is way over the top, downright laughable in some scenes, and the director is a no talent hack. All the shots of foot ball you have seen in any other movie about the sport before, any scene we are supposed to find funny reminds us how funny it is by playing carnival music, with any dramatic scene playing a quiet piano number. Oh, and there is even a montage that is SOOOOOO bad it is almost painful to watch.<br/><br/>I'm sure this movie will do well at the box office, and people will talk about what a great movie it was, but don't buy into the hype. If you want to see a good movie with the family watch something that is genuine, and not the forced sentimentality that Hollywood spoon feeds people with the same sports movie(Coach Carter, Glory Road, etc) over and over again."

Including Football players Coachs, fans, and athletic department. Some felt they should cancel the the program it would be to painful to restart it after the loss. But one player wouldn't let that happen. He felt that his team mates left the program and the team in his hands and they shouldn't let it go away! they may have lost the wonderful players and coaches but they should never loss the game they loved to play! one coach was ever so brave to take on the job! and he tried to bring back the team in memory and honor of the ones who had died. We are Marshell tells their story and how they all over came it...but no matter what no one would ever forget that awful day on November 14, 1970 that claimed 75 peoples lives! i think everyone should see this movie it tells a heart warming story and it makes people cherish what they have and it teaches some important lessons! but most deff bring some tissues!"

He sets out to recruit and start the team anew amidst a grief-stricken town.<br/><br/>One problem with the movie is that everyone is often moping around and we don't really know who they are (in terms of character development) so it's not really that effective or interesting. Matthew McConaughey usually puts in an engaging performance, but here his character across as someone with ADD and a flippant attitude. Given that he's a core character, that's not good.<br/><br/>I realize that many people liked this movie, so I suggest that if this movie intrigues you, watch the first 30 minutes. If you find it slow and the characters uninteresting, quit while you're ahead - otherwise, enjoy the show."

","Based on a true story, but still very formulaic. The film could have benefited from being grittier and more realistic. It manages to capture the strong and tragic emotions, but when it tries to be inspirational, it pulls out a series of tacky speeches and slow motion back slaps. The story has a great beginning, setting up a town shattering tragedy. The build up is ominous, but still leaves room for surprise. The cast is littered with fantastic actors, from an uncredited Robert Patrick, Ian McShane, and David Strathairn. Each of them plays their roles very well, and I liked the view of different townsfolk. It would have been nice to see more of the town, as McShane and Strathairn are two of the highlights. It also emphasized the painful loss and the needed hope. It does manage to raise some goosebumps, and its raw power is enough to propel it into the end zone. Moving, inspirational, but less than subtle."

"Solipsisticblog","5","4","12","29 December 2006"," Maudlin film falls short
","If you like your sports films extra maudlin, then you'll love ""We are Marshall"". In 1970 almost the entirety of the Marshall football team, coaching staff, and many football parents and boosters were killed in a plane crash while returning from an away game. It was a horrible tragedy and the school nearly decided to kill the football program. But due to the urging of the remaining players and students, the program was given a reprieve.<br/><br/>Enter spunky, gonzo coach Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConnaughey) who wants to keep the program afloat. To do so, he enlists the help of assistant coach Red Dawson (Matthew Fox), the lone surviving coach who is resistant to return to coaching. Dawson has profound guilt--he gave up his seat on the doomed plane to another coach who wanted to return home to see his daughter--as well as the sadness at the loss of all his players, staff, and friends. Powerful men like college trustee Paul Griffen (Ian McShane), who lost his son in the crash, want to see the program die a quiet death. Griffen's son was to marry cheerleader Annie Cantrell (Kate Mara) and after her fiancé's death, she becomes devoted to caring for and grieving with Griffen.<br/><br/>This is all well and good and the first half hour of the film gives you great hope for its potential. Once Lengyel arrives, the movie takes on a gonzo energy and we are treated to a fun montage of player recruitment and early practices--standard sports movie fare. But then this energy is sapped as the film engages in another hour and a half of grief. The characters and townspeople don't change, evolve, grow. They just wallow and we have to watch the whole thing.<br/><br/>Good films can be made about a failure to come to terms with tragedy (see the fantastic ""In America"". If you haven't, rent it now. It'll floor you.) But ""We are Marshall"" with its steady stream of sports film clichés and thin characterization doesn't have the machinery to pull it off. I was fully ready to forgive the movie its clichés. I like sports films even many of the lesser ones. Rising above adversity and winning just makes for good cinema. But ""Marshall"" fails under the weight of a script that runs in circles.<br/><br/>If you stick around through the closing moments, though, you will be treated to a truly inspiring epilogue. By keeping the football team going, Lengyel paved the way for a program that would have great success in the future. Kate Mara, a very good performance in an underdeveloped part, recounts this success in a voice over and it's the most inspiring moment of the film. You want to admire the film because it's ultimately about the importance of perseverance, but the movie is too bathetic to win the hearts of viewers."

","This was an average sports flick, except for the fact that the football was poorly researched (in 1971 calling a timeout after a first down would have been redundant), and that I was distracted every time somebody said ""N-C two A,"" which happened at least twice a scene. This film had too many characters whom you expected to have pivotal parts but never amounted to anything and none of the characters had any depth until it was too late. The camera-work and all around cinematography were cheap and cliché, with many shots not showing anything of significance and some being downright nauseating. While the story moved fine and I stayed interested, I felt nothing because the movie tried to go in too many directions.

An actor who I never in a million years thought I would find myself praising, he truly shined in this film.<br/><br/>This is the true story of the town of Huntington, West Virginia. As the Marshall University football team and several prominent town-members were flying home from an away game, the plane crashed, taking the lives of everyone on board. Leaving the town and the college devastated and many families ripped in two, it seemed all hope was lost. The four remaining varsity members, however, were not going to give up. They fight to keep the program alive, and eventually get approval from the board. All that is needed now is a new head coach. Enter Jack Lengyel, otherwise known as McConaughy himself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film is not the best. It's not terrible, but it is also most definitely not great. The story is sad, but then it never reaches triumphant status. There's simply much better sports movies, especially better football movies(Remember the Titans, anyone?).<br/><br/>It is worth it, though, simply for Matthew McConaughy's inspired performance. He plays the head coach Jack Lengyel with ease and endearing. He is the perfect combination of country and intelligence. What makes his performance even greater is the humor he adds to a movie that desperately needed it. You cannot help but get caught up in his enthusiasm. He creates a character that everyone would want to get to know. The rest of the cast is fine, but can't seem to outshine the man himself.<br/><br/>In summation, it's definitely not the best movie of the year, and it's nowhere near the best sports movies list. However, it's lead performance makes it most definitely worth a watch. 5/10 stars.<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

Actually, you have seen all the movies before, since they all feed on the same ideas. So what's the different thing that may make you watch? It's the script's treatment; being a key player in that game of ""making the different thing"" which is called movies.<br/><br/>This time, there are a true story, some emotionality involved, many characters, and the meaning about the importance of playing more than the importance of winning, as if playing is winning itself; if only you can do it.<br/><br/>The movie's feelings are clear. It has many artistic merits, topped by the acting, the cinematography, and the directing; who though that (Mc.G) can make movies else Charlie's Angels 1 and 2?! But eventually it doesn't hold to that spirit of ""different"" much.<br/><br/>Save (President Dedmon), played by (David Strathairn), the characters aren't interesting enough. Take for instance the lead character. That full-of-life man seems perfect, throwing pieces of wisdom to everybody, making jokes all the time, and his only mistake is not knowing how to change a diaper; which he even did anyway. That, as a whole, is the interpretation of BORING!<br/><br/>You can say the same about the situations. There is no scene where I felt how the lead character affected the team in a deep way, not preachy way. We hear about him having dinner with the remaining-alive members of the old team, and never see anything. Why the dead team is out of the picture?! They are like ""Them"" all along. Not relating them to the present characters took a lot of the movie's drama. The angry father and the young waitress's line was good, but what about the rest, especially when you don't have, a la the comic version of the same movie, the funny players to utilize and fill the movie with their various antics.<br/><br/>The third act is disappointing; it has predictable everything. There is no surprise whatsoever. The scene of the speech is worn-out, with nothing new about it. It's where I was bored to death! The last match is a farce; now here's a worthless and usual TV work. Not writing the end's narrated information right, underling the meaning of the ""importance of playing"", caused a laugh in the wrong place. So that *great* coach, with his *great* team, had 9 winnings and 33 loses??!!<br/><br/>As you see, with the lack of interesting characters, good situations, smart details, saturated storylines--the movie suffered from dramatic emptiness. That's why (Matthew Fox) and (Anthony Mackie) spent their time just crying! Therefore, the feelings of hope, determination and beating the grief are there, but not actively achieved. And, as a result, the predictability was allowed to run the matters as another sport movie with ""underachievers-go-achievers"", so instead of utilizing the trite frame, there was nothing else it, being done a bit poorly too.<br/><br/>They tried to use (Matthew McConaughey)'s talent and name to present a distinct lead character, but nothing was thorough about it. And the script tended to a documentary-like trait, which is bad according to the true story's emotional power. See how uneven this movie is!<br/><br/>By traditional and somewhat blank treatment, it didn't get to be the different thing. Hence, (We Are Marshall) couldn't rescue itself from falling into the sin of ""badly formulaic"". Using the formula isn't a crime, but doing nothing with it.. surely is!"

Whether or not you're a football fan, you'll love this powerful film of how the lives of an entire town are literally shredded as most of the town's population, and the most popular members at that, are all suddenly destroyed in an airplane crash. Teenagers, parents, friends, all gone. The beginning of the film alone up to and the immediate aftermath of the crash make watching the film worthwhile, though they are tough to take. Even macho men will find it hard not to shed a tear. Ironically, that is what makes it a great movie for both men and women (though it might be too rough for children because of the subject matter of sudden death and loss).<br/><br/>Ironically, too, you actually feel a sense of loss as a viewer because some of the best acting is during that first part of the film. Coach Tolley (Robert Patrick) is such a powerful presence and so well acted, that you literally miss him and wish he were the surviving actor. Though those that remain are great as well.<br/><br/>Schmaltzy, yes, and if it were not a true story I might say to avoid it. But as a nearly factual account of great strength in the face of great loss, I highly recommend it for men and women, and as a date movie. You will have a renewed sense of the preciousness of life, yours and those around you, as well as those who are not with you, and of the goodness of God who permits that loss but only for a short time. For life, and love, go on if we will only accept them, cherish them, and pass them along."

","i went to this movie expecting little and thats exactly what it was...if you love football its kinda sad and since i do i can relate to the sadness of the movie. there's a lot of crying and they try to get you into the we are mars hall saying and by the end of the movie your just waiting to get out.. but its really not a total waist of time. people have just made way to many football movies that aren't cool...i doubt anyone is really looking forward to this movie besides people that went to marshal university.. and if you didn't go you really don't feel too sorry for the people, because they start the sad part of the movie right in the middle. the movie was sad all the way through and its not really even that great of a football movie.. don't expect a gridiron gang or anything because there's only two and a half games and they only win one by like 3.."
"tjperry77","7","2","12","14 December 2006"," Solid Film
","I saw an advance screening of the movie tonight. I felt that overall the film was very solid. My major beef with the film was that it was somewhat depressing all the way through. I was hoping for a real ""feel good"" ending but was a bit disappointed. The movie tried to come across as a story of triumph and perseverance in a time of great difficulty for Marshall University. I would say it did an OK job of this, but I was never able to get over the depressing undertones that were present throughout the movie. Overall I would give the movie a rating of slightly better than average. If you are looking for a dramatic sports film with a big name headlining (Matthew McConaughey) you will really enjoy the experience."

","The night was what I would have considered to be normal. Our family had just eaten spaghetti for dinner. Mom was washing dishes and my dad had just taken out the trash. Dad comes back inside and turns all the lights off. He then tells us to look at the sky. It was flashing yellow, red, orange. I was only 8 years old at the time, but that night has remained etched in my memory ever since. To this day, I have a terrible fear of airplanes. The airport was just over the hill from us and loud planes/jets were a usual occurrence. While we didn't hear the crash, I will never forget the sky. My parents put my brother and I in the car and traveled to the crash site. I'm not sure if they knew what it was at the time. I do remember the terrible traffic jam and the fire trucks.<br/><br/>While I am glad the movie has been made, I am afraid I will be unable to view it for the reasons stated above."

","If I could I would rate this movie 10000/10! I may be Irish in general, but I am half American and a die-medium fan of Cleveland Browns! Anyways the heart warming tale is a tale of motivation and surprises (and tear ducts) <br/><br/>It reminded me of my kind of Titanic! The movie has it's first sad moment in the ghastly plane crash that kills all if the players and coaches. I have NO idea how I didn't cry during the movie... But I did get a bit teary-eyed after some of the wonderful and tragedies.<br/><br/>I love the fact that it tells all the new recruits futures in the end.<br/><br/>My favorite movie used to be The Blind Side, but this movie ""punted'"" that out if it's position!"
"hall895","7","0","1","2 April 2008"," Not quite as uplifting and inspiring as it could have been
","Here we have yet another entry in the ""inspiring sports movie"" genre. You know the type...Rocky and Rudy and Hoosiers and so on. The plucky, overmatched underdogs whose story of course leads to that big uplifting moment at the end which will make you cheer or cry or both. But We Are Marshall is a little bit different than those other films. Here the story is not just about overachieving, not just about competing with and maybe even beating an opponent who is simply much better than you. This is a story about overcoming so much more, about facing unspeakable tragedy and finding the strength and will to carry on. Why is it then that when this film's inevitable ""big moment"" comes you may well sense that you found yourself more inspired by, say, the rather mundane by comparison story of Rudy with some not particularly talented kid getting to play for a few seconds in a football game? We Are Marshall, with the story it has to tell, should clearly be the most uplifting and inspiring film of this particular genre. But it's not. It's a good movie, a very good one at times. But it never quite lives up to the potential you sense the story had.<br/><br/>The film begins in November 1970 with the Marshall University football team flying home from a game. However the team will never make it home as their chartered plane crashes just short of the airport in Huntington, West Virginia. In an instant the entire Marshall football program has essentially been wiped out. But of course in the immediate aftermath of the crash nobody is really concerned with football. The entire Huntington/Marshall community is in mourning. So many lives lost and not just the team either, as many of Huntington's most prominent citizens, Marshall supporters all, were on the plane as well. The fact that a number of children were left orphaned, losing both parents in the crash, speaks to the depth of the tragedy. In the face of a tragedy like this how could football really be important? In fact the first inclination of Marshall administrators is to discontinue the football program. But the following season the Marshall University football team would in fact take the field. This movie tells the story of how new coach Jack Lengyel essentially rebuilt the program from scratch, got a team out on the field and helped to, at least in some small way, allow this shattered community to heal.<br/><br/>It's obviously a very captivating story. So why does the movie not quite hit the heights you sense it should? The biggest problem is the movie's pace. Fifteen to twenty minutes easily could have been cut here to help the movie move along. As it is the movie struggles to build the momentum so important in leading to that big payoff at the end. Some characters seem superfluous, most notably that of the girlfriend of one of the dead players, as portrayed by Kate Mara. There's nothing wrong with Mara's performance, it's just that her character seems totally unnecessary and really adds nothing to the film. Any time spent with her character is time which could have been better spent elsewhere or better yet cut out of the film altogether. In the central role of the new coach Matthew McConaughey gives what is at times a frustrating performance. All the offbeat quirks and mannerisms wear thin after a while. Perhaps he was trying too hard to imitate the real Coach Lengyel, but whatever McConaughey was trying to do he never quite manages to convince. And since his character is at the very heart of the story that is a rather glaring problem with the movie. But despite the problems the movie may have it's still well worth seeing. You'll be both inspired and entertained. You just may get the sense you should have been a little bit more inspired and entertained than you actually are."

","We Are Marshall (2006) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>True life story about the Marshall football program who lost all but three football players and all but one coach due to a plane crash in 1970. The following year the school, after much debate, decides to put another team on the field and hires a new coach (Matthew McConaughey) who must deal with the new team and those who knew people who were killed in the crash. I was really worried walking into this film due to the PG rating, which I thought was going to mean everything had been sugared down but that wasn't the case. The opening thirty-minutes and during several other scenes are incredibly sad and depressing without any sugar being added. The film pays great tribute to the men and women who died, which is all you can expect. The football scenes are clichÃ©d as hell but that doesn't really matter because the film's strength is in its heart and the emotion it shows. The theater group I watched this with were cheering and crying throughout the entire film so it certainly hit all the right notes. McConaughey gives a very good performance and the supporting cast, which includes Matthew Fox, David Strathairn, Robert Patrick and Anthony Mackie, are equally good."

","I was 9 mths old when this event occurred. I am, and always have been an avid ""sports nut"" I researched the events surrounding this tragic event. Some people only concentrate on the negative when posting, others see the BIG picture.<br/><br/>I felt that this movie was tastefully portrayed. Those who are critical, live too much for minute by minute details. Real sports fanatics and those who do not even Like sports, could sit back and appreciate a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>In my lifetime, I have witnessed, and experienced similar tragedies. For those people who ""live in a shell"", I really feel bad for you. ALL OF LIFE'S EVENTS make us stronger or weaker. I choose to grow stronger. When people say that those things could not happen to them......THINK AGAIN....<br/><br/>My approval for a great movie at one of the hardest times in my life...<br/><br/>Shana Hurt, NC"
"GA4056","7","0","8","28 December 2006"," Lack of credits for Atlanta and Atlanta crew
","The media has portrayed this film as being shot in Huntington, west Virginia. Out of a twelve week shoot 3 weeks were shot there, mainly exterior establishing shots. nine weeks of shooting were done in Atlanta, Georgia. Nonetheless, in the credits Huntington was thanked, but no mention of Atlanta. I have seen publicity photos saying that they are in Huntington but in actuality they are in Georgia.<br/><br/>I also have a problem about screen credits. Myself and many others worked hard on this film for three to five months. I lost thirty-five pounds working on it. Many of my co-workers and myself did not receive screen credit.<br/><br/>It was a very hard show. My hat is off to McG, who is a joy to be around. Everyone I know who has seen the film has enjoyed it tremendously. The consensus is that the sets looked great. I just wish we had been treated a little better."
